001-60310,ENG,TUR,CHAMBER,2002,CASE OF SABUKTEKIN v. TURKEY,1,No violation of Art. 2 concerning the death of the applicant's husband;No violation of Art. 2 concerning the effectiveness of the investigation;Not necessary to examine Art. 6-1;No violation of Art. 13,Matti Pellonpää,"[""7. On 28 September 1994 the applicant's husband, Salih Sabuktekin, a building contractor, was killed outside his house as he was getting into his van. He was a member of the pro-Kurdish political party, HADEP (the People's Democracy Party) and a delegate of the local Yüregir/Adana branch. According to the witnesses, he was gunned down by two men in civilian clothes in front of a number of people, including his brother, Halil Sabuktekin, who was waiting for him in the vehicle."", ""8. There are discrepancies between the parties' accounts of what took place, as regards both the timing of the incident and events immediately after the shooting."", ""9. According to the applicant, the shooting took place between 6.30 a.m. and 7 a.m. Her brother-in-law, Halil Sabuktekin, attempted to chase his brother's killers but had been prevented from doing so by plainclothes police officers, who had proceeded to arrest him and taken him into police custody. In her observations of 31 March 1997 the applicant added that her brother-in-law had set off in pursuit of the killers with another person whom she named in a statement of 21 June 1999 as Latif Turan."", '10. In corroboration of her account, the applicant inter alia sent the Commission a statement made by her brother-in-law on 31 March 1997 before a member of the Human Rights Association and a member of the HADEP. According to that statement, the shots had been fired at approximately ten minutes past seven. He had set off in pursuit of the killers with a friend, but they had been intercepted by police officers. After questioning them about the PKK, Hizbullah (the Party of God), and the HADEP, the police officers had taken them firstly to Adana State Hospital, where Halil Sabuktekin had caught sight of his brother on a bench, and then to the police station, where they were questioned. The police had released them an hour later. Halil Sabuktekin had then returned to the hospital, where he learnt that his brother had died in the meantime.', ""11. The applicant added that some twenty people had been taken into police custody while her husband's funeral was taking place. Moreover, on at least three occasions before her husband's death the police had burst into their house at night and carried out searches. On the first two occasions they had enquired as to her husband's whereabouts and on the third had taken him away. However, he had been released the following day. She also said that their house had been kept under constant police surveillance."", '12. The applicant affirmed that she was not asked to attend for interview by the investigators until February or March 1998.', '13. The Government maintained that the shots had been fired just before 6 a.m. The investigation revealed that Halil Sabuktekin had immediately taken his brother to Adana Hospital.', '14. The Government also maintained that the applicant had been sent a letter requiring her to attend the local police station after the murder, but had failed to do so.', ""15. The record of the victim's examination on his admission to hospital, which was signed by two doctors, put the time of his arrival at 6.20 a.m. A police report recorded as having been made up at 6.30 a.m. on 28 September 1994 and which was signed by two police officers, A.Ö. and S.A., and a doctor, stated that the applicant's husband had arrived at the casualty and emergency department of the Adana State Hospital at 6.20 a.m. and had been taken to an operating theatre. A second police report signed by the same two officers and Halil Sabuktekin had been made up at 6.30 a.m. on 28 September 1994 to record the remittance of various objects and money in the wounded man's possession to his brother, Halil Sabuktekin."", '16. After the incident the police made inquiries at the scene, drew up a sketch map of the locality and took the names of everyone who was present when the shooting occurred. The incident report states that seven cartridges were found.', ""17. On 28 September 1994 five people, including Halil Sabuktekin, made statements to the police. Halil Sabuktekin said that the incident had occurred at about 6.30 a.m. and that he had taken his brother to hospital on discovering that he had been hit. He made no mention of having chased the assailants or of being stopped by police officers. Abdullah Ertekin, an employee of the victim who was in the back of the vehicle when the shooting took place, made no mention of any such events in his account either. He was questioned by police officers at 7 a.m. and put the time of the shooting at 6.30 a.m., immediately after he and one Mesut Şen had pulled up outside the victim's house in the van. These two witnesses were only able to give a brief description of the two gunmen. Müslüm Olcay, the owner of a tearoom, gave information on the age, height and hair colour of one of the gunmen, but was unable to describe the second. He did, however, say that there were approximately ten people in his tearoom in addition to the workmen who had just left to get into the van. He made no reference in his statement to the suspects being chased after the shooting. Questioned by the same officers, Suphi Özbudak, a baker working nearby, was unable to provide any helpful information."", ""18. The Adana Public Prosecutor began a preliminary investigation into the murder of the applicant's husband. On 13 October 1994 the Head of the Adana Anti-Terrorist Branch sent a report to the Adana Public Prosecutor, to which were attached the records of the four interviews conducted on 28 September 1994, a sketch map of the scene of the crime and three other police reports giving details of the searches made at the scene and of the vehicle and confirming that the police had received the bullet that had been removed from the victim's body. Two medical reports were also attached, namely the death certificates concluding that an autopsy was required, and the toxicological analysis report. Among other matters referred to in the Head of the Anti-Terrorist Branch's report and enclosed with it were the results of the ballistics report."", ""19. On 6 December 1994, in the course of that investigation, the Adana Public Prosecutor issued an arrest warrant against a person or persons unknown for murder and requested the relevant police department to investigate the crime and arrest the suspects. It was instructed to report to the Principal Public Prosecutor's Office quarterly on progress."", '20. In July 1995 the Adana Anti-Terrorist Branch Headquarters launched an operation against the illegal organisation Hizbullah after several members of the HADEP and a number of PKK supporters were killed. In an interview on 27 July 1995, Z.T., one of fourteen people arrested in that operation, said that another member of the organisation, H.T., had asked him to obtain information on members of the PKK and the HADEP living in the vicinity, including Salih Sabuktekin. After completing his mission, he learnt that the people concerned had been killed in 1994 and 1995. He added that he had no idea who the killers were or who had ordered the murders to be carried out. H.T., who was also among those arrested, was questioned the same day but denied the accusations. That information was passed on to the Adana Public Prosecutor, with a summary of the interviews of the persons questioned.', '21. Meanwhile, forensic tests were carried out on firearms and ammunition that had been seized at the homes of some of the people who had been arrested on 20 July 1995. It showed that the cartridge cases from the seized ammunition were not the same as cartridge cases that had been found at the scene of certain unsolved cases.', '22. On 4 August 1995 the Adana Public Prosecutor questioned the fourteen suspects. He made an application on the same day for six of them to be remanded in custody.', '23. After hearing these suspects the Second Division of the Adana Criminal Court remanded five of them, including H.T. and Z.T., in custody and ordered the release of the sixth.', '24. Also on 4 August 1995 the Adana Public Prosecutor relinquished jurisdiction over the case, as he considered that some of the criminal activities of which the persons arrested were accused, namely the counts of being members of and activists in an illegal organisation, fell within the jurisdiction of the Public Prosecutor at the Konya National Security Court.', '25. On 11 August 1995 the Public Prosecutor at the Konya National Security Court dropped charges against eight of the fourteen defendants, as he considered that there was no concrete evidence to show that they had played an active role in the illegal organisation. He committed the six remaining defendants to stand trial before the National Security Court.', '26. On 16 August 1995 the Public Prosecutor at the Konya National Security Court requested the Adana Public Prosecutor to arrange a confrontation between the four witnesses who had been questioned on 28 September 1994 and six of the persons who had been arrested in July 1995, including Z.T. and H.T. On 1 September 1995 the Adana Public Prosecutor instructed Adana Police Headquarters to produce the four witnesses concerned and the Governor of Adana Prison to produce the six prisoners for a confrontation. Müslüm Olcay was brought before him on 26 September 1995. According to a note dated 29 September 1995, it was not possible to produce Halil Sabuktekin, as he was performing his military service at Doğubayazıt in another region. Abdullah Ertekin and Suphi Özbudak could not be produced either, as they had moved and the police could not find anyone who knew their new address. In letters of 25 September and 18 October 1995 the Adana Public Prosecutor informed the Public Prosecutor at the Konya National Security Court that it had not been possible to hold the requested confrontation, since there was no record of one of the accused in the prison register and the others had been transferred to Karaman Prison.', '27. On 7 November 1995 the Public Prosecutor at the Konya National Security Court requested the Adana Anti-Terrorist Branch Headquarters to produce the four witnesses concerned. On 21 November 1995 the Adana Anti-Terrorist Branch Headquarters repeated that Halil Sabuktekin was performing his military service at Doğubayazıt and said that the other witnesses had insufficient means to pay their travel expenses and would attend as soon as they were able.', '28. On 28 November 1995, referring in particular to the report of 13 October 1994 (see paragraph 18 above), the Public Prosecutor at the Konya National Security Court requested the Adana Anti-Terrorist Branch Headquarters to conduct a thorough search for those responsible for the murders of Salih Sabuktekin and another person. He asked for quarterly progress reports on the investigation.', ""29. On 12 December 1995 the Public Prosecutor at the Konya National Security Court invited the Adana Public Prosecutor's Office to arrange for a confrontation between the witnesses to Salih Sabuktekin's murder and the defendants who had been committed on 11 August 1995 for trial by the National Security Court."", ""30. On 7 March 1996 the Anti-Terrorist Branch Headquarters informed the Public Prosecutor at the Konya National Security Court that, despite its efforts, it had not yet managed to identify those responsible for the two murders referred to in the latter's letter of 28 November 1995. It assured him that as soon as it obtained any further information it would pass it on to him."", ""31. On 14 March 1996 the Public Prosecutor at the Konya National Security Court again invited the Adana Public Prosecutor's Office to arrange for a confrontation between the persons who had witnessed the murder and the defendants who had been committed on 11 August 1995 for trial by the National Security Court."", '32. On 25 July 1996 the Konya National Security Court acquitted the six defendants who on 11 August 1995 had been committed to stand trial before it for lack of evidence. On 1 August 1996 the Public Prosecutor appealed to the Court of Cassation, which, in a judgment of 16 February 1998, upheld the judgment of 25 July 1996.', '33. On 25 September 1996, having received no reply to his letters of 12 December 1995 and 14 March 1996, the Public Prosecutor at the Konya National Security Court repeated his request of 14 March 1996 for a confrontation to be arranged. He gave instructions for photographs to be taken of the persons concerned for use for identification purposes should the need subsequently arise. On 3 and 7 October 1996 he received a reply informing him among other things that it had not been possible to arrange for the presence of the persons indicted on 11 August 1995 as, according to the information contained in the indictment, they were in custody.', ""34. On 18 October 1996 the Public Prosecutor at the Konya National Security Court renewed his requests to the Adana Public Prosecutor's Office for a confrontation to be arranged, explaining that the persons who were to be confronted by the witnesses had been released as a result of their acquittal."", ""35. On 5 November 1996 the Public Prosecutor at the Konya National Security Court invited the Adana Public Prosecutor's Office to recover the clothing the victim was wearing when he was killed for use in forensic tests. He explained that it might have been handed over to his brother, Abdulvahap. He also requested a further hearing of the four witnesses who had given evidence on 28 September 1994 and a further inspection of the scene of the crime."", '36. The Konya National Security Court was abolished by Law no. 4210 of 13 November 1996 and replaced by the Adana National Security Court, to which the case was transferred.', '37. On 23 June 1997 the Public Prosecutor at the Adana National Security Court instructed the Anti-Terrorist Branch Headquarters to pursue its investigations into the five crimes of murder and assault, including the murder of Salih Sabuktekin, that had been committed in 1994 and 1995. He invited it to explore the possibility that the crimes were the work of the illegal Hizbullah or PKK organisations further. He pointed out that H.T. and Z.T. remained under suspicion in that regard, and requested that nine witnesses, including Halil Sabuktekin and Müslüm Olcay, be shown the photographs of the suspects that had been taken at the request of the Public Prosecutor at the Konya National Security Court on 25 September 1996.', ""38. On 3 July 1997 the Public Prosecutor at the Adana National Security Court took a deposition from Müslüm Olcay; it did not add to the information contained in his deposition of 28 September 1994. Müslüm Olcay was shown the photographs of suspects, but said that he did not recognise any of them and had not seen the killers' faces."", '39. Also on 3 July 1997 the Anti-Terrorist Branch Headquarters informed the Public Prosecutor that it was unable to bring the other witnesses before him, as they were not staying at their addresses.', '40. On 30 July 1997 the Public Prosecutor at the Adana National Security Court again invited the Anti-Terrorist Branch Headquarters to pursue its investigations into the five crimes of murder and assault and reminded them that H.T. and Z.T. were suspects. He also requested monthly progress reports.', ""41. Referring to the letters of 23 June and 30 July 1997 the Anti-Terrorist Branch Headquarters informed the Public Prosecutor on 28 August 1997 that it had not been able to establish where H.T. and Z.T lived. It had found the addresses of Z.T.'s brothers and H.T.'s brother, but the latter did not know where H.T. lived. On 9 September 1997 the Anti-Terrorist Branch Headquarters informed the Public Prosecutor that it had been unable to obtain data or information about the murder on 28 September 1994."", '42. By letters of 6 November 1997, 6 January, 3 February and 19 March 1998, the Public Prosecutor at the Adana National Security Court again invited the Anti-Terrorist Branch Headquarters to pursue its investigations into the death and to provide him with monthly progress reports. The Anti-Terrorist Branch acknowledged receipt of the letters and promised to take the necessary action. By letters of 20 May, 20 June, 20 July, 20 August and 22 September 1998 it informed him that no new information had been obtained from its further inquiries.', ""43. Meanwhile, on 14 April 1998 the Public Prosecutor at the Adana National Security Court invited the Anti-Terrorist Branch Headquarters to arrange for the applicant and Abdulvahap and Halil Sabuktekin to attend his office for questioning. The request concerning Abdulvahap Sabuktekin was forwarded the following day to the Public Prosecutor's Office in Izmir, where he lived."", '44. On 15 April 1998 the Public Prosecutor at the Adana National Security Court invited the Anti-Terrorist Branch Headquarters to arrange for the police officer who had been the first to the scene to be brought before him for questioning. The Anti-Terrorist Branch informed him the same day that it had been unable to contact the police officer as he was performing his military service and it was not known to which barracks he had been assigned.', '45. On 15 April 1998 the Public Prosecutor at the National Security Court took a deposition from the applicant, in which the latter stated:', '“On 28 September 1994 my husband left the house at approximately 6.53 a.m. to go out in our van. He set off in the direction of the tearooms to fetch the workmen who were waiting for him there. He was getting into the van when two people came up alongside him. They shot him from behind from a distance of approximately two metres. As I was a little way off, I cannot say who fired the shots: it is possible that both the assailants did. I ran towards the scene of the murder to try to grab hold of the killers, but they fled. One of the persons who fired the shots was short and stout, the other was thin and approximately 1 metre 70 tall. I saw them from behind.”', 'The complainant is asked to examine photographs of the suspects, but says that she cannot recognise the killers as she did not see their faces.', '“The accused fired the shots with a pistol. I do not know how many shots were fired. I would say six or seven. I did not see the pistols. I do not know who killed my husband, nor do I know whether he was executed by an organisation. I wish to file a complaint if the killers are found. I would add that my husband was killed as he opened the van door and started to get in.”', '46. Abdullah Ertekin was heard on 16 April 1998 and gave similar information to that contained in his deposition of 28 September 1994. He added that after the shots had been fired, the injured man was taken to Adana Hospital, where he died. Müslüm Olcay was heard the same day but did not add to the information he had given in his previous depositions, (see paragraph 17 above).', ""47. The victim's brother, Abdulvahap Sabuktekin, was heard by the Public Prosecutor on 20 April 1998. He had little information to give about his brother's death. He had been informed of events at work and had gone to the hospital where he learnt that his brother had died. He added that his brother's clothes had not been handed over to him and he did not know what had been done with them. Halil Sabuktekin was heard by the Public Prosecutor on 22 April 1998. The record of his deposition reads as follows:"", ""“'Towards 6.30 a. m. on the morning of 28 September 1994, I went to the tearoom. My elder brother's van arrived at about 6.30 a.m. I got into the driver's cabin, and my elder brother, Mehmet Salih Sabuktekin, did likewise. He had already put a foot inside when I heard six pistol shots and my brother collapsed in the driver's cabin of the van. There were four of us in the cabin and my brother fell on top of us. I started to run after the two men who had fired the shots. I did not see their faces, but there had been other people in the tearoom while I was there, apart from the workmen. It was they who shot my brother. Both of them had a pistol in their hands but I am unable to identify the make. One of the killers was approximately 1 metre 80 tall, the other 1 metre 60. He was stout. The man who was 1 metre 80 tall was slim, had a black moustache and hollow cheeks. The other man was 1 metre 60 tall, stout, blond and had bright coloured eyes. I ran after them but was unable to catch them. They turned into another street and got away. They did not fire at me or anyone else.'"", ""The witness was shown the photographs in the case file [including the photographs of the fourteen people who were arrested in July 1995 (see paragraph 20 above)]. He said: 'The men who shot my brother are not any of the men in the photographs. I do not know what clothes my brother was wearing the day he was killed or where they are, but they are not in our house. I saw my brother's killers from behind, not from the front. However, they were in the tea-room: one was tall and dark, the other small and blond. I did not see the killers after the murder.'"", ""The witness's statements of 28 September 1994 were read over to him. He replied:"", ""'The statements are correct and the signature is mine. In our suburb the owner of a bookshop was killed. He was Z.T.'s elder brother. Two months after that murder, my brother was killed. After the bookshop owner was killed, a group of men gathered outside our office in the 19 May suburb, shouting 'They are the killers'. I do not know these people. It is possible that my brother Mehmet Salih Sabuktekin was believed to be responsible for the death of the bookshop owner and was executed by Hizbullah supporters. I have nothing else to say.'”"", '48. By a letter sent on 24 April 1998 the International Relations Department at the Ministry of Justice informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the position in the investigation and forwarded information from the case file. It advised that following the murder of Salih Sabuktekin, the police had began inquiries the same day and had summoned Halit Sabuktekin, the applicant (Sultan Sabuktekin), Abdullah Ertekin, Müslüm Olcay and Suphi Özbudak to give statements as witnesses.', '49. Halil Sabuktekin was questioned further by the Public Prosecutor on 8 May 1998 and stated inter alia:', '“When we recovered the body of my brother, Mehmet Salih Sabuktekin, he was not wearing any clothes. The clothes were not returned to us.', 'At the time of the murder, I was inside the van on the corner of 1034 Street in the 19 May district. My brother was shot as he was getting into the van. He collapsed, but later managed to sit up. We took him to Adana Hospital. He was not operated on by the Casualty and Emergency Department. We were told later that he had died as he was being taken for an operation.', 'I saw the killers. They were not people I knew. I would recognise them if I saw them again.”', '50. On 18 September 1998 the Public Prosecutor at the Adana National Security Court issued further instructions to the Anti-Terrorist Branch Headquarters concerning the five murders and/or assaults committed in 1994 and 1995, including:', '“(a) In the light of your replies regarding these case files, we note that no analyses have been carried out, the acts remain unexplained and no inquiries have been made to resolve them. These acts may have been the work of either the PKK organisation or Hizbullah. In any event, in view of the importance of the events, inquiries must be made and a detailed reply given...', '(e) The murders and attempted murders have profoundly affected public opinion, creating a sense of insecurity. It is for that reason that you are asked to investigate these cases carefully and to inform us of the results of your inquiries.”', ""51. On 28 September 1998 the Anti-Terrorist Branch Headquarters brought the following information about the present case to the Public Prosecutor's attention:"", ""“It is considered that the murder of Mehmet Salih Sabuktekin on 28 September 1994 was perpetrated by Hizbullah. During questioning, Z.T., a member of Hizbullah, stated that H.T., a member of the same organisation, had given an order for information to be obtained on members of the PKK with a view to ridding the district of those people. Z.T. has admitted that he compiled a list containing the names of those people and gave it to B.T. Mr Salih Sabuktekin's name was included on the list. Z.T. has also said that he heard about the murder later. H.T. denied Z.T.'s allegations. No organisation has claimed responsibility for this murder.”"", 'Abdullah Ertekin appeared before the public prosecutor again on 5 November 1998 and provided similar information to that contained in his deposition of 28 September 1994. He added that he had remained at the scene of the murder while the driver of the van, Mesut Şen, took the victim, his brother-in-law, to hospital.', '52. Referring to the letter of 19 March 1998 (see paragraph 42 above), the Anti-Terrorist Branch informed the Public Prosecutor at the Adana National Security Court in a letter of 21 October 1998 that it was pursuing its inquiries and would inform him of developments.', '53. On 4 November 1998 the Anti-Terrorist Branch Headquarters questioned Halil Sabuktekin, who gave the following account:', ""“At about 7 a.m. on the day of the murder, I was waiting outside the tearoom on Cukurova Boulevard with about fourteen workers for my brother to arrive. He came to within approximately twenty metres of us and gestured for us to get into the van, a Skoda. I sat in the front. When my brother was next to us, some people who I did not know but had noticed drinking tea while waiting for my brother, one of whom was very corpulent, the other tall and slim, shot him. My brother collapsed on top of us. I got out on the driver's side and ran after the assailants. When they saw that I was giving chase, they fired two shots. That scared me and I turned back at that point. Nobody prevented me from chasing them. Later I took a collective taxi to the hospital to which my brother had been admitted."", 'The fourteen workmen who were in front of the tearoom on that day were our workmen. I do not remember their names and addresses.', 'In the deposition I made at the police station on 28 April 1994 I did not mention the fact that I had chased the assailants, but in my later depositions to the judicial authorities and the Public Prosecutor at the Adana National Security Court, I did explain that I had chased the suspects and that no one had stopped me doing so.', 'A day after I made my depositions to the judicial authorities and the Public Prosecutor, a man with a beard approached me saying he was a member of the Adana Section of the Human Rights Association. He got me to sign a blank sheet of paper and told me that he would fill it in and approach the authorities. When I asked him which authorities he had in mind, he told me not to worry and left.', 'I have made this deposition without being subjected to pressure of any sort and have expressed my opinion of my own will.', '54. On 9 November 1998 Mesut Şen was heard by the Anti-Terrorist Branch Headquarters. The following is an extract from his statement:', ""“I knew Mehmet Salih Sabuktekin, who was killed on the aforementioned date, as I worked for him as a driver and he was married to my half sister, Sultane Sabuktekin. On the day of the murder I arrived outside the tearoom on Cukurova Boulevard in the 19 May of Yüregir District in Adana, to collect the workmen. Thirteen or fourteen workmen got into the back of the van. Seated next to me in the van were Halil Sabuktekin and one Abdullah. I do not know his surname or address. When our employer, Mehmet Salih Sabuktekin, got in beside me I heard pistol shots. I heard five or six shots. I did not see the suspects' faces. I leant over inside the vehicle to protect myself. Halil Sabuktekin got out of the van by climbing over me but I do not know whether he chased the suspects. I then saw the suspects from behind making their getaway along the D400 road. I did not give chase as I was afraid. Since I did not see their faces, I cannot identify them. Once I had got over the shock, I took Mehmet Salih Sabuktekin to the Adana State Hospital. I was questioned by police officers in the hospital. This is what I know about these events.”"", '55. Mesut Şen said virtually the same thing when he was questioned the same day by the Public Prosecutor at the Adana National Security Court. He explained that he was alone in the van when he stopped outside the tea room. Halil Sabuktekin and Abdullah Ertekin got in beside him and the other workmen got in the back.', '56. Under further questioning on 9 November 1998 by the Public Prosecutor, Halil Sabuktekin gave the following details about the persons present in the tearoom just before his brother was killed:', ""“Those present were our workmen, Mesut Şen, Latif Turan, Ekrem Turan, Abdullah Ertekin and some others whose names I do not recall. The two people who killed my brother were sitting beside us. As I had no reason to be suspicious of them, I did not pay them any attention. My brother's van, whose vehicle registration number I do not recall, arrived to pick up the workmen. I was sat in the part reserved for the driver and passengers. My brother, Mehmet Salih Sabuktekin, put a foot inside the vehicle to sit down next to me and at that point I heard six pistol shots. My brother collapsed towards me. I got out of my seat of and began to run after the suspects. I did not see their faces. These were not the people whose photographs were shown to me earlier. The only persons at the scene were our workmen and the two suspects.”"", '57. The applicants was further questioned by the Public Prosecutor on 18 November 1998. The two records made of the interview read as follows:', ""“'At about 6.53 a.m. on 28 September 1994, my husband, Mehmet Salih Sabuktekin, left our house. His van was going to pick up the workmen outside Müslüm Olcay's coffee house to take them to the building site. When he left the house, I wondered whether he would manage to catch the van and that is why I waited outside the house. I was approximately 250 metres from the van and there was nothing obstructing my view of it. I knew that the van driver was Mesut Şen, but did not know the workmen. As my husband, Mehmet Salih Sabuktekin, got into the van alongside the driver, two people came up and fired shots, but I was unable to work out whether my husband was the target. At that point a person I did not know arrived and told me that my husband had been shot. One of the assailants was stout and short. The other was slim and approximately 1 metre 70 tall. I did not see their faces. From what I heard, they fired six or seven shots. I saw one of them fire a shot in the air. I do not know who killed my husband. I was not questioned after the killing. The first deposition I gave was to you on 15 April 1998. Mesut Şen was the van driver and that is how I know that he was at the scene of the murder. I do not know the identity of the other workmen. I do not remember whether I took any official action after the murder. The assailants ran towards me. At that point I did not know that they had shot my husband. They disappeared round the corner of the road just next to me. They were holding pistols. My brother-in-law, Halil Sabuktekin, arrived and told me that my husband had been shot. I did not see Halil run after the suspects. When he got up to me he fainted. I wanted to help him recover his senses and at the same time to follow the suspects, but I did not find them. I met an elderly person. I do not know his name, but do know his address. That person may know in which direction the suspects fled. When I asked him which way they had gone, he said that he had not seen them. To be precise, he said that they had run off and that there was no point in giving chase, as I would never be able to catch them up. No one stopped me when I tried to chase them. In any event, I was the only person who sought to follow the suspects. Three or four years before my husband was killed, there was an investigation. My husband was taken into police custody but was not detained. He was questioned about a person named Rıfat and another workman, who were working on one of the building sites in the sub-prefecture of Karatas. Rıfat and the other workman were suspected of being members of the PKK and I think my husband was suspected of helping them. I repeat that my husband was not detained but merely taken into police custody. I do not suggest that any plainclothes police officers were at the scene of the murder. No one sought to stop anyone from chasing the suspects. In any event, I was the only person who attempted to follow them. That is all I have to say.'"", 'The depositions was read out and the witness approved it. Not knowing how to sign her name, she affixed a thumbprint.', ""'I did not tell the people who drew up the memorial [the memorial in reply that was lodged with the Commission] that my brother-in-law, Halil Sabuktekin, was prevented from chasing after the suspects by plainclothes police officers. I do not know where they obtained that information. I did not say that in my deposition of 15 April 1998, as it is not true and I was not asked about that subject. We buried the deceased the day he was killed. At about 5 a.m. the following day, I noticed someone in the fields, about 250 metres from my home, and another person walk past my house. I think that they were police officers, but they were not wearing uniforms. The person who walked past my house saw me crying and made off in the direction of the fields. He undoubtedly caught up with the person who was already there. I have nothing else to say.'”"", '58. On the afternoon of 18 November 1998, the Public Prosecutor took the following statement from Ali Acar:', ""“At about 3.30 p.m. today, police officers, accompanied by a person who I did not know beforehand but whom I subsequently learnt was Mrs Sultane Sabuktekin, came to my house. Pointing at me, Sultane said 'I am not sure, but he may be the person'. The police officers gave me an appointment to attend the office of the Public Prosecutor at the Adana National Security Court. In 1994 and 1995 several people were killed in our district. I did not know the person who was killed, Mehmet Salih Sabuktekin , or his wife, Sultane Sabuktekin. I had never seen Sultane before today. I am a brick manufacturer. I do not recall the murder of Mehmet Salih Sabuktekin. Mrs Sultane never spoke to me about the subject at that time. I do not know anything and have not seen anything. I do not know the suspects and have no information about the murder of Mehmet Salih Sabuktekin.”"", '59. When questioned on 19 November 1998, Latif Turan said that after hearing the first shots, he had been seized by panic and had not watched what happened. He had not seen the assailants or the persons who had chased after them and could not say whether there had been a chase. It was only later that he had noticed that Salih Sabuktekin had been wounded. Salih Sabuktekin and his brother were the only persons he knew among those who had been present. He could not remember whether his brother, Ekrem Turan, who was also working on the building site to which they were all going, was present that morning. Ekrem Turan was later questioned, but stated that he was not at the scene of the murder as he had taken the day off work.', '60. The rules and procedures applicable to liability for illegal acts may be resumed as follows.', '61. The Criminal Code contains provisions dealing with unintentional homicide (Articles 452 and 459), intentional homicide (Article 448) and murder (Article 450).', ""62. The authorities' obligations with regard to conducting a preliminary investigation into acts or omissions capable of constituting such offences that have been brought to their attention are governed by Articles 151 to 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP). Offences may be reported to the authorities or members of the security forces or to the public prosecutors' offices. Complaints may be made in writing or orally. If the complaint is made orally, the authority must make a record of it (Article 151 CCP)."", '63. If there is evidence to suggest that a death is not due to natural causes, members of the security forces who have been informed of that fact are required to advise the public prosecutor or a criminal-court judge (Article 152 CCP).', '64. A public prosecutor who is informed by any means whatsoever of a situation that gives rise to suspicion that an offence has been committed has a duty to investigate the facts in order to decide whether or not a prosecution should be brought (Article 153 CCP).', '65. Under section 13 of Law no. 2577 on Administrative Procedure, anyone who sustains damage as a result of an act by the authorities may, within one year after the alleged act was committed, claim compensation from them. If the claim is rejected in whole or in part or if no reply is received within sixty days, the victim may bring administrative proceedings.', '66. Article 125 §§ 1 and 7 of the Constitution provides:', '“All acts or decisions of the authorities are subject to judicial review...', 'The authorities shall be liable to make reparation for all damage caused by their acts or measures.”', ""That provision establishes the State's strict liability, which comes into play if it is shown that in the circumstances of a particular case the State has failed in its obligation to maintain public order, ensure public safety or protect people's lives or property, without it being necessary to show a tortious act attributable to the authorities. Under these rules, the authorities may therefore be held liable to compensate anyone who has sustained loss as a result of acts committed by unidentified persons."", ""67. Under the Code of Obligations, anyone who suffers damage as a result of an illegal or tortious act may bring an action for damages for pecuniary loss (Articles 41 to 46) and non-pecuniary loss (Article 47). The civil courts are not bound by either the findings or the verdict of the criminal courts on the issue of the defendant's guilt (Article 53)."", ""68. However, under section 13 of Law no. 657 on State Employees, anyone who has sustained loss as a result of an act done in the performance of duties governed by public law may, in principle, only bring an action against the authority by whom the civil servant concerned is employed and not directly against the civil servant (see Article 129 § 5 of the Constitution and Articles 55 and 100 of the Code of Obligations). That is not, however, an absolute rule. When an act is found to be illegal or tortious and, consequently, is no longer an “administrative” act or deed, the civil courts may allow a claim for damages to be made against the official concerned, without prejudice to the victim's right to bring an action against the authority on the basis of its joint liability as the employer (Article 50 of the Code of Obligations).""]",[],[],[],"['13', '2']",[],[]

The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Lębork. He is currently serving a prison term.', '9. On 19 November 2002 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of forgery of documents as well as armed robbery and drug trafficking, committed in an organised criminal group. Since September 2002 he had been in hiding.', '10. On 21 November 2002 the Gdańsk District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded him in custody, relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question. It also considered that detaining the applicant was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, because the applicant had threatened the victim at the time of the commitment of the alleged offence. The court also stressed the severity of the anticipated sentence and the fact that the applicant had a previous criminal record.', '11. An appeal by the applicant against the detention order was unsuccessful. On 16 December 2002 the Gdańsk Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) upheld the challenged decision, basically repeating the arguments of the District Court and relying additionally on the fact that in September 2002 the applicant had gone into hiding.', ""12. The argument that the applicant had gone into hiding was repeated by the Słupsk District Court in its decisions of 18 February 2003 and 3 June 2003, extending the applicant's detention."", '13. Numerous appeals by the applicant against decisions extending his detention and all his subsequent applications for release were unsuccessful.', ""14. Subsequently, the applicant's pre-trial detention was prolonged on several occasions (on 18 February, 6 March, 3 June, 28 August and 5 December 2003 and on 16 February, 8 June and 17 August 2004). In all their detention decisions the courts repeatedly relied on a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question, which was supported by evidence from witnesses. They attached importance to the grave nature of those offences and the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant."", '15. On 22 July 2003 the Public Prosecutor lodged a bill of indictment with the Słupsk District Court. The bill of indictment comprised fifty charges of, among others, participation in an organised criminal group, drug trafficking, uttering threats and robberies brought against thirteen defendants. The applicant was charged with participation in an organised criminal group, drug smuggling, uttering threats and forgery of documents.', ""16. Once the length of the applicant's detention had reached the statutory two-year maximum laid down in Article 263 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Kodeks Postępowania Karnego), the first-instance court no longer had jurisdiction to extend it. Consequently, it was the Gdańsk Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) which issued further extensions. In its first extension decision, on 13 October 2004, the Gdańsk Court of Appeal relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged and on the considerable complexity of the case. The court also held that the risk that the applicant and other co-accused would obstruct the investigation had been established."", ""17. The applicant's detention was subsequently extended by the Gdańsk Court of Appeal on 1 December 2004, 26 January 2005 and 1 March 2005. The Court relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question and on their serious nature. It also stressed that the fact that the applicant and the co-defendants were charged with participation in an organised criminal group created the reasonable fear that they might obstruct the proceedings or try to influence witnesses. The Court additionally examined the conduct of the proceedings and found no undue or unjustified delays. Between 15 September and 23 November 2004 the District Court held nine hearings. In December 2004 four hearings were held and in January 2005 five hearings were held."", ""18. On 21 March 2005 the Słupsk District Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to four years' imprisonment."", ""19.

The first applicant, Mr Ivan Dvořáček, was born in 1942. The second applicant, Mrs Jozefa Dvořáčková, was born in 1945. They are married and live in Bratislava. They filed the application also on behalf of Ms Ivana Dvořáčková, their daughter.', '6. Ms Ivana Dvořáčková was born in 1981 with Down Syndrome (trisomy 21) and a damaged heart and lungs. She was in the care of a specialised health institution in Bratislava. In 1986 she was examined in the Centre of Paediatric Cardiology in PragueMotole where it was established that, due to post-natal pathological developments, her heart chamber defect could no longer be remedied.', '7. On 1987 she underwent vascular surgery in Prague. However, the doctors considered that comprehensive heart surgery with a view to eliminating the cardio-vascular defect was no longer feasible. A conservative treatment was recommended and the medical prognosis was that her heart or lungs would fail in the second or third decade of her life.', '8. Ms Ivana Dvořáčková died of heart failure on 14 March 2004 at the age of 23.', '9. On 26 October 1987 Ms Ivana Dvořáčková and her parents instituted proceedings in the Bratislava I District Court. They claimed compensation for damage on the ground that Ms Ivana Dvořáčková’s health had been seriously and irreparably damaged as a result of shortcomings in the post-natal treatment she had received in a hospital to which the defendant was the legal successor. In particular, on the basis of the aforementioned examination in the Centre of Paediatric Cardiology in Prague, they alleged that the health institution in Bratislava had failed to diagnose in time the extent of the damage to her health and to ensure appropriate and timely treatment of the defect.', '10. The District Court held eleven hearings in the case and dismissed the action on 9 August 1990. On 19 June 1991 the Regional Court in Bratislava quashed that judgment. The case file was returned to the District Court on 5 August 1991.', '11. In 1994 and 1995 the District Court took various procedural steps. It scheduled two hearings in 1997.', '12. On 2 March 1998 the District Court appointed an expert, who submitted an opinion on 17 November 1999.', '13. Another hearing in the case was scheduled for 3 October 2000. The plaintiffs requested an adjournment but the District Court dismissed their request on 18 May 2001. On 30 November 2001 the Regional Court quashed that decision. After obtaining further evidence, the District Court stayed the proceedings on 19 March 2002 at the applicants’ request. On 13 June 2003 the plaintiffs requested that the proceedings be resumed.', '14. On 11 December 2003 the District Court held a hearing at which Ms Ivana Dvořáčková challenged the expert.', '15. On 20 April 2004, after their daughter had died, the first and second applicants asked the District Court to proceed with their case and determine whether the defendant was liable for damage to their daughter’s health. They indicated that the question arose whether her death had been caused by shortcomings in her medical treatment and that they intended to claim damages in that respect. On 5 May 2004 the first and second applicants specified their claims for damages with the District Court.', '16. On 7 June 2004 the District Court dismissed the request for the exclusion of the expert. In a separate decision, which was rectified on 30 August 2004, it discontinued the proceedings. On 30 September 2004 the Bratislava Regional Court varied the first-instance court’s decision in that it discontinued the proceedings only to the extent that they concerned part of Ms Dvořáčková’s claim for compensation which under the relevant law could not pass to her heirs. The appellate court remitted the case to the District Court for further examination.', '17. On 26 May 2005 the District Court adjourned the case as the defendant’s representative did not attend the hearing.', '18. A further hearing was held on 28 June 2005. The first applicant stated that he challenged the three expert opinions included in the file as the experts involved either lacked the requisite qualifications or were biased. The District Court decided to obtain another expert opinion. A hearing scheduled for 20 March 2006 had to be adjourned as the judge was ill.', '19. After the case had been transferred to a different judge, a hearing was held on 24 April 2006. The first applicant urged the court to determine the case. He maintained that the evidence available was sufficient and that obtaining another expert opinion was not necessary. The judge decided to obtain a fourth expert opinion in the case. In a decision of 25 May 2006 the District Court instructed the Medical Faculty of the P.J. Šafárik University in Košice to submit an opinion on the relevant issues within 40 days.', '20. On 24 July 2008 the Bratislava I District Court asked the Hradec Králové District Court (Czech Republic) for assistance in obtaining a further opinion by two Czech medical experts.', '21. In January 2009 the parties informed the Court that the proceedings were pending.', '22. On 4 March 2004 the Constitutional Court held that the Bratislava I District Court had violated Ms I. Dvořáčková’s right to a hearing within a reasonable time. It found that the case was not particularly complex and that the plaintiff had not by her conduct contributed to the length of the proceedings in a substantial manner. The decision stated that there had been unjustified delays in the proceedings before the District Court, totalling approximately six years.', '23. The Constitutional Court ordered the Bratislava I District Court to proceed with the case without further delay and to pay to the plaintiff, within two months from its judgment becoming final, the equivalent of 3,452 euros (EUR) as just satisfaction. It also ordered the Bratislava I District Court to reimburse the plaintiff’s costs related to the constitutional proceedings within fifteen days.', '24. On 21 April 2004 the parents of Ms I. Dvořáčková, represented by an advocate, lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court alleging a violation of their right under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention to a hearing within a reasonable time.', '25. They submitted further arguments and documents subsequently. In particular, in two letters which they personally sent by registered mail to the Constitutional Court and its President on 23 July 2004, they alleged that the inactivity of the District Court amounted to a denial of justice and that Articles 2, 8 and 14 of the Convention had also been violated. As regards Article 2 in particular, they submitted that their daughter had died as a result of medical negligence. The applicants referred to the States’ obligation to protect the life of persons within their jurisdiction and to “apply all civil-law remedies, such as compensation for damage, in cases of medical negligence”.', '26. On 11 October 2004 the applicants appointed a different advocate to represent them in the proceedings before the Constitutional Court. In a submission of 21 October 2004 the advocate asked the Constitutional Court to have regard to all earlier submissions in the case and to consider the scope of the breach of the applicants’ rights guaranteed by both the Constitution and the Convention. At the request of the Constitutional Court the advocate submitted, on 18 February 2005, further information about the scope of the proceedings complained of and about the complaint under Article 127 of the Constitution. He indicated in his letter that in the proceedings before the Constitutional Court the plaintiffs “alleged a breach of their right under Article 48 § 2 of the Constitution to a hearing without unjustified delays and that they also complained of interference with their human rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights”.', '27. On 23 May 2005 the Constitutional Court declared admissible the complaint of unjustified delays in the proceedings before the Bratislava I District Court. It stated that the plaintiffs had claimed damages in the action brought on 26 October 1987 and therefore had standing as a party to the proceedings complained of.', '28. To the extent that the plaintiffs complained of “interference with their human rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights” the Constitutional Court rejected their complaint as not complying with the statutory requirements. In particular, the plaintiffs had not specified the rights which they alleged had been violated, submitted any arguments in support of their allegation or provided draft wording for the operative part of the decision they sought to obtain from the Constitutional Court with respect to that complaint.', '29. On 11 October 2005 the Constitutional Court found that the Bratislava I District Court had violated the plaintiffs’ right to a hearing within a reasonable time. It ordered the District Court to proceed with the case without further delay and granted the equivalent of EUR 1,287 each to the first and second applicants as just satisfaction payable within two months. It also ordered the Bratislava I District Court to reimburse the costs of the constitutional proceedings to the applicants (the equivalent of EUR 807).', '30. The Constitutional Court noted that the proceedings in issue concerned a claim for compensation for serious damage to the health of Ms Ivana Dvořáčková. That claim was based on allegedly incorrect medical diagnoses as a result of which I. Dvořáčková’s lung and heart had been damaged to the extent that she had been permanently handicapped as from 7 April 1987. Subsequently the plaintiffs had extended the claim to include, inter alia, compensation for the costs of medical treatment and care for their daughter, expenses relating to her burial and damages for unjustified interference with their privacy.', '31. The Constitutional Court found that the case was not particularly complex and that the overall duration of the proceedings could not be imputed to the plaintiffs. In addition to the delays in the proceedings to which it had pointed in its judgment of 4 March 2004 (see paragraph 22 above), the Constitutional Court found that the case had been with an expert for eighteen months. During the subsequent period the District Court had not proceeded with the case effectively with the exception of a period of approximately one year between March 2002 and April 2003 when the proceedings had been stayed.', '32. The following provisions of the Constitutional Court Act 1993 are relevant in the present case.', '33. Section 20(1) provides that a request for proceedings to be started before the Constitutional Court must indicate, inter alia, the decision which the plaintiff seeks to obtain, specify the reasons for the request and indicate evidence in support.', '34. Pursuant to paragraph 2 of section 20, plaintiffs are required to submit an authority for a lawyer to represent them in the proceedings before the Constitutional Court.', '35. Under paragraph 3 of section 20, the Constitutional Court is bound by a plaintiff’s request for proceedings to be started unless the Act expressly provides otherwise.', '36. The Constitutional Court has declared itself bound, in accordance with section 20(3) of the Constitutional Court Act 1993, by a party’s submission aimed at initiating proceedings before it. The Constitutional Court has expressly stated that the submission was particularly relevant as regards the wording of the order which parties sought to obtain from it as it could only decide those matters which a party had requested be determined (see, for example, decisions III. ÚS 166/02 of 6 November 2002 or III. ÚS 65/02 of 9 October 2002).']","['2', '6']",['6-1'],[],[],[],[]

The applicant was born in 1946.', '7. On 14 August 1997 the investigating judge at the Vaduz Regional Court (Landgericht), having heard the applicant, ordered that he be taken into pre-trial detention on suspicion of, inter alia, embezzlement and continuous aggravated fraud (file no. 10 Vr 203/97). He found that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had enticed a number of persons to entrust him with the investment of their capital, which he had then fraudulently diverted using a network of partly foreign companies. Giving detailed reasons, the investigating judge found that there was a danger of absconding, a danger that the applicant might influence witnesses, and also a danger of repetition of the offences. Finally, having regard to the seriousness of the offence, the applicant’s detention was proportionate to the sentence he risked incurring.', '8. On 19 September 1997 the Court of Appeal (Obergericht) held a hearing on the applicant’s request for release (Haftprüfungsverhandlung). The applicant was not represented by counsel at this hearing. Following the hearing, the court ordered that the applicant’s detention be continued. It confirmed the reasons advanced by the Regional Court.', '9. On the same day the Vaduz Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s request of 18 August to have a legal-aid counsel appointed for him. Regarding the applicant’s submissions concerning his income and assets, and the fact that he was represented by two counsel of his own choosing in a second set of proceedings (file no. 282/92), it found that he had sufficient means to pay for counsel.', '10. On 10 December 1997 the Regional Court ordered the applicant’s representation by legal aid counsel. It noted that the investigations and, in particular, an expert opinion, which had meanwhile been submitted, had shown that the applicant had been living exclusively on money obtained from the investors in his various companies and had therefore no means to pay for defence counsel. In the evening of 16 December 1997 the Lawyers’ Chamber appointed Mr B.', '11. On 17 December 1997 the Court of Appeal held a hearing on the applicant’s renewed request for release.', '12. At the beginning of the hearing, the applicant’s counsel pointed out that he had only been appointed at 6 p.m. on the day before and had therefore been limited to two hours of consultation with the applicant without having had a possibility to study the voluminous file. The Court noted that it had not been informed of the late appointment of counsel for the applicant and drew his attention to the fact that he remained free to request that the hearing be adjourned as the statutory three days’ time-limit for its preparation had not been complied with. However, counsel did not request an adjournment.', '13. At the close of the hearing, the court ordered the continuation of the applicant’s detention. It confirmed the reasons given in the decisions of 14 August and 19 September 1997.', '14. On 17 December 1997 the Lawyer’s Chamber appointed Mr K. as legal-aid counsel for the applicant.', '15. On 14 January 1998 the Court of Appeal, sitting in camera as a panel of five judges, dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 17 December 1997. As to the applicant’s complaint that he did not have sufficient time to prepare for the hearing of 17 December 1997 concerning his detention, the court noted that his counsel had waived the right to request an adjournment. There were no reasons to doubt the validity of the waiver.', '16. On 29 January 1998 the Public Prosecutor’s Office requested that the applicant’s pre-trial detention be extended to up to one year on account of the complexity of the case. The investigating judge supported this request on 30 January. The applicant was given no opportunity to comment.', '17. On 11 February 1998 the Court of Appeal, sitting in camera as a panel of five judges, ordered that the applicant’s detention would be allowed to last up to one year, i.e. until 13 August 1998 at the latest. With regard to the suspicion against the applicant and the danger of absconding and of a repetition of the offences, the court referred to its decision of 14 January 1998. Invoking Article 131 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessordnung), according to which detention on remand must not exceed six months unless the investigations are particularly complex, it found that the present proceedings concerned an exceedingly complex case of white-collar crimes. The offences to be investigated had been committed by a number of co-accused over a period of four years, numerous companies with links to foreign countries were involved and a great number of witnesses had to be heard, many of them under letters rogatory. A period of detention of up to one year appeared proportionate, all the more so because, given the maximum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment, even a further prolongation of the detention to up to two years would be admissible under Article 131.', '18. On 5 March 1998 the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof) declared inadmissible the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 14 January 1998.', '19. On 2 April 1998 the Supreme Court, sitting in camera, dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 11 February 1998. As to the applicant’s complaint that he had not been heard on the requests for prolongation of his detention prior to the Court of Appeal’s decision, the Supreme Court, referring in detail to the Constitutional Court’s (Staatsgerichthof) case-law, found that the right to be heard could also be complied with where the person concerned had a possibility to appeal against the decision. However, it was advisable in the future to hear detainees on requests for prolongation of the detention.', '20. On 4 September 1998 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint against the Supreme Court’s decision of 2 April 1998. As to the applicant’s complaint that he had not been heard prior to the decision of 11 February 1998, the Constitutional Court noted that the Code of Criminal Procedure did not require that a detainee be heard prior to a decision to prolong the detention. In these circumstances, the lack of an opportunity to comment was remedied by the possibility to appeal against the decision itself. Nevertheless - as the Supreme Court had rightly pointed out - it would be desirable to hear a detainee before deciding on a request for prolongation of the detention. The Constitutional Court also found that the Supreme Court as well as the Court of Appeal had given sufficient reasons for their decisions.', '21. Also on 4 September 1998, the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint against the Supreme Court’s decision of 5 March 1998. It found that the Court of Appeal had rightly noted that the applicant’s first request for legal aid had, on the basis of his own submissions, been dismissed on the ground that he was not indigent. It added that, even conceding that the applicant lost his income on account of his detention, he had considerable assets and had admitted it. The assumption that he was not indigent was confirmed by the fact that at the time he was represented by two counsel of his own choosing in a second set of criminal proceedings. Moreover, the applicant’s financial situation had become transparent only after the expert opinion had been filed in November 1997. Shortly afterwards a legal-aid counsel was appointed for him. As to the complaint that the legal aid counsel appointed on 16 December 1997 did not have sufficient time to prepare for the hearing of 17 December, the Constitutional Court confirmed the finding that counsel had validly waived his right to request an adjournment of that hearing.', '22. Both the Constitutional Court’s decisions were served on 2 October 1998.']",['5'],['5-4'],[],[],[],[]

The applicant was born in 1939 and lives in Asenovgrad.', '7. On 29 May 1991 he entered into an employment agreement with a local company (the “company”) whereby he undertook to work for it abroad. Several months later, while working for the company in Germany, the applicant fell seriously ill, underwent an operation and was on sick leave for about two months. At the end of his sick leave on 18 October 1991, the applicant found that his employment agreement had been unilaterally terminated by the company. He returned to Bulgaria soon thereafter.', '8. On 19 May 1992 the applicant initiated an action against the company. He sought damages in the amount of 13,170 German marks (DEM), or their equivalent of 184,389 Bulgarian levs (BGL), on account of the company’s failure to pay out sick leave entitlements, back pay for overtime work and a payment for an insurance policy.', '9. The Plovdiv Regional Court conducted ten hearings between 2 September 1992 and 23 January 1995, scheduled two to five months apart. During this time it obtained two experts’ reports and questioned witnesses. Of the hearings conducted, one was adjourned from 5 March to 5 May 1993 due to the absence of the applicant, another was postponed from 12 May to 14 September 1994 at the request of the defendant and a third, was adjourned from 14 September to 28 November 1994 because the defendant was hindering an expert from completing his report.', '10. In a judgment of 2 March 1995 the Plovdiv Regional Court found partly in favour of the applicant. It awarded him BGL 1,032 for sick leave entitlements and dismissed the remainder of his claims. On 22 March 1995 the applicant appealed against the judgment.', '11. A hearing was held before the Supreme Court on 28 February 1996.', '12. In a judgment of 16 July 1996 the Supreme Court declared the judgment of the Plovdiv Regional Court null and void and remitted the case to the lower court. It established that the lower court had been sitting in an unlawful composition of three judges rather than of one judge and two jurors.', '13. At the retrial, the Plovdiv Regional Court conducted nine hearings between 28 October 1996 and 12 June 1998, scheduled one to four months apart. During this time it obtained an expert’s report and questioned witnesses. Of the hearings conducted, one was adjourned from 29 April to 2 May 1997 because the applicant could not be summoned at his address. In addition, between 3 September 1997 and 16 April 1998 three consecutive hearings were postponed because the applicant or his lawyer were ill and at the request of the defendant in order to acquaint himself with the expert’s report.', '14. In a judgment of 22 December 1998 the Plovdiv Regional Court again found partly in favour of the applicant. It awarded him BGL 24,100 for sick leave entitlements and dismissed the remainder of his claims. On 25 February 1999 the applicant appealed against the judgment.', '15. The Plovdiv Court of Appeals conducted four hearings between 10 September 1999 and 17 April 2000, scheduled one to four months apart. One of the hearings was adjourned from 10 September to 19 November 1999 because the applicant was ill.', '16. In a judgment of 3 July 2000 the Plovdiv Court of Appeals quashed part of the judgment of the lower court in respect of the amount awarded to the applicant for sick leave entitlements in Bulgarian levs and rendered a judgment in the case whereby it re-calculated the award in German marks, specifying it to be DEM 1,679 plus interest as from 22 May 1992. It upheld the remainder of the judgment of the Plovdiv Regional Court in respect of the dismissal of the applicant’s other claims. On 13 September 2000 the applicant appealed against the judgment.', '17. A hearing was held before the Supreme Court of Cassation on 5 June 2001.', '18.

It upheld the remainder of the judgment of the Plovdiv Court of Appeals in respect of the amounts awarded for sick leave entitlements.', '19. The Plovdiv Court of Appeals conducted three hearings between 24 October 2001 and 23 January 2002, scheduled one to two months apart, during which time an expert’s opinion was obtained.', '20. In a judgment of 22 February 2002 the Plovdiv Court of Appeals quashed the remaining part of the judgment of 22 December 1998 of the Plovdiv Regional Court and rendered a judgment in the case in which it ordered the company to pay the applicant DEM 2,220 for back pay and overtime work plus interest as from 22 May 1992.', '21. On 25 March 2002 the applicant obtained a writ of execution against the company for the amounts awarded. It is unclear whether and if the applicant obtained execution of the same.', '22.

The applicant lives in Vrlika.', '5. He is a serviceman employed by the Ministry of Defence (Ministarstvo obrane Republike Hrvatske). In 1996, 1997 and 1998, as a member of the 40th Engineering Brigade of the Croatian Army, the applicant occasionally participated in demining operations in the newly liberated territories in Croatia.', '6. On the basis of the Decision of the Minister of Defence of 18 September 1995 (see paragraph 36 below), he was entitled to a special daily allowance for such work.', '7. Since the allowances had not been paid to him, on 21 May 2002 the applicant brought a civil action against the State in the Knin Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Kninu), seeking payment of the unpaid allowances. He sought in total the sum of 16,142.83 Croatian kunas (HRK) together with accrued statutory default interest.', '8. The State responded that his action was time-barred because the three-year limitation period for employment-related claims had expired.', '9. In reply, the applicant argued that on several occasions he had asked his commanding officer why the allowances had not been paid. His commanding officer had made enquiries of his superior, who had then contacted the General Staff of the Croatian Armed Forces (Glavni stožer Oružanih snaga Republike Hrvatske). Eventually, the applicant had been informed through his commanding officer that his claims were not being disputed and that they would be paid once the funds for that purpose had been allocated in the State budget. Relying on that information, the applicant argued that the State had acknowledged the debt within the meaning of section 387 of the Obligations Act and that the running of the statutory limitation period had thus been interrupted.', ""10. The court heard the applicant's commanding officer B.B. and the head of the Split Regional Finance Department of the Ministry of Defence, Brigadier I.P."", '11. B.B., who had been the commander of the 40th Engineering Brigade between January 1996 and April 1999, testified that lists of servicemen who carried out demining work, together with the number of days worked and the corresponding amount of allowances, had been submitted to him by platoon commanders within the brigade. As the commander of the unit, he had signed them after checking them for accuracy and had then submitted them for certification to the commander of the 3rd Operational Zone. After the commander of the 3rd Operational Zone had signed the lists, they had been submitted for payment to the Regional Finance Department in Split. He had informed the applicant that the lists had been submitted for payment. When the allowances were not paid, the applicant and other members of the unit had approached him, as their commanding officer and the only person they were authorised to approach under internal regulations, asking him when the payment would be made. In their name he had then contacted the commander of the 3rd Operational Zone. Each time he had been informed that the right to receive payment and its amount were not being disputed and that payment would follow after the funds had been allocated for that purpose. Each time he had transmitted that information to the members of his unit, including the applicant.', '12. I.P. had since 1996 been the head of the Split Regional Finance Department of the Ministry of Defence, which was in charge of financial matters for the 3rd Operational Zone. He testified that he had been aware that members of the 40th Engineering Brigade had been carrying out demining work up to April 1998 and that the commander of the 3rd Operational Zone had been submitting lists of servicemen who carried out demining work for payment. Since payment was not forthcoming when the allowances fell due, the General Staff of the Croatian Armed Forces had informed the relevant financial departments that the allowances had not been paid because no funds had been allocated in the budget for that purpose, whereas no instructions had been given to dispute the right to receive allowances or their amount.', '13. On 3 March 2003 the Knin Municipal Court ruled in favour of the applicant and ordered the State to pay him the allowances he sought. The relevant part of that judgment read as follows:', ""“[It] is undisputed that ... when each instalment became due, up to 21 February 2002, the plaintiff asked his commanding officer when the payment would be made, because according to the internal organisation of [the Ministry of Defence] that was the only person he was authorised to approach, and that [his] commanding officer took this up on behalf of the plaintiff with the Headquarters of the 3rd Operational Zone and that the commander of the 3rd Operational Zone informed [the plaintiff's] commanding officer that the right to receive payment and its amount were not in dispute, and that payment would follow after the funds had been allocated in the budget, because currently there were none; the commanding officer passed this information on to the plaintiff."", 'The foregoing, in the view of this court, represents acknowledgement of the debt within the meaning of section 387 of the Obligations Act, because ... the plaintiff was informed by the person authorised to act on behalf of the respondent that the right to receive payment and its amount were not in dispute and that payment would follow once funds had been allocated in the budget.”', ""14. Following an appeal by the State, on 22 April 2003 the Šibenik County Court (Županijski sud u Šibeniku) quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case. It held that the first-instance court had failed to establish: (a) who in this case was the person authorised to acknowledge the debt on behalf of the Ministry of Defence, and (b) whether the signed and certified lists of the members of the applicant's unit who had carried out demining work, indicating the number of days on which they had done such work and the corresponding amount of daily allowances, processed by the Ministry's Finance Department, in fact constituted requests for payment and therefore an indirect acknowledgment of the debt."", ""15. In the resumed proceedings, the Knin Municipal Court again heard the head of the Split Regional Finance Department of the Ministry of Defence, Brigadier I.P., who testified that the certified lists of servicemen who had carried out demining work constituted requests for payment of the allowances. He further stated that after receiving the lists the Split Regional Finance Department had checked them for accuracy and submitted them together with the requisite form, which in fact constituted a request for payment, to the Central Finance Department of the Ministry of Defence in Zagreb. According to I.P., the Central Finance Department had been authorised to check the lists and could have returned them to the Regional Finance Department if the request for payment of allowances or their amount had been invalid, which they had not done. After the Split Regional Finance Department had submitted the lists and request for payment, the head of the Central Finance Department had informed him that payment would follow once funds had been allocated in the budget for that purpose. Had there been funds, no further action would have been required for the amount requested to be transferred to the applicant's bank account."", '16. In these resumed proceedings, the respondent argued for the first time that, in accordance with the internal regulations of the Ministry of Defence, the person authorised to acknowledge the debt on behalf of the Ministry was the head of its Finance Department before a court action had been brought, and afterwards the head of the Legal Department.', '17. On 18 June 2003 the Municipal Court again ruled in favour of the plaintiff. The relevant part of that judgment read as follows:', '“The Split Regional Finance Department certified the above-mentioned payment lists ... by first checking that the payment and its amount were justified, and then sent it, together with the [requisite] form, namely the payment request form, to the Central Finance Department ... in Zagreb. [That Department], by not returning the lists and the request for payment to the Split Regional Finance Department, accepted them as justified and well-founded. [The Central Finance Department] had to pay the amounts [sought] because the Split Regional Finance Department did not have ready money. After receiving those [lists and] the request for payment, the Central Finance Department had informed the Split Department that payment would follow once funds had been allocated in the State budget, of which the plaintiff was notified and which was explained to him by his commanding officer between the [time the instalments] became due and 21 February 2002.', ""The foregoing, in view of this court, represents acknowledgement of the debt because, by certifying the payment lists with the payment request form and informing the plaintiff thereof as well as of the fact that payment would follow once funds had been allocated in the State budget, the plaintiff, as the creditor, was informed by the respondent, as the debtor, in a clear and unequivocal manner, that the claim at issue, that is, the respondent's debt, was being acknowledged.”"", ""18. Following an appeal by the State, on 8 March 2004 the Šibenik County Court again quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case. It held that from the case file it followed that in accordance with the internal regulations of the Ministry of Defence the person authorised to acknowledge the debt on behalf of the Ministry had been the head of its Finance Department before the action was brought, and afterwards the head of the Legal Department. Therefore, the applicant's commanding officer could not have acknowledged the debt on behalf of the Ministry."", '19. In the resumed proceedings, the Knin Municipal Court, in order to establish who was the person authorised to acknowledge the debt on behalf of the Ministry of Defence, heard the head of the Central Finance Department of the Ministry of Defence, and examined the internal regulations of the Ministry.', ""20. The head of the Ministry's Central Finance Department, I.H., testified that the person authorised to acknowledge the debt on behalf of the Ministry had indeed been the head of its Central Finance Department before the action was brought and the head of its Legal Department afterwards. He also testified that the Split Regional Finance Department's request for payment of daily allowances for demining work had been deemed invalid by a letter of 29 October 1998 because the Decision of the Minister of Defence of 18 September 1995 applied only to the Danube region of Croatia."", '21. On 19 April 2005 the Municipal Court ruled for the third time in favour of the plaintiff. The relevant part of that judgment read as follows:', ""“In line with the internal organisation of [the Ministry], the plaintiff, after [the daily allowances had become due but] payment had not been forthcoming, had been addressing his requests for payment to his immediate superior, that is to the commander of his unit, whereupon he [the commander] had on behalf of the plaintiff been contacting the commander of the 3rd Operational Zone of the Croatian Armed Forces. The commander of the 3rd Operational Zone had been forwarding such requests to the General Staff of the Croatian Armed Forces, which had been replying that the right to receive payment and its amount were being acknowledged, and that payment would follow once funds had been allocated for that purpose. The commander of the 3rd Operational Zone had been sending that information to the commander of the [plaintiff's] unit, who had been notifying the plaintiff of this between June 1998 and May 2002, when the commander of the unit received the last information from the commander of the 3rd Operational Zone."", ""In this way authorised and responsible persons and the department [within the Ministry], in particular the commander of the 40th Engineering Brigade, the commander of the 3rd Operational Zone ... and the competent Regional Finance Department, which certified and acknowledged the amounts of daily allowances as costs of [the Ministry], and in the form of a request for transfer of funds corresponding to the amounts sought ..., submitted them to [the Ministry's Central Finance Department], acknowledged the debt to the plaintiff in a clear and unequivocal manner."", ""Accordingly, the respondent's argument raised in the course of the proceedings that only the head of [the Central Finance Service] or the head of the Legal Department were authorised to acknowledge the debt on behalf of the Ministry, is unfounded because this does not follow from the evidence taken, especially from the documents provided by the respondent, in particular from [the internal regulations of the Ministry of Defence], and [because] the time-limits fixed by the court at the request of the respondent's representative for furnishing evidence [in support of that argument] had expired."", '...', '... from the letter of 29 October 1998 it does not follow that the request of the [Split] Regional Finance Department had been regarded as invalid. [Rather], it was only returned to the [Split Regional Finance] Department for additional examination and checking, and it was suggested that afterwards the Regional Finance Department should decide on the right to receive payment of the allowances at issue.', 'Consequently, in the light of the foregoing, this court indisputably established that authorised persons of the respondent had continued, throughout the entire period in dispute, that is, from the time the claims had become due until May 2002, to inform the plaintiff in a clear and unequivocal manner that the respondent did not dispute [his] right to receive daily allowances in the amount sought. [T]hereby, the respondent acknowledged the debt to the plaintiff within the meaning of section 387 of the Obligations Act, so it is clear that the statutory limitation period did not expire, because its running was interrupted by the acknowledgment of the debt.”', ""22. Following an appeal by the State, on 24 October 2005 the Šibenik County Court reversed the first-instance judgment by dismissing the applicant's action. The relevant part of that judgment read as follows:"", '“On the basis of the evidence taken, the first-instance court established the following relevant facts:', '- that the plaintiff, as a member of the 40th Engineering Brigade of the Croatian Army at the material time, under the command of the 3rd Operational Zone of the Croatian Armed Forces, had occasionally carried out demining work during 1996, 1997 and 1998;', '- that the Decision [of the Minister of Defence of 18 September 1995] had established the right of the ... members of the Croatian Armed Forces to a special daily allowance for demining work;', '- that, in accordance with the [above] Decision, the commander of the 40th Engineering Brigade had been compiling monthly lists of members of the unit who in a particular month had carried out demining work, and had specified the number of days spent on demining work and the corresponding amounts of daily allowances due, and that [those lists] had been certified and co-signed by the commander of the 3rd Operational Zone of the Croatian Armed Forces and submitted to the Split Regional Finance Department of the [Ministry of Defence];', '- that the plaintiff, when the special daily allowances were not paid, on numerous occasions approached the commander of his unit, in accordance with the hierarchical organisation of the [Ministry] ... with a query as to when the payment would be made, and that [his commander], after making enquiries of the command of the 3rd Operational Zone, informed him that his claims were not in dispute... and that payment would follow after funds had been allocated for that purpose.', ""Relying on these facts, the first-instance court found that that the authorised persons of the respondent (the commander of the 40th Engineering Brigade, the commander of the 3rd Operational Zone of the Croatian Armed Forces, as well as the Split Regional Finance Department – which had certified and acknowledged the amount of the plaintiff's special daily allowances as costs of the respondent and had submitted it in the form of a request to the [Central] Finance Department of the [Ministry for transfer of the amount sought]) – had, throughout the entire period in dispute, until May 2002, unequivocally informed the plaintiff that the respondent did not dispute [his] right to receive daily allowances in the amount sought, and that the respondent had thereby acknowledged the debt to the plaintiff within the meaning of section 387 of the Obligations Act, so the statutory limitation period had not expired."", ""However, having regard to the evidence taken before the first-instance court, this court considers the above finding of the first-instance court erroneous. [This is so] because, contrary to the view of the first-instance court, and in accordance with the hierarchical organisation of the [Ministry], the persons authorised to acknowledge the debt on behalf of the [Ministry] were the head of [its Central] Finance Department – which Department, in accordance with the [Ministry's] internal regulations, was authorised to ultimately process and check the requests for payment of the plaintiff's claims submitted by the Split Regional Finance Department (until the action was brought in this case) – and the head of the [Ministry's] Legal Department (during the present proceedings), as the respondent correctly argued ... as well as the other authorised persons who were, in accordance with the hierarchical organisation of the [Ministry], superior to [them]."", ""That being so, and having regard to the facts established in the proceedings before the first-instance court, it does not follow that it was precisely those authorised persons mentioned above who acknowledged the debt by making a declaration to the plaintiff as the creditor, nor that the debt was acknowledged in some indirect manner within the meaning of paragraph 2 of section 387 of the Obligations Act. [O]n the contrary, the request of the Split Regional Finance Department to transfer funds [corresponding to the amounts of daily allowances sought] (which request, together with signed and certified lists compiled by the 40th Engineering Brigade, cannot be considered an acknowledgement of the debt within the meaning of section 387 of the Obligations Act) ... was regarded as invalid by the Central Finance Department and returned to the Split Regional Finance Department for further checking and additional examination (...). [T]herefore, in the instant case the respondent did not acknowledge the plaintiff's claims in any manner prescribed by law that would lead to an interruption of the statutory limitation period. [S]ince the last monthly instalment of special daily allowances had become due in April 1998, and the action in this case had been brought on 21 May 2001, the [respondent's] plea that the claims at issue were statute-barred, ... is well-founded because the three-year statutory limitation period set forth in section 131 of the Labour Act in respect of the plaintiff's claims, which arose from his employment relationship with the respondent, had expired in the instant case.”"", '23. The applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint against the second-instance judgment, alleging violations of his constitutional rights to equality before the courts and to a fair hearing. He argued that his claim for special daily allowances for demining work was not statute-barred, because the Ministry of Defence had on several occasions acknowledged the debt, thereby interrupting the running of the statutory limitation period, and that the Šibenik County Court had not relied on any provision of substantive law which would justify dismissal of his action.', ""24. On 10 April 2008 the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) dismissed the applicant's constitutional complaint and served its decision on his representative on 8 May 2008."", '25.

The Constitutional Court nevertheless allowed the constitutional complaint, finding violations of Articles 14, 19(2) and 26 of the Constitution, on which the complainant had not relied, and quashed the contested decisions. In so deciding it held as follows:"", '“Therefore, a constitutional complaint cannot be based on either of the constitutional provisions stated [by the complainant in her constitutional complaint].', 'However, the present case concerns, as will be explained further, a specific legal situation as a result of which this court, despite [its] finding that there are not, and cannot be, violations of the constitutional rights explicitly relied on by the complainant, considers that there are circumstances which warrant quashing [the contested] decisions.', '...', 'Namely, it is evident from the constitutional complaint and the case file that there have been violations of [constitutional] rights, in particular those guaranteed by Article 14 (equality, equality before the law), Article 19 paragraph 2 (the guarantee of judicial review of decisions of state and other public authorities) and Article 26 (equality before the courts and other state or public authorities) of the Constitution ...”', '29. Section 387 of the Obligations Act (Zakon o obveznim odnosima, Official Gazette of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia nos. 29/1978, 39/1985 and 57/1989, and the Official Gazette of the Republic of Croatia no. 53/1991 with subsequent amendments) provided as follows:', 'STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS', 'GENERAL PROVISIONS', 'General rule', 'Section 360', '“(1) The right to request performance of an obligation shall be extinguished on the expiration of a statutory limitation period.', '(2) ...', '(3) A court shall not take a statutory limitation period into account of its own motion if the debtor did not plead it.”', 'INTERRUPTION OF A STATUTORY LIMITATION PERIOD', 'Acknowledgement of a debt', 'Section 387', '“(1) The running of a statutory limitation period shall be interrupted when the debtor acknowledges his or her debt.', '(2) A debt may be acknowledged not only by a statement [that is, a declaration] to the creditor but also in an indirect manner, such as by making a payment, paying interest or providing security...”', '30. In interpreting section 387 of the Obligations Act the Supreme Court has consistently held that acknowledgement of a debt capable of interrupting a statutory limitation period, regardless of whether it has been made in a direct or indirect manner, has to be done unequivocally and by the persons authorised to act on behalf of the debtor (see, for example, decisions nos. Rev 3053/1999-2 of 23 January 2002, Rev 271/03-2 of 12 April 2005, Rev 347/04-2 of 21 June 2005, Revt 97/03-2 of 22 December 2005, and Revt 156/2006-2 of 29 November 2006).', ""31. On 25 May 2000 the Supreme Court delivered a judgment, no. Rev 1401/1999-2, in a case in which the plaintiffs sued the State seeking payment of unpaid salaries for the period during which they had been receiving medical treatment and held captive by the enemy, respectively. The question arose whether the letter of the Ministry of Defence, in particular, the General Staff of the Croatian Armed Forces, of 9 February 1998, confirming that the plaintiffs had been members of their military unit and had appeared on its payroll but had not collected their salaries in the above-mentioned period, constituted acknowledgment of the debt. The lower courts dismissed the plaintiffs' action, finding that the letter had not constituted acknowledgement of a debt capable of interrupting the statutory limitation period. In dismissing an appeal on points of law (revizija) by the plaintiffs and upholding the lower courts' judgments, the Supreme Court held as follows:"", ""“From [the letter of 9 February 1998] it only follows that the plaintiffs were members of a certain unit at a certain time and that they did not receive a salary for that period. Such [a letter] cannot per se constitute an acknowledgment of the debt within the meaning of section 366 of the Obligations Act and interruption of the statutory limitation period. That is a general statement which cannot be considered as an acknowledgment of the debt. The ... letter indicates that the debt may exist but it does not constitute an acknowledgement by the debtor that the debt [indeed] exists, that is, acknowledgment that the debtor has [an obligation] to settle the debt or that the debtor will settle it. The statement of facts by the debtor, on the basis of which it could be concluded that the debt exists, does not constitute acknowledgment of the debt [capable of] interrupting the statutory limitation period. For the acknowledgement of the debt to result in the interruption of the statutory limitation period, it has to be explicit and specific so that the debtor's will to settle the existing debt is unequivocally expressed.”"", ""32. On 27 September 2007 the Supreme Court delivered a decision, no. Rev-427/2006-2, in a case where the plaintiff company sued the State seeking payment of a certain amount of money. The question arose whether a letter of 15 May 1996 signed on behalf of the Finance Department of the Ministry of Defence by the head of its Bookkeeping Division informing the plaintiff that its claim had been recorded with the Ministry's Finance Department but that funds had not been allocated to satisfy that claim, as well as a letter of 6 November 1997 signed on behalf of the Finance Department of the Ministry of Defence by the head of its Payment Operations Division notifying the plaintiff that the Ministry would settle its debt by transferring the money to the plaintiff company's giro account upon transfer of the funds to the Ministry from the State budget, amounted to acknowledgment of the debt. The lower courts ruled in favour of the plaintiff, finding that the above-mentioned letters had constituted acknowledgement of a debt capable of interrupting the statutory limitation period. The Supreme Court allowed an appeal on points of law by the State, quashed the lower courts' judgments and remitted the case. In so deciding the Supreme Court held as follows:"", '“In the contested judgments no reasons were given for the finding that the head of the Bookkeeping Division, who had signed the letter of 15 May 1996, would be authorised to acknowledge the debt (even assuming that the mere recording of the claim and its amount with the Finance Department of the Ministry of Defence could be considered an acknowledgment of the debt).', ""... the letter of 6 November 1997 [containing] the statement that its [the Ministry's] debt would be settled by transferring the money to the [plaintiff company's] giro account, but without establishing the amount of the debt that the respondent considered well-founded, and without establishing whether ... the head of the Payment Operations Division (who signed the letter) was authorised to give such a statement, cannot, at least for the time being, be considered an acknowledgment of the debt."", ""In this court's view, an acknowledgement of a debt within the meaning of section 387 paragraph 2 of the Obligations Act can be made by the debtor personally or through an authorised person (if the debtor is a legal entity). It follows from the foregoing that declarations of unauthorised persons acknowledging a debt on behalf of a debtor cannot produce for the debtor any legal effects of a valid acknowledgement of a debt. It also has to be noted that an acknowledgement of a debt must not be contrary to peremptory norms [jus cogens]."", 'For these reasons, until it is established whether, and on the basis of which legal document, the head of the Bookkeeping Division and the head of the Payment Operations Division were persons authorised to acknowledge the debt, there can be no conclusions as to the legal significance of the letters of 15 May 1996 and 6 November 1997.”', '33. According to the views expressed in Croatian legal doctrine, a right is not extinguished by the expiration of a statutory limitation period. Rather, the creditor only loses the right to seek its enforcement through the courts. Therefore, a debtor remains a debtor even after a statutory limitation period has expired. For that reason, if a debtor pays a creditor after the expiry of a statutory limitation period, he or she cannot claim the amount paid back (on account of unjust enrichment) because he or she paid an existing debt', '34.

Mr lives at Höchst in Vorarlberg.', '9. On 7 November 1987 a police car observed the applicant driving on the motorway at speeds considerably in excess of the maximum speed limits. At 14.28 hours and 53 seconds he was recorded travelling at 150 kilometres per hour on a stretch of road where a sign indicated the limit to be 100 k.p.h. Thirty-one seconds later he was recorded travelling at 67 k.p.h. over the general 130 k.p.h. limit for motorways. The applicant alleged that as the vehicle he was driving was an extremely powerful one, it was difficult for the driver to realise at what speed it was actually travelling.', 'On 6 December 1987 the Tyrol regional police authority (Landesgendarmeriekommando) drew up a report and imposed two separate fines on the applicant for speeding.', '10. On 16 November 1988, after administrative proceedings which involved an examination of the reporting police officers (Meldungsleger) in the absence of the applicant, the Imst district authority (Bezirkshauptmannschaft) found the applicant guilty of two speeding offences under the Road Traffic Act (Straßenverkehrsordnung - see paragraph 17 below). Pursuant to section 99(3) of that Act (see paragraph 18 below) the applicant was fined 4,000 and 6,000 Austrian schillings (ATS), with imprisonment of eight and ten days respectively in default of payment.', '11. The applicant appealed to the Tyrol regional government (Amt der Landesregierung), questioning the precision of the police methods for measuring vehicle speed. He further contended that, having admitted driving at a high speed on a given stretch of road, he should not have been punished under two different provisions, which had resulted in an excessively high fine. He therefore requested that the incident be treated as a single offence and the fine reduced accordingly.', ""12. On 22 December 1988 the Tyrol regional government reduced the fines to ATS 2,000 and 4,000 respectively, and the penalties in default to four and seven days' imprisonment. The appellate authority accepted, among other considerations, that speed-measuring techniques could not achieve total accuracy. The submission that only one offence had been committed was dismissed on the ground that two different provisions had been infringed at two different moments in time."", '13. Mr Palaoro then applied to the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof). Relying on Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, he complained that the administrative criminal procedure did not guarantee a fair trial. He argued that he should have been given an oral hearing and the opportunity to examine the witnesses - that is to say the police officers - in person. This would have allowed him to establish that the measuring methods used by the police were often defective. He further criticised the ""principle of cumulative imposition of penalties"" (Kumulationsprinzip), by virtue of which the same criminal behaviour could be punished under different provisions. In this context he referred to Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 ((P7-4) to the Convention.', ""14. On 10 March 1989 the Constitutional Court declared the applicant's complaint partly inadmissible as raising questions concerning the application of ordinary law; in so far as the complaint did raise issues of constitutional law, the Constitutional Court, referring to its own case-law on the Convention, found that the application did not have sufficient prospects of success. Among other provisions, Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal Constitution was applied (see paragraph 20 below)."", '15. On 19 April 1989 Mr Palaoro requested the Constitutional Court to send his file to the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof) and on 15 June 1989 he submitted his grounds of appeal to the latter. He stressed that he should have had the opportunity to examine the witnesses directly and that he should not have been punished twice for what he considered to be a single offence.', 'No public hearing was requested.', ""16. On 25 October 1989 the applicant's appeal was dismissed by the Administrative Court pursuant to section 42(1) of the Administrative Court Act (Verwaltungsgerichtshofsgesetz - see paragraph 24 below). It noted that a formal confrontation with a witness was to be ordered only where it was necessary in the special circumstances of a given case: there was no general right to put questions in person to a witness (section 47 of the Administrative Criminal Justice Act). The Administrative Court upheld the respondent authority's grounds for dismissing the applicant's second complaint (see paragraph 12 above)."", '17. Section 20(2) of the Road Traffic Act 1960 sets the maximum speed limit on motorways at 130 kilometres per hour.', 'Section 52(A)(10)(a) of the same Act prohibits travelling in excess of the speed limit indicated on a road sign.', '18. Under section 99(3)(a) of the Road Traffic Act, breaches of its provisions are punishable with a fine of up to ATS 10,000, with imprisonment of up to two weeks in default of payment.', '19.

Exceptions may be prescribed by law.""', '20. By Article 144 para. 1 of the Federal Constitution, the Constitutional Court, when an application (Beschwerde) is made to it, has to determine whether an administrative decision (Bescheid) has infringed a right guaranteed by the Constitution or has applied regulations (Verordnung) contrary to the law, a law contrary to the Constitution or an international treaty incompatible with Austrian law.', 'Article 144 para. 2 provides:', '""Up to the time of the hearing the Constitutional Court may by means of a decision (Beschluß) decline to accept a case for adjudication if it does not have sufficient prospects of success or if it cannot be expected that the judgment will clarify an issue of constitutional law.

If it considers that reasons which have not yet been notified to one of the parties might be decisive for ruling on [one of these complaints] ..., it must hear the parties on this point and adjourn the proceedings if necessary.""', '24. Section 42(1) of the same Act states that, save as otherwise provided, the Administrative Court must either dismiss an application as ill-founded or quash the impugned decision.', 'By section 42(2),', '""The Administrative Court shall quash the impugned decision if it is unlawful', '1. by reason of its content, [or]', '2. because the respondent authority lacked jurisdiction, [or]', '3. on account of a breach of procedural rules, in that', '(a) the respondent authority has made findings of fact which are, in an important respect, contradicted by the case file, or', '(b) the facts require further investigation on an important point, or', '(c) procedural rules have been disregarded, compliance with which could have led to a different decision by the respondent authority.""', '25.

In a judgment of 14 October 1987 (G 181/86) the Constitutional Court held:', '""From the fact that it has been necessary to extend the reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention to cover the procedural safeguards of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, because of the connection between those two provisions (art. 5, art. 6), it follows that, conversely, the limited review (die (bloß) nachprüfende Kontrolle) carried out by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court is insufficient in respect of criminal penalties within the meaning of the Convention that are not covered by the reservation.""', '27. Pursuant to Article 129 of the Federal Constitution, administrative courts called ""independent administrative tribunals"" (Unabhängige Verwaltungssenate) were set up in the Länder with effect from 1 January 1991.

On 8 May 2000 the investigating judge at the İstanbul State Security Court ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention.', '8. On 19 June 2000 a bill of indictment was filed against the applicant and four other persons with the İstanbul State Security Court, accusing them of forming a criminal profit-making organisation and of being involved in incidents of murder, extortion and fraud.', '9. On 30 January 2003 the first-instance court acquitted the applicant and the other accused of the former charge on the ground that the mental elements of the crime had not been established on their parts.

On 20 December 2004 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court, noting that the latter had erroneously acquitted the applicant and his co-accused of the charge concerned.

THE NETHERLANDS,4,Inadmissible,,"['The applicant, Curtis Francis Warren, is a United Kingdom national who was born in 1963 and is currently serving a prison sentence in the Netherlands. He is represented before the Court by Mr J. Jahae, a lawyer practising in Amsterdam.', 'The applicant was placed in pre-trial detention (voorlopige hechtenis) on 24 October 1996. The criminal proceedings brought against the applicant – in which he stood accused of, inter alia, leading a criminal organisation, importation of about 317 kilograms of cocaine and possession of XTC, marihuana and weapons – came to an end on 16 November 1999, when the Supreme Court (Hoge Raad) confirmed the judgment handed down by the Court of Appeal (gerechtshof) of The Hague on 22 April 1999 in which the applicant had been sentenced to twelve years’ imprisonment.', 'The applicant, who had initially been detained in an ordinary remand centre (huis van bewaring), was transferred – on the basis of a report from the Detainee Intelligence Information Service / National Criminal Intelligence Service (Gedetineerde Recherche Informatiepunt / Centrale Recherche Informatiedienst; “GRIP/CRI”) according to which there were indications that the applicant would seek ways to escape – on 23 December 1996 to the National Segregation Unit (Landelijke Afzonderingsafdeling) in a Maastricht detention facility.', 'On 4 February 1997, on the basis of further GRIP information and the advice of the special selection board of the maximum-security institution (Extra Beveiligde Inrichting; “EBI”) – the Minister of Justice decided to place the applicant in the pre-trial detention unit in the EBI which is part of the Nieuw Vosseveld Penitentiary Complex in Vught. According to this further GRIP information, set out in an official report (ambtsbericht) dated 23 December 1996, the applicant represented an increased security risk in that in case of an escape, outside aid with use of brute force, violence against persons and a hostage-taking situation could not be excluded. In this connection, it was pointed out that he was a member of a criminal organisation, that various kinds of firearms and hand grenades had been found when members of this organisation had been arrested, that some members – including the applicant’s right-hand man – were still at large, that the organisation was said to dispose of explosives and heavy arms such as rocket launchers, and that in the course of previous arrests of members of the organisation in the United Kingdom, one person escaped when the police transport was blocked by a vehicle. It was further pointed out that the authorities of the United Kingdom, where the applicant was to serve a 23 years’ prison sentence, had filed a request for his extradition.', 'The applicant’s detention in the EBI was reviewed and prolonged by the Minister every six months.', 'On 15 September 1999, the applicant was attacked in the EBI by another detainee who was lethally injured by the applicant in the ensuing fight. Criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant which ended on 4 March 2003 when the Supreme Court confirmed the judgment given by the ‘s-Hertogenbosch Court of Appeal on 8 February 2002, in which it had rejected the applicant’s plea of self-defence, convicted him of manslaughter and imposed a sentence of four years’ imprisonment.', 'By letter of 17 July 2001, the applicant was informed that the Minister of Justice had decided to extend his placement in the EBI once again. This decision was based on the contents of the official report of 23 December 1996, the possibility of the applicant’s extradition to the United Kingdom where – according to the applicant’s own statement – he would still have to serve a fifteen years’ prison sentence, and a further official report of 16 August 1999, according to which there were plans to liberate the applicant from detention, involving the deployment of a helicopter by a member of the criminal organisation who had escaped on 10 June 1999 from a Netherlands detention facility by way of a well prepared escape plan. Further pointing out that the applicant had been sentenced to twelve years’ imprisonment and that he had been convicted in first instance in another set of criminal proceedings in connection with the death of a co-detainee to four years’ imprisonment, the Minister considered that it appeared from the above that the applicant’s escape would give rise to great social upheaval. Since, moreover, the EBI special selection board – having noted the above as well as the grave concern in society and public opinion concerning the crimes committed by the applicant – had advised the Minister to prolong the applicant’s detention in the EBI, the Minister had taken a decision to this effect.', 'The applicant filed an appeal against this decision with the Appeals Board (beroepscommissie) of the Council for the Administration of Criminal Justice and Protection of Juveniles (Raad voor Strafrechtstoepassing en Jeugdbescherming). In this appeal, he challenged the necessity to prolong his placement in the EBI, arguing inter alia that it had been based on outdated information, that his conduct in the EBI had been correct throughout, that he had not caused the fight with the co-detainee, and that there were no reasons for holding that he would harbour any escape plans. Although he did make a general reference to the findings of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) as regards the EBI regime, he did not present any arguments about the manner in which this regime would have affected him personally. He further did not raise any complaints, either in form or substance, under Article 3 or Article 8 of the Convention in relation to his personal conditions of detention in the EBI.', 'On 29 November 2001, the Appeals Board dismissed the appeal. It noted that the applicant had been sentenced to a lengthy prison sentence for very serious crimes giving rise to grave concern in society and public opinion, and that – in addition – he had been sentenced in first instance to four years’ imprisonment in relation to a fight in the EBI with a fatal outcome. It therefore considered that the applicant, in the event of an escape, would pose an unacceptable risk to society in terms of severe disturbance of public order, the risk of escape being, as such, of lesser importance, i.e. the situation provided for in Article 6 under b. of the Regulation selection, placement and transfer of detainees (Regeling selectie, plaatsing en overplaatsing van gedetineerden) of 15 August 2000. The Appeals Board further concluded that, having found no facts or circumstances militating against a continuation of the applicant’s stay in the EBI, the decision to prolong his placement was lawful and that, weighing up all the interests involved, it could not be considered as unreasonable or unjust.', 'On 15 April 2002, the applicant was transferred to a prison with an ordinary regime in Maastricht.', 'An overview of the relevant domestic law and practice is given in the Court’s judgment of 4 February 2003 in the case of Van der Ven v. the Netherlands (no. 50901/99, §§ 26-35, ECHR 2003-II).']",[],[],[],[],[],[]

On 26 February 2002 the applicant requested one of the Deputy Presidents of the Supreme Court to initiate supervisory review proceedings in his case before the Supreme Court, arguing that the lower courts wrongly assessed the evidence in the case and failed to apply the domestic law correctly.', ""10. Apparently in response to that request, on 11 June 2002 the Deputy President of the Supreme Court decided to initiate supervisory review proceedings in respect of the decisions of the lower courts in the applicant's case.

From the documents submitted by the applicant it follows that he received a copy of the request of 11 June 2002 only on 27 November 2002, that is already after the supervisory review hearing in his case.', ""13. The applicant explained that once the main set of criminal proceedings was over, the lawyer in question had ceased to represent him. He submitted a copy of the lawyer's letter dated 29 January 2006, in which the lawyer had confirmed the absence of any agreement to act on the applicant's behalf in the supervisory review proceedings of 19 November 2002. The lawyer also confirmed the receipt of the notification of 5 November 2002, along with a copy of the request of 11 June 2002, but stated that he had been unable to react to these documents for lack of authority."", '14. The parties agreed that the applicant asked to attend the supervisory review hearing in person.', '15. The applicant submitted a copy of that request. The request was made on 10 November 2002 but was not received by the Supreme Court until 26 November 2002.', ""16. On 19 November 2002 the Supreme Court, in the presence of the prosecutor and one of the other co-defendants' lawyers, examined the arguments of the Deputy President's supervisory review appeal and amended the sentence by changing the charges of aggravated kidnapping to aggravated deprivation of liberty.

Shortly thereafter they applied for asylum.', 'On 13 November 2000 the first applicant married an Irish national. On 21 November 2000 she applied for a residence permit on the basis of her marriage. She did not therefore pursue the asylum application. The marriage subsequently failed and the first applicant separated from her husband. Accordingly, on 19 July 2004 the Department of Justice, Equality and Law reform revoked her leave to remain as she was no longer residing with her spouse and proposed to deport her. The Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform (“the Minister”) issued a deportation order in December 2004.', 'On 10 November 2005 the applicants re-applied for asylum. The first applicant was interviewed on 23 November 2005. The application for asylum was based on the following claims. The first applicant claimed that she was ill in her late teens and was sent to live with the family of a native doctor (“E”) in or around 1990. Thereafter, she was effectively detained by that family. E cut her with a blade and rubbed charcoal into her wounds and six months later began raping her. E threatened to kill the first applicant’s father when the latter protested. Her father later died in 1997. She gave birth to her son in 1992 and to the second applicant in 1999. In November 1999 E died. Since E’s brother wished to marry the first applicant, the applicants escaped from E’s funeral. They fled to Ibadan. Following threats, they left for Lagos and, subsequently, they left for Ireland, via France, leaving the first applicant’s son with her mother. The first applicant claims that she was subjected to Female Genital Mutilation (“FGM”) against her will prior to the birth of the second applicant. She feared that, on return, that she would be kidnapped and re-detained by E’s family and that the second applicant would be subjected to FGM. The first applicant claims that internal re-location is not an option and that the Nigerian police would not assist her.', 'By letter of 2 December 2005 the applicants were informed that the Refugee Applications Commissioner (“RAC”) was recommending that they not be declared refugees.

THE UNITED KINGDOM,4,Inadmissible,Giovanni Bonello;Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Nebojša Vučinić;Nicolas Bratza;Päivi Hirvelä,"['The applicants, Mr Takahashi Shimidzu and Mr Andrew Ivan Berllaque, are British nationals who were born in 1982 and 1965 respectively. They live in Gibraltar. Mr Shimidzu was represented before the Court by Mr D. Hughes, a barrister practising in Gibraltar; Mr Berllaque by Mr S. Bossino, a barrister also practising in Gibraltar. They were each assisted by Ms J. Simor and Mr C. Nicholls Q.C., counsel.', 'The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms E. Willmott of the Foreign Commonwealth Office.', 'The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', 'On 1–3 April 2003, the first applicant, Mr Shimidzu, was tried before a judge and jury in the Supreme Court of Gibraltar on charges of assault occasioning bodily harm, obstructing a police officer and resisting a police officer in the execution of his duty. He was acquitted by the jury after a submission of no case to answer was rejected by the trial judge. When Mr Shimidzu’s counsel made application for costs after the trial, the Chief Justice said:', '“But, Mr Hughes, you know that you can’t get costs. I would grant them, if I could, you know that the law is against you.”', 'When counsel persisted the Chief Justice said:', '“You keep trying, Mr Hughes, I understand why you keep trying, but in my opinion it is an unjust system, which says, you can award costs against the defendant on conviction, you cannot award costs in the Supreme Court on acquittal. It is not a just system, but it’s not something that I can get round, however much I would enjoy trying to weave it. I just cannot, and it is a matter for the Legislature, but it is a matter perhaps that the Legislature ought to be invited to give their attention to.”', 'On 13 – 16 October 2003, the second applicant, Mr Berllaque, was tried before the same court on charges of rape. At the conclusion of the prosecution case, the trial judge upheld a defence submission of no case to answer and, on his direction, the jury acquitted the second applicant.', 'Mr Shimidzu made a motion to challenge the refusal to award costs. This was referred by the Supreme Court to the Court of Appeal of Gibraltar on 30 September 2003.', 'Mr Berllaque was given leave to intervene in the proceedings before the Court of Appeal in Mr Shimidzu’s case. Before the Court of Appeal, the applicants argued, inter alia, that the relevant provision of Gibraltarian criminal law, section 232 of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance, violated the Gibraltar Constitution. They relied on sections 1 and 8 of the Constitution. In respect of section 8, they argued that section 232 violated their right to a fair hearing and was a violation of the presumption of innocence. It appears that it was accepted before the Court of Appeal that while section 232 (2) allowed the Supreme Court to order the prosecution to pay costs to an acquitted defendant, all defendants before the Supreme Court would be unable to fulfil the conditions laid down in section 232 (2) since in order for a person to be committed for trial they would have to be detained in custody or bound by recognizance (see section 232 (2) (a) below). The Court of Appeal unanimously rejected the applicant’s submissions in respect of the presumption of innocence and the prohibition on discrimination contained in section 1. By a majority, it found that section 232 violated the right to a fair hearing contained in section 8.', 'The Attorney-General for Gibraltar appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. On 28 June 2005, the Privy Council allowed the appeal, holding that section 232, while unattractive and lacking even-handedness, did not violate the Constitution. This unattractiveness was relieved by the fact that the subsection (1) of the section, allowing the prosecution to claim costs from a convicted defendant, was a dead letter. The Privy Council, relying on this Court’s rulings in Masson and Van Zon v. the Netherlands, judgment of 28 September 1995, Series A no. 327A, §§ 48-49 and Lutz v. Germany, judgment of 25 August 1987, Series A no. 123, § 59, found that Article 6 of the Convention did not require a discretion to award costs to an acquitted defendant. While an even-handed discretionary power to order reimbursement of costs incurred by a successful prosecutor or a successful defendant would be desirable, it was not correct to find, as the Court of Appeal had, that such a power was universal among Western European countries. The principle of equality of arms sought to ensure that a defendant did not suffer an unfair procedural disadvantage but did not require that the situations of the prosecutor and defendant should be assimilated and neither applicant had been able to show any procedural disadvantage in the conduct of the trial from the inability to recover his costs. In respect of the presumption of innocence (and referring to this Court’s findings in Lutz, cited above; Leutscher v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II; and Minelli v. Switzerland, judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 62), the Privy Council found that where the domestic court had a discretion to order costs against a prosecutor in favour of an acquitted defendant, the court should not refuse to make such an order in terms which threw doubt on the presumption of innocence. However, where domestic law granted no discretion and did not permit the making of an order, the failure to make such an order could not be rationally understood as throwing doubt on the defendant’s innocence.', 'Section 1 of the Gibraltar Constitution Order 1969 (now superseded by a 2006 Order), in so far as it is relevant, provided as follows:', '“It is hereby recognised and declared that in Gibraltar there have existed and shall continue to exist without discrimination by reason of race, place of origin, political opinions, colour, creed or sex, but subject to respect for the rights and freedoms of others and for the public interest, each and all of the following human rights and fundamental freedoms, namely―', '(a) the right of the individual to life, liberty, security of the person and the protection of the law; ...', '...and the provisions of this Chapter shall have effect for the purpose of affording protection to the said rights and freedoms subject to such limitations of that protection as are contained in those provisions, being limitations designed to ensure that the enjoyment of the said rights and freedoms by any individual does not prejudice the rights and freedoms of others or the public interest.”', 'Section 8 (1) and (2), insofar as they are relevant, provided as follows:', '““Provisions to secure protection of law', '8.(1) If any person is charged with a criminal offence, then, unless the charge is withdrawn, the case shall be afforded a fair hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial court established by law.', '(2) Every person who is charged with a criminal offence ―', '(a) shall be presumed to be innocent until he is proved or has pleaded guilty;', '...', '(c) shall be given adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence;', '(d) shall be permitted to defend himself in person or, at his own expense, by a legal representative of his own choice or, where so prescribed, by a legal representative provided at the public expense...”', 'Sections 6 and 7 also provided protection against deprivation of property.', 'Part XI of the Ordinance governs costs and other ancillary orders in criminal cases.', 'Section 229, governing the award of costs by Magistrates’ Courts, so far as it is relevant, provides:', '“(1) On the summary trial of an information the magistrates’ court shall have power to make such order as to costs ―', '(a) on conviction, to be paid by the defendant to the prosecutor; and', '(b) on dismissal of the information, to be paid by the prosecutor to the defendant, as it thinks just and reasonable:', 'Provided that ―', '(i) where under the conviction the court orders payment of any sum as a fine, penalty, forfeiture or compensation, and the sum so ordered to be paid does not exceed £1, the court shall not order the defendant to pay any costs under this subsection unless in any particular case it thinks fit to do so;', '(ii) and where the defendant is a child or young person, the amount of the costs ordered to be paid by the defendant himself under this subsection shall not exceed the amount of any fine ordered to be so paid.', '(2) The court shall specify in the conviction, or, as the case may be, the order of dismissal, the amount of any costs that it orders to be paid under subsection (1).', '(3) Where examining justices determine not to commit the accused for trial on the ground that the evidence is not sufficient to put him upon his trial, and are of opinion that the charge was not made in good faith, they may order the prosecutor to pay the whole or any part of the costs incurred in or about the defence.”', 'At the relevant time, section 232, governing the award of costs by the Supreme Court, provided:', '“(1) The Supreme Court may, if it thinks fit, order any person convicted before it to pay the whole or any part of the costs incurred in or about the prosecution and conviction, including any proceedings before the examining justices.', '(2) Where any person is acquitted on indictment, then, if ―', '(a) he has not been committed to or detained in custody or bound by recognizance to answer the indictment; or', '(b) the indictment is for an offence under the Merchandise Marks Ordinance;', '(c) the indictment is by a private prosecutor for the publication of a defamatory libel or for any corrupt practice within the meaning of the House of Assembly Ordinance,', 'the Supreme Court may order the prosecutor to pay the whole or any part of the costs incurred in or about the defence, including any proceedings before the examining justices.', '(3) Costs payable under this section shall be taxed by the Registrar.”', 'Section 231(1) was repealed by the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Ordinance 2005 with effect from 22 December 2005.']",[],[],[],[],[],[]

Valticos,"['6. Mrs Ingrid Hoffmann is an Austrian citizen residing in Gaissau. She is a housewife.', '7. In 1980 Mrs Hoffmann - then Miss Berger - married Mr S., a telephone technician. At that time, they were both Roman Catholics.', 'Two children were born to them, a son, Martin, in 1980 and a daughter, Sandra, in 1982. They were baptised as Roman Catholics.', '8. The applicant left the Roman Catholic Church to become a Jehovah’s Witness.', '9. On 17 October 1983 the applicant instituted divorce proceedings against Mr S. She left him in August or September 1984 while the proceedings were still pending, taking the children with her.', 'The divorce was pronounced on 12 June 1986.', '10. Following their separation, both the applicant and Mr S. applied to the Innsbruck District Court (Bezirksgericht) to be granted parental rights (Elternrechte) over the children.', 'Mr S. submitted that if the children were left in the applicant’s care, there was a risk that they would be brought up in a way that would do them harm. He claimed that the educational principles of the religious denomination to which the applicant belonged were hostile to society, in that they discouraged all intercourse with non-members, all expressions of patriotism (such as singing the national anthem) and religious tolerance. All this would lead to the children’s social isolation. In addition, the Jehovah’s Witnesses’ ban on blood transfusions might give rise to situations in which their life or their health was endangered.', 'With regard to the son, Martin, Mr S. noted that he would eventually have to refuse to perform military service or even the civilian service exacted in its stead.', 'The applicant claimed that she was better placed to take care of the children, being in a position to devote herself to them completely, and as a mother better able to provide them with the necessary family environment. She alleged that Mr S. did not even provide for their maintenance, as he was both legally and morally bound to do. She acknowledged, however, that she intended to bring the children up in her own faith.', 'The youth office of the Innsbruck District Authority (Bezirkshauptmannschaft, Abteilung Jugendfürsorge) expressed a preference for granting parental rights to the applicant; it referred to, inter alia, the expert opinion of a child psychologist.', '11. By decision of 8 January 1986, the District Court granted parental rights to the applicant and denied them to Mr S.', 'According to its reasoning, only the children’s well-being fell to be considered. The material living conditions of both parents were such that either of them would be able to take proper care of the children; however, the father would need his mother’s help. The children had stronger emotional ties with the applicant, having lived with her for a year and a half already, and separating them from her might cause them psychological harm. It followed that it was preferable to leave the children with the mother.', 'The District Court further observed:', '""As against this, it has been stated by the children’s father, essentially as his only argument, that Ingrid S.’s membership of the religious community of the Jehovah’s Witnesses has serious detrimental effects on the children. As to this, it ought to be made clear right away that in no case are parents’ religious convictions as such a relevant criterion in deciding on parental rights and duties pursuant to Article 177 para. 2 of the Civil Code. These rights cannot be refused to a parent or withheld from him for the sole reason that he or she belongs to a religious minority.', 'However, in the concrete case it needs to be examined whether the mother’s religious convictions have a negative influence on her upbringing of the children which should be taken into account and whether their well-being is impaired as a result. It appears in particular that Ingrid S. would not allow blood transfusions to be given to her children; that for herself she rejects communal celebration of such customary holidays as Christmas or Easter; that the children experience a certain tension in relation to an environment which does not correspond to their faith; and that their integration in societal institutions such as kindergarten and school is made more difficult. However, the father’s apprehension of complete social isolation as a result of the mother’s religion does not appear well-founded in the light of the established facts. In addition, no possible dangers to either child’s development have appeared in the course of the establishment of the facts.', 'It is true that the facts adduced (blood transfusions, holidays, impaired social integration) are in principle capable of having detrimental effects on the children. This point must now be examined in the context of the particular case. It appears first of all that the father’s argument that Martin and Sandra would be exposed in an emergency to serious danger to their life and health by the refusal of a blood transfusion is not of decisive importance. In the absence of parental permission for a medically necessary blood transfusion to either child, such permission can be replaced by a judicial decision in accordance with Article 176 of the Civil Code (compare the decision of the Innsbruck Regional Court (Landesgericht) of 3 July 1979, 4R 128/79). In any case, according to this legal provision, anyone can apply to the court for an order that is necessary to ensure the welfare of the child when the parent endangers it by his conduct. In view of this possibility of applying to the court, which is available at all times, no danger to the children need be inferred from the mother’s attitude to blood transfusions.', 'As for Ingrid S.’s rejection of holidays, notice must be taken of her express agreement to allow the father to take the children on such occasions and celebrate them with the children as he sees fit. The mother’s religious convictions thus do not deprive Martin and Sandra of the possibility of celebrating these holidays in the usual way, so that no detriment to the children can be found in this regard either.', 'Of the reservations with regard to the mother’s upbringing of the children resulting from her religion the only remaining one of any significance is the circumstance that Martin and Sandra will in later life experience somewhat more difficulty in finding their way in social groups as a result of the religious precepts of the Jehovah’s Witnesses and will find themselves to some extent in a special position. However, the court cannot consider this so detrimental to the children’s welfare that they should for that reason not be entrusted to their mother, with whom they have such a close psychological relationship and to whose care they are accustomed. Careful consideration must lead to the conclusion that in spite of more difficult social integration, as discussed above, it appears to be more in the interest of the children’s welfare to grant parental rights to the mother than to transfer them to the father.""', '12. Mr S. appealed against the above decision to the Innsbruck Regional Court (Landesgericht).', '13. The Regional Court rejected the appeal by decision of 14 March 1986. Its grounds for so doing were the following:', '""The main thrust of the appeal is to argue that the decision of the first-instance court is incompatible with the children’s welfare in view of the mother’s membership of the religious community of the Jehovah’s Witnesses. In this connection, the appellant discusses the criteria and objectives peculiar to that religious community and the resulting social attitudes, which are in his opinion wrong; it follows, in his view, that both children are bound to suffer harm if the parental rights and duties are assigned to the mother, and in particular that they may be forced into social isolation removed from reality.', 'The appellant’s line of argument in this regard is unsound. The Jehovah’s Witnesses, formerly known as Serious Bible Students, a community based upon their own interpretation of the Bible, are not outlawed in Austria; it may therefore be assumed that their objectives neither infringe the law nor offend morality (see Article 16 of the Basic Law in conjunction with Article 9 (art. 9) of the European Convention on Human Rights). Therefore, the mother’s membership of that religious community cannot of itself constitute a danger to the children’s welfare ...', 'Admittedly, the mother’s religion will in all probability affect the children’s care and upbringing, and they may come to experience a certain tension in relation to an environment which does not correspond to their faith. The first-instance court has already dealt at length with part of the appellant’s arguments that relate thereto and has given detailed and conclusive reasons why the father’s objections against assigning the parental rights and duties to the mother cannot in the final instance be decisive. The new points raised on appeal - relating to a lack of understanding of democracy and a lack of subordination to the State - cannot cast doubt on the first-instance decision as regards the children’s welfare; it suffices in this respect to recall the legal recognition of the religious community of the Jehovah’s Witnesses, which meant, contrary to the appellant’s allegation, that the first-instance court did not in fact need to seek ex officio an expert opinion on the objectives or the ‘nature’ of the Jehovah’s Witnesses. Nor were the first-instance proceedings incomplete because no expert medical opinion was sought regarding the question, which was raised anew on appeal, of blood transfusions, which are rejected by the Jehovah’s Witnesses; in the event that a judicial remedy (a decision pursuant to Article 176 of the Civil Code) arrives too late, it will in the final instance be up to the physician treating the patient, when confronted with the problem, to reach a decision, with a view in the first place to life-saving medical action and only in the second place taking into account the rejection of blood transfusions which is peculiar to the Jehovah’s Witnesses.', 'The appellant’s further line of argument - to the effect that a properly arranged transfer of the children to himself and properly arranged visiting rights for the mother could not cause the same shock as had the mother’s forcible removal of the children, and that the decision under appeal had legalised her unilateral action - also fails to convince. The appellant overlooks the fact that, in view of the paramount importance of the children’s welfare, the way in which they reached the place where they are currently being taken care of is not necessarily decisive. Even illegal conduct would be of relevance only to the extent that it might, in an individual case, be possible to infer therefrom a lack of suitability for care or upbringing; it is not otherwise decisive for determining the attribution of parental rights and duties whether or not the parent concerned has taken charge of the children without authorisation. It remains true, however, that both children have for a long time developed harmoniously in the mother’s care, that there is a closer relationship with her than with the father, and that, whatever the religious or philosophical views of the mother, neither child has suffered any harm in his or her physical or - particularly - psychological development; in fact the appellant could not seriously claim that they had actually suffered in the latter respect.""', '14. Mr S. lodged an appeal on points of law (außerordentlicher Revisionsrekurs) with the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof).', '15. By decision of 3 September 1986, the Supreme Court overturned the judgment of the Innsbruck Regional Court, granting parental rights to Mr S. instead of the applicant. It gave the following reasons:', '""The appellant has not hitherto claimed that the children belonged to the Roman Catholic faith; however, he has stated, and it has in fact been established, that the mother is bringing them up according to the principles of the Jehovah’s Witnesses’ teaching. It is also uncontested that the children do not belong to this confession. The lower courts had therefore to examine whether or not the mother’s bringing up the children in this way contravened the provisions of the Federal Law of 1985 on the Religious Education of Children (Bundesgesetz über die religiöse Kindererziehung), BGBl (Bundesgesetzblatt, Federal official Gazette) 1985/155 (re-enactment of the Law of 15 July 1921 on the Religious Education of Children, dRGB (deutsches Reichsgesetzblatt, German Reich Gazette) I. 939). According to Article 1 of the 1921 Act the religious education of a child shall be decided upon by an agreement freely entered into by the parents, in so far as the responsibility for his or her care and upbringing is vested in them. Such an agreement may be revoked at any time and is terminated by the death of either spouse. Article 2, paragraph 1, of the 1921 Act lays down that if such an agreement does not or ceases to exist, the provisions of the Civil Code on the care and upbringing of children shall extend to their religious education. However, according to Article 2, paragraph 2 of the 1921 Act, during the existence of the marriage neither parent may decide without the consent of the other that the child is to be brought up in a faith different from that shared by both parents at the time of the marriage or from that in which he or she has hitherto been brought up.', 'Since in any case the children do not belong to the faith of the Jehovah’s Witnesses, their education according to the principles of this sect (which is not, as the appellant rightly points out, a recognised religious community: see Adamovich-Funk, Österreichisches Verfassungsrecht, [Austrian Constitutional Law], Vol. 3, p. 415) contravenes Article 2, paragraph 2, of the 1921 Act. The Regional Court’s failure to apply this provision is obviously in breach of the law.', 'Moreover, the lower courts also failed in their decisions to give due consideration to the children’s welfare ... . That the mother, as has been established, would refuse to consent to the children’s receiving a necessary blood transfusion constitutes a danger to their well-being, since requesting a court to substitute its consent for that of the mother ... may in urgent cases involve a life-threatening delay and medical intervention without seeking the approval of the person entitled to take care of the child is considered contrary to the law ... . It has also been established that if the children are educated according to the religious teaching of the Jehovah’s Witnesses, they will become social outcasts. In the initial decision as to which of the spouses is to have the right to provide care and upbringing, these circumstances cannot be ignored. Although it is preferable for young children to be taken care of by their mother ..., this applies only provided that all other things are equal ... . There is no maternal privilege as regards the attribution of parental right ... . The stress caused to the children by being transferred to the care of the other parent, which in any case is usually transitory, has to be accepted in their own best interests ... . The file contains no documentary basis for the assumption that a change to another carer ‘would with a high degree of probability cause the children serious psychological harm’ ... . Even according to the opinion of the lower courts, the father is able to see to the children’s upbringing, since they have a good relationship with him and with their grandmother, who would take charge of their care and upbringing during the father’s absence at work; the availability of accommodation for the children in the house of the father’s parents is assured. Therefore, only transfer of parental rights and duties to the father is in the children’s interest.""', '16. Numbering about four million worldwide not counting uninitiated sympathisers, the Jehovah’s Witnesses form a particular religious movement. It originated in America in the 1870s. Formerly known by names such as International Bible Students, the Jehovah’s Witnesses took their present name in 1931.', '17. A central feature of Jehovah’s Witness doctrine is the belief that the Holy Scriptures in the original Hebrew and Greek are the revealed word of Jehovah God and must therefore be taken as literal truth.', 'The refusal to accept blood transfusions is based on several scriptural references, most notably Acts 15: 28-29, which reads (New World translation):', '""For the holy spirit and we ourselves have favored adding no further burden to you, except these necessary things, to keep abstaining from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication. If you carefully keep yourselves from these things, you will prosper ...""', '18. Article 177 of the Austrian Civil Code (Allgemeines Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) deals with the custody of children in an event such as the dissolution of their parents’ marriage by divorce. It reads:', '""(1) Where the marriage between the parents of a legitimate minor has been dissolved, annulled or declared void, or where the parents are separated other than merely for a temporary period, they may submit to the court an agreement concerning which of them shall in the future have custody of the child. The court shall approve the agreement if it is in the interests of the child’s welfare.', '(2) Where no agreement is reached within a reasonable time, or if the agreement reached is not in the interest of the child’s welfare, the court shall decide which parent is to have sole custody of the child in the future; in the case of a separation of the parents which is not merely temporary, such a decision shall be taken only on application by one of them.""', '19. Both during and after the parents’ marriage, the court may be called upon to substitute its approval or consent for that of the parents (or parent). The relevant provision is Article 176, which reads:', '""Where the conduct of the parents threatens the welfare of a minor, the court shall be required, irrespective of who has applied to it, to make the orders necessary for the protection of the child’s welfare. Such an order may also be made on application by one of the parents when the parents have failed to reach an agreement concerning a matter of importance to the child. In particular the court may withdraw custody of a child, either wholly or in part, including rights of approval and consent provided by law. In individual cases the court is also required to substitute its approval or consent for parental approval or consent required by law, when there is no justified reason for refusal.""', '20. In taking decisions under Articles 176 and 177, the courts follow the criteria set out in Article 178a, which reads:', '""In assessing the interests of the minor, his or her personality and needs must be duly taken into consideration, particularly his or her talents, abilities, inclinations and developmental opportunities, as well as the material circumstances of the parents.""', '21. Religious freedom is guaranteed by Article 14 of the Basic Law (Staatsgrundgesetz), which reads:', '""(1) Complete freedom of beliefs and conscience is guaranteed to everyone.', '(2) Enjoyment of civil and political rights shall be independent of religious confessions; however, a religious confession may not stand in the way of civic duties.', '(3) No one shall be compelled to take any church-related action or to participate in any church-related celebration, except in pursuance of a power conferred by law on another person to whose authority he is subject.""', '22. Austria has a system of recognition of religious communities. It is governed by the Act of 20 May 1874 concerning the Legal Recognition of Religious Communities (Gesetz betreffend die gesetzliche Anerkennung von Religionsgesellschaften), RGBl (Reichsgesetzblatt, Official Gazette of the Austrian Empire) 1874/68. Only five religious communities are so recognised, among them the Roman Catholic Church but not the Jehovah’s Witnesses. Religious groupings without legal recognition have legal personality as ""societies"" (Vereine) under the general law.', '23. The religious education of children is governed by the Federal Act on the Religious Education of Children, which re-enacted a German law dating from 1921 that was incorporated into Austrian law in 1939 (see paragraph 15 above).', '""The religious education of a child shall be decided upon by an agreement freely entered into by the parents, in so far as the responsibility for the child’s care and upbringing is vested in them. Such an agreement may be revoked at any time and is terminated by the death of either spouse.""', '""(1) If such an agreement does not or ceases to exist,the provisions of the Civil Code on the care and upbringing of children shall extend to their religious education.', '(2) During the existence of their marriage neither parent may decide without the consent of the other that the child is to be brought up in a faith different from that shared by both parents at the time of their marriage or from that in which he or she has hitherto been brought up, or that a child is to cease to attend religious education classes.', '(3) In the absence of such consent, application may be made for the mediation of, or a decision by, the guardianship court. In any such decision the interests of education shall be paramount even in cases not covered by Article 176 of the Civil Code. Before the decision is taken the child’s parents, and if necessary relatives, relatives by marriage and teachers, must be heard if this is possible without significant delays or disproportionate costs. The child itself must be heard if it has reached the age of ten.""', '24. The need for parental permission for administering blood transfusions to minors follows from the law governing medical action in general.', 'Thus, the Hospitals Act (Krankenanstaltengesetz), BGBl 1/1957, lays down in Article 8:', '""(1)...', '(2) Hospital patients may be medically treated only in accordance with the principles and recognised methods of medical science.', '(3) Special curative treatments including surgical operations may be carried out on a patient only with his consent, but if the patient has not yet reached the age of eighteen or if because he lacks mental maturity or health he cannot assess the necessity or usefulness of the treatment, only with the consent of his legal representative. Consent is not required if the treatment is so urgently necessary that the delay involved in obtaining the consent of the patient or his legal representative or in appointing a legal representative would endanger his life or would entail the danger of serious harm to his health. The medical director of the hospital or the doctor responsible for the management of the hospital department concerned shall decide on the necessity and urgency of treatment.""', '25. It is a criminal offence to administer medical treatment without the requisite consent; this follows from Article 110 of the Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch), which reads:', '""(1) Whoever treats another person, even according to the rules of medical science, without having obtained that person’s consent, shall be liable to imprisonment for up to six months or to a fine of up to 360 daily rates.', '(2) If the offender has failed to obtain the consent of the patient because he assumed that a delay in the treatment would entail a serious risk for the life or health of the patient, he shall be punished according to paragraph 1 only if the assumed risk did not exist and if by taking due care ... he could have been aware of this.', '(3) The offender shall be punished only at the request of the person who underwent unauthorised treatment.""']","['14', '8']",[],[],[],[],[]

The applicant was born in 1978 and lives in Ankara.', '6. On 6 March 2000 the applicant was arrested by the gendarmerie in the border city of Edirne on her return from Bulgaria. She was detained in a gendarmerie station. According to an arrest report prepared by the gendarmerie the same day, the applicant was informed of her right to be represented by a lawyer and to inform her family about her arrest. Nevertheless, it was also stated in the same document that, if the offence in respect of which she was arrested fell within the jurisdiction of State Security Courts, she could consult a lawyer only if her detention period was extended by a judge or if a judge ordered her detention in a prison. The applicant signed the report and wrote on it that she had “no requests”.', '7. The applicant was interrogated during her detention at the gendarmerie station, and an eight-page statement was taken from her between 7 and 9 March 2000. In her statement the applicant admitted to having engaged in activities on behalf of the PKK.', '8. On 9 March 2000 the applicant was examined by a doctor at the Edirne branch of the Forensic Medicine Directorate. According to the medical report drawn up the same day, there were “no injuries or signs of ill-treatment on her body”.', ""9. The same day she was brought before the prosecutor and then before the Edirne Magistrates' Court, which ordered her pre-trial detention in prison. In two statements made during meetings with the prosecutor and the judge the applicant admitted to being a member of the PKK."", '10. According to the three statements referred to above, the applicant did not want to be represented by a lawyer during the questioning.', ""11. On 3 April 2000 the prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed an indictment against the applicant with that court for the offence of membership of an illegal organisation, namely the PKK. The prosecutor, referring to the above-mentioned statements made by the applicant, alleged that the applicant had left Turkey in 1996 and had been taken to the PKK's training camp in Lavrion, Greece, where she had received training. Following her training she had obtained a false German passport in order to enter the Netherlands. During her time in Europe she had engaged in activities on behalf of the PKK in Germany and the Netherlands."", '12. Criminal proceedings against the applicant commenced before the Istanbul State Security Court (hereafter “the trial court”). During the proceedings the applicant was represented by a lawyer.', '13. During the first hearing, which was held on 22 June 2000, the applicant rejected the allegations against her and alleged that, before she was brought before the prosecutor and the judge on 9 March 2000, she had been told by the gendarmes that if she did not accept the accusations before the judge and the prosecutor she would be taken back to the gendarmerie station and tortured again. That had been the reason she had accepted the accusations before the prosecutor and the judge. When asked by the trial court what she had to say about the medical report of 9 March 2000 in which it was stated that her body bore no signs of ill-treatment, the applicant replied that the medical report had been prepared before she was beaten up by gendarme officers and threatened with rape. She also alleged that she had been stripped naked by the gendarmes during her detention. The applicant further informed the trial court that the gendarmes had not asked her whether she wanted to be represented by a lawyer during the questioning.', '14. During the second hearing, which was held on 29 August 2000, the applicant submitted a handwritten letter to the trial court. In the letter she alleged, in particular, that while she was being detained in the gendarmerie station she had been insulted by gendarme officers, blindfolded, beaten up and drenched with water. Before being questioned she had been undressed and “they” had touched various parts of her body. Threats of rape and death, directed at her and her mother, had also been made.', ""15. The lawyer representing the applicant told the trial court that his client's questioning had been in breach of the applicable procedure and legislation and, as such, the statements taken from her constituted unlawfully obtained evidence which was not admissible in a court of law. Other than the statements taken from his client by the gendarmerie and then by the prosecutor and the judge on 9 March 2000, there was no evidence against her. The lawyer drew the trial court's attention to a Court of Cassation decision according to which confessions not supported by further evidence were not admissible as evidence."", '16. The lawyer further asked the trial court to hear a “cassette of the questioning” of the applicant which had apparently been mentioned in a document drawn up by the gendarmerie. This request was rejected by the trial court which noted that the cassette was not in its possession.', ""17. The lawyer also pointed out that there was no mention of his client's name in the statements taken from E.Ş. who, according to the indictment, had helped his client to go to Greece."", ""18. On 9 October 2001 the applicant was found guilty as charged and sentenced to twelve years and six months' imprisonment. In convicting the applicant the trial court had regard to the statements taken from her at the gendarmerie station and then by the prosecutor and the judge on 9 March 2000, as well as to the statements made by E.Ş. in the course of his trial in 1998."", ""19. The applicant appealed against her conviction and argued, in particular, that the decision of the trial court had not been adequately reasoned. In the grounds of appeal the applicant's lawyer also repeated his earlier defence submissions concerning the allegedly unlawful nature of the evidence used in convicting his client, and referred to various Articles of the Convention."", ""20. On 8 July 2002 the Court of Cassation upheld the applicant's conviction."", '21. At the time notice of the application was given to the respondent Government, the Government were requested to submit to the Court a copy of the “cassette of questioning” referred to above (see paragraph 16 above). It appears from the documents submitted to the Court by the applicant that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requested the Ministry of Justice to obtain the cassette so that it could be submitted to the Court. The gendarmerie, who were requested by the domestic judicial authorities to produce the cassette, stated in their letter of 21 May 2008 that they had “no records of the cassette being handed over to the Edirne prosecutor”.']","['3', '6']",[],[],[],[],[]

It appears that on 16 June and 10 October 2003 the District Court examined and fully granted the applicant’s two fresh claims for unpaid social benefits. It ordered the authority to pay RUR 18,721.85 and RUR 5,130.31 respectively. Both decisions were enforced with a six months delay, in December 2003 and February 2004 respectively.', '20.

Under Section 13 of the Law, the enforcement proceedings should be completed within two months upon receipt of the writ of enforcement by the bailiff.', '23. Under special rules governing enforcement of execution writs against the recipients of allocations from the federal budget, adopted by the Federal Government on 22 February 2001 (Decree No. 143, as in force at the relevant time), a creditor is to apply to a relevant branch of the Federal Treasury holding debtor’s accounts (Sections 1 to 4).', '24.

The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in London.', '8. On 2 February 1998 the applicant was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. She was found to be suffering from a mental illness. She was detained in hospital pursuant to sections 37 and 41 of the Mental Health Act 1983 (“the 1983 Act”). She applied to a Mental Health Review Tribunal (“MHRT”) for her discharge from detention in hospital.', '9. On 24 May 1999 the MHRT first considered her application. It adjourned in order, inter alia, to obtain a psychiatric report from a Dr Hamilton which was to address the eligibility of the applicant for a conditional discharge from hospital.', ""10. On 16 August 1999 the MHRT resumed its hearing of the applicant's application. It had before it the report of Dr Hamilton, which expressed the view that the applicant was not ready for discharge. Furthermore, the psychiatrist in charge of the applicant's care, Dr O'Grady, and a social worker gave evidence to the MHRT stating that they were opposed to the applicant's discharge. They proposed that the applicant should instead be transferred to hostel-type accommodation, under the care of a supervising consultant psychiatrist."", '11. The MHRT nevertheless concluded that the applicant should be conditionally discharged. The conditions were that the applicant should reside at the home of her parents, that she should cooperate with supervision by a social worker and a forensic consultant psychiatrist, and that she should comply with such treatment as might be prescribed for her.', '12. In coming to its decision, the MHRT answered the three questions below as follows:', 'The MHRT expressed the following as a part of its reasoning:', '“The Tribunal is satisfied ... that the patient is now suffering from mental illness, namely schizophrenia, the symptoms of which are being fully controlled by medication and that she needs ongoing treatment and medication in order to control her illness.', 'The patient ... has been symptom-free for at least the last 8 to 12 months.', '...', '... in view of the possibility of a relapse, she should remain liable to be recalled to hospital for further treatment.”', '13. The MHRT deferred the discharge of the applicant until satisfactory arrangements had been made to meet the conditions it had imposed.', ""14. On 30 September 1999 the psychiatrist responsible for supervising the applicant in the community, Dr Kennedy, saw her with two members of his team. He concluded that he was not prepared to supervise her if she were at home but only if she were in supported accommodation. He described his consultation with the applicant in a letter to Dr O'Grady, dated 6 October 1999, in which he wrote, inter alia:"", '“I made it clear that I would not consider it safe to supervise [the applicant] if she were to go straight home to the care of her parents, as there are important areas of her treatment in which she has not yet made sufficient progress for anyone to be confident that she would not relapse and reoffend while there.”', ""15. Dr Kennedy made clear that he was in no doubt that the next stage in the applicant's treatment, rehabilitation and risk management should take place near her family, but in a medium-security unit or at a registered mental nursing home. Alternatively, he suggested asking one of his colleagues, or one of the general psychiatrists at St Anne's Hospital, whether they would be willing to supervise the applicant on conditional discharge to her parents' home."", ""16. On 11 October 1999 Dr O'Grady wrote to the MHRT. He stated that the purpose of his letter was to give the MHRT advance notice that his team was unable to meet the conditions set by the tribunal for the conditional discharge of the applicant. He explained that both Dr Hamilton and Dr Kennedy were agreed that it would be difficult to manage her should she be discharged directly to her parents' home. He continued:"", '“In the circumstances, I believe it is highly unlikely that there will be another forensic psychiatrist willing to provide the supervision that is necessary to meet the conditions of the tribunal ... We continue to hold the view that it is not in her best interests to be discharged directly to her family but [that she] should go through a further period of rehabilitation in the community to prepare her fully for community living.”', ""17. On 19 October 1999 Dr O'Grady again wrote to the MHRT informing it that he would write to the other consultant forensic psychiatrists in the North London Forensic Service (“the NLFS”) to enquire whether they would be prepared to supervise the applicant under the conditions laid down by the tribunal. As it transpired, none of those psychiatrists was prepared to do so."", '18. On 15 November 1999 the health authority responsible for the area in which the applicant lived (“the health authority”) requested the director of the NLFS to approach forensic colleagues working in the private sector to establish whether they might be willing to offer supervision.', ""19. On 2 December 1999 the NLFS informed the health authority that the applicant's new responsible medical officer, Dr Duffield, was not satisfied that the applicant should return home. However, he had agreed to approach all local catchment area forensic consultant psychiatrists to determine whether they would be willing to provide after-care supervision for the applicant were she to be discharged to her parents' home."", '20. On 15 December 1999 the NLFS wrote to the health authority to confirm that no consultant forensic psychiatrist from the NLFS was willing to supervise the applicant in the community. Furthermore, it stated that it was not aware of any individual or organisation that would be suitably equipped to undertake such a task in the community. The letter noted that most private independent sector providers concentrated on acute and in-patient care only.', '21. On 17 December 1999 Dr Duffield wrote to the MHRT to advise it that its conditions had not been complied with so far, and the reasons therefor.', '22. In December 1999 and January 2000 the health authority wrote to the clinical directors of the forensic psychiatry services in London, Hertfordshire and Essex, identifying nine units in addition to the NLFS. They were asked to discuss the case urgently with their consultant colleagues to establish whether any of them was prepared to assess the applicant with a view to becoming her supervising consultant forensic psychiatrist under the terms laid down by the MHRT. None was willing or able to assist.', '23. The health authority subsequently wrote to both national and private institutions in Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire with the same request. Once again, no one was prepared to comply with the conditions set by the MHRT.', '24. The health authority concluded that there were no further steps that it could take.', '25. On 3 March 2000 Dr Kennedy wrote to the Home Office, advising it of his opinion that the conditions imposed by the MHRT were impossible to meet. He therefore requested the Home Secretary to consider exercising his powers under section 71(1) of the 1983 Act to refer the applicant to an MHRT. The Home Secretary complied with that request on 17 March 2000.', '26. On 3 December 1999 the applicant issued proceedings for judicial review of the decision of the health authority not to provide her with psychiatric supervision in the community in implementation of the conditions imposed by the MHRT, which was preventing her discharge from hospital. She sought, inter alia, the quashing of that decision and/or an order to compel the health authority to provide her with the psychiatric treatment necessary to implement the conditions imposed by the MHRT.', '27. On 18 January 2000 the High Court granted the applicant permission to apply for judicial review. The Secretary of State for Health declined to intervene in the proceedings, but made the following observations:', '“The Mental Health Act provides an established legislative framework in this and similar cases designed to safeguard the interests of patients. As part of this scheme Responsible Medical Officers are accountable in a way which clearly does not permit them to effectively deny the determinations of properly constituted Mental Health Review Tribunals ... It is a matter for the Tribunal whether they decide to order a conditional discharge against the advice of the [Responsible Medical Officer].”', ""28. On 9 June 2000 the High Court judge (Mr Justice Burton) heard the applicant's substantive application for judicial review. The applicant argued that she was entitled to be discharged from hospital; that the health authority was in breach of its duty under section 117 of the 1983 Act for failing to provide her with the necessary services to comply with the conditions of the MHRT; and that the failure to comply with those conditions within a reasonable period of time was in breach of Article 5 of the Convention."", ""29. The judge rejected the applicant's application. He held that, under section 117 of the 1983 Act, the health authority was not under an absolute duty to implement the conditions of the MHRT, but only a duty to take all reasonable steps to attempt to satisfy those conditions. The judge further held that, on the facts, the health authority had complied with that duty. He further rejected the applicant's suggestion that any of the psychiatric consultants had “thwarted” the conclusions of the MHRT, holding that doctors were both entitled and obliged to exercise their own professional judgment."", ""30. On 24 August 2000, following the reference by the Home Secretary on 17 March 2000 (see paragraph 25 above), a differently constituted MHRT considered the applicant's case afresh. It concluded that the applicant should be conditionally discharged. The conditions were that the applicant should reside in accommodation approved by her responsible medical officer, that she accept to be supervised and take the medication prescribed by the latter, and that she accept to be supervised by her social supervisor."", '31. The MHRT gave the same answers as the first MHRT to the questions set out in paragraph 12 above. It also deferred the discharge of the applicant until satisfactory arrangements had been made to meet the conditions it had imposed. It further expressed the following as part of its reasoning:', ""“... we consider that it is appropriate that [the applicant] should remain liable to recall to hospital. The critical issue, we feel, is that Miss Kolanis's current good mental health is dependent, in our view, upon her continuing to receive her medication."", 'Our hope and expectation is that the condition as to residence which we have imposed will be capable of being complied with within a relatively short period. We consider that, bearing in mind that Miss Kolanis had a legitimate expectation a year ago of being released into the community almost at once, her [Responsible Medical Officer] and the other responsible authorities should treat the finding of suitable accommodation for her as urgent. Having seen Miss Kolanis, it is clear to us that she is a very personable woman and we find it difficult to conceive of any responsible body having any legitimate objection to accommodating her.”', '32. On 23 December 2000 the applicant was conditionally discharged from hospital to a resettlement project hostel in London.', ""33. Subsequently, the Court of Appeal granted the applicant permission to appeal against the judgment of the High Court of 9 June 2000 in her judicial review proceedings. It recognised that, in the light of the applicant's conditional discharge, which had occurred subsequent to the judgment of the High Court, the issues raised on appeal were, in one sense, academic. However, permission to appeal was granted as a result of the importance of the issues raised."", ""34. On 21 February 2001 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's appeal. It agreed with the interpretation of section 117 of the 1983 Act that had been the basis of the decision of the High Court judge (see paragraph 29 above)."", '35. In paragraph 16 of his judgment, Lord Phillips set out the effect of an earlier judgment of the House of Lords in R. v. Oxford Regional Mental Health Review Tribunal, ex parte Secretary of State for the Home Department [1987] 3 All England Law Reports 8 (“Oxford”) as follows:', '“Should, for any reason, it prove impossible to implement the conditions specified by a Tribunal, that Tribunal could not consider whether to impose alternative conditions or even to direct discharge of the patient without conditions. In such circumstances the patient would remain detained unless and until a fresh reference was made to a Tribunal. The patient was not entitled himself to initiate a reference for twelve months. The Secretary of State was under no similar restriction, but in practice a considerable length of time would be likely to elapse before the matter came back before the Tribunal pursuant to a reference by the Secretary of State. The implications of this state of affairs were considered by the European Court of Human Rights in Johnson v. the United Kingdom ...”', 'At the time at which the facts in the present case arose, no separate relief was available to the applicant under the Human Rights Act 1998 (which incorporated the Convention directly into domestic law). Nevertheless, Lord Phillips proceeded on the basis that, where there was no conflict with precedent, the correct approach had always been to interpret legislation in a manner that was consistent with the Convention. He therefore addressed the human rights issues in the case as follows:', '“32. Does the legislative scheme, as interpreted in [Oxford], violate the right to liberty conferred by Article 5 of the [Convention]? In considering this question it is necessary to distinguish between two different situations. The first is a case, such as the present, where the Tribunal concludes that the patient is mentally ill and requires treatment, but that under appropriate conditions such treatment can be provided in the community. The second is where, as in the case of Johnson, the Tribunal finds that the patient is no longer suffering from mental illness, is not in need of treatment but needs to be discharged into a controlled environment in order to reduce the stress involved, to make sure that the patient is indeed free of the illness and to reduce the risk that the illness may recur.', ""33. Where (i) a patient is suffering from mental illness and (ii) treatment of that illness is necessary in the interests of the patient's own health or for the protection of others and (iii) it proves impossible or impractical to arrange for the patient to receive the necessary treatment in the community, it seems to me that the three criteria identified by the European Court in Winterwerp are made out. Whether or not it is necessary to detain a patient in hospital for treatment may well depend upon the level of facilities available for treatment within the community. Neither Article 5 nor Strasbourg jurisprudence lays down any criteria as to the extent to which member States must provide facilities for the care of those of unsound mind in the community, thereby avoiding the necessity for them to be detained for treatment in hospital."", '34. If a health authority is unable, despite the exercise of all reasonable endeavours, to procure for a patient the level of care and treatment in the community that a Tribunal considers to be a prerequisite to the discharge of the patient from hospital, I do not consider that the continued detention of the patient in hospital will violate the right to liberty conferred by Article 5.', '35. Very different considerations apply to a factual situation such as that considered by the Strasbourg Court in Johnson. Where a patient has been cured of mental illness, he is no longer of unsound mind and the exception to the right to liberty provided for by Article 5 § 1 (e) does not apply. In Johnson the Court has recognised that, in such circumstances, it may nonetheless be legitimate to make discharge of the patient conditional rather than absolute and to defer, to some extent, the discharge to which the patient is entitled. The deferral must, however, be proportionate to its object and cannot become indefinite. The decision in Johnson suggests that the statutory regime as interpreted in [Oxford], may not be consistent with Article 5. If the Tribunal imposes a condition which proves impossible of performance, too lengthy a period may elapse before the position is reconsidered as a result of a subsequent referral.', '36. The solution to the problem is not to interpret section 117 in such a way as to impose on health authorities an absolute obligation to satisfy conditions imposed by Tribunals. I do not consider it appropriate in this case to attempt to provide a definitive answer to the problem. I would simply observe that the solution may well involve reconsidering the decision of the House of Lords in [Oxford]. ...”', '36. During the course of his judgment, Lord Justice Buxton opined as follows:', '“39. The effect of Article 5 § 4 of the [Convention] is to entitle a person in the situation of [the applicant] to have the lawfulness of her detention decided by a body, within the system of the State that is detaining her, that has appropriate court-like characteristics. In the case of the United Kingdom, that court-like function is performed by the Mental Health Review Tribunal (MHRT). One necessary characteristic of such a body, if it is to meet the requirements of Article 5 § 4, is that its orders should be effective in securing the release of persons whose detention it rules to be unlawful: see ... X v. the United Kingdom[judgment of 5 November 1981, Series A no. 46] ...', '40. In the present case, the MHRT concluded that the detention of [the applicant] would be unlawful once the conditions upon which her release was contingent were put in place. Those conditions, in particular, included cooperation by [the applicant] with supervision by a forensic consultant psychiatrist; and therefore, by necessary implication, provision of such supervision by the appropriate organ of the State. If that order were to be effective, as Article 5 § 4 requires, such supervision had to be provided.', '41. Johnson ..., paragraphs 66 and 67, seems to me to make clear, in accordance with that requirement of effectiveness, that a breach of Article 5 § 1 is committed by the State if, once the MHRT has determined that a patient should be released, it imposes conditions to facilitate that release that in the event are not fulfilled, at least if the non-fulfilment can be attributed to another organ of the State.', ""42. In applying that part of the Court's jurisprudence, I would not make the distinction drawn by [Lord Phillips], in paragraph 32 of his judgment, and based on the approach of the Strasbourg Court in Winterwerp, between cases where the MHRT concludes that the patient is mentally ill, but can be treated in the community, and cases (such as Johnson itself) where the MHRT finds that the patient is no longer suffering from mental illness but nonetheless needs to be released into a controlled environment. In the latter case, the justification for the placing of continued restrictions on the subject relates, and can only relate, to the history of mental illness and, as in Johnson, to the prospect of recurrence. In both cases, there is continued detention; the role of the MHRT in both cases is to exercise the court-like functions required by Article 5 § 4, and under the jurisprudence of Article 5 § 4 the national authorities are equally bound to respect and act on the determination of the MHRT in either case."", ""43. There is also a practical difficulty in applying the Winterwerp criterion of whether the mental disorder is 'of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement' to decisions that were not taken with that formulation expressly in mind. In [the applicant's] case, the MHRT answered 'Yes' to the question: 'Is the Tribunal satisfied that the patient is not now suffering from mental illness ... of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for the patient to be liable to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment?', but in their extended reasoning made it clear that any discharge must be subject to the provision of continuing treatment. That is not a clear-cut decision of the type that Winterwerp seems to assume."", ""44. However that may be, under the [Convention] jurisprudence ... once the MHRT made a decision as to [the applicant's] release that was contingent on the provision of forensic psychiatric supervision, it became the responsibility of the State to provide that supervision. Otherwise, if nothing was done, the situation would arise that was identified in paragraph 67 of the judgment in Johnson, of indefinite deferral of the release that had been ordered by the MHRT. That deferral would arguably entail a breach of the [Convention]. The issue would depend on whether, once the MHRT had determined that her condition could and should be treated in the community, she was, in terms of the analysis in Winterwerp, suffering from a mental disorder of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement. I have already indicated the difficulty of this question. We received no submissions upon it, the argument being concentrated in another direction, and I certainly do not decide the issue here."", ""45. In raising the possibility that [the applicant's] detention became unlawful I have not overlooked [Lord Phillips's] view, set out in paragraph 33 of his judgment, that such a conclusion may be controlled or affected by the availability of treatment facilities in the particular community involved; but what matters in [Convention] terms is the ruling of the MHRT, the determining body created by Article 5 § 4. If the ruling of the MHRT is frustrated, in a case where under the [Convention] jurisprudence the subject should no longer be detained, then the subject is deprived of her Article 5 § 4 protection, as (I think it to be clear) the [Court] would have held in Johnson had the issue not been determined already under Article 5 § 1: see paragraphs 69-72 of the judgment."", ""46. I well accept that this conclusion entails a number of practical difficulties, not least that it might appear to lead to the release of a person who is or has been mentally ill without the support that the MHRT thought necessary for that release. That may appear surprising, not only in common-sense terms, but also in view of the emphasis placed in the jurisprudence of the [Convention] upon the judgment of the national authorities: see for instance the observations of the [Court] in Luberti v. Italy [judgment of 23 February 1984, Series A no. 75] at paragraph 27 as to the relevance in this context of the doctrine of the margin of appreciation; and the observations in paragraph 63 of the judgment in Johnson as to the respect to be paid to the discretionary judgment of those responsible for dealing with the mentally ill. The problem in this case arises, however, from the rigidity of the required procedure of the MHRT that is identified in paragraphs 16 and 36 of [Lord Phillips's] judgment. If the MHRT indeed had the power to review its decisions in the light of practical circumstances, as was envisaged by Woolf J in [Oxford], then difficulties of the present order would not arise; and provided that the national authorities made all reasonable efforts to comply with provisional decisions of the MHRT I very much doubt that any objection to such a procedure would arise under the [Convention]. That, however, is not the present state of domestic law: the decision of the MHRT being once and for all, that is the decision that Article 5 § 4 requires to be respected."", '...', ""48. ... [the applicant] may have a complaint under Article 5 in relation to the whole circumstances that led to her continued detention: including, in particular, that the MHRT having ruled that her continued detention was not justified, the implementation by the State of that order in the event caused her to continue to be detained. The State is responsible for the whole of these circumstances. That, presumably, is why the State was found to be in breach in Johnson from the original date of the MHRT's decision: see the last sentence of paragraph 67 of the judgment. The circumstances of [the applicant's] case might, therefore, by the same token found a successful complaint in Strasbourg.”"", '37. Lord Justice Sedley, during the course of his judgment, expressed the following view (in paragraphs 55 and 56):', '“... more than one legitimate judgment – that of the community psychiatrist as well as of the MHRT – may have to be accommodated for the purposes of Article 5 § 4, at least to the extent that the decision of the MHRT is explicitly dependent on the collaboration of the psychiatrist.', '... I am rather less positive than Buxton LJ in looking to Strasbourg to afford [the applicant] a remedy that cannot be afforded here. It seems to me ... that the legislative scheme, while not always satisfactory in practice, is Convention-compliant in principle.”', ""38. On 3 July 2001 the House of Lords refused the applicant's petition of appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal."", '39. Section 1(2) of the Mental Health Act 1983 (“the 1983 Act”) defines “mental disorder” as “mental illness, arrested or incomplete development of mind, psychopathic disorder and any other disorder or disability of mind”.', '40. Section 37 of the 1983 Act empowers a court to order a person, on being convicted of a criminal offence punishable with imprisonment, to be admitted to and detained in a specified hospital (“a hospital order”).', '41. The court can only make a hospital order if it is satisfied on the written or oral evidence of two registered medical practitioners that the offender is suffering from mental disorder (see paragraph 39 above) and that', '“the mental disorder ... is of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for him to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment and, in the case of psychopathic disorder or mental impairment, that such treatment is likely to alleviate or prevent a deterioration in his condition” (section 37(2)(a)(i))', 'and', '“the court is of the opinion, having regard to all the circumstances including the nature of the offence and the character and antecedents of the offender, and to the other available methods of dealing with him, that the most suitable method of disposing of the case is by means of a [hospital order]” (section 37(2)(b).', '42. Under section 37(7), a hospital order must specify the form or forms of mental disorder from which the offender is suffering, as confirmed by the evidence of two practitioners.', '43. Under section 41(1) of the 1983 Act, where a hospital order is made by the Crown Court, and it appears to the court, having regard to the nature of the offence, the antecedents of the offender and the risk of his committing further offences if set at large, that it is necessary for the protection of the public from serious harm to do so, the court may further order that the offender shall be subject to certain specified restrictions, detailed in section 41 of the Act. Such an order is called a “restriction order” and may be made either without limit of time or for the period specified in the order.', '44. The purpose of an MHRT is to deal with applications and references by and in respect of patients under the provisions of the 1983 Act (section 65(1)).', '45. Under section 70 of the 1983 Act, a person who is subject to a hospital order and a restriction order (“a restricted patient”) may apply to an MHRT for a review of his or her detention in hospital:', ""(i) initially after a period of between six and twelve months' detention;"", '(ii) thereafter, annually.', '46. Under section 71(1) of the 1983 Act, the Secretary of State may at any time refer the case of a restricted patient to an MHRT. This power is discretionary. The Secretary of State therefore cannot be compelled by a patient to exercise it.', ""47. Under section 73(1) and (2), read in conjunction with section 72(1), of the 1983 Act (as they were at the time when the facts giving rise to the applicant's case occurred, the sections having subsequently been amended), where an application was made to an MHRT by a restricted patient or where his case was referred to it by the Secretary of State, the MHRT was required to direct the absolute discharge of the patient if it was satisfied:"", '(a) (i) that the patient was not then suffering from mental illness, psychopathic disorder, severe mental impairment or mental impairment or from any of those forms of disorder of a nature or degree which made it appropriate for the patient to be liable to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment; or', '(ii) that it was not necessary for the health or safety of the patient or for the protection of other persons that the patient should receive such treatment (section 73(1) of the 1983 Act); and', '(b) that it was not appropriate for the patient to remain liable to be recalled to hospital for further treatment (section 73(2) of the 1983 Act).', '48. Pursuant to section 73(3), upon an absolute discharge, the patient ceases to be liable to be detained by virtue of the hospital order and the restriction order ceases to have effect.', '49. Under section 73(2) of the 1983 Act, where an MHRT is satisfied as to either of the matters referred to in (a), but not as to the matter referred to in (b) in paragraph 47 above, it is required to direct the conditional discharge of the patient.', '50. Lady Justice Butler-Sloss, giving judgment in R. v. Merseyside Mental Health Review Tribunal, ex parte K. [1990] 1 All England Law Reports 699-700, explained the nature of this power as follows:', '“Section 73 gives to the tribunal the power to impose a conditional discharge and retain residual control over patients not then suffering from mental disorder or not to a degree requiring continued detention in hospital. This would appear to be a provision designed both for the support of the patient in the community and the protection of the public, and it is an important discretionary power vested in an independent tribunal, one not lightly to be set aside in the absence of clear words.”', '51. By virtue of section 73(4) of the 1983 Act, a patient who has been conditionally discharged may be recalled by the Secretary of State. In addition, that patient must comply with the conditions attached to the discharge. In contrast to a patient who has been absolutely discharged, a conditionally discharged patient does not cease to be liable to be detained by virtue of the relevant hospital order.', '52. Under section 73(7) of the 1983 Act, an MHRT can defer a direction for the conditional discharge of a restricted patient until such arrangements as appear to be necessary for the purpose of discharge have been made to its satisfaction.', ""53. As set out above, in the applicant's domestic case in the Court of Appeal (R. (K.) v. Camden and Islington Health Authority [2001] England and Wales Court of Appeal (Civil Division) 240), Lord Phillips considered the effect of the House of Lords' decision in Oxford. He concluded that if it proved impossible to implement the conditions specified by an MHRT, the patient would remain detained unless and until a fresh reference were made to an MHRT. The original MHRT that imposed the conditions did not have any power to reconsider its decision."", ""54. A patient's case can therefore only be reconsidered by a differently constituted MHRT. In those circumstances the case must be considered afresh."", ""55. The Secretary of State may also order a patient's conditional or absolute discharge under section 42 of the 1983 Act."", '56. Section 117(2) of the 1983 Act reads as follows:', '“It shall be the duty of the health authority and of the local social services authority to provide, in cooperation with relevant voluntary agencies, after-care services for any person to whom this section applies ...”', ""57. As set out above, the Court of Appeal in the applicant's domestic case (cited above) held that the duty imposed by section 117(2) was not absolute. It was a duty to take all reasonable steps to attempt to satisfy the conditions imposed by the MHRT."", ""58. In R. (I.H.) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department and Another [2002] England and Wales Court of Appeal (Civil Division) 646, decided on 15 May 2002, the Court of Appeal considered the question of whether sections 73(2) and/or 73(7) of the 1983 Act were incompatible with Article 5 §§ 1 (e) and/or 4 of the Convention in that MHRTs lacked the power to guarantee that conditions they might attach to a deferred order for conditional discharge would be implemented within a reasonable period of time. The case, similarly to that of the applicant, involved a patient who was suffering from a mental illness, but one which was in remission. It was decided subsequently to the applicant's domestic case and was brought under the Human Rights Act 1998. It therefore took into account the judgments in the applicant's domestic proceedings, the Convention and Strasbourg jurisprudence."", '59. In paragraph 53 of his judgment, Lord Phillips confirmed that the decision of the House of Lords in Oxford made clear that an MHRT was neither obliged nor entitled to reconsider its earlier decision in respect of a conditional discharge in order to accommodate any new facts that might cause it to alter that decision.', 'Lord Phillips continued, in paragraph 54:', ""“... the decision in [Oxford] is in potential conflict with the requirements of Article5 § 4. If, having made a decision that a patient is entitled to a conditional discharge, subject to specific conditions which necessitate deferral of the discharge, the Tribunal cannot revisit its decision, the patient is liable to find himself 'in limbo' should it prove impossible to put in place the arrangements necessary to enable him to comply with the proposed conditions. That period 'in limbo' may last too long to be compatible with Article 5 § 4 and may result in the patient being detained in violation of Article 5 § 1.”"", 'Lord Phillips therefore determined that the decision in Oxford needed to be reviewed in the light of the requirements of Article 5 of the Convention. He concluded, in paragraph 71:', ""“Tribunals should no longer proceed on the basis that they cannot reconsider a decision to direct a conditional discharge on specified conditions where, after deferral and before directing discharge, there is a material change of circumstances. ... The original decision should be treated as a provisional decision, and the Tribunal should monitor progress towards implementing it so as to ensure that the patient is not left 'in limbo' for an unreasonable length of time.”"", 'Lord Phillips then gave guidelines to MHRTs considering the discharge of a patient. The guidelines comprised specific steps that could be taken by an MHRT should problems arise with making arrangements to meet the conditions of a conditional discharge. Those steps included the possibility of deferring for a further period, varying the proposed conditions to seek to overcome the difficulties, ordering a conditional discharge without specific conditions or deciding that the patient had to remain detained in hospital for treatment. The Court of Appeal concluded (in paragraphs 96-98) that such a scheme, proposed in the light of its review of the decision of the House of Lords in Oxford, would be compatible with Article 5 § 1 of the Convention.', '60. Following an appeal to the House of Lords, on 13 November 2003, Lord Bingham, in his judgment with which the other members of the House of Lords agreed, held:', ""“18. The key to a correct understanding of Johnson is to appreciate the nature of the case with which the Court was dealing. It was that of a patient who, from June 1989 onwards, was found not to be suffering from mental illness and whose condition did not warrant detention in hospital. The Court's reasoning is not applicable to any other case."", '...', '26. I do not accept that, because the tribunal lacked the power to secure compliance with its conditions, it lacked the coercive power which is one of the essential attributes of a court. What Article 5 §§ 1 (e) and 4 require is that a person of unsound mind compulsorily detained in hospital should have access to a court with power to decide whether the detention is lawful and, if not, to order his release. This power the tribunal had. Nothing in Article 5 suggests that discharge subject to conditions is impermissible in principle, and nothing in the Convention jurisprudence suggests that the power to discharge conditionally (whether there are specific conditions or a mere liability to recall), properly used, should be viewed with disfavour. Indeed, the conditional discharge regime, properly used, is of great benefit to patients and the public, and conducive to the Convention object of restricting the curtailment of personal liberty to the maximum, because it enables tribunals to ensure that restricted patients compulsorily detained in hospital represent the hard core of those who suffer from mental illness, are a risk to themselves or others and cannot be effectively treated and supervised other than in hospital. If there is any possibility of treating and supervising a patient in the community, the imposition of conditions permit that possibility to be explored and, it may be, tried.', ""27. When, following the tribunal's order of 3 February 2000, it proved impossible to secure compliance with the conditions within a matter of a few months, a violation of the appellant's Article 5 § 4 right did occur. It occurred because the tribunal, having made its order, was precluded by the authority of the Oxford case from reconsidering it. The result was to leave the appellant in limbo for a much longer period than was acceptable or compatible with the Convention. I would accordingly endorse the Court of Appeal's decision to set aside the Oxford ruling and I would adopt the ruling it gave in paragraph 71 of its judgment quoted above. Evidence before the House shows that that ruling is already yielding significant practical benefits. ..."", ""28. There was no time between 3 February 2000 and 25 March 2002 when the appellant was, in my opinion, unlawfully detained, and there was thus no breach of Article 5 § 1 (e). There is a categorical difference, not a difference of degree, between this case and that of Johnson. Mr Johnson was a patient in whose case the Winterwerp criteria were found not to be satisfied from June 1989 onwards. While, therefore, it was reasonable to try and ease the patient's reintegration into the community by the imposition of conditions, the alternative, if those conditions proved impossible to meet, was not continued detention but discharge, either absolutely or subject only to a condition of liability to recall. His detention became unlawful shortly after June 1989 because there were, as all the doctors agreed, no grounds for continuing to detain him. The present case is quite different. There was never a medical consensus, nor did the tribunal find, that the Winterwerp criteria were not satisfied. The tribunal considered that the appellant could be satisfactorily treated and supervised in the community if its conditions were met, as it expected, but the alternative, if these conditions proved impossible to meet, was not discharge, either absolutely or subject only to a condition of recall, but continued detention. ..."", ""29. The duty of the health authority, whether under section 117 of the 1983 Act or in response to the tribunal's order of 3 February 2000, was to use its best endeavours to procure compliance with the conditions laid down by the tribunal. This it did. It was not subject to an absolute obligation to procure compliance and was not at fault in failing to do so. It had no power to require any psychiatrist to act in a way which conflicted with the conscientious professional judgment of that psychiatrist. Thus the appellant can base no claim on the fact that the tribunal's conditions were not met. ..."", ""30. I do not consider that the violation of Article 5 § 4 which I have found calls for an award of compensation since (a) the violation has been publicly acknowledged and the appellant's right thereby vindicated, (b) the law has been amended in a way which should prevent similar violations in future, and (c) the appellant has not been the victim of unlawful detention, which Article 5 is intended to avoid."", 'For these reasons ... I would dismiss this appeal.”']",['5'],"['5-4', '5-5']",[],['5'],['5-1'],['5-1-e']

On 20 August 1940 the applicant's father purchased a building located at 7 Intrarea Domneşti Street, Bucharest, which was made up of two blocks, A and B, containing three and two flats respectively."", '9. In 1950 the State nationalised the building under Decree no. 92/1950.', '10. On 7 February 1996 the applicant applied to the board established by the Bucharest City Council to deal with applications lodged under Law no. 112/1995 (“the Board”) seeking the return of the whole building under Law no. 112/1995 on the legal status of nationalised residential property (“Law no. 112/1995”).', '11. On 23 October 1996 the Board decided that buildings nationalised prior to 1989 in respect of which former owners had lodged a claim for restitution under Law no. 112/1995 or had brought an action for recovery of possession before the courts were not to be sold to tenants until their legal status had been clarified.', '12. On 23 February and 17 March 1997 the city council sold to the tenants the two flats in block B and the adjoining land, under Law no. 112/1995.', '13. On 20 March 1997 the applicant brought an action against the city council before the Bucharest Court of First Instance for recovery of possession of the entire building.', ""14. In a judgment of 10 April 1997 the court granted the action for recovery of possession and recognised the applicant as the building's owner. It held that the applicant's father had not been among those individuals to whom Decree no. 92/1950 had applied, since he was specifically excluded by its Article II. It ordered the city council to return the building to the applicant. The judgment became final and, in the absence of an appeal, became legally binding."", '15. On 16 April 1997, under Law no. 112/1995, the city council sold to the former tenants flat no. 2 – one of the three flats in block A of the building in question – and the adjoining land.', '16. By a decision of 22 July 1997, issued in compliance with the judgment of 10 April 1997, the city council ordered that the whole building be returned to the applicant.', '17. On 17 September 1997 the applicant and the representatives of the city council signed a memorandum assigning possession of the part of the building which had not been affected by the above-mentioned contracts of sale (see paragraphs 12 and 15 above). They noted that, in order for the rest of the building to be returned to the applicant, the contracts concluded with the tenants would first have to be set aside.', ""18. On 28 April 1998 the Board informed the applicant that he could no longer benefit from the reparation measures provided for in Law no. 112/1995, a piece of extraordinary legislation, since the building's return had been ordered in the judgment of 10 April 1997."", 'In 1999 the city council advised the applicant that, under Law no. 112/1995, he was entitled only to damages, and not to the return of the property.', '19. On 6 November 1997 the city council brought an action in the Bucharest Court of First Instance, seeking to have set aside the contracts of sale concluded with the tenants (see paragraphs 12 and 15 above). On 27 February 1998 the applicant asked to be allowed to take part in these proceedings; he too requested that the contracts be set aside.', ""20. In a judgment of 9 March 1999 the court dismissed the main claim lodged by the city council and allowed in part the applicant's interlocutory request."", 'At the same time, the court held that the agreements concerning the sale of the flats were valid, on the ground that the applicant had not proved that the parties thereto had been acting in bad faith. In those circumstances, it considered that it was open to the applicant to bring an action for recovery of possession in order to have his title to the property compared with those of the purchasers of the flats in question.', '21. The applicant appealed against that judgment.', ""In a judgment of 11 February 2000 the Bucharest County Court dismissed the applicant's appeal. It noted that he had not submitted evidence that would rebut the presumption of the purchasers' good faith and held that, when the contracts were concluded, the tenants could reasonably have assumed that the State was the rightful owner of the flats."", ""In assessing the parties' good faith, the court took into account that the applicant had not expressly notified the city council of his intention to seek the building's return. It dismissed the idea that communication of the introductory claim for recovery of possession amounted to notification, on the ground that the judgment of 10 April 1997 did not refer to the exact date on which the claim had been lodged."", 'The court also held that the purchasers would have been unable, by taking reasonable steps, to find out about the existence of the action for recovery of possession brought by the applicant against the city council.', '22. The applicant lodged a further appeal.', 'In a judgment of 30 May 2000, the Bucharest Court of Appeal gave judgment against him, considering that he had not proved that the purchasers were acting in bad faith when the contracts were concluded. It observed that possible bad faith on the part of the city council did not implicitly entail that of the purchasers.', ""The Court of Appeal also held that at the time of the sale the purchasers did not know, and could not have found out by taking reasonable steps, that the State was not the rightful owner of the building. In addition, it considered that the application for restitution lodged by the applicant with the city council in 1996 (see paragraph 10 above) did not affect the purchasers' good faith, given that in 1999 the local authorities had informed the applicant that, under Law no. 112/1995, he was entitled only to damages and not to the return of the property."", '23. In Romanian law, the concept of “title” refers to the legal act by which the right of ownership is acquired, namely, for example, through sale, gift or succession, or through the nationalisation law and its practical implementation in the actions of the legally empowered administrative authorities.', 'Decree no. 92/1950 was one of the nationalisation decrees that was widely applied with regard to immovable property; under it, numerous buildings, listed in the schedules annexed to the decree and which belonged to former industrialists, owners of large estates, bankers and owners of large trading enterprises, were nationalised. Article II of the decree expressly excluded from its scope immovable property belonging to workers, civil servants, small artisans, persons working in intellectual professions and retired persons.', '24. In the absence of special legislation governing the legal status of nationalised immovable property, the courts initially considered that they had jurisdiction to deal with cases concerning such property, particularly where it had been nationalised in application of Decree no. 92/1950. In those disputes, the national courts held that they had jurisdiction to rule on whether the provisions of the various nationalisation decrees met the substantive and procedural requirements laid down in the Constitutions in force when they were adopted.', 'During this initial phase, the loss of ownership as a result of nationalisation was considered to have involved a transfer of “title” if, at the time of expropriation, there had been compliance with the relevant decrees, the Constitution and the international treaties to which Romania was a party.', ""25. In a second period, subsequent to the Supreme Court of Justice's departure from precedent on 2 February 1995, the national courts no longer considered that they had jurisdiction to analyse the application of the nationalisation decrees and to order the return of immovable property nationalised in application of Decree no. 92/1950. They considered that legislation alone could bring the nationalisations carried out under Decree no. 92/1950 into accord with the provisions of the Constitution concerning the right of property (see also Brumărescu v. Romania [GC], no. 28342/95, § 37, ECHR 1999-VII)."", '26. In a third period the State enacted Law no. 112/1995, which allowed for the sale to tenants of nationalised buildings which had passed lawfully into the ownership of the State. The return of nationalised buildings to the former owners or their heirs was possible only if they lived in those buildings as tenants or if the property was unoccupied and had not been rented out. In respect of property which did not fulfil those conditions, it was open to the former owners to request compensation.', 'In decision no. 20/1996, which was binding on the authorities responsible for implementing the Law, the government defined nationalised buildings legally vested in the State as those which had passed into the ownership of the State under a legislative provision. Under the same decision, Law no. 112/1995 was not applicable to immovable property held de facto by the State, that is, where ownership was not based on any legislative provision, given that the State had no title to such property.', '27. Legal opinion, followed in practice by the national courts, found that State “title” as governed by decision no. 20/1996 implied the existence of a legislative provision authorising nationalisation. It was sufficient for the State merely to refer to legislation that was in force at the time of the nationalisation of a property for its expropriation to be considered as having taken place lawfully (F. Baias, B. Dumitrache and M. Nicolae, Regimul juridic al imobilelor preluate abuziv. Legea nr. 10/2001 comentată şi adnotată (“The legal status of wrongfully seized property. An annotated commentary on Law 10/2001”), Editura Rosetti, Bucharest, 2002, vol. I, p. 73; similarly, I. Adam, Legea nr. 10/2001. Regimul juridic aplicabil imobilelor preluate abuziv (“Law no. 10/2001. The legal regime applicable to wrongfully seized property”), Editura All Beck, Bucharest, 2003, p. 10; I. Adam, Drept civil. Drepturile reale (“Civil Law. Rights in rem”), Editura All Beck, Bucharest, 2002, pp. 319-23; and judgment no. 70/1998 of the Ploieşti Court of Appeal). It was thus sufficient that immovable property nationalised under Decree no. 92/1950 had been included in the schedules annexed to the decree for it to be considered as having been nationalised “by transfer of title”, irrespective of whether or not the substantive and procedural requirements imposed by the decree had been met at the time of nationalisation.', '28. Having sold off, under decision no. 20/1996, part of the immovable property considered to have been nationalised “by transfer of title”, in a fourth period, marked by the adoption and entry into force of government decision no. 11/1997 on 4 February 1997, the executive amended and added to the definition of the immovable property which had been nationalised “by transfer of title”. It introduced an additional condition: under Article 1 § 2 of the latter decision, property acquired by the State through transfer of title was that which had been acquired in accordance with the requirements of the decrees in force at the material time. The decision also provided:', '“...', '4. Residential property which passed into State ownership in violation of the legislative provision in force at the material time, or where State ownership was not based on any legislative provision, shall be considered as having passed into State ownership without title, and is excluded from the scope of Law no. 112/1995.', '5. A claim for restitution or compensation may be made under ordinary law in respect of immovable property which does not come within the scope of Law no. 112/1995 and for which the State has no valid title. ...”', '29. According to precedent, as confirmed by the practice of the domestic courts, decision no. 11/1997 is considered to apply not only to property expropriated in fact, but also to that acquired in violation of the legal requirements imposed by the nationalisation decree, both of which were held to have been nationalised “without title” (F. Baias, B. Dumitrache and M. Nicolae, op. cit, p. 74; similarly, I. Adam, Legea nr. 10/2001, cited above, p. 11, and Drept civil, cited above, p. 319; and judgment no. 510/2003 of the Supreme Court of Justice).', '30. Property acquired by the State under Decree no. 92/1950 was considered to have been nationalised by transfer of title if the legal requirements set out in Articles I §§ 1-5 and II of the decree were met on the date of the nationalisation and if, on that date, the person listed as owner on the annexed schedules was the real lawful owner.', '31. Section 6(1) of this Law provides:', '“Property acquired by the State between 6 March 1945 and 22 December 1989, provided that it passed into State ownership by virtue of a valid title, that is to say in a manner not contrary to the Constitution, to international treaties to which Romania was a party or to any legislation in force at the time of its transfer to the State, shall likewise form part of the public or private property of the State or other public authorities.”', ""32. After the State had sold off, under decision no. 11/1997, some of the property nationalised “by transfer of title”, Law no. 213/1998 introduced a new “validity” condition for State title; the validity of the State's right of ownership became subject to the compliance of the nationalisation decree and its administrative implementing acts with the Constitution, the international treaties to which Romania was a party and the laws in force at the date on which the property in question passed into State ownership. A contrario, in the absence of such compliance, the State did not have valid title and had thus not acquired ownership rights to the immovable property. The former owner could consequently claim it by applying to the competent courts for examination of the “validity” of State title (F. Baias, B. Dumitrache and M. Nicolae, op. cit., p. 75; similarly, I. Adam, Legea nr. 10/2001, cited above, p. 16, and Drept civil, cited above, pp. 324-30)."", '33. The courts granted actions for recovery of possession brought against the State where they considered that the relevant nationalisation decree had been applied in breach of the conditions set out in it (see, for example, judgment no. 860/1999 of the Cluj Court of Appeal; and judgments nos. 1184/2000 and 1787/2000 of the Supreme Court of Justice – application of nationalisation Decree no. 92/1950 to a person who was exempt from its application; judgments nos. 1239/1999 and 1293/1999 of the Constanţa Court of Appeal – failure to comply with the administrative formalities set out in nationalisation Decree no. 223/1974).', '34. In certain cases the Supreme Court of Justice decided, in application of the new condition introduced by Law no. 213/1998, that certain nationalisation decrees had been contrary to the Constitutions in force at the time of their adoption and to the international treaties to which Romania had been a party.', 'Thus, in judgment no. 46/2003, it held that Decree no. 92/1950 failed to comply with the 1948 Constitution; in judgment no. 2078/2000, it held that Decree no. 223/1974 was contrary to the 1965 Constitution on account of its discriminatory nature; in judgment no. 2434/2000, it stated that Decrees nos. 218/1960 and 712/1966 did not comply with the provisions of the 1952 and 1965 Constitutions respectively. This case-law was followed by some of the lower courts (for example, judgments nos. 1246R/2000 and 1140R/1999 of the Braşov Court of Appeal – published in M. Voicu and M. Popoacă, Dreptul de proprietate şi alte drepturi reale. Tratat de jurisprudenţă 1991\xad2002 (“The right of ownership and other real-property rights. Treatise on the case-law 1991-2002”), Editura Lumina Lex, Bucharest, 2002, p. 342 – which noted the failure of Decree no. 223/1974 to comply with the 1965 Constitution; judgment no. 1680/1998 of the Bacău Court of Appeal, published in M. Voicu and M. Popoacă, op. cit., p. 333).', '35. In other cases, the Supreme Court of Justice, followed by another group of courts, held that Decree no. 223/1974 conferred “valid State title” (judgments nos. 440/2003 and 709/2003, Supreme Court of Justice; no. 1R/2001, Târgu-Mureş Court of Appeal; nos. 761R/2001 and 1495R/2001, Braşov Court of Appeal; nos. 2062/1997 and 715/1999, Ploieşti Court of Appeal, published in M. Voicu and M. Popoacă, op. cit., p. 355).', '36. In addition, although the Supreme Court of Justice considered in judgments nos. 3696/2003 and 4009/2003 that Decree no. 223/1974 was contrary to the 1965 Constitution and the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it nonetheless held in judgment no. 2814/2004 that that decree conferred valid State title.', '37. As to Decree no. 92/1950, the Supreme Court of Justice ruled in judgments nos. 1424/2001, 1945/2001 and 46/2003 that it contravened the 1948 Constitution, although it held in judgments nos. 1005/2003 and 634/2004 that it conferred “valid State title”.', ""38. Where the seller is not the owner of the possession to be sold, Romanian legislation does not explicitly penalise the sale of someone else's property, which is not regulated by statute. Legal opinion and precedent have consistently noted that this does not deprive the rightful owner of his or her title (see, for example, judgment no. 2467/1992 of the Supreme Court of Justice, published in the journal Law, no. 10-11/1993, p. 113; judgment no. 132/1994 of the Supreme Court of Justice, published in the journal Law, no. 5/1995, p. 77; judgment no. 197/1996 of the Bacău Court of Appeal, published in The Case-Law of the Bacău Court of Appeal in 1996, p. 18; judgment no. 486/1999 of the Bacău Court of Appeal). In practice, the contract of sale concluded between a seller who is not the owner and the purchaser is binding on them alone (res inter alios acta) and not in respect of the rightful owner; the property does not cease to belong to the rightful owner, who continues to be free to dispose of it (see, for example, judgment no. 132/1994 of the Supreme Court of Justice, Case-Law Reports, 1994, p. 39)."", 'The fate of the contract depends on the good or bad faith of the parties to it. If the parties acted in bad faith in concluding the contract, in that they were aware that the seller was not the owner of the property, legal opinion and the case-law generally consider that the sale was a speculative operation, was unlawful in purpose and, accordingly, that it is null and void (fraus omnia corrumpit) (see, for example, judgment no. 419R/1994 of the Galaţi Court of Appeal, published in Summary of the Judicial Practice of the Galaţi Court of Appeal, 1 July 1993\xad31 December 1994, p. 84).', ""If the parties to the contract, or at least the purchaser, concluded the sale in good faith and if the purchaser was persuaded that the seller fulfilled all the legal requirements to be entitled to transfer title (Article 1899 § 1 of the Civil Code), the contract is tainted only by relative nullity (see, for example, judgment no. 2467/1992 of the Supreme Court of Justice, published in the journal Law, no. 10-11/1993, p. 113; judgment 190/1979 of the Olt County Court, published in the Romanian Law Journal, no. 6/1980). The lawful owner cannot apply to have such a sale set aside, because he or she is not a party to the contract, but he or she does have the option of defending his or her title by means of an action for recovery of possession if the property is in the purchaser's possession (see, for example, judgment no. 279/1976 of the Supreme Court, Case-Law Reports, 1976, p. 81; judgment no. 2467/1992 of the Supreme Court of Justice, published in the journal Law, no. 10-11/1993, p. 113; judgment 2207/1967 of the Supreme Court, delivered on 1 January 1967 and published in the Romanian Law Journal, no. 5/1968, p. 161; judgment no. 132/1994 of the Supreme Court of Justice, published in the journal Law, no. 5/1995, p. 77; judgment no. 197/1996 of the Bacău Court of Appeal, published in The Case-Law of the Bacău Court of Appeal in 1996, p. 18)."", ""39. Legal opinion and the case-law define an action for recovery of possession, which is not regulated by statute, as an action by which the owner of a specific individual property who has lost possession of it to a third party seeks to have his or her title to the property re-established and to obtain possession of it from the third party, who is not the owner. The claim, as an indefeasible action to establish title which is not subject to limitation of time, is intended to establish directly the existence of the claimant's title; obtaining possession is merely an incidental effect."", 'The Romanian courts have considered that it is sufficient during recovery proceedings to examine the two titles, namely those of the claimant and the respondent, in order that the court examining the action may declare that one of them had priority (este mai caracterizat) over the other on account, for example, of its chronological priority or the fact that it had previously been included in a land register (see, for example, judgment no. 2543/1996 of the Ploieşti Court of Appeal, published in M. Voicu and M. Popoacă, op. cit., p. 358, and judgment no. 1554/2000 of the Cluj Court of Appeal).', '40. The new Law establishes the principle of the return of unlawfully nationalised property, subject to certain exceptions, including one concerning buildings sold to tenants under Law no. 112/1995, introduced by section 18(d) of Law no. 10/2001. Where return of property is not possible, the former owners are entitled to compensation. The relevant sections of Law no. 10/2001 provide:', '“...', '(2) Persons who were owners of immovable property seized by the State without valid title shall conserve their title ...”', '“The compensation awarded to former owners shall be exclusively in the form of damages:', '...', '(d) the building was sold to the former tenant in compliance with the provisions of Law no. 112/1995 ...”', '“...', '(2) The sale or donation of immovable property unlawfully seized by the State shall be declared null and void, save where these transactions were concluded in good faith. ...”', '41. On 18 April 2003 the government adopted decision no. 498/2003 on the uniform application of Law no. 10/2001, which enshrines the principle of the stability of property relations by upholding the rights of persons who acquired nationalised immovable property in good faith (in judgment no. 2822/2003, the Supreme Court of Justice held that, if the immovable property had been sold to the tenants and the former owner had not obtained rescission of the contract of sale, the immovable property could not be returned to him or her under Law no. 10/2001).', '42. The aim of decision no. 498/2003 was to preserve the legal status of property which had already been sold under Law no. 112/1995. In respect of section 46(2) of Law no. 10/2001, it stated:', ""“Sales concluded prior to Law no. 213/1998, under Law no. 112/1995 and in compliance with the latter's conditions, enjoy the full protection afforded by Law no. 10/2001 in that their effects are recognised and maintained. With regard to sales concluded after the enactment of Law no. 213/1998, the maintenance or, as appropriate, rescission of the conveyancing act is subject to evidence of the purchaser's good faith when the sale was concluded.”"", ""43. Romanian legal opinion and the domestic courts have given at least five different interpretations, some of them conflicting, of sections 18(d) and 46(2) of Law no. 10/2001 and their effects (see, for example, F. Baias, B. Dumitrache and M. Nicolae, op. cit., p. 294; “Discuţii cu privire la admisibilitatea acţiunii în revendicare a adevăratului proprietar împotriva subdobânditorului de bună credinţă al unui imobil” (“Examination of the admissibility of an action for recovery of possession by the lawful owner against the purchaser in good faith of a property 'P' ”) – or R. Popescu, E. Dincă, first part, and P. Perju, second part, Law, no. 6/2001, pp. 5 and 18; I. Adam, Legea nr. 10/2001, cited above, p. 9; D. Chirica, “Regimul juridic al revendicării imobilelor preluate de stat fără titlu valabil de la subdobânditorii care se prevalează de buna lor credinţă la data cumpărării” (“The rules governing actions for the recovery of possession of immovable property appropriated by the State without valid title, brought against purchasers who rely on their good faith at the time of the sale”), Law, no. 8/2002, p. 59)."", '44. In a consistent series of rulings, the Supreme Court of Justice has dismissed as inadmissible actions for the recovery of possession of nationalised buildings brought by the former owner against the State or the purchasers following the entry into force of Law no. 10/2001 (see, for example, judgments nos. 1856/2003; 2601/2003; 2810/2003; 3164/2004; 4705/2004; 4109/2003; 3702/2003; 1400/2004; 1426/2004; 3652/2004).', ""45. In a series of more recent judgments, the Supreme Court of Justice has dismissed actions for recovery of possession brought by former owners against purchasers following the entry into force of Law no. 10/2001 while indicating that, where the courts had upheld the sale of someone else's property, this consolidated, ipso jure, the transfer of title to the purchasers, as such an effect was inherent in the contract of sale and could not be overturned through a comparison of the competing titles to the same property (judgments nos. 3962/2003, 4229/2003, 5555/2003 or 5395/2004 of the Supreme Court of Justice)."", ""46. In other judgments, the Supreme Court of Justice has dismissed actions brought against purchasers for recovery of possession by applying the theory of appearances (see, for example, judgments nos. 4268/2002, 2685/2003 and 634/2004), without however explaining the nature of the joint and unavoidable error or the difference between that and mere good faith on the part of the purchaser (in judgment no. 709/2003, the Supreme Court of Justice noted the purchasers' “public” error at the time of the sale, because they had considered, when concluding the sale, that the State was the rightful owner of the immovable property; it also noted that the purchasers had been acting in good faith because they had believed that the State was the true owner. In contrast, in judgment no. 132/2004 it refused to apply the same theory on the ground that the purchaser had not proved the existence of a joint and unavoidable error)."", ""47. On several occasions, the Supreme Court of Justice took the view that section 46(2) of Law no. 10/2001 was applicable in proceedings introduced before that provision was enacted and dismissed actions for recovery of possession brought by the former owner against the purchaser on the basis that the assumption of the purchaser's good faith was to take priority (see, for example, judgments nos. 1/2003, 4894/2003 and 3835/2003). It also considered that the absolute nullity of the sale was an essential premise for the admission of an action against the purchaser for recovery of possession (judgment no. 439/2003)."", ""48. In other judgments the Supreme Court of Justice and the other domestic courts have dismissed actions for recovery of possession on account of the purchaser's good faith without reference to Law no. 10/2001 (see, for example, judgments no. 759R/2001, Braşov Court of Appeal; no. 470/A/2000, Bucharest Court of Appeal, upheld by judgment no. 2702/2002 of the Supreme Court of Justice; and nos. 3787/2003, 3737/2003 and 555/2004 of the Supreme Court of Justice)."", ""49. In accordance with the definition given by Article 1898 § 1 of the Civil Code, good faith is “a conviction on the part of the occupier that the seller met all the legal requirements to be able to transfer title”. Thus, in judgment no. 4894/2003, the Supreme Court of Justice considered that good faith consisted in the purchasers' conviction that they had concluded a contract with the rightful owner and in compliance with the legal provisions in force at the time the contract was concluded, and that those two conditions had been met in the case in question."", '50. Bad faith has been defined by Romanian legal opinion as the attitude of a person who carries out an action or an act in breach of the law while being fully aware of the unlawful nature of his or her conduct (see S. Ghimpu, G. Brehoi, G. Mocanu, A. Popescu and I. Urs, Dicţionar juridic, Editura Albatros, Bucharest, 1985).', ""51. Certain domestic courts have ruled that the purchaser must be asked to provide evidence that he or she took reasonable steps to establish the legal status of the property. Other courts have taken the view that the purchaser's good faith should be presumed and that it was for the other party to prove bad faith. Thus, there is no consistent case-law indicating either which party bears the burden of proving good faith or the facts which the party wishing to contest that good faith is required to prove."", ""52. In judgment no. 510/2003, the Supreme Court of Justice upheld an action for recovery of possession brought by the former owner of a nationalised building, holding that the purchaser's bad faith “did not seem open to question, given that ... he knew or might have known that the building was likely to be claimed by the former owners, that he could and indeed ought to have apprised himself of the steps taken by the former owner to recover possession, and that his passivity was to be taken into account”. It also ruled – in judgment no. 4218/2002 – that it was inconceivable that, when purchasing such a significant item of property as a building, the tenant would have failed to take reasonable steps to establish that property's legal status."", ""In addition, it stated – in judgment no. 4623/2002 – that, as a minimum and prior to conclusion of the sale agreement, the purchaser ought to have checked whether an application for restitution had been submitted in respect of the building under Law no. 112/1995 or whether an action for recovery of possession was pending, failing which his good faith could be questioned. In judgment no. 4561/2003, the Supreme Court of Justice considered that the purchaser's lack of information or ignorance with regard to the legal status of the property acquired was not such as to excuse his or her mistake."", '53. In judgment no. 3962/2003, however, the Supreme Court of Justice indicated that the failure by a tenant to take steps to establish the legal status of the building which he was in the process of acquiring had no legal consequences.', 'In other judgments, the Supreme Court of Justice applied the principle set out in Article 1899 § 2 of the Civil Code, by which good faith is presumed and bad faith must be demonstrated by the party relying on it, but without however examining the steps that the purchaser had or had not taken prior to purchasing a nationalised property (see, for example, judgments nos. 781/2003; 5359/2003; 1476/2004; 2559/2004; 3855/2004; and 4229/2003).']",[],[],[],[],[],[]

The second applicant, Mr Anton Georg Risch, was born in 1927 and lives in Vaduz. The third applicant, Mr Paul Arnold Risch, was born in 1937 and lives in Triesen. The fourth applicant, Mr Mamertus Risch, was born in 1939 and lives in Triesen. The fifth to ninth applicants are the heirs of Walter Risch: Wolfgang Risch (born in 1952 and living in Balzers), Hannelore Steger (born in 1954 and living in Schaan), Eva Ott (born in 1954 and living in Schaan), Josef Risch (born in 1956 and living in Balzers) and Natascha Strampella (born in 1971 and living in Schaan). All the applicants are Liechtenstein nationals. They were represented before the Court by Mr W.L. Weh, a lawyer practising in Bregenz, Austria.', 'The applicants are joint owners of two adjacent plots of land in Schellenberg, registered under files nos. 55/IV and 67/IV of the Schellenberg land register. In an area zoning plan, the Schellenberg municipality designated these plots of land as non-building land.', 'On 15 July 1997 the applicants in application no. 63151/00 (that is, the first, second, third and fourth applicants in the present case and Walter Risch, who died after the termination of the proceedings at issue in that application) requested the Liechtenstein Government to pay them compensation for damage allegedly incurred as a result of the designation of their land as non-building land.', 'On 2 June 1998 the Liechtenstein Government dismissed that request.', ""On 25 June 1999 the Liechtenstein Administrative Court, sitting in camera, dismissed the applicants' appeal against the Government's decision. In these proceedings the Schellenberg municipality, as the respondent party, had filed reasoned submissions on 21 October 1998 requesting the Administrative Court to dismiss the applicants' appeal, inter alia because the applicants' property had not been opened up for development purposes. These comments were not served on the applicants."", ""In its decision, the Administrative Court included a detailed summary of the comments submitted by the Schellenberg municipality. It noted that the conditions for compensation had not been met, inter alia because, contrary to the applicants' submissions, the applicants' property had not been opened up for development purposes. When the zoning plan was issued, the applicants could not have legitimately expected their property to be designated as building land. As to the applicants' request that the parties be heard on that issue, the Administrative Court considered that the applicants had filed very detailed written submissions and had therefore been given sufficient opportunity to submit their arguments and evidence."", ""On 29 February 2000 the Liechtenstein Constitutional Court dismissed the applicants' complaint (file no. StGH 1999/26). It found, in particular, that the failure to afford the applicants an opportunity to comment on the Schellenberg municipality's submissions before the Administrative Court had not breached their right to a fair trial. Even though the said submissions had contained some new information, the applicants had not suffered any prejudice as the new information had not had any bearing on the Administrative Court's decision."", 'On 12 October 2000 the applicants in application no. 63151/00 lodged their application with the Court.', 'In its judgment of 19 May 2005 in the case of Steck-Risch and Others v. Liechtenstein the Court found that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in that the principle of equality of arms had been disregarded. The Court found as follows:', ""“56. In the present case, the Schellenberg municipality, being the opposing party in the compensation proceedings at issue, filed comments on the applicants' appeal to the Administrative Court, requesting it to dismiss that appeal. It is not contested that these comments were not served on the applicants and that they had no opportunity to reply to them. This deficiency it not remedied by the fact that the applicants could complain to the Constitutional Court, as the latter does not carry out a full review of the case."", ""57. The Court is not convinced by the Government's argument that, in contrast to the Ziegler case (cited above), the Administrative Court did not rely on these comments. It is true that that Court did not rely on the municipality's assertion that the applicants' father had not filed an objection against the area zoning plan. However, it did have regard to its submissions on the question of whether the applicants' land was opened up for building. In any case, the municipality's observations contained a reasoned opinion on the merits of the applicants' appeal. The Court has repeatedly held that in such a situation the effect which the observations actually had on the judgment is of little consequence. What is particularly at stake here is the litigants' confidence in the workings of justice, which is based on, inter alia, the knowledge that they have had the opportunity to express their views on every document in the file (Nideröst-Huber, cited above, p. 108, §§ 27, 29; Ziegler, cited above, § 38)."", '58. In the present case, respect for the right to a fair trial, guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, required that the applicants be given an opportunity to have knowledge of and to comment on the observations submitted by the opposing party, namely the Schellenberg municipality. However, the applicants were not afforded this possibility.”', ""As regards the application of Article 41 of the Convention, the Court noted the applicants' argument that they had suffered pecuniary damage as their land would be worth more had it been designated as building land, which, in the applicants' contention, would have been the case had the violations of the Convention not occurred. It found, however, that there was no causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage claimed and that it was not called upon to speculate what the outcome of the proceedings would have been if they had been in conformity with the requirements of Article 6 § 1. Therefore, it made no award in respect of pecuniary damage."", ""As to the applicants' request that the Court order a reopening of the domestic proceedings, the Court reiterated that it was primarily for the State concerned to choose the means to be used in its domestic legal order in order to discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means were compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court's judgment. This discretion as to the manner of execution of a judgment reflected the freedom of choice attaching to the primary obligation of the Contracting States under the Convention to secure the rights and freedoms guaranteed (the Court referred to Assanidze v. Georgia, no. 71503/01, § 202, ECHR 2004-II). Only in very exceptional circumstances had the Court ordered individual measures of redress (ibid, §§ 202-203). The Court considered that no such circumstances pertained in the case before it."", ""The Court's judgment in application no. 63151/00 having become final on 19 August 2005, the applicants in that application lodged a request with the Administrative Court on 2 September 2005 to reopen the compensation proceedings."", ""On 19 October 2006 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicants' request."", ""The Administrative Court found that the applicants had not substantiated that the conditions for reopening the proceedings under section 104 of the Act on Administrative Procedures (Landesverwaltungspflegegesetz; see “Relevant domestic and international law and practice” below) had been met. It further decided not to reopen the proceedings ex officio under section 105 of the Act on Administrative Procedures (see “Relevant domestic and international law and practice” below). The Administrative Court referred to the findings of the Constitutional Court in its decision of 29 February 2000. It noted that the latter had considered that the submissions by the municipality of Schellenberg had contained new facts which had not, however, had any bearing on the reasoning of the Administrative Court dismissing the applicants' appeal in its decision of 25 June 1999."", ""The Administrative Court considered that the Court's finding of a violation of the Convention was not a reason to reopen the proceedings under Liechtenstein law. Article 46 of the Convention did not contain an obligation to reopen proceedings. Accordingly, in its judgment of 19 May 2005 the Court had rejected the applicants' request to order a reopening of the proceedings before the domestic courts. There were no new aspects which the Administrative Court had been unable to take into consideration in its first judgment."", ""On 29 November 2006 the applicants lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court against the Administrative Court's decision. They claimed, inter alia, that the refusal to reopen the proceedings had violated their right to a fair trial. In particular, the Administrative Court's reference to the Constitutional Court's finding, in its decision of 29 February 2000, that the comments made by the municipality of Schellenberg had been irrelevant to the reasoning of the Administrative Court's first decision had been arbitrary."", ""On 3 July 2007 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicants' constitutional complaint (file no. StGH 2006/111)."", ""The Constitutional Court took note of the Court's finding that Article 6 of the Convention had been breached in the proceedings before the Liechtenstein Administrative Court. However, under the provisions of the Convention that finding did not mean that the final judgment of the Liechtenstein court had to be quashed, as the Contracting Parties to the Convention were not obliged to accord such an effect to the Court's judgments."", ""The Constitutional Court considered not to be arbitrary, but in fact convincing, the Administrative Court's finding that Liechtenstein law (in particular section 104 § 1 of the Act on Administrative Procedures read in conjunction with Article 498 of the Code of Civil Procedure, section 104 § 2 and section 105 of the Act on Administrative Procedures; see “Relevant domestic and international law and practice” below) did not provide for a reopening of the proceedings in respect of a decision taken by the Administrative Court itself or by the Constitutional Court following a finding by this Court that that decision had violated the Convention. Such a finding had to be classified as a new legal assessment, but not as a new fact or new evidence which would alone justify a reopening under the applicable legal provisions."", 'The Constitutional Court further noted that the Court, in its judgment of 19 May 2005, had found that there was no causal connection between the violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention found and the pecuniary damage claimed by the applicants. The Court further awarded the applicants costs under Article 41 of the Convention without examining and irrespective of the question whether restitution, including a reopening of the proceedings, could be granted under Liechtenstein law.', ""The Constitutional Court considered that, in the present case, the Court's finding of a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention was sufficient restitution. The Contracting Parties to the Convention were not obliged to provide for a reopening of proceedings which had been terminated by a final decision in cases in which the Court had found that a procedural right under Article 6 had been disregarded. It conceded that this finding was unsatisfactory in cases in which a reopening of the proceedings was necessary in order to grant redress. It noted that in several other Contracting Parties to the Convention, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the law permitted the reopening of proceedings following the finding of a violation by the Court under certain circumstances. However, it was for the legislator, not the courts, to provide for a reopening of the proceedings."", 'The Constitutional Court further left open whether respect for the right to equality could warrant a reopening of proceedings if otherwise the result would be blatantly unjust. In any event, a blatant injustice had not occurred in the present case. Not only had the Court found that there was no causal link between the violation of the Convention found and the damage claimed by the applicants, the applicants had also been awarded the costs incurred in the proceedings because of the breach of Article 6.', ""The Constitutional Court expressly accepted the Court's judgment, according to which a breach of Article 6 § 1 had occurred. It agreed, however, with the Administrative Court, which had found that its decision, in respect of which the applicants requested a reopening of the proceedings, was not based on that breach. Therefore, the Court's finding of a violation of the Convention was sufficient and further measures of restitution were not necessary."", ""The decision was served on the applicants' counsel on 28 November 2007."", 'On 2 September 2005 the applicants, in addition to their application lodged with the Administrative Court, also requested the Constitutional Court to reopen the proceedings which it had terminated by its decision of 29 February 2000, to quash the decision of the Administrative Court of 25 June 1999 and to order that court to take a new decision in fresh proceedings.', ""On 3 July 2007 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicants' request for the proceedings before it to be reopened under section 51 § 1 of the Constitutional Court Act (see “Relevant domestic and international law and practice” below). Referring to the reasons given in its decision taken on the same day in complaint no. StGH 2006/111, it found that it was sufficient for it to confirm that the failure to serve the comments of the Schellenberg municipality of 21 October 1998 on the applicants had breached their rights under Article 6 § 1 (file no. StGH 2005/68)."", ""The decision was served on the applicants' counsel on 28 November 2007."", ""On 20 December 2006 – that is, at a time when the reopening proceedings were still pending before the Constitutional Court – the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, in its 982th session, concluded its examination of the execution of the Court's judgment of 19 May 2005 in the case of Steck-Risch and Others v.

The Constitutional Court has already taken account of the possible effect of the violation on the proceedings, holding that the applicants had not suffered any prejudice (see below).', '... General measures', ""Stating that the principle of equality of arms is a basic element of fairness of proceedings, the Constitutional Court agreed with the applicants' argument that they should have been afforded an opportunity to be informed of and to comment upon the municipality's observations. It did note, however, that while the submission contained new information, it had played no role in the Administrative Court's decision and therefore no prejudice had occurred. Thus the Constitutional Court concluded that the applicants' procedural rights had not been interfered with."", ""Citing its case-law, the European Court held that the actual effect of the observations on the judgment was of little consequence, as it was above all the litigants' confidence in the work of justice which was at stake.

The applicant, an Italian national, was born in 1942 and lives in Florence.', '7. On an unspecified date, G., a minor, complained to the County Department of Public Safety in Seattle (United States) that while on holiday in Italy he had been indecently assaulted by the applicant, a caretaker in the halls of residence where he had been staying. Consequently, the Florence public prosecutor’s office brought criminal proceedings against the applicant for sexual assault on a minor and gross indecency in a public place.', '8. On 16 March 1991 the Florence public prosecutor sent international rogatory letters to the Criminal Division of the King County District Court in Seattle pursuant to the Treaty for Mutual Assistance in Criminal Proceedings between the Government of the Italian Republic and the Government of the United States of America (“the Mutual Assistance Treaty”), which had been ratified by Law no. 224 of 1984. The aim of the rogatory letters was for questions to be put to G., his father (Mr D.) and Miss F., the doctor in whom G. had first confided. The public prosecutor set out in detail the questions which he considered should be put to the witnesses and the manner in which the record of interview should be drafted. He added that no lawyer should be present during the interview.', '9. On 6 November 1991 Mr D. was questioned by a Seattle police officer. No lawyer was present at the interview. In essence, he confirmed that his son had said that he had been fondled by the applicant. On 26 May 1992 the Italian Consulate-General in San Francisco (United States) received the record of the interview from the American authorities with two documents containing written statements by G.’s mother (Mrs D.) and Mrs N., a child psychotherapist who was treating G. for the behavioural disorders he presented. In their statements, Mrs N. recited the events that G. had related to her and the traumatic effects they had had, while Mrs D. confirmed her husband’s version of events. The documents were then translated into Italian and sent to the Florence public prosecutor.', '10. The applicant was committed for trial before the Florence Criminal Court.', '11. On 25 October 1993 the Florence public prosecutor applied to the President of the Criminal Court for permission to summons G., Mr and Mrs D. and Mrs N. to appear at a public hearing on 23 November 1993 for questioning. The case file does not reveal whether that application was granted or whether the witnesses concerned were served with summonses to attend. Whatever the position, none of them appeared at the trial before the Criminal Court and the examination requested by the public prosecutor did not take place.', '12. On 23 November 1993 two police officers from Florence were questioned. They indicated that they had received G.’s complaint from the American authorities and gave a description of the hall of residence where the applicant had been working at the material time.', '13. At the request of the public prosecutor and despite opposition by the applicant, the Criminal Court ordered that the documents received from the United States, in particular the record of the interview with Mr D. and the statements of Mrs D. and Mrs N., should be read out. That decision was taken pursuant to Article 512 bis of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP), which provides: “On application by a party and having regard to the other evidence, the judge may order that the records of the statements made by a foreign national living outside the Italian territory be read out if either that person has not been summonsed to appear or, having been so summonsed, has failed to appear.” The applicant and the defence witnesses gave evidence that same day.', '14. In a judgment of 19 January 1994, which was deposited with the registry on 19 March 1994, the court imposed a two-year suspended sentence on the applicant. That decision was taken on the basis of the complaint lodged by G. with the Department of Public Safety in Seattle and the statements made by Mr and Mrs D. and Mrs N., which the court found to be credible and consistent.', '15. On 26 April 1994 the applicant appealed to the Florence Court of Appeal. He argued, inter alia, that the acts performed pursuant to the rogatory letters were invalid. In that connection, he noted that G. had never been interviewed and that evidence had been taken from Mrs D. and Mrs N. – whom the Florence public prosecutor had not sought to interview – without authority. Furthermore, they had not been questioned but had merely made written statements. As regards Mr D.’s interview, the American police officer who had conducted it had been acting without authority, given that the international rogatory letters had been sent to the District Court in Seattle. Moreover, no lawyer had been present when the interviews and statements were obtained and the persons concerned had not been asked to take the oath, which showed that the documents did not constitute “testimony”, but merely “preliminary investigative acts”. As such, they should not have been used by the Florence Criminal Court as evidence of the accused’s guilt. Lastly, the applicant contended that Article 512 bis CCP was not applicable in the instant case as that provision referred only to statements made in Italy.', '16. In a judgment of 17 May 1996, which was deposited with the registry on 23 May 1996, the Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the Criminal Court. It observed that by virtue of the locus regit actum principle, acts performed under rogatory letters had to be regulated by the law of the foreign State to which the Italian authorities had referred, provided that the foreign law was not incompatible with Italian public order and in particular “defence rights”. In the instant case, the procedure followed by the Seattle authorities could not be regarded as having infringed those rights as Article 512 bis CCP allowed statements made in Italy or elsewhere by foreign nationals resident outside the national territory to be read out. As regards the fact that G. had not been questioned, the Court of Appeal considered that it was quite understandable that the American police should have wished to prevent the minor, who had been affected psychologically by the violence he had endured, from suffering any further trauma.', '17. On 29 June 1996 the applicant appealed to the Court of Cassation. Referring to the arguments he had raised before the Court of Appeal, he repeated his case that the documents obtained through rogatory letters should not have been used to decide his guilt. He also maintained that Article 431 § 1 (d) CCP, which requires that a record of acts performed outside the Italian territory by rogatory letters be lodged on the judge’s file (fascicolo per il dibattimento), was unconstitutional. He considered in particular that that provision was incompatible with Articles 3 and 24 of the Italian Constitution, which respectively guarantee the equality of all citizens before the law and the right to defend oneself at every stage of the proceedings. In that connection, he stressed that he had been given no opportunity to question Mr D., Mrs D. or Mrs N., whose statements had formed the basis of his conviction.', '18. In a judgment of 17 January 1997, which was deposited with the registry on 2 April 1997, the Court of Cassation cited the provisions of Article 512 bis CCP, which it held to be applicable in the instant case, and declared the issue of constitutionality raised by the applicant irrelevant. Finding that the reasons given by the Florence Court of Appeal on all the issues in dispute had been cogent and correct, it dismissed the applicant’s appeal.', '19. Under the terms of Article 1 of the Mutual Assistance Treaty, the signatory States undertake to afford each other mutual assistance in criminal investigations and proceedings.

The applicants were born in 1977 and 1971 respectively and live in London.', '7. Between 9 and 12 September 2003 there was a Defence Systems and Equipment International Exhibition (“the arms fair”) at the Excel Centre in Docklands, East London, which was the subject of protests and demonstrations.', '8. At about 10.30 a.m. on 9 September 2003 the first applicant was riding a bicycle and carrying a rucksack near the arms fair, on his way to join the demonstration. He was stopped and searched by two police officers who told him he was being searched under section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 (“the 2000 Act”: see paragraphs 28-34 below) for articles which could be used in connection with terrorism. He was handed a notice to that effect. The first applicant claimed he was told in response to his question as to why he was being stopped that it was because a lot of protesters were about and the police were concerned that they would cause trouble. Nothing incriminating was found (although computer printouts giving information about the demonstration were seized by the officers) and the first applicant was allowed to go on his way. He was detained for roughly 20 minutes.', ""9. At about 1.15 p.m. on 9 September 2003, the second applicant, wearing a photographer's jacket, carrying a small bag and holding a camera in her hand, was stopped close to the arms fair. She had apparently emerged from some bushes. The second applicant, a journalist, was in the area to film the protests. She was searched by a police officer from the Metropolitan Police notwithstanding that she showed her press cards to show who she was. She was told to stop filming. The police officer told her that she was using her powers under sections 44 and 45 of the 2000 Act. Nothing incriminating was found and the second applicant was allowed to go on her way. The record of her search showed she was stopped for five minutes but she thought it was more like thirty minutes. She claimed to have felt so intimidated and distressed that she did not feel able to return to the demonstration although it had been her intention to make a documentary or sell footage of it."", ""10. The applicants sought to challenge the legality of the stop and search powers used against them by way of judicial review. Prior to the High Court hearing, the Secretary of State offered the applicants a procedure which would have enabled the High Court to review in closed session, with the benefit of submissions from a special advocate, the underlying intelligence material which had been the basis for the Secretary of State's decision to confirm the authorisation (section 46 of the 2000 Act: see paragraphs 30-31 below). The applicants, however, indicated that they did not consider it necessary or appropriate to proceed in this way, since they did not intend to challenge the assessment that there was a general threat of terrorism against the United Kingdom. Instead, they contended, first, that the authorisation and confirmation in question, since they formed part of a rolling programme of authorisations covering the entire London area, were ultra vires and unlawful, since there were a number of clear indications that Parliament had intended an authorisation under section 44 of the 2000 Act (“a section 44 authorisation”) to be given and confirmed only in response to an imminent terrorist threat to a specific location in respect of which normal police powers of stop and search were inadequate. Secondly, the applicants claimed that the use of the section 44 authorisation by police officers to stop and search them at the arms fair was contrary to the legislative purpose and unlawful and that the guidance given to police officers was either non-existent or calculated to cause officers to misuse the powers. Thirdly, the applicants claimed that the section 44 authorisations and the exercise of powers under them constituted a disproportionate interference with their rights under Articles 5, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the Convention."", '11. On 31 October 2003, the Divisional Court dismissed the application ([2003] EWHC 2545). Lord Justice Brooke, giving the judgment of the court, held that Parliament had envisaged that a section 44 authorisation might cover the whole of a police area as a response to a general threat of terrorist activity on a substantial scale and that the authorisation and the subsequent confirmation by the Secretary of State were not ultra vires.', ""Brooke LJ held as follows, in connection with the applicants' second ground of challenge:"", '“The powers conferred on the police under section 44 are powers which most British people would have hoped were completely unnecessary in this country, particularly in time of peace. People have always been free to come and go in this country as they wish unless the police have reasonable cause to stop them. Parliament has, however, judged that the contemporary threats posed by international terrorism and dissident Irish terrorism are such that as a people we should be content that the police should be able to stop and search us at will for articles that might be connected with terrorism.', 'It is elementary that if the police abuse these powers and target them disproportionately against those whom they perceive to be no particular friends of theirs the terrorists will have to that extent won. The right to demonstrate peacefully against an arms fair is just as important as the right to walk or cycle about the streets of London without being stopped by the police unless they have reasonable cause. If the police wish to use this extraordinary power to stop and search without cause they must exercise it in a way that does not give rise to legitimate complaints of arbitrary abuse of power.', ""We are not, however, satisfied that the police's conduct on 9th September entitles either Mr Gillan or Ms Quinton to a public law remedy. There is just enough evidence available to persuade us that, in the absence of any evidence that these powers were being habitually used on occasions which might represent symbolic targets, the arms fair was an occasion which concerned the police sufficiently to persuade them that the use of section 44 powers was needed ... . But it was a fairly close call, and the Metropolitan Police would do well to review their training and briefing and the language of the standard forms they use for section 44 stop/searches if they wish to avoid a similar challenge in future. ...”"", 'Finally, the court found that the powers were provided for by law and not disproportionate, given the risk of terrorist attack in London.', '12. The Court of Appeal gave judgment on 29 July 2004 ([2004] EWCA Civ 1067). As to the proper interpretation of the legislation, it held that:', '“It is clear that Parliament, unusually, has permitted random stopping and searching, but, as we have already indicated when examining the language of the relevant sections, made the use of that power subject to safeguards. The power is only to be used for a single specified purpose for a period of an authorisation granted by a senior officer and confirmed by the Secretary of State. Furthermore, the authorisation only has a limited life unless renewed.', ""We do not find it surprising that the word 'expedient' should appear in section 44(3) in conjunction with the power to authorise. The statutory scheme is to leave how the power is to be used to the discretion of the senior officer. In agreement with the Divisional Court, we would give the word its ordinary meaning of advantageous. It is entirely consistent with the framework of the legislation that a power of this sort should be exercised when a senior police officer considers it is advantageous to exercise the power for the prevention of acts of terrorism."", 'Interpreted in this way, sections 44 and 45 could not conflict with the provisions of the Articles of the ECHR. If those Articles were to be infringed it would be because of the manner of the exercise of the power, not its existence. Any possible infringement of the ECHR would depend on the circumstances in which the power that the sections give is exercised.”', ""13. The Court of Appeal did not consider it necessary to determine whether Article 5 § 1 applied, since it held that any deprivation of liberty was justifiable under Article 5 § 1(b). However it held that, if the point had to be decided, the better view was that there was no deprivation of liberty, taking into account the likely limited nature of any infringement in a normal stop and search and the fact that the main aim would not be to deprive an individual of his liberty but rather to effect a verification of one form or another. Nor did it consider that Articles 10 and 11 applied. Although the applicants' evidence gave some cause for concern that the power had been used against them to control or deter their attendance at the demonstration, those issues had not been tested because the thrust of their argument was directed at the conformity of the legislation with the Convention and, properly used as a measure of limited duration to search for articles connected with terrorism, the stop and search power would not impinge on the rights to freedom of expression or assembly."", ""14. The respondent Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police had conceded that the stop and search measures amounted to interferences with the applicants' Article 8 rights, and the Court of Appeal accepted that this was the correct approach, describing section 44 as “an extremely wide power to intrude on the privacy of the members of the public”. It considered that the interference was, however, in accordance with the law, for the following reasons:"", ""“'The law' that is under criticism here is the statute, not the authorisation. That law is just as much a public record as is any other statute. And the provisions are not arbitrary in any relevant sense. Although the police officer does not have to have grounds for suspecting the presence of suspicious articles before stopping a citizen in any particular case (section 45(1)(b)), he can only be authorised to use those powers for limited purposes, and where a decision has been made that the exercise of the powers is expedient for the serious purpose of the prevention of acts of terrorism (section 44(3)). The system, so controlled, cannot be said to be arbitrary in any sense that deprives it of the status of 'law' in the autonomous meaning of that term as understood in Convention jurisprudence. In addition, while the authorisations and their confirmation are not published because not unreasonably it is considered publication could damage the effectiveness of the stop and search powers and as the individual who is stopped has the right to a written statement under section 45(5), in this context the lack of publication does not mean that what occurred was not a procedure prescribed by law.”"", 'Furthermore, given the nature of the terrorist threat against the United Kingdom, the authorisation and confirmation of the power could not, as a matter of general principle, be said to be disproportionate: the disadvantage of the intrusion and restraint imposed on even a large number of individuals by being stopped and searched could not possibly match the advantage that accrued from the possibility of a terrorist attack being thereby foiled or deterred. Having regard to the nature of the arms fair, its location near an airport and a previous site of a terrorist incident (connected with the Northern Ireland problems) and the fact that a protest was taking place, the police were entitled to decide that section 44 powers should be exercised in connection with it. However, the inadequacy of the evidence provided by the police concerning the use of the section 44 power in the vicinity of the arms fair made it impossible to come to any conclusion as regards the lawfulness and proportionality of the use of the power against the applicants.', ""15. The House of Lords, on 8 March 2006, unanimously dismissed the applicants' appeals ([2006] UKHL 12). Lord Bingham, with whom the other Lords agreed, began by observing:"", ""“1. It is an old and cherished tradition of our country that everyone should be free to go about their business in the streets of the land, confident that they will not be stopped and searched by the police unless reasonably suspected of having committed a criminal offence. So jealously has this tradition been guarded that it has almost become a constitutional principle. But it is not an absolute rule. There are, and have for some years been, statutory exceptions to it. These appeals concern an exception now found in sections 44-47 of the Terrorism Act 2000 ('the 2000 Act'). The appellants challenge the use made of these sections and, in the last resort, the sections themselves. Since any departure from the ordinary rule calls for careful scrutiny, their challenge raises issues of general importance.”"", '16. The first issue before the House of Lords was as to the proper construction of the statute. The applicants had argued that section 44(3) should be interpreted as permitting an authorisation to be made only if the decision-maker had reasonable grounds for considering that the powers were necessary and suitable, in all the circumstances, for the prevention of terrorism. Lord Bingham rejected this interpretation, since the word “expedient” in the section had a meaning quite distinct from “necessary”. He continued:', ""“14. ... But there are other reasons also for rejecting the argument. It is true, as already recognised, that section 45(1)(b), in dispensing with the condition of reasonable suspicion, departs from the normal rule applicable where a constable exercises a power to stop and search. One would therefore incline, within the permissible limits of interpretation, to give 'expedient' a meaning no wider than the context requires. But examination of the statutory context shows that the authorisation and exercise of the power are very closely regulated, leaving no room for the inference that Parliament did not mean what it said. There is indeed every indication that Parliament appreciated the significance of the power it was conferring but thought it an appropriate measure to protect the public against the grave risks posed by terrorism, provided the power was subject to effective constraints. The legislation embodies a series of such constraints. First, an authorisation under section 44(1) or (2) may be given only if the person giving it considers (and, it goes without saying, reasonably considers) it expedient 'for the prevention of acts of terrorism'. The authorisation must be directed to that overriding objective. Secondly, the authorisation may be given only by a very senior police officer. Thirdly, the authorisation cannot extend beyond the boundary of a police force area, and need not extend so far. Fourthly, the authorisation is limited to a period of 28 days, and need not be for so long. Fifthly, the authorisation must be reported to the Secretary of State forthwith. Sixthly, the authorisation lapses after 48 hours if not confirmed by the Secretary of State. Seventhly, the Secretary of State may abbreviate the term of an authorisation, or cancel it with effect from a specified time. Eighthly, a renewed authorisation is subject to the same confirmation procedure. Ninthly, the powers conferred on a constable by an authorisation under sections 44(1) or (2) may only be exercised to search for articles of a kind which could be used in connection with terrorism. Tenthly, Parliament made provision in section 126 for reports on the working of the Act to be made to it at least once a year, which have in the event been made with commendable thoroughness, fairness and expertise by Lord Carlile of Berriew QC. Lastly, it is clear that any misuse of the power to authorise or confirm or search will expose the authorising officer, the Secretary of State or the constable, as the case may be, to corrective legal action."", ""15. The principle of legality has no application in this context, since even if these sections are accepted as infringing a fundamental human right, itself a debatable proposition, they do not do so by general words but by provisions of a detailed, specific and unambiguous character. Nor are the appellants assisted by the Home Office circular. This may well represent a cautious official response to the appellants' challenge, and to the urging of Lord Carlile that these powers be sparingly used. But it cannot, even arguably, affect the construction of section 44(3). The effect of that sub-section is that an authorisation may be given if, and only if, the person giving it considers it likely that these stop and search powers will be of significant practical value and utility in seeking to achieve the public end to which these sections are directed, the prevention of acts of terrorism.”"", ""17. Lord Bingham rejected the applicants' contention that the “rolling programme” of authorisations had been ultra vires, as follows:"", ""“18. The appellants' second, and main, ground of attack was directed to the succession of authorisations which had had effect throughout the Metropolitan Police District since February 2001, continuing until September 2003. It was, they suggested, one thing to authorise the exercise of an exceptional power to counter a particular and specific threat, but quite another to authorise what was, in effect, a continuous ban throughout the London area. Again this is not an unattractive submission. One can imagine that an authorisation renewed month after month might become the product of a routine bureaucratic exercise and not of the informed consideration which sections 44 and 46 clearly require. But all the authorisations and confirmations relevant to these appeals conformed with the statutory limits on duration and area. Renewal was expressly authorised by section 46(7). The authorisations and confirmations complied with the letter of the statute. The evidence of the Assistant Commissioner and Catherine Byrne does not support, and indeed contradicts, the inference of a routine bureaucratic exercise. It may well be that Parliament, legislating before the events of September 2001, did not envisage a continuous succession of authorisations. But it clearly intended that the section 44 powers should be available to be exercised when a terrorist threat was apprehended which such exercise would help to address, and the pattern of renewals which developed up to September 2003 (it is understood the pattern has since changed) was itself a product of Parliament's principled refusal to confer these exceptional stop and search powers on a continuing, countrywide basis. Reporting on the operation of the 2000 Act during the years 2002 and 2003, Lord Carlile ...found that sections 44 and 45 remained necessary and proportional to the continuing and serious risk of terrorism, and regarded London as 'a special case, having vulnerable assets and relevant residential pockets in almost every borough'.”"", '18. On the question whether either applicant had been deprived of liberty as a result of the stop and search procedure, Lord Bingham commented on the absence of any decision of the European Court of Human Rights on closely analogous facts and accepted that there were some features indicative of a deprivation of liberty, such as the coercive nature of the measure. However, since the procedure would ordinarily be relatively brief and since the person stopped would not be arrested, handcuffed, confined or removed to any different place, such a person should not be regarded “as being detained in the sense of confined or kept in custody, but more properly of being detained in the sense of kept from proceeding or kept waiting”. Article 5 did not, therefore, apply.', '19. As to the question whether Article 8 was applicable, Lord Bingham was:', ""“28. ... doubtful whether an ordinary superficial search of the person can be said to show a lack of respect for private life. It is true that 'private life' has been generously construed to embrace wide rights to personal autonomy. But it is clear Convention jurisprudence that intrusions must reach a certain level of seriousness to engage the operation of the Convention, which is, after all, concerned with human rights and fundamental freedoms, and I incline to the view that an ordinary superficial search of the person and an opening of bags, of the kind to which passengers uncomplainingly submit at airports, for example, can scarcely be said to reach that level.”"", ""20. Lord Bingham did not consider that the power to stop and search under sections 44-45, properly used in accordance with the statute and Code A, could be used to infringe a person's rights under Articles 10 or 11 of the Convention."", '21. Despite his doubts as to the applicability of Articles 5, 8, 10 or 11, Lord Bingham went on to consider whether the stop and search powers complied with the requirement of “lawfulness” under the Convention, as follows:', '“34. The lawfulness requirement in the Convention addresses supremely important features of the rule of law. The exercise of power by public officials, as it affects members of the public, must be governed by clear and publicly-accessible rules of law. The public must not be vulnerable to interference by public officials acting on any personal whim, caprice, malice, predilection or purpose other than that for which the power was conferred. This is what, in this context, is meant by arbitrariness, which is the antithesis of legality. This is the test which any interference with or derogation from a Convention right must meet if a violation is to be avoided.', ""35. The stop and search regime under review does in my opinion meet that test. The 2000 Act informs the public that these powers are, if duly authorised and confirmed, available. It defines and limits the powers with considerable precision. Code A, a public document, describes the procedure in detail. The Act and the Code do not require the fact or the details of any authorisation to be publicised in any way, even retrospectively, but I doubt if they are to be regarded as 'law' rather than as a procedure for bringing the law into potential effect. In any event, it would stultify a potentially valuable source of public protection to require notice of an authorisation or confirmation to be publicised prospectively. The efficacy of a measure such as this will be gravely weakened if potential offenders are alerted in advance. Anyone stopped and searched must be told, by the constable, all he needs to know. In exercising the power the constable is not free to act arbitrarily, and will be open to civil suit if he does. It is true that he need have no suspicion before stopping and searching a member of the public. This cannot, realistically, be interpreted as a warrant to stop and search people who are obviously not terrorist suspects, which would be futile and time-wasting. It is to ensure that a constable is not deterred from stopping and searching a person whom he does suspect as a potential terrorist by the fear that he could not show reasonable grounds for his suspicion. It is not suggested that the constables in these cases exercised their powers in a discriminatory manner (an impossible contention on the facts), and I prefer to say nothing on the subject of discrimination.”"", '22. Lord Hope of Craighead agreed with Lord Bingham. In particular, he considered that the stop and search power complied with the principle of legality for the following reasons:', '“48. The sight of police officers equipped with bundles of the stop/search form 5090 which is used to record the fact that a person or vehicle was stopped by virtue of sections 44(1) or 44(2) has become familiar in Central London since the suicide bombings that were perpetrated on 7 July 2005 and the attempts to repeat the attacks two weeks later. They can be seen inside the barriers at stations on the London Underground, watching people as they come through the barriers and occasionally stopping someone who attracts their attention and searching them. Most people who become aware of the police presence are there because they want to use the transport system. The travelling public are reassured by what they see the police doing at the barriers. They are in the front line of those who would be at risk if there were to be another terrorist outrage. But those who are singled out, stopped and searched in this way may well see things differently. They may find the process inconvenient, intrusive and irritating. As it takes place in public, they may well also find it embarrassing. This is likely to be the case if they believe, contrary to the facts, that they are being discriminated against on grounds of race. These features of the process give rise to this question. Are the limits on the use of the power sufficient to answer a challenge that the Convention rights of the person who is searched are being violated because its use is unforeseeable and arbitrary?', ""49. From that person's perspective the situation is one where all the cards are in the hands of the police. It is they, and not the general public, who know that an authorisation is in force and the area that it relates to. It is they who decide when and where within that area they should exercise the power that has been given to them. It is they who decide which persons or which vehicles should be stopped and searched. Sections 44(1) and 44(2) make it clear that the power may be exercised only by a constable in uniform. Section 45(1)(a) provides that the power may be exercised only for the purpose of searching for articles of a kind which could be used in connection with terrorism. But no criterion is laid down in the statute or in any published document as to the precise state of mind that the constable must be in before the power can be exercised."", ""50. Section 45(1)(b) provides that the power may be exercised whether or not the constable has grounds for suspecting the presence of articles of a kind which could be used in connection with terrorism. The definition of the word 'terrorism' for the purposes of the Act is a wide one, and the matter is left to the judgment of each individual police officer. The first indication that members of the public are likely to get that they are liable to be stopped and searched is when the order to stop is given. Those who are well informed may get some indication as to what is afoot when they see the police with bundles of forms in their hands looking in their direction. But for most people the order to stop will come as a surprise. Unless they are in possession of articles of the kind that the constable is entitled to search for, they may well wonder why they have been singled out for the treatment that they are being subjected to."", '51. There is, of course, a strong argument the other way. If the stop and search procedure is to be effective in detecting and preventing those who are planning to perpetrate acts of terrorism it has to be like this. Advertising the time when and the places where this is to be done helps the terrorist. It impedes the work of the security services. Sophisticated methods of disguise and concealment may be used where warnings are given. Those involved in terrorism can be expected to take full advantage of any published information as to when and where the power is likely to be exercised. So the police need to be free to decide when and where the use of the procedure is to be authorised and whom they should stop on the spur of the moment if their actions are to be a step ahead of the terrorist. Must this system be held to be unlawful under Convention law ... on the ground that it is arbitrary?', '...', '55. ... The use of the section 44 power has to be seen in the context of the legislation that provides for it. The need for its use at any given time and in any given place to be authorised, and for the authorisation to be confirmed within 48 hours, provides a background of law that is readily accessible to the citizen. It provides a system of regulatory control over the exercise of the power which enables the person who is stopped and searched, if he wishes, to test its legality in the courts. In that event the authorisation and the confirmation of it will of necessity, to enable the law to be tested properly, become relevant evidence. The guidance in para 2.25 of Code A warns the constable that the power is to be used only for reasons connected with terrorism, and that particular care must be taken not to discriminate against members of minority ethnic groups when it is being exercised. It is no more precise than that. But it serves as a reminder that there is a structure of law within which the power must be exercised. A constable who acts within these limits is not exercising the section 44 power arbitrarily.', ""56. As the concluding words of para 67 of the decision in Malone v United Kingdom (1985) 7 EHRR 14 indicate, the sufficiency of these measures must be balanced against the nature and degree of the interference with the citizen's Convention rights which is likely to result from the exercise of the power that has been given to the public authority. The things that a constable can do when exercising the section 44 power are limited by the provisions of section 45(3) and 45(4). He may not require the person to remove any clothing in public except that which is specified, and the person may be detained only for such time as is reasonably required to permit the search to be carried out at or near the place where the person or vehicle has been stopped. The extent of the intrusion is not very great given the obvious importance of the purpose for which it is being resorted to. In my opinion the structure of law within which it is to be exercised is sufficient in all the circumstances to meet the requirement of legality."", '57. It should be noted, of course, that the best safeguard against the abuse of the power in practice is likely to be found in the training, supervision and discipline of the constables who are to be entrusted with its exercise. Public confidence in the police and good relations with those who belong to the ethnic minorities are of the highest importance when extraordinary powers of the kind that are under scrutiny in this case are being exercised. The law will provide remedies if the power to stop and search is improperly exercised. But these are remedies of last resort. Prevention of any abuse of the power in the first place, and a tighter control over its use from the top, must be the first priority.”', '23. Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood observed, inter alia:', ""“74. Given the exceptional (although, as Lord Bingham has explained, neither unique nor particularly novel) nature of [the section 44] power (often described as the power of random search, requiring for its exercise no reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing), it is unsurprisingly hedged about with a wide variety of restrictions and safeguards. Those most directly relevant to the way in which the power impacts upon the public on the ground are perhaps these. It can be used only by a constable in uniform (section 44 (1) and (2)). It can be used only to search for terrorist-connected articles (section 45(1) (a)). The person searched must not be required to remove any clothing in public except for headgear, footwear, an outer coat, a jacket or gloves (section 45(3)). The search must be carried out at or near the place where the person or vehicle is stopped (section 45(4)). And the person or vehicle stopped can be detained only for such time as is reasonably required to permit such a search (section 45(4)). Unwelcome and inconvenient though most people may be expected to regard such a stop and search procedure, and radically though it departs from our traditional understanding of the limits of police power, it can scarcely be said to constitute any very substantial invasion of our fundamental civil liberties. Nevertheless, given, as the respondents rightly concede, that in certain cases at least such a procedure will be sufficiently intrusive to engage a person's article 8 right to respect for his private life, and given too that this power is clearly open to abuse—the inevitable consequence of its exercise requiring no grounds of suspicion on the police officer's part—the way is clearly open to an argument that the scheme is not properly compliant with the Convention requirement that it be 'in accordance with the law.'"", ""75. For this requirement to be satisfied ... not only must the interference with the Convention right to privacy have some basis in domestic law (as here clearly it does in the 2000 Act); not only must that law be adequately accessible to the public (as here clearly it is—unlike, for example, the position in Malone v United Kingdom (1985) 7 EHRR 14); not only must the law be reasonably foreseeable, to enable those affected to regulate their conduct accordingly (a requirement surely here satisfied by the public's recognition, from the very terms of the legislation, that drivers and pedestrians are liable to be subjected to this form of random search and of the need to submit to it); but there must also be sufficient safeguards to avoid the risk of the power being abused or exercised arbitrarily."", ""76. As I understand the appellants' argument, it is upon this final requirement that it principally focuses: this power, submits Mr Singh, is all too easily capable of being used in an arbitrary fashion and all too difficult to safeguard against such abuse. True, he acknowledges, if the power is in fact abused in any particular case the police officer concerned will be liable to a civil claim for damages (and, no doubt, to police disciplinary action). But, he submits, it will usually be impossible to establish a misuse of the power given that no particular grounds are required for its apparently lawful exercise. Assume, for example, that a police officer in fact exercises this power for racially discriminatory reasons of his own, how could that be established? There are simply no effective safeguards against such abuse, no adequate criteria against which to judge the propriety of its use. Certainly it is provided by paragraph 2.25 of Code A (a published code issued under section 66 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984) that: 'Officers must take particular care not to discriminate against members of minority ethnic groups in the exercise of these powers'. But, say the appellants, there is simply no way of policing that instruction with regard to the exercise of so wide a random power. No way, that is, submits [counsel for the applicants], unless it is by stopping and searching literally everyone (as, of course, occurs at airports and on entry to certain other specific buildings) or by stopping and searching on a strictly numerical basis, say every tenth person. Only in one or other of these ways, the appellants' argument forces them to contend, could such a power as this be exercisable consistently with the principle of legal certainty: there cannot otherwise be the necessary safeguards in place to satisfy the Convention requirement as to 'the quality of the law' ..."", ""77. I would reject this argument. In the first place it would seem to me impossible to exercise the section 44 power effectively in either of the ways suggested. Imagine that following the London Underground bombings last July the police had attempted to stop and search everyone entering an underground station or indeed every tenth (or hundredth) such person. Not only would such a task have been well nigh impossible but it would to my mind thwart the real purpose and value of this power. That, as Lord Bingham puts it in paragraph 35 of his opinion, is not 'to stop and search people who are obviously not terrorist suspects, which would be futile and time-wasting [but rather] to ensure that a constable is not deterred from stopping and searching a person whom he does suspect as a potential terrorist by the fear that he could not show reasonable grounds for his suspicion.' It is to be hoped, first, that potential terrorists will be deterred (certainly from carrying the tools of their trade) by knowing of the risk they run of being randomly searched, and, secondly, that by the exercise of this power police officers may on occasion (if only very rarely) find such materials and thereby disrupt or avert a proposed terrorist attack. Neither of these aims will be served by police officers searching those who seem to them least likely to present a risk instead of those they have a hunch may be intent on terrorist action."", '78. In his 2001 review of the operation of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 (amended as explained by Lord Bingham in paragraph 9 of his opinion) and the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996, Mr John Rowe QC said this of the power to stop and search those entering or leaving the United Kingdom with a view to finding out whether they were involved in terrorism:', ""'The “intuitive” stop"", '37. It is impossible to overstate the value of these stops ...', '38. I should explain what I mean by an “intuitive stop”. It is a stop which is made “cold” or “at random”—but I prefer the words “on intuition”—without advance knowledge about the person or vehicle being stopped.', ""39. I do not think such a stop by a trained Special Branch officer is “cold” or “random”. The officer has experience and training in the features and circumstances of terrorism and terrorist groups, and he or she may therefore notice things which the layman would not, or he or she may simply have a police officer's intuition. Often the reason for such a stop cannot be explained to the layman.'"", ""79. Later in his review Mr Rowe noted of the more general stop and search powers originally contained in sections 13A and 13B of the 1989 Act that 'these powers were used sparingly, and for good reason'. I respectfully agree that the section 44 power (as it is now) should be exercised sparingly, a recommendation echoed throughout a series of annual reports on the 2000 Act by Lord Carlile of Berriew QC, the independent reviewer of the terrorist legislation appointed in succession to Mr Rowe—see most recently paragraph 106 of his 2005 report, suggesting that the use of the power 'could be cut by at least 50 per cent without significant risk to the public or detriment to policing.' To my mind, however, that makes it all the more important that it is targeted as the police officer's intuition dictates rather than used in the true sense randomly for all the world as if there were some particular merit in stopping and searching people whom the officers regard as constituting no threat whatever. In short, the value of this legislation, just like that allowing people to be stopped and searched at ports, is that it enables police officers to make what Mr Rowe characterised as an intuitive stop."", '80. Of course, as the Privy Counsellor Review Committee chaired by Lord Newton of Braintree noted in its December 2003 report on the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001:', ""'Sophisticated terrorists change their profile and methods to avoid presenting a static target. For example, al Qaeda is reported to place particular value on recruiting Muslim converts because they judge them to be less likely to be scrutinised by the authorities.'"", 'It seems to me inevitable, however, that so long as the principal terrorist risk against which use of the section 44 power has been authorised is that from al Qaeda, a disproportionate number of those stopped and searched will be of Asian appearance (particularly if they happen to be carrying rucksacks or wearing apparently bulky clothing capable of containing terrorist-related items).', '81. Is such a conclusion inimical to Convention jurisprudence or, indeed, inconsistent with domestic discrimination law? In my judgment it is not, provided only that police officers exercising this power on the ground pay proper heed to paragraph 2.25 of Code A:', ""'The selection of persons stopped under section 44 of Terrorism Act 2000 should reflect an objective assessment of the threat posed by the various terrorist groups active in Great Britain. The powers must not be used to stop and search for reasons unconnected with terrorism. Officers must take particular care not to discriminate against members of minority ethnic groups in the exercise of these powers. There may be circumstances, however, where it is appropriate for officers to take account of a person's ethnic origin in selecting persons to be stopped in response to a specific terrorist threat (for example, some international terrorist groups are associated with particular ethnic identities).'"", 'Ethnic origin accordingly can and properly should be taken into account in deciding whether and whom to stop and search provided always that the power is used sensitively and the selection is made for reasons connected with the perceived terrorist threat and not on grounds of racial discrimination.”', ""24. The applicants also commenced a claim in the County Court on 8 September 2004 for, inter alia, damages under the Human Rights Act 1998 on the basis that the police had used the stop and search powers unlawfully against each applicant and in breach of Articles 8, 10 and 11 of the Convention, to control or deter their attendance at the demonstration rather than to search for articles linked to terrorism. The claims were stayed pending the outcome of their appeal to the House of Lords and were finally heard in February 2007. The County Court rejected the applicants' claims and determined that the power had, in respect to each of them, been properly and lawfully exercised. The applicants did not seek to appeal against this judgment."", '25. Police officers have the power to stop and search individuals under a range of legislation. For example, section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 allows an officer who has reasonable grounds for suspicion to stop and search a person or vehicle to look for stolen or prohibited items. Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 allows a senior officer to authorise the stop and search of persons and vehicles where there is good reason to believe that to do so would help to prevent incidents involving serious violence or that persons are carrying dangerous instruments or offensive weapons.', '26. The police power to stop and search at random where expedient to prevent acts of terrorism was first introduced as a response to the bombing campaign between 1992 and 1994 in and around London. Section 81 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 inserted a new section 13A into the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 (“the 1989 Act”) in similar terms to section 44 of the 2000 Act (see paragraph 30 below), but without any requirement that the Secretary of State confirm the authorisation. The Prevention of Terrorism (Additional Powers) Act 1996 created an additional, separate power to stop and search pedestrians, under section 13B of the 1989 Act. The 1996 Act also established for the first time the confirmation procedure involving the Secretary of State.', '27. In 1995 the Government asked Lord Lloyd of Berwick, a House of Lords judge, to undertake an Inquiry into the need for specific counter-terrorism legislation in the United Kingdom following the decrease in terrorism connected to Northern Ireland. The Inquiry included consideration of whether there remained a continuing need for a power equivalent to that in sections 13A and 13B of the 1989 Act. In his Report (Cm 3420, § 10, October 1996), Lord Lloyd noted that between February and August 1996 the police in London had carried out searches of 9,700 drivers and passengers and 270 pedestrians under sections 13A and 13B of the 1989 Act. When considering whether similar powers should be retained in any permanent counter-terrorism legislation that might be enacted, he observed that a decision to give the police a power to stop and search at random was not to be taken lightly. On the other hand there was evidence that a number of terrorists had been intercepted by alert officers on patrol, and in at least one case a potential catastrophe had been averted. He said that there was also reason to believe that terrorists were deterred to some extent by the prospect of police road checks and the consequent risk that they would be intercepted. He commented:', '“As to usage, the figures show that the power has been used with great discretion. The requirement for authorisation by a very senior police officer is an important control mechanism. A number of requests have been turned down. That is reassuring. The police are very sensitive to the damage which would be done if there were ever any grounds for suspecting that the power was being used as anything other than a counter-terrorism measure.”', ""In the end Lord Lloyd recommended that powers on the lines of the existing sections 13A and 13B should be retained in permanent legislation. He also recommended that the Secretary of State's confirmation should be required in relation to each provision. Since the Police and Criminal Evidence Act Code A applied the same standards to the terrorism provisions as to other statutory powers to stop and search, he saw no need for additional safeguards."", ""28. The 2000 Act was intended to overhaul, modernise and strengthen the law relating to terrorism in the light, inter alia, of Lord Lloyd's Inquiry."", '“Terrorism” is defined, in section 1, as follows:', ""“(1) In this Act 'terrorism' means the use or threat of action where -"", '(a) the action falls within subsection (2),', '(b) the use or threat is designed to influence the government or to intimidate the public or a section of the public, and', '(c) the use or threat is made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause.', '(2) Action falls within this subsection if it -', '(a) involves serious violence against a person,', '(b) involves serious damage to property,', ""(c) endangers a person's life, other than that of the person committing the action,"", '(d) creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public, or', '(e) is designed seriously to interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic system.', '(3) The use or threat of action falling within subsection (2) which involves the use of firearms or explosives is terrorism whether or not subsection (1)(b) is satisfied.', '(4) In this section -', ""(a) 'action' includes action outside the United Kingdom,"", '(b) a reference to any person or to property is a reference to any person, or to property, wherever situated,', '(c) a reference to the public includes a reference to the public of a country other than the United Kingdom, and', ""(d) 'the government' means the government of the United Kingdom, of a Part of the United Kingdom or of a country other than the United Kingdom."", '(5) In this Act a reference to action taken for the purposes of terrorism includes a reference to action taken for the benefit of a proscribed organisation.”', '29. Sections 41-43 of the 2000 Act, under the sub-heading “Suspected terrorists”, provide for arrest without warrant, the search of premises and the search of persons by a police officer. In each case there must be reasonable suspicion that the person subject to the arrest or search is a terrorist.', '30. Sections 44-47, under the sub-heading “Power to stop and search”, are not subject to the requirement of reasonable suspicion. These sections provide for a three stage procedure.', 'The first stage, under section 44, is authorisation:', '“44(1) An authorisation under this subsection authorises any constable in uniform to stop a vehicle in an area or at a place specified in the authorisation and to search -', '(a) the vehicle;', '(b) the driver of the vehicle;', '(c) a passenger in the vehicle;', '(d) anything in or on the vehicle or carried by the driver or a passenger.', '(2) An authorisation under this subsection authorises any constable in uniform to stop a pedestrian in an area or at a place specified in the authorisation and to search -', '(a) the pedestrian;', '(b) anything carried by him.', '(3) An authorisation under subsection (1) or (2) may be given only if the person giving it considers it expedient for the prevention of acts of terrorism.', '(4) An authorisation may be given -', '(a) where the specified area or place is the whole or part of a police area outside Northern Ireland other than one mentioned in paragraph (b) or (c), by a police officer for the area who is of at least the rank of assistant chief constable;', '(b) where the specified area or place is the whole or part of the metropolitan police district, by a police officer for the district who is of at least the rank of commander of the metropolitan police;', '(c) where the specified area or place is the whole or part of the City of London, by a police officer for the City who is of at least the rank of commander in the City of London police force;', '(d) where the specified area or place is the whole or part of Northern Ireland, by a [member of the Police Service of Northern Ireland] who is of at least the rank of assistant chief constable.', '(5) If an authorisation is given orally, the person giving it shall confirm it in writing as soon as is reasonably practicable.”', 'By section 46(1)-(2), an authorisation takes effect when given and expires when it is expressed to expire, but may not be for longer than 28 days. The existence and contents of section 44 authorisations are not within the public domain.', '31. The second stage is confirmation, governed by section 46(3)-(7). The giver of an authorisation must inform the Secretary of State as soon as is reasonably practicable. If the Secretary of State does not confirm the authorisation within 48 hours of the time when it was given, it then ceases to have effect (without invalidating anything done during the 48-hour period). When confirming an authorisation the Secretary of State may substitute an earlier, but not a later, time of expiry. He may cancel an authorisation with effect from a specified time. Where an authorisation is duly renewed, the same confirmation procedure applies. The Secretary of State may not alter the geographical coverage of an authorisation but may withhold his confirmation if he considers the area covered to be too wide.', '32. The third stage, under section 45, involves the exercise of the stop and search power by a police constable:', '“(1) The power conferred by an authorisation under section 44(1) or (2) -', '(a) may be exercised only for the purpose of searching for articles of a kind which could be used in connection with terrorism, and', '(b) may be exercised whether or not the constable has grounds for suspecting the presence of articles of that kind.', '(2) A constable may seize and retain an article which he discovers in the course of a search by virtue of section 44(1) or (2) and which he reasonably suspects is intended to be used in connection with terrorism.', '(3) A constable exercising the power conferred by an authorisation may not require a person to remove any clothing in public except for headgear, footwear, an outer coat, a jacket or gloves.', '(4) Where a constable proposes to search a person or vehicle by virtue of section 44(1) or (2) he may detain the person or vehicle for such time as is reasonably required to permit the search to be carried out at or near the place where the person or vehicle is stopped.', '(5) Where -', '(a) a vehicle or pedestrian is stopped by virtue of section 44(1) or (2), and', '(b) the driver of the vehicle or the pedestrian applies for a written statement that the vehicle was stopped, or that he was stopped, by virtue of section 44(1) or (2),', 'the written statement shall be provided.', '(6) An application under subsection (5) must be made within the period of 12 months beginning with the date on which the vehicle or pedestrian was stopped.”', '33. These powers are additional to the other powers conferred on a constable by law (2000 Act, section 114). Section 47 makes it an offence punishable by imprisonment or fine or both to fail to stop when required to do so by a constable, or wilfully to obstruct a constable in the exercise of the power conferred by an authorisation under section 44(1) or (2).', '34. Sections 44-47 of the 2000 Act came into force on 19 February 2001. It was disclosed during the domestic proceedings in the present case that successive section 44 authorisations, each covering the whole of the Metropolitan Police district and each for the maximum permissible period (28 days), have been made and confirmed ever since that time.', '35. A Code of Practice was issued by the Secretary of State on 1 April 2003 to guide police officers in the exercise of all statutory powers of stop and search. It was required to be readily available at all police stations for consultation by police officers and was a public document.', '36. The Code required, inter alia, that such powers be “used fairly, responsibly, with respect to people being searched”. It required that the power under section 44 of the 2000 Act “must not be used to stop and search for reasons unconnected with terrorism” and that the power should be used “to search only for articles which could be used for terrorist purposes”. In paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3, the Code provided:', '“1.2 The intrusion on the liberty of the person stopped or searched must be brief and detention for the purposes of a search must take place at or near the location of the stop.', '1.3 If these fundamental principles are not observed the use of powers to stop and search may be drawn into question. Failure to use the powers in the proper manner reduces their effectiveness. Stop and search can play an important role in the detection and prevention of crime, and using the powers fairly makes them more effective.”', 'Paragraph 3.5 of the Code provided:', ""“There is no power to require a person to remove any clothing in public other than an outer coat, jacket or gloves except under section 45(3) of the Terrorism Act 2000 (which empowers a constable conducting a search under section 44(1) or 44(2) of that Act to require a person to remove headgear and footwear in public) ... A search in public of a person's clothing which has not been removed must be restricted to superficial examination of outer garments. This does not, however, prevent an officer from placing his or her hand inside the pockets of the outer clothing, or feeling round the inside of collars, socks and shoes if this is reasonably necessary in the circumstances to look for the object of the search or to remove and examine any item reasonably suspected to be the object of the search. For the same reasons, subject to the restrictions on the removal of headgear, a person's hair may also be searched in public ...”"", 'Certain steps were required by paragraph 3.8 to be taken before the search:', '“3.8 Before any search of a detained person or attended vehicle takes place the officer must take reasonable steps to give the person to be searched or in charge of the vehicle the following information:', '(a) that they are being detained for the purposes of a search;', ""(b) the officer's name (except in the case of enquiries linked to the investigation of terrorism, or otherwise where the officer reasonably believes that giving his or her name might put him or her in danger, in which case a warrant or other identification number shall be given) and the name of the police station to which the officer is attached;"", '(c) the legal search power which is being exercised; and', '(d) a clear explanation of;', '(i) the purpose of the search in terms of the article or articles for which there is a power to search; ...', '(iii) in the case of powers which do not require reasonable suspicion ..., the nature of the power and of any necessary authorisation and the fact that it has been given.”', 'Officers conducting a search were required by paragraph 3.9 to be in uniform. The Code continued, in paragraphs 3.10-3.11:', ""“3.10 Before the search takes place the officer must inform the person (or the owner or person in charge of the vehicle that is to be searched) of his or her entitlement to a copy of the record of the search, including his entitlement to a record of the search if an application is made within 12 months, if it is wholly impracticable to make a record at the time. If a record is not made at the time the person should also be told how a copy can be obtained.... The person should also be given information about police powers to stop and search and the individual's rights in these circumstances."", ""3.11 If the person to be searched, or in charge of a vehicle to be searched, does not appear to understand what is being said, or there is any doubt about the person's ability to understand English, the officer must take reasonable steps to bring information regarding the person's rights and any relevant provisions of this Code to his or her attention. If the person is deaf or cannot understand English and is accompanied by someone, then the officer must try to establish whether that person can interpret or otherwise help the officer to give the required information.”"", 'A record was required to be made at the time or as soon as practicable (paragraph 4.1):', ""“4.1 An officer who has carried out a search in the exercise of any power to which this Code applies, must make a record of it at the time, unless there are exceptional circumstances which would make this wholly impracticable (e.g. in situations involving public disorder or when the officer's presence is urgently required elsewhere). If a record is not made at the time, the officer must do so as soon as practicable afterwards. There may be situations in which it is not practicable to obtain the information necessary to complete a record, but the officer should make every reasonable effort to do so.”"", '37. Section 126 of the 2000 Act requires the Secretary of State to lay a report on the working of the Act before Parliament at least once every 12 months and Lord Carlile of Berriew QC has been appointed as Independent Reviewer to prepare the annual report, inter alia.', '38. In paragraph 5.8 of his report on the operation of the Act in 2001 Lord Carlile briefly summarised the effect of section 44-47 and then said:', '“No difficulties have been drawn to my attention in relation to the exercise of these powers. They were used extensively in 2001. I have examined the full list of such authorisations, which have been deployed in almost every police authority area in Great Britain. It would not be in the public interest to provide details of the reasons and events. I am satisfied that their use works well and is used to protect the public interest, institutions, and in the cause of public safety and the security of the state. I have been able to scrutinise the documentation used for Section 44 authorisations. It is designed to limit inconvenience to the general public, and to ensure that no authorisation is given without detailed and documented reasons.”', ""39. In Lord Carlile's “Report on the Operation in 2002 and 2003 of the Terrorism Act 2000”, he commented on the section 44 power as follows:"", '“67. Part 5 of the Act contains counter-terrorism powers available to the police to deal with operational situations. During 2003 these powers have become more controversial, particularly because of increased levels of protest arising from the war against Iraq. In particular, section 44 has been the cause of considerable anxiety and debate.', '...', '75. Last year I asserted that no particular problems had been drawn to my attention from the operation of these provisions during 2001. The opposite has been the case in relation to 2003. I have received many complaints, some from organisations and others from individuals. I cannot comment here on individual cases ...', '...', '79. In London there have been rolling 28 day authorisations for the whole of the area policed by the Metropolitan police and the City of London Police. I have seen detailed figures for the use of the powers in every part of that area. In some parts of London the section 44/45 powers have been used very little. In others, with obvious targets such as an airport or Parliament, there has been more extensive use, as one would expect. There is no part of London where the powers have not been used at all between the beginning of February 2001 and the end of August 2003, the period for which I have statistics. There are huge differences between the boroughs in this context: I take this to be evidence of specific operational decisions by the police. The nature of London means that a terrorist may well live in one borough, have associates in others, and have targets in yet others. Having said that, at present there is no other city with continuous section 44 authorisations.', '...', ""83. Lord Justice Brooke's judgment [in the present case: see paragraph 11 above] exactly reflects my own concerns on this front. Whilst the section 44 authorisations for the Metropolitan Police area, and for parts of Gloucestershire and neighbouring areas, at the material times were justifiable and proof from judicial review, their use gave some rise for anxiety. That anxiety arises from the contents of section 45, and the difficulty faced in real-time situations by constables confronted by complex legislative decisions."", ""84. Pursuant to section 45, a section 44/45 search can be carried out by a constable in an authorised area whether or not he has grounds for suspicion, but may only be 'for articles of a kind which could be used in connection with terrorism'. This calls at least theoretically for officers to pause for thought between (a) stop, (b) commencement of search, and (c) during search. If the search commences as defined in section 45(1)(a), but the officer realises at any given moment that in reality he is searching for non-terrorism articles, he should change gear into a non-[Terrorism Act 2000] search procedure. This is asking a lot of an officer who may have been briefed in short form at a testing scene."", '...', '86. In my view section 44 and section 45 remain necessary and proportional to the continuing and serious risk of terrorism. London is a special case, having vulnerable assets and relevant residential pockets in almost every borough. The use of section 44 authorisations elsewhere in the country has been relatively sparing. However, I would urge the Home Office and [the Association of Chief Police Officers] ... to produce new, short, clear and preferably nationally accepted guidelines for issue to all officers in section 44 authorised areas. All briefings should remind officers that, even where there is a section 44 authorisation, other stop and search powers may be judged more appropriate with some individuals stopped. Whilst agreeing with the Chief Constable of Gloucestershire that the powers are drawn widely, and with the Metropolitan Police that they have great potential utility to protect the public, in using the powers appropriate attention should be given to the important right to protest within the law.”', '40. In his report on the operation of the 2000 Act in 2005 (May 2006), Lord Carlile commented:', '“91. In 2003 and 2004 I received many complaints, some from organisations and others from individuals, about the operation of sections 44 and 45. These and some litigation have been taken seriously by the police. As a result, I have been consulted upon and have been able to contribute to work towards providing a clearer understanding throughout police forces of the utility and limitations of sections 43-45.', '92. The crucial thing is that police officers on the ground, exercising relatively unfamiliar powers sometimes in circumstances of some stress, should have a greater degree of knowledge of the scope and limitations of those powers. Terrorism related powers should be used for terrorism related purposes; otherwise their credibility is severely damaged. An incident on the 31st March 2006 at a hospital in Staffordshire yet again highlighted this. In a diverse community the erroneous use of powers against people who are not terrorists is bound to damage community relations.', '...', '95. ... [Section 44] authorisations have been used extensively in 2005, unsurprisingly in the immediate aftermath of the events of the 7th and 21st July.', '96. Although available in Scotland, to date section 44 powers have never been authorised by a Scottish police force. I had anticipated that they might have been deployed for the 2005 meeting of the G8 Summit in Scotland. They were not. London apart, I doubt that there is evidence that Scotland is less at risk from terrorism than other parts of the country. This perpetuates the question of why section 44 is needed in England and Wales if it is not required in Scotland. There is no other provision specific to Scots Law to explain the difference of approach. At the very least this demonstrates that other powers are on the whole perfectly adequate for most purposes.', '97. My view continues as expressed a year ago - that I find it hard to understand why section 44 authorisations are perceived to be needed in some force areas but not others with strikingly similar risk profiles. This view has not been affected by the events of July 2005.', '98. I remain sure that section 44 could be used less and expect it to be used less. There is little or no evidence that the use of section 44 has the potential to prevent an act of terrorism as compared with other statutory powers of stop and search.', '99. The Home Office scrutinises applications critically. It is a sound approach for them to refuse unless the circumstances are absolutely clear.', '100. In my view section 44 and section 45 remain necessary and proportional to the continuing and serious risk of terrorism. London is a special case, having vulnerable assets and relevant residential pockets in almost every borough, and fairly extensive use is understandable. However, I emphasise that they should be used sparingly. Evidence of misuse, especially in an arbitrary way, will not find favour with the courts and could fuel demands for repeal. It involves a substantial encroachment into the reasonable expectation of the public at large that they will only face police intervention in their lives (even when protesters) if there is reasonable suspicion that they will commit a crime.”', '41. In his report on the operation of the 2000 Act in 2006 (June 2007), Lord Carlile observed:', '“113. My view continues as expressed in the past two years – that I find it hard to understand why section 44 authorisations are perceived to be needed in some force areas but not others with strikingly similar risk profiles.', '114. I remain sure that section 44 could be used less and expect it to be used less. There is little or no evidence that the use of section 44 has the potential to prevent an act of terrorism as compared with other statutory powers of stop and search. Its utility has been questioned publicly by senior Metropolitan Police staff with wide experience of terrorism policing.', '115. The Home Office continues to scrutinise applications critically. I think that they could and should refuse more often. There are instances in which public order stop and search powers are as effective – and they are always more palatable to those stopped and searched.', '116. In my view section 44 and section 45 remain necessary and proportional to the continuing and serious risk of terrorism. However, I emphasise again that they should be used sparingly. They encroach into the reasonable expectation of the public at large that they will only face police intervention in their lives (even when protesters) if there is reasonable suspicion that they will commit a crime.”', '42. In his report into the operation of the 2000 Act in 2007 (June 2008), Lord Carlile noted that the criticism of the section 44 power had increased further during the preceding year and continued:', '“130. I am sure beyond any doubt that section 44 could be used less and expect it to be used less. There is little or no evidence that the use of section 44 has the potential to prevent an act of terrorism as compared with other statutory powers of stop and search. Whilst arrests for other crime have followed searches under the section, none of the many thousands of searches has ever related to a terrorism offence. ...”', 'Nonetheless, he concluded that the powers remained necessary and proportionate to the continuing terrorist threat.', '43. Finally, in his report on the operation of the 2000 Act in 2008 (June 2009), Lord Carlile commented:', ""“140. Examples of poor or unnecessary use of section 44 abound. I have evidence of cases where the person stopped is so obviously far from any known terrorism profile that, realistically, there is not the slightest possibility of him/her being a terrorist, and no other feature to justify the stop. In one situation the basis of the stops being carried out was numerical only, which is almost certainly unlawful and in no way an intelligent use of the procedure. Chief officers must bear in mind that a section 44 stop, without suspicion, is an invasion of the stopped person's freedom of movement. I believe that it is totally wrong for any person to be stopped in order to produce a racial balance in the section 44 statistics. There is ample anecdotal evidence that this is happening. I can well understand the concerns of the police that they should be free from allegations of prejudice; but it is not a good use of precious resources if they waste them on self-evidently unmerited searches. It is also an invasion of the civil liberties of the person who has been stopped, simply to 'balance' the statistics. The criteria for section 44 stops should be objectively based, irrespective of racial considerations: if an objective basis happens to produce an ethnic imbalance, that may have to be regarded as a proportional consequence of operational policing."", '141. Useful practice guidance on stop and search in relation to terrorism was produced during 2008 by the National Policing Improvement Agency on behalf of the Association of Chief Police Officers [ACPO]. This guidance emphasises crucial requirement, which include that –', '● These powers are exceptional', '● The geographical extent of section 44 authorisations must be clearly defined', '● The legal test is expediency for the purposes of preventing acts of terrorism', '● Community impact assessments are a vital part of the authorisation process', '● The Home Secretary should be provided with a detailed justification for a section 44 authorisation', '● Chief officers must expect the Home Office to apply detailed and rigorous scrutiny in considering whether to confirm authorisations', '● Leaflets should be made available to the public in an area where the power is being deployed', '● Officers must keep careful records', '...', '146. My view remains as expressed in the past four years, but reinforced: that I find it hard to understand why section 44 authorisations are perceived to be needed in some force areas, and in relation to some sites, but not others with strikingly similar risk profiles. Where other stop and search powers are adequate to meet need, there is no need to apply for or to approve the use of the section. Its primary purpose is to deal with operationally difficult places at times of stress, when there is a heightened likelihood of terrorists gaining access to a significant location. For example, I have no criticism of its careful use at the time of a major demonstration at London Heathrow Airport: terrorists might well use the opportunity of participation in such a demonstration to enter, photograph or otherwise reconnoitre, and otherwise add to their knowledge of a potential target such as Heathrow. Nor do I criticise its use at or near critical infrastructure or places of especial national significance.', ""147. I now feel a sense of frustration that the Metropolitan Police still does not limit their section 44 authorisations to some boroughs only, or parts of boroughs, rather than to the entire force area. I cannot see a justification for the whole of the Greater London area being covered permanently, and the intention of the section was not to place London under permanent special search powers. However, a pilot project is about to start in which the section is deployed in a different way. I shall examine that project closely. The alarming numbers of usages of the power (between 8,000 and 10,000 stops per month as we entered 2009) represent bad news, and I hope for better in a year's time. The figures, and a little analysis of them, show that section 44 is being used as an instrument to aid non-terrorism policing on some occasions, and this is unacceptable."", '148. I am sure that safely it could be used far less. There is little or no evidence that the use of section 44 has the potential to prevent an act of terrorism as compared with other statutory powers of stop and search. Whilst arrests for other crime have followed searches under the section, none of the many thousands of searches has ever resulted in conviction of a terrorism offence. Its utility has been questioned publicly and privately by senior Metropolitan Police staff with wide experience of terrorism policing.', '149. It should not be taken that the lesser usage of section 44 in places other than London means that such places are less safe, or more prone to terrorism. There are different ways of achieving the same end. The effect on community relations of the extensive use of the section is undoubtedly negative. Search on reasonable and stated suspicion, though not in itself a high test, is more understandable and reassuring to the public.', '150. I emphasise that I am not in favour of repealing section 44. Subject to the views expressed above, in my judgment section 44 and section 45 remain necessary and proportional to the continuing and serious risk of terrorism.”', '44. Under section 95 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, the Secretary of State is under an obligation to publish information relating to the criminal justice system with reference to avoiding discrimination on the ground of race. In a report published pursuant to this obligation in October 2007, “Statistics on Race and the Criminal Justice System – 2006”, the Ministry of Justice recorded that:', '“A total of 44,543 searches were made under section 44(1) and 44(2) of the Terrorism Act 2000 in 2005/6 compared with 33,177 in 2004/5, an overall increase of 34% (Table 4.6). Searches of Asian people increased from 3,697 to 6,805 (up 84%), searches of Black people increased from 2,744 to 4,155 (up 51%). Searches of people in the Other ethnic group also increased, from 1,428 in 2004/5 to 1,937 in 2005/6 (up 36%), as did searches of White people, increasing from 24,782 in 2004/5 to 30,837 in 2005/6 (up 24%). Over half of searches took place in the Metropolitan Police area and 15% in the City of London, compared to 40% and 20% respectively in 2004/5. The large increases in comparison to the 2004/5 figures may be explained, in part, by the London bombings of 7 July 2005. As with stop and searches under s.1 PACE, resultant increased street activities of the police led to an increase in the use of stop and search powers under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000.', 'In 2005/6, 25,479 searches of vehicle occupants were made under section 44 (1) (Table 4.7). Seventy-five per cent of those searched in 2005/6 were White, 11% Asian and 8% Black. There was a slight increase in the proportion of White people searched and a slight fall in the proportion of Black people searched under this provision compared to 2004/5. Forty-six arrests of vehicle occupants in connection with terrorism resulted from section 44 (1) searches, compared to 38 in the previous year. Arrests under non-terrorism legislation following the use of this provision remained constant between 2004/5 and 2005/6 at 246. Most arrests following a section 44 (1) search were in London. This most likely reflects the increased use of the powers in London.', 'The number of stop and searches of pedestrians under section 44(2) nearly doubled between 2004/5 and 2005/6 with 19,064 stop and searches recorded in 2005/6. This increase was accounted for by the increase in use of the power in London. Use of the power in areas outside of London decreased by 19% between 2004/5 and 2005/6. In 2005/6, 61% of people stopped under section 44(2) were White compared to 74% in 2004/5 and 72% in 2003/4. The proportions for Black and Asian people fell to 11% and 21% respectively in 2005/6. In 2005/6, 59 arrests in connection with terrorism resulted from section 44 (2) searches compared to 24 in the previous year and five in 2003/4. Arrests under non-terrorist legislation rose from 153 in 2004/5 to 212 in 2005/6.”', '45. In the report published the following year, in July 2008, “Statistics on Race and the Criminal Justice System – 2006/7”, the Ministry of Justice recorded that:', '“A total of 37,000 searches were made under section 44(1) and 44(2) of the Terrorism Act 2000 in 2006/7 compared with 45,000 in 2005/6 and represents a decrease of 16.5% (Table 4.6). Over a third of police force areas did not record any use of this power in 2006/7. Searches decreased for all ethnic groups but the biggest fall was for Asian people (19.1%), followed by those in the White group (15.8%), those in the Other category (15.4%), and lastly Black people (13.3%). Nine areas did increase the number searched under Section 44 and this included the [Metropolitan Police] who registered an 11.3% rise. This contrasts with the City of London where there was a 69.2% fall. The proportion of Asian people searched under Section 44 in the Met police area (19.1%) exceeded the proportion of Black persons (12.5%).', 'In 2006/7 23,000 searches of vehicle occupants were made under Section 44(1) (Table 4.7). Seventy-two per cent of those searched during this period were White, a fall of three percentage points on the previous year, 10% Black (up 2 percentage points), and 13% Asian (up 2 percentage points). Fourteen arrests of vehicle occupants in connection with terrorism resulted from Section 44 (1) searches, compared to 46 the previous year. Four of these involved Black persons and four Asians. Arrests under non-terrorism legislation following the use of this provision have remained constant between 2004/5 and 2006/7 at 246.', 'The number of stop and searches of pedestrians under Section 44(2) has reduced by just over 28% between 2005/6 and 2006/7 from 19,000 to 13,700. A large part of this fall can be accounted for by the decrease in the City of London from 3,149 to 425 over the two year period. The proportion of White pedestrians searched under Section 44(2) has increased since the previous year from 61% of the total to 66%. Asian people remain the highest BME group both searched (17%) and subsequently arrested in connection with terrorism (29%).”', '46. The most recent report, “Statistics on Race and the Criminal Justice System 2007/8”, published in April 2009, recorded a significant increase in the use of the section 44 powers:', '“A total of 117,278 searches of people were made under section 44 (1) and 44 (2) of the Terrorism Act 2000 in 2007/08 compared with 37,197 in 2006/07 and represents an increase of 215% (Table 4.6). Just under a fifth (19%) of police force areas did not record any use of this power in 2007/08. Searches increased for all ethnic groups but the biggest rise was for Black people (322%), followed by those in the Asian group (277%), those in the Other category (262%), and lastly White people (185%).', 'The large rise in the number of stop and searches made under the Terrorism Act largely reflects increases in the use of this power by the Metropolitan police. In 2007/08 the Metropolitan police were responsible for 87% of searches made under section 44 (1) and 44 (2) of the Terrorism Act 2000, compared to 68% of those made in 2006/07. The Metropolitan police used this power on 76,496 more occasions than in the previous year, which represents an increase of 303%. This rise is directly attributable to the robust response by the Metropolitan police to the threat of terror related networks in London since the Haymarket bomb in 2007.', 'Tables 4.7 and 4.8 show selected police force areas, where the total number stopped and searched under s. 44 (1) & (2) of the Terrorism Act 2000 exceeded 1,000 people in 2007/08.', 'In 2007/08, 65,217 searches of vehicle occupants were made under Section 44 (1) (Table 4.7). Sixty-four per cent of those searched during this period were White, a fall of eight percentage points on the previous year, 13% were Black (up 3 percentage points), and 16% were Asian (up 4 percentage points). Thirty-four arrests of vehicle occupants in connection with terrorism resulted from Section 44 (1) searches, compared to 14 the previous year. Nine of these involved Black persons and 10 Asians. Arrests under non-terrorism legislation following the use of stop and search under Section 44 (1) increased to 665 from 246 in 2006/07.', ""The number of stop and searches of pedestrians under Section 44 (2) has increased by 280% between 2006/07 and 2007/08 from 13,712 to 52,061 (Table 4.8). As previously mentioned, this large increase can be attributable to the Metropolitan police's robust response to the Haymarket bombs. The proportion of White pedestrians searched under Section 44 (2) has decreased since the previous year from 66% of the total to 61%. Asian people remain the highest BME group both searched (19%) and subsequently arrested in connection with terrorism (29%).”"", '47. In its Report, “Demonstrating respect for rights? A human rights approach to policing protest”, published in March 2009, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights recommended, in connection with section 44 of the 2000 Act:', '“Counter-terrorism powers', '86. A significant number of witnesses expressed serious concerns at the use of counter-terrorism powers on protestors, particularly the power under section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 to stop and search without suspicion. Witnesses suggested that the use of the powers contravened the OSCE/ODIHR Guidelines which note:', ""Domestic legislation designed to counter terrorism or 'extremism' should narrowly define these terms so as not to include forms of civil disobedience and protest; the pursuit of certain political, religious, or ideological ends; or attempts to exert influence on other sections of society, the government, or international opinion."", '87. The National Union of Journalists complained that the police had relied on the Terrorism Act 2000 to prevent journalists from leaving demonstrations. Some witnesses noted that restrictions on peaceful protests were increasingly justified by reference to the security threat. The following comment by David Mead reflects the views of a number of witnesses:', '...there can be no justification to call upon anti-terrorism legislation to police protests/protestors and such use debases the very real threat terrorists are capable of posing to us all.', '88. High profile examples of the inappropriate use of counter-terrorism powers include: preventing Walter Wolfgang from re-entering the Labour Party conference in Brighton in 2005, following his physical ejection for heckling the then Foreign Secretary Jack Straw MP; and stopping and searching a protestor and a journalist at an arms fair at the Excel Centre in Docklands, East London in 2003. Less well-known examples include the use of stop and search on demonstrators at military bases or people wearing slogans on t-shirts.', ""89. The Research Defence Society and the author and commentator Richard D. North both distinguished protestors (including animal rights extremists) from terrorists. Mr North said 'terrorism is a word we ought to reserve for some kind of insurgency, or guerrilla of asymmetrical warfare'. In contrast, Huntingdon Life Sciences argued in relation to protest against its activities by animal rights activists, however, that 'insufficient consideration was given to counter-terrorism powers in what was widely considered in practice (but not in name) to be domestic terrorism'."", ""90. When we asked police representatives whether it was appropriate to use counter-terrorism powers against protestors, AAC Allison replied that 'there are occasions when we do need to use our counter-terrorism powers: I would say that that is why we have them'."", '91. Addressing the same question, the Minister was clear that counter-terrorism powers should only be used in relation to terrorism. He noted that the Prime Minister had ordered a review into the use of stop and search powers and as a result new guidance had been published. He pointed out, however, that:', 'If you have a big protest near a big power station or airport, [...] it is very difficult to say that under no circumstances should the police in those situations ever consider using a counterterrorism power when we all know it is perfectly possible for the legitimate protestors to be infiltrated by one or two who may have other desires...', ""92. The new guidance on stop and search noted that the powers to stop and search under sections 43 and 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 only allow an officer to 'search for articles of evidence that relate to terrorism' and that '[the section 44] power should be used sparingly'. In the light of the decision of the House of Lords in Gillan, which concerned the use of the stop and search power on protestors and journalists outside an arms fair in the Docklands in London, the guidance states that stop and search should never be used to conduct arbitrary searches but should be based on objective criteria. The guidance refers to protests, noting that section 44 may be appropriate for large public events that may be at risk from terrorism, but states 'officers should also be reminded at briefings that stop and search powers under the Terrorism Act 2000 must never be used as a public order tactic.' The only reference to human rights is contained in the section of the guidance on the contents of the community impact assessment: it suggests that 'the requirements of the Human Rights Act 1998' should be included in the community impact assessment. Although not specifically referring to journalists, the guidance states that the Terrorism Act 2000, even where a section 44 designation is in place, does not prevent people from taking photographs. In addition, although film and memory cards may be seized as part of a search, officers do not have a legal power to delete images or destroy film."", ""93. Whilst we accept that there may be circumstances where the police reasonably believe, on the basis of intelligence, that a demonstration could be used to mask a terrorist attack or be a target of terrorism, we have heard of no examples of this issue arising in practice. We are concerned by the reports we have received of police using counter-terrorism powers on peaceful protestors. It is not clear to us whether this stems from a deliberate decision by the police to use a legal tool which they now have or if individual officers are exercising their discretion inappropriately. Whatever the reason, this is a matter of concern. We welcome the Minister's comments that counter-terrorism legislation should not be used to deal with public order of protests. We also welcome the recommendation in the new guidance to human rights being included in community impact assessments. We recommend that the new guidance on the use of the section 44 stop and search power be amended to make clear that counter-terrorism powers should not be used against peaceful protestors. In addition, the guidance should make specific reference to the duty of police to act compatibly with human rights, including, for example, by specifying the human rights engaged by protest.”"", '48. In May 2009 the Metropolitan Police published a report summarising the conclusions of their review into the use of the power under section 44 of the 2000 Act. The report stated that the “emerging findings” from the review supported a three-layered approach to the use of the power, namely that the power should continue to be available in the vicinity of sites across London of key symbolic or strategic importance, but that elsewhere, except where authorised by a specific directive, officers should only stop and search individuals using the power under section 43 of the 2000 Act, where they had grounds to suspect that the person might be engaged in a terrorism-related offence.']",['8'],[],[],[],[],[]

It appears that the applicant stayed for some time in Turkey and then in Greece.', '11. He arrived in Denmark on 20 August 1989 and applied for asylum. Pursuant to the practice of the Danish immigration authorities at that time, all asylum-seekers from Iran who, due to desertion from the army, had left their home country before the armistice between Iran and Iraq in the summer of 1988 were granted a residence permit. Accordingly, on 12 October 1990 the applicant was granted a residence and work permit. On 25 August 1994 the residence permit became permanent.', '12. In 1992 the applicant met a Danish woman, A, with whom he cohabited. A daughter was born out of the relationship on 16 October 1996. The applicant and A got married on 23 September 1997 and had another child, a son, born on 20 April 2001. A also has a daughter born in 1989 from a previous relationship, who lives with A and the applicant, and with whom the applicant has a very close relationship. All three children have been raised pursuant to Danish traditions.', ""13. It appears that the applicant's family broke off all relations with him in 1987 due to his desertion from the army."", '14. In Denmark the applicant had been making a living as the owner of a pizzeria until the end of 1996.

A works at a retirement home.', ""15. On 17 December 1996 the applicant was arrested and detained on remand, charged with drug trafficking allegedly committed during 1996. By judgment of 1 October 1997 the City Court of Hobro (retten i Hobro) found him guilty, inter alia, of drug trafficking with regard to at least 450 grams of heroine contrary to Article 191 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment and, pursuant to sections 22 and 26 of the Aliens Act, was expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on his return."", 'The applicant appealed against the judgment but withdrew the appeal in November 1997, whereupon the City Court judgment acquired legal force.', '16.

Also in accordance with the Aliens Act, the applicant availed himself of the possibility, prior to the enforcement of a deportation, to bring before the immigration authorities (Udlændingestyrelsen) the question whether he could be returned to Iran, since, pursuant to the Aliens Act, an alien must not be returned to a country in which he or she will risk persecution on the grounds set out in Article 1 A of the Convention of 28 July 1951 concerning the Status of Refugees. The immigration authorities found, on 13 January 1999, that the applicant would not risk persecution in Iran of a kind which could constitute a basis for his remaining in Denmark. The applicant appealed against this decision to the Refugee Board (Flygtningenævnet), which on 16 April 1999 requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide more information on the situation in Iran.', ""Having obtained information from several different authorities, on 4 January 2000 the Refugee Board confirmed the immigration authorities' decision."", ""18. Subsequently, relying on section 50 of the Aliens Act for the second time, and claiming that material changes in his circumstances had occurred, the applicant requested the City Court of Hobro to reconsider the expulsion decision. The court had the same material at its disposal as the Refugee Board and a number of statements from doctors concerning the applicant's state of health. In addition, A was heard stating inter alia that her daughter from a previous relationship, refuses to move to Iran. By judgment of 14 February 2000 the City Court revoked the decision to expel the applicant."", ""On 3 March 2000 the High Court of Western Denmark quashed the above decision and dismissed the applicant's request for reconsideration of the expulsion order since, pursuant to section 50 of the Aliens Act, an expelled alien is entitled to only one judicial review of the question of expulsion.

The applicant, Mr Albert Fürst von Thurn und Taxis, is a German national, who was born in 1983 and lives in Regensburg. He was represented before the Court by Mr A. Geiger, a lawyer practising in Munich.', '3. The applicant is the owner of a court library and archives dating back to the fifteenth century. In 1943 the library contained approximately 150,000 volumes; today, it contains about 204,000 volumes. The library is accessible to the public and the archives are accessible for scientific purposes.', '4. The property was originally incorporated in a family trust fund (Fideikommis). Under section 1 of the Law on the Dissolution of Family Trust Funds (Gesetz über das Erlöschen der Familienfideikommisse und sonstiger Vermögen, FideiErlG, see relvant domestic law, below), which entered into force on 30 June 1938, all family trust funds were dissolved by 1 January 1939. The property contained in these funds was, as a rule, transferred into normal private property. However, section 6 of the abovementioned law allowed the authorities to impose certain protective and security measures in respect of objects of particular artistic, scientific, historical or patrimonial value.', '5. By decisions of 12 July, 22 October and 30 October 1943 the Nuremberg Court of Appeal, in its capacity as a trust fund court, relying on section 6 of the above-mentioned law, placed the administration of the different parts of the court library and archives under the supervision of the director of the Bavarian State Library, and of the directors of the State Archives in Stuttgart and Amberg. The current owner and his legal successors were ordered to obtain authorisation from the supervising authority before changing, displacing, or disposing of the library or the archives or of parts thereof. Furthermore, it was ordered that the library and archives had to be maintained in an “orderly condition”.', '6. On 31 January 2002 the applicant lodged a request with the Nuremberg Court of Appeal to lift the above-mentioned measures. Relying on section 6 § 8 of the Law on the Dissolution of Family Trust Funds, he argued that the measures deprived him of making use of his property in a reasonable way. Under the orders issued in 1943, he had to bear considerable expenses while being denied any possibility of profiting from his property. The applicant submitted that the factual and legal circumstances had changed since 1943. The costs of maintenance for the court library and the central archives had increased dramatically. For the year 2002, the total expenses were estimated at 295,000 euros. The applicant further argued that the limitations imposed were unconstitutional, as he did not receive any compensation for the factual expropriation.', '7. On 8 December 2003 the Nuremberg Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s request on the grounds that the applicant had not established that the factual and legal circumstances had changed since the imposition of the impugned measures in 1943. The Court of Appeal conceded that the expenses submitted by the applicant for the maintenance of the library and the archives were considerable. However, there was no indication that these expenses had not merely increased because of general inflation, but had been generated after 1943. The Court of Appeal further considered that section 6 of the Law on the dissolution of Family Trust Funds was constitutional. The court noted in this context that the court library and archives were cultural goods of exceptional importance meriting special protection. The measures imposed were justified by the public interest in the conservation of valuable goods giving testimony of German culture and history. If the measures imposed in 1943 were lifted, the conservation and accessibility of the court library and central archives could no longer be assured.', '8. On 27 October 2004 the Bavarian High Court (Oberstes Landesgericht) rejected the applicant’s complaint on the grounds that the orders issued in 1943 were legally binding and that the factual and legal circumstances had not changed in a way which would justify the measures to be lifted. The court observed that the court library and central archives remained an important part of the cultural heritage which necessitated protection. Conversely, economic interests did not play a decisive role in the decision taken in 1943. Accordingly, the general change in the economic context did not justify the measures to be lifted. The Court of Appeal further considered that there was no violation of the right to equal treatment. The situation had to be seen in the context of the historical and social circumstances under which the property was acquired. These circumstances, taken in their entirety, could not be compared to the circumstances under which “civil” property was acquired.', '9. On 28 October 2009 the Federal Constitutional Court refused to accept the applicant’s constitutional complaint for adjudication (1 BvR 963/05). This decision was served on the applicant’s counsel on 12 November 2009.', '10. The Law on the Dissolution of Family Trust Funds (Gesetz über das Erlöschen der Familienfideikommisse und sonstiger Vermögen, FideiErlG) as in force from 30 June 1938 until 30 November 2007 read, in so far as relevant:', 'Section 1 Date of Dissolution', '“(1) All remaining family trust funds are dissolved by 1 January 1939...”', 'Section 2 The Trust Fund Property', '“As from the [date of] dissolution of the trust fund, the trust fund property becomes the free property of the last trust fund owner....”', 'Section 6 Other Safeguards and Security measures', '“(1) If the trust fund contained objects or collections of particular artistic, scientific, historical or local value (e. g. buildings, picture galleries, archives, libraries) or charitable institutions, the Trust Fund Court has to take the necessary measures for their appropriate conservation in case the objects appear to be endangered because of the dissolution of the trust fund and if the conservation lies in the public interest.', '(2) The Trust Fund Court may, in particular...issue regulations on the storage and conservations of objects and may subject the change, displacement and the validity of legal dispositions to administrative authorisation. The Trust Fund Court is further obliged to ensure that objects of particular artistic, scientific, historical or patrimonial value are made accessible to the public in an appropriate way. ...', '...', '(8) In case of a change of circumstances, the Trust Fund Court, on request of one of the parties concerned, may change or lift the measures taken under the above paragraphs...”', '11. Under Section 34, measures taken under that law did not give rise to compensation claims.', '12. The FideiErlG was re-published in the Federal Law Gazette of 10 July 1958 (BGBl. III 7811-2) and repealed by law of 30 November 2007 under the condition that the rights and duties established under that law remained unchanged and that the law remained applicable for rights and duties established when it was still in force.']",[],[],[],[],[],[]

In April 1977 the applicant, a widower with two children, remarried. His second wife was a French national who herself had two children from a previous marriage with a French national from whom she had been divorced in 1976. During the summer of 1982 the applicant’s wife’s son and daughter were on school holidays at the applicant’s home at Lindau, near Lake Constance.', '10. The daughter, K.B., was fourteen years old and a French national. On 9 July 1982 she spent the day wind surfing. On her return she complained that she felt tired and was not as tanned as she would have liked. As he had done several times in the past, the applicant injected her at about 8.30 p.m. with a ferric preparation that was sold under the brand name Kobalt-Ferrcelit and was in principle intended for the treatment of anaemia.', '11. At about 9.30 a.m. on 10 July 1982 the applicant found K.B. dead in her bedroom and proceeded to inject her with various products in an attempt to revive her. A call was made to the emergency services and the body examined by a doctor at about 10.20 a.m. He put the time of death at about 3 a.m. and found no traces of violence, apart from marks made by injections to the thorax and right arm.', '12. The police immediately started an investigation into the death at the hands of a person or persons unknown and an autopsy was carried out by two pathologists on 12 July 1982. Although they were unable to determine the cause of death, primarily because the body was in an advanced state of decomposition, they found no evidence of sexual or other assault. Consequently, on 17 August 1982 the Kempten public prosecutor’s office made the first of four decisions to take no further action in the case, in accordance with Article 170 § 2 of the German Code of Criminal Procedure.', '13. The girl’s father then requested the Kempten public prosecutor’s office to make further inquiries, notably on the ground that the autopsy report had been criticised by a French forensic doctor to whom he had submitted a copy. The public prosecutor’s office agreed to his request and sought an expert opinion from the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Munich.', '14. On 27 November 1982 one of the pathologists who had carried out the autopsy said that wounds found to the girl’s external genitalia had been caused after death. On 3 March 1983, after he had carried out a chemo-toxicological and histological analysis and heard the pathologists, the applicant and other members of the family, the expert concluded that the girl had not died of natural causes. However, he was unable to reach any further conclusion about the cause of death, which, in his opinion, could not be attributed to the injection of the ferric product, no traces of which had been found in the body. In May 1983 a further expert pharmacological examination was carried out to determine the side-effects or contraindications of the ferric product that had been injected on the day before the girl’s death.', '15. On 14 June 1983 the Public Prosecutor at the Kempten Regional Court decided for the second time to take no further action. The Principal Public Prosecutor at the Munich Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht) took the view that an appeal lodged against that decision by the victim’s father on 4 July 1983 was an internal appeal (Dienstaufsichtsbeschwerde) and dismissed it on 20 September 1983.', '16. On 17 October 1983 the victim’s father lodged a complaint through his German lawyers in which the applicant was named as the suspect in the rape and murder of his daughter. The case file in the investigation that had been started in 1982 against a person or persons unknown was joined to the new investigation procedure that had been initiated on the complaint of the victim’s father. On 2 November 1983 the public prosecutor’s office at Kempten Regional Court decided for the third time, on the basis of the conclusions of the various experts in the previous investigation, to take no further action.', '17. The decision of 2 November 1983 to take no further action was upheld by the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Munich Court of Appeal on 30 January 1984 on the ground that the investigation had produced insufficient evidence to justify a prosecution.', '18. On 15 March 1984, after a petition had been sent to the Bavarian Regional Parliament, the investigation was resumed for the fourth time and on 15 April 1984 the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Appeal instructed the public prosecutor’s office to make further inquiries.', '19. On 8 June 1984 the Kempten public prosecutor’s office requested the Toulouse public prosecutor’s office under arrangements for judicial mutual assistance to question the victim’s younger brother, who was born in 1971, about the circumstances of his sister’s death. The boy was questioned on 4 September 1984.', '20. In addition, a further pharmacological report on the toxicological effects of the ferric preparation was requested from the Clinical Pharmacology Institute in Bremen, which set out its conclusions in two reports dated 15 July and 26 September 1985. On 17 July 1985 the Kempten public prosecutor’s office also requested the French authorities under the arrangements for judicial mutual assistance to exhume the body which had been buried in Toulouse. The Toulouse investigating judge made an order to that effect on 30 October 1985 and on 4 December 1985 the body was exhumed and examined by two forensic doctors.', '21. On 24 February 1986, in the light of the conclusions of the expert report and of the negative results of the autopsy that had been carried out after the exhumation, the Kempten public prosecutor’s office decided for the fourth time to take no further action in the case. That decision was upheld on 9 May 1986 by the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Munich Court of Appeal.', '22. In accordance with the provisions of Article 172 of the German Code of Criminal Procedure, the victim’s father issued proceedings (Klageerzwingungsverfahren) in the Munich Court of Appeal in which he complained that the Principal Public Prosecutor should not have upheld the decision to take no further action and sought an order compelling the public prosecutor’s office to charge the applicant with voluntary or involuntary homicide. In a judgment of 9 September 1987 the First Criminal Division of the Munich Court of Appeal declared the appeal inadmissible.', '23. On 23 January 1984, while continuing to press for the applicant’s prosecution in Germany, the victim’s father lodged a criminal complaint for involuntary homicide against a person or persons unknown with the Paris investigating judge and applied to be joined as a civil party to the proceedings. The complaint was based on Article 689-1 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure, which lays down that aliens who commit a serious crime (crime) outside the territory of the Republic may be prosecuted and tried under French law if the victim is a French national.', '24. In support of his complaint the victim’s father lodged documents, expert reports, investigative papers and witness statements that had been obtained by the Kempten public prosecutor’s office in Germany.', '25. On 12 March 1985 the Paris investigating judge sent letters rogatory to the German authorities requesting them to question various witnesses and to take certain steps. The Kempten public prosecutor’s office replied on 2 November 1985.', '26. On 27 February 1986 the Kempten public prosecutor’s office sent the investigating judge a photocopy of the investigation file comprising three volumes.', '27. A new investigating judge assigned to the case in Paris was informed by the victim’s father on 10 March 1986 that the public prosecutor’s office had decided for the fourth time on 24 February 1986 to take no further action. He sent new letters rogatory to the German authorities on 17 June 1987, in which he invited them to make available to three French experts, whom he had appointed that day, samples that had been taken during the autopsy and examined by the three German experts who had compiled the report of 3 March 1983.', '28. In accordance with the French letters rogatory, the samples were delivered to the French police on 22 March 1988 and, on 25 March, to the experts who had been appointed on 17 June 1987. The experts lodged their report on 27 July 1988 and a supplementary report on 30 November 1988, in which they corrected an error of transcription.', '29. On 9 December 1988 the Paris investigating judge ordered an additional expert report with a view to ascertaining the precise role and effects of the medicines with which the applicant said he had injected his stepdaughter when attempting to revive her. That report was lodged on 26 December 1988.', '30. On 8 February 1989 the third investigating judge assigned to the case issued a summons requiring the applicant to appear before him. In a letter of 22 February 1989 the applicant informed the investigating judge that the German authorities had concluded after an investigation that no third party bore responsibility for K.B.’s death and that he saw no reason to travel to Paris. He indicated, however, that he was willing to be interviewed at his home.', '31. On 27 July 1989 the investigating judge sent a third set of letters rogatory to the German authorities asking them to notify the applicant of the conclusions of the expert reports of 27 July and 26 December 1988 and to put to him, as an “assisted witness”, certain precise questions regarding the sequence of events. The applicant was questioned by a German judge on 8 February 1990.', '32. On 20 May 1990 the applicant informed the investigating judge in reply to a request of 4 May that it was not possible for him to travel to Paris and that he had already answered the judge’s questions. He said, however, that he was willing to reply in writing to any further questions the judge might wish to ask.', '33. On 1 February 1991 – almost seven years after the investigation had begun – the applicant was charged with the crime of assault resulting in unintentional death. On 23 April 1991 he was questioned by a German judge acting pursuant to letters rogatory.', '34. On 10 July 1992 the investigating judge made an order closing the investigation and sending the file to the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Paris Court of Appeal, who lodged written submissions on 25 September 1992.', '35. Using the system established by the scheme for international mutual assistance in law enforcement, the applicant was notified of the date of the hearing before the Indictment Division on 28 January 1993. His lawyer was informed on 3 February 1993. Neither the applicant nor his lawyer attended the hearing on 11 March 1993.', '36. By a judgment of 8 April 1993 the Indictment Division of the Paris Court of Appeal committed the applicant to stand trial in the Paris Assize Court on a count of involuntary homicide. The Indictment Division noted the conflicting opinions of the French experts who had seen the evidence in the German file, including the expert reports. By way of conclusion the Indictment Division stated:', '“The investigation was started on a complaint of voluntary homicide. However, in the order closing the investigation the investigating judge charged Dieter Krombach with voluntary assault resulting in unintentional death. The Principal Public Prosecutor and the civil party have also submitted that he should be committed for trial on that charge.', 'The court finds that the medical evidence gathered in the course of the investigation suggests that K.B.’s death was a direct consequence of an intravenous injection of a solution that might have been Kobalt-Ferrcelit. The injection was contemporaneous with the death.', 'In order to justify that act, Dieter Krombach has furnished conflicting and untrue accounts, stating firstly that his intention had been to help the girl to tan more quickly and subsequently to treat her for her anaemic condition. Kobalt-Ferrcelit does not help people to tan and at the material time K.B. was a girl in perfect health, there being no reference in her medical records to any symptoms of anaemia.', 'Dieter Krombach also lied about the chronology of the events when he affirmed that the injection had taken place several hours before the death. Lastly, the faked attempt to revive her and the use of mutually incompatible products on a living being can only be explained by an intention to conceal the cause of death.', 'These factors taken as a whole constitute sufficient grounds for suspecting that Dieter Krombach gave the fatal injection not as a cure, but with the intention of causing death.”', 'The Indictment Division also issued an arrest warrant.', '37. On 4 May 1993 the judgment was served on the applicant through the foreign public prosecutor’s service. The applicant was summonsed on several occasions for preliminary questioning in order to establish his identity, but refused to comply with any of the summonses.', '38. The applicant appealed to the Court of Cassation against the committal order. In his written submissions he argued, inter alia, that the non bis in idem principle had been contravened and that an estoppel per rem judicatam arose, as, although Article 689-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure enabled aliens to be tried under French law if the victim of the crime was a French national, no prosecution could lie if there had been a final judgment overseas. In that connection, the applicant maintained that a discharge order had been made in his favour on 24 February 1986 by the Kempten public prosecutor’s office, an investigating body, and had become final with the decision of the Criminal Division of the Munich Court of Appeal of 9 September 1987.', '39. In a judgment of 21 September 1993 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s ground of appeal on the ground that it raised a new issue as neither the impugned judgment nor any of the procedural documents showed that the appellant had argued before the Indictment Division that the German judicial authorities had made a discharge order in his favour in respect of the same offence.', '40. On 7 September 1994 the applicant’s French lawyer was informed that the applicant was required to appear before Paris Assize Court from 7 to 10 November 1994. On 26 October he applied to the President of the Assize Court for an order for a supplementary measure to ensure that the case file contained all the documents from the German proceedings. The President dismissed that application by a letter of 3 November 1994 in which he informed the lawyer that it was for the assize court with lawful jurisdiction in the case to determine whether such a measure was necessary.', '41. By an order of 15 November 1994, which was served on 17 November 1994, the President of the Assize Court invited the applicant to report to the authorities within ten days. In accordance with Articles 627 et seq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure, that order was published in the Gazette du Palais (Court Gazette) and displayed in the courtroom of the Paris Assize Court and on the front door to the town hall of the first administrative district of Paris.', '42. On 7 February 1995 the applicant wrote a letter to the President of the Assize Court explaining that he was willing to attend the hearing on 1 March 1995 provided that he received an assurance that he would remain at liberty throughout the duration of the trial. He said that he could not understand the conduct of the French authorities, who had failed throughout the investigation in France to take the discharge order that had been made in Germany into account. He added that it was his intention to be represented by a lawyer.', '43. By an order of 1 March 1995 the President of the Assize Court adjourned the case to 9 March 1995.', '44. The applicant’s French lawyer, assisted by a German lawyer, lodged submissions with the Assize Court based on Article 6 of the Convention. He sought permission to represent the applicant in his absence and to make submissions regarding various matters, namely: the existence of an estoppel per rem judicatam, a ruling on the estoppel issue by the Assize Court acting on its own initiative, an order for an additional investigation to secure the communication of the investigation file by the German authorities and an examination of the scope of the discharge orders.', '45. By a judgment of 9 March 1995 delivered by the Paris Assize Court after it had heard the Advocate-General’s submissions calling for a thirty-year prison sentence, the applicant was found guilty of voluntary assault on his stepdaughter unintentionally causing her death and sentenced to fifteen years’ imprisonment.', '46. The Assize Court explained in its judgment that if the applicant had reported to the authorities, it would have been able to discontinue the in absentia procedure and the applicant would have been able to make any requests that would assist in his defence when complying with that mandatory procedural requirement. It also reminded the applicant’s lawyers, who were present at the hearing, that Article 630 of the Code of Criminal Procedure prohibited representation for absent defendants and laid down that their submissions were inadmissible.', '47. In a civil judgment that was also delivered in absentia on 13 March 1995, the Paris Assize Court ordered the applicant to pay 250,000 French francs (FRF) as reparation for non-pecuniary damage and FRF 100,000 for costs and expenses. The applicant’s lawyer had lodged a note to the Assize Court in deliberations in which he had pointed out that the total lack of representation for the defence in the civil action constituted a breach of Article 6 of the Convention. He complained in particular that he had not been informed of the heads of claim or of the civil party’s submissions.', '48. By an order of 1 June 1995 made under Article 636 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the President of the Court of Cassation declared the applicant’s appeals against the judgments of the Assize Court inadmissible.', '49. A “Schengen” warrant followed by an international warrant were issued, on dates which are not indicated in the case file, for the applicant’s arrest.', '50. On 12 September 1995 the victim’s father applied to the Kempten Regional Court for an authority to execute the Paris Assize Court’s judgment ordering the applicant to pay FRF 350,000 in damages. On 29 April 1996 the Regional Court granted that application and its decision was upheld by the Munich Court of Appeal on 11 February 1997.', '51. The applicant appealed on points of law. By a decision of 4 December 1997 the Federal Court (Bundesgerichtshof) referred the case to the Court of Justice of the European Communities with a view to obtaining a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of Article 27 § 1 of the Convention of 27 September 1968 on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters, which lays down that judicial decisions shall not be recognised if recognition would be contrary to public policy in the State in which recognition is sought.', '52. Among the reasons given by the Federal Court for seeking a ruling was that it considered that the enforcement of the judicial decision obtained by proceedings in absentia such as those conducted in France might be regarded as contrary to German public policy, at least so far as the civil limb of the proceedings was concerned, as Article 103 § 1 of the Basic Law laid down that everyone had the right to be heard (Anspruch auf rechtliches Gehör), and that that right incorporated the right to representation by a lawyer. Lastly, referring to Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the Federal Court indicated that the decision delivered in absentia appeared to it to infringe the right to access to a court and, as regards the civil limb, the right to equality of arms.', '53. In a judgment of 28 March 2000, the Court of Justice of the European Communities held: “the court of the State in which enforcement is sought can, with respect to a defendant domiciled in that State and prosecuted for an intentional offence, take account, in relation to the public-policy clause in Article 27, point 1, of the Convention, of the fact that the court of the State of origin refused to allow that person to have his defence presented unless he appeared in person”.', '54. Following that judgment the Federal Court dismissed the application by the victim’s father of 29 June 2000 for an order to enforce the civil judgment delivered by the French Assize Court on 13 March 1995.', '55. On 7 January 2000 the applicant was arrested in Austria and detained pursuant to an order of the judge of the Feldkirch Regional Court (Journalrichter des Landesgerichts Feldkirch) pending the hearing of a request for his extradition. By an order of 21 January 2000 the judge concerned dismissed a bail application by the applicant, despite his offer of a surety.', 'However, on 2 February 2000 the Innsbruck Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht Innsbruck) quashed that order and ordered the applicant’s immediate release. It considered that the judgment of the Munich Court of Appeal of 9 September 1987 (see paragraph 22 above), against which there was no right of appeal under German law, raised a relative estoppel per rem judicatam, since the investigation could only be restarted in Germany if new evidence came to light. Once the courts in the state in which the offence had been committed had decided not to prosecute the applicant and had taken a final decision in that regard, he could not be detained for the purposes of extradition. Lastly, the Court of Appeal held that Article 54 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement (Schengener Durchführungsabkommen), which incorporates the non bis in idem principle, precluded the applicant’s being retried in France in respect of the matters for which a final discharge order had been made in his favour in Germany.', '56. Article 214 of the Code of Criminal Procedure lays down that if the offence charged is classified by statute as a serious crime (crime), the indictment division will commit the accused for trial by the assize court.', 'There is an assize court in Paris and in each of the French départements. The court is composed of professional judges (the president and two wing members) and a nine-person lay jury whose members are drawn by lot from a panel of thirty-five jurors and ten substitute jurors chosen annually by lot for jury service during the four ordinary assize sessions held in the département.', 'The inquiry into the facts of a serious criminal case (affaire criminelle) must be conducted orally at the trial. At the end of the hearing, the court retires to decide on its verdict and sentence. Article 349 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that the court must answer each of the questions contained in the operative provisions of the committal order by either “yes” or “no” and that each question must be put in the following way: “Is the accused guilty of having committed such an offence?”. The votes of a majority comprising at least eight jurors are required for the accused to be convicted of the offence.', '57. As regards the accused’s presence at the trial, Article 215 of the Code of Criminal Procedure lays down that the committal order, which is valid only if it contains a statement and the legal classification of the alleged offences, shall be accompanied by a warrant for the accused’s arrest, specifying his or her identity. Article 215-1 provides that an accused who is on bail must surrender to custody at the latest on the day preceding the hearing in the assize court and that the arrest warrant shall be executed if, after being duly summonsed and without due cause, he or she fails to attend on the appointed day for questioning by the president of the assize court. Article 270 provides for the accused to be tried in absentia if he or she cannot be apprehended and does not attend the trial (see paragraphs 59-61 below).', '58. As soon as the committal order has become final and the accused, after being detained, has been transferred to the prison in the locality where the assize court will sit, the president of the assize court must, in accordance with Article 273, establish the accused’s identity and ensure that he or she has been duly served with the committal order. Article 274 also requires the president to invite the accused to choose a lawyer to assist with his or her defence; if the accused fails to do so, the president must assign counsel to represent him or her. This is because Article 317 makes the accused’s representation at the trial mandatory and provides that if no counsel appears on behalf of the accused, the president must on his or her own initiative assign the accused counsel. Article 320 lays down that if an accused refuses to appear at the trial after being summonsed to do so by a bailiff the president may order that he or she be brought before the court by force. The president may also order that the hearing shall proceed notwithstanding the accused’s absence.', '59. As regards the procedure for trial in absentia, the main provisions of the French Code of Criminal Procedure are as follows:', '“If, after the committal order has been made by the indictment division, it has not proved possible to apprehend the accused or he or she has failed to report within ten days after the service of notice at his or her home to do so or the accused has absconded after reporting or being apprehended, the president of the assize court or, in his absence, the president of the court in the locality where the assize court will sit, or the judge replacing him or her, shall issue an order requiring the accused to report within a further period of ten days, failing which the accused shall be declared an outlaw, the exercise of his or her rights as a citizen shall be suspended, his or her assets shall be sequestered for the duration of the contempt, he or she shall not be entitled to take part in any court proceedings during that period, the criminal proceedings shall continue and any person knowing where the accused is to be found shall be under a duty to report that information.

THE CZECH REPUBLIC,4,Violation of Art. 6-1;Inadmissible under P1-1;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings,,"['4. The applicants were born in 1951 and 1952 respectively, and live in Svoboda nad Úpou.', '5. In January 1986 the applicants bought from the State a house, which had been seized after the emigration of the former owners. The applicants made an initial payment of CZK 100,000 by 30 April 1986, the remaining sum of CZK 244,846 to be paid in fifteen annual instalments. However, the purchase was without risk of forfeiture if such an instalment remained unpaid.', '6. Pursuant to the Extra-Judicial Rehabilitation Act (hereinafter “the Act”), in December 1991 the former owners brought an action against the applicants for the restitution of their property. In January 1996 the applicants were ordered to restore the property to the former owners. In May 1999 the applicants were ordered to vacate the house within a year of the coming into force of the first instance judgment without receiving compensatory accommodation.', ""7. In February 2002 the District Court ordered the execution of its judgment for the applicants' eviction. In May 2000 the Regional Court upheld the order. In October 2002 the District Court dismissed the applicants' request to suspend the execution. In April 2003 the Regional Court upheld the District Court's dismissal."", ""8. On 28 January 2004 the applicants were informed that the eviction would take place on 23 February 2004. On 19 February 2004 the District Court dismissed their request to suspend the eviction. On 23 February 2004, the applicants' lawyer was served with the District Court's dismissal of 19 February 2004 and, on 9 March 2004, she filed an appeal which is still pending before the Regional Court."", '9. Apart from the two aforesaid proceedings, the former owners instituted proceedings against the applicants for the illegal use of the house since 1 January 1996, seeking payment of outstanding rent in the amount of CZK 431,000 (13,596 EUR). In these proceedings, which have been pending since 10 October 1997, the applicants sought to recover damages to compensate for expenditure invested in material improvements to the house, filing a counterclaim (kompenzační námitka) for CZE 300,000 (EUR 9,464) on 5 January 1998, apparently under section 7(4) of the Act. This provides that, if the value of the property has increased so that its price, as assessed on the day of the submission of the written request by the entitled person, substantially exceeds the original purchase price of the property, it is left to the discretion of the entitled person whether he or she will request financial compensation or the return of the property. If he or she insists on the surrender of the property, the entitled person must compensate the person obliged to return the property for the difference between the two prices.', ""10. In September 1997 the applicants lodged with the Ministry of Finance a request for reimbursement of the purchase price, pursuant to section 11 of the Act, which entitles physical persons who are under an obligation to restore property to recover the price they had paid when acquiring such property from the State. On 4 February 1998, upon the Ministry's request of 5 November 1997, they submitted additional documents. On 13 March 1998 their lawyer informed the Ministry that, on 11 March 1998, she had obtained the document of the Svoboda nad Úpou Municipal Office (městský úřad) confirming that the applicants had so far paid CZK 295,888 (EUR 9,334) of the purchase price. In a letter of 15 May 1998, the Ministry informed the applicants' lawyer that they would deal with her clients' request for reimbursement of the purchase price on reception of the restitution agreement (dohoda o vydání věci) which, together with other documents, had not yet been adduced by the applicants. They were further requested to provide evidence of the amount of the purchase price which they had already paid. The applicants' lawyer replied on 9 June 1998."", ""11. On 18 January 1999 the applicants lodged an action for damages against the Ministry of Finance and the Trutnov District Office (okresní úřad), seeking compensation in the amount of CZK 500,000 (EUR 15,773) for damage caused by the allegedly erroneous action of a public authority by virtue of the State Liability Act, no. 58/1969. The damages which they requested corresponded to the difference between the original purchase price (CZK 344,846 - EUR 10,878) and the price which should now be paid for a house of the same standard. By instituting this action, the applicants further sought to recover damages to compensate for the second applicant's loss of business premises and customers (she is a dressmaker), for the betterment of the land on which the house had been built and for the loss of accommodation."", '12. On 15 February and 10 May 1999 respectively, the District Office and the Ministry of Finance presented their comments on the action.', ""13. On 17 June 1999 the applicants' lawyer sent documents issued by the Svoboda nad Úpou Municipal Office on 7 June 1999 proving that the applicants had already paid CZK 321,212 (EUR 10,133)."", ""14. On 5 October 1999 the applicants' lawyer sent an additional document to the Ministry of Finance concerning their request for reimbursement of the purchase price."", '15. On 20 October 1999 the applicants extended their action, also directing it against the Town of Svoboda nad Úpou and the Ministry of the Interior. The two new defendants commented upon the action on 8 November 1999 and 14 February 2000 respectively.', ""16. According to the Government, on 29 November 1999 the applicants' lawyer informed the Ministry of Finance that the property at issue had been restored to the former owners in accordance with the judgment. She said that her clients did not agree with the judgment and would continue to pay annual instalments towards the purchase price. She stated that she would inform the Ministry whether she wished to have the purchase price reimbursed or whether she would wait."", '17. On 28 December 1999 the applicants were invited to submit observations on the arguments of the Ministry of the Interior. They did so on 10 January 2000.', ""18. By a letter of 24 January 2000 the Ministry of Finance informed the applicants' lawyer that, inter alia, it had all the documents necessary for the settlement of their request for reimbursement of the purchase price under section 11 of the Act. Nevertheless, it asked the lawyer to submit an additional document and to specify whether the sum of CZK 312,212 (EUR 9,848), corresponding to the part of the purchase price which the applicants had paid so far, had to be reimbursed and, if so, to which bank account."", '19. At a hearing of 12 October 2000, the District Court invited the applicants to rectify certain shortcomings in their action and to specify which of the four defendants in fact represented the interests of the State. On 12 December 2000 the court urgently reminded the applicants to submit this information.', ""20. On 12 March 2001 the District Court, upon the applicants' request received on 10 January 2001, adjourned the proceedings pending the Supreme Court's decision on the applicants' appeal on points of law concerning their eviction from the house."", ""21. On 30 October 2001 the District Court resumed the proceedings for damages, the decision of the Supreme Court of 28 June 2001 rejecting the applicants' appeal having become effective on 19 July 2001."", '22. On 2 November 2001 the court invited the applicants to rectify, within four weeks, certain shortcomings in their action, to specify who of the four defendants in fact represented the State, and to quantify their claim for damages. On 16 November 2001 the Ministry of the Interior requested the court to take a decision in this respect.', '23. On 18 February 2002 the applicants rectified their action. However, on 24 October 2002, they were requested to rectify further shortcomings and supplement their action.', ""24. On 28 November 2002, upon the District Court's invitation of 22 October 2002, the applicants specified their arguments on which they based their action for damages. On 18 December 2002 they adduced further documentary evidence, proposing that the District Court ensure the submission of certain additional documents."", '25. On 7 February 2003 the Ministry of Finance informed the District Court that the applicants had requested to have the purchase price reimbursed but that, according to their lawyer, they had not complied with the court judgment to return the house, had continued to pay the annual instalments and, therefore, had not insisted on the settlement of the case, i.e. on the reimbursement of the purchase price. The Ministry assured the court that it was ready to reimburse the amount due to the applicants.', '26. On 24 April 2003 a hearing was held by the District Court, and was adjourned until 23 June 2003.', '27. On 4 June 2003 the applicants submitted their supplementary observations on the merits of their action for damages.', ""28. The hearing held on 23 June 2003 was adjourned to 14 July 2003, when the District Court decided that the proceedings concerning the payment of the purchase price, with interest for the delays in payment since 18 January 1999, would be considered separately. It dismissed the remainder of the applicants' claim for damages."", '29. On the same day, the Ministry of Finance reimbursed the whole purchase price of CZK 344,846 (EUR 10,878) to the applicants who, on 11 August 2003, withdrew the relevant part of their action for damages.', ""30. On 18 December 2003 the Regional Court, upon the applicants' appeal of 1 September 2003, upheld the merits of the District Court's judgment."", '31. On 22 March 2004 the applicants filed an appeal on points of law (dovolání) in the Supreme Court (Nejvyšší soud). These proceedings are still pending.', '32. On 21 June 2004 the District Court, after having held a hearing on 4 June 2004, stayed the proceedings as to the payment of the purchase price. It ordered the Ministry of Finance to pay interest for the delays in payment since 18 January 1999 within three days of the coming into force of the judgment.', '33. The defendant lodged an appeal against this judgment. The appellate proceedings are still pending.']",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[]

In January 1967 the applicant was convicted of murder. He was released on licence in April 1979. His licence required him to cooperate with his probation officer and to remain in the United Kingdom unless his probation officer agreed to his travelling abroad.', '11. Soon after release the applicant left the United Kingdom in breach of his licence and went to live in South Africa. In September 1980 his licence was revoked and thereafter he was continuously “unlawfully at large”.', '12. In April 1989 the applicant was arrested in the United Kingdom, having returned from South Africa in possession of a false passport. Possession of a false passport led to a fine. He remained in custody, however, due to the revocation of the life licence. He made written representations to the Parole Board against the 1980 decision to recall him to prison but the Board rejected those representations and recommended a further review in July 1990.', ""13. In November 1990 the Board recommended the applicant's release subject to a satisfactory release plan. This recommendation was accepted by the Secretary of State. In March 1991 the applicant was released on life licence."", ""14. In July 1993 the applicant was arrested and remanded in custody on counterfeiting charges. On 19 July 1994 he was convicted on two counts of conspiracy to forge travellers' cheques and passports and sentenced to six years' imprisonment."", ""15. In September 1994 the Parole Board recommended revocation of the applicant's life licence and further review at the parole eligibility date of his six-year sentence. The Secretary of State accepted the Board's recommendation, revoking the licence under section 39(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 (“the 1991 Act”). The applicant made written representations, but the Board maintained its decision."", ""16. In 1996 the Parole Board conducted a formal review of the applicant's case and recommended his release on life licence. It said:"", '“This case is exceptional in that it is a recall one and he has previously made a successful transition from prison to the community without violent reoffending ... It is felt that the risk of serious reoffending in the future is very low. Recent reports of progress in prison have been favourable and no untoward incidents have been reported; positive links with his family have been maintained. In view of these facts, it is now felt that he could be released safely and appropriately into the community. The Panel took the view after lengthy consideration that nothing further would be gained by a period in open conditions, and the successful return to the community, bearing in mind all risk factors, would be best facilitated by returning to his family directly.”', ""17. By letter of 27 February 1997 to the applicant, the Secretary of State rejected the Board's recommendation in the following terms:"", '“... [The Secretary of State] notes with concern the circumstances surrounding your two recalls to prison ... Both these occasions represent a serious and grave breach of the trust placed in you as a life licensee and demonstrate a lack of regard for the requirements of supervision. Against this background the Secretary of State is not yet satisfied that if released on licence for a third time, you would fully comply with the conditions of your life licence. He notes that you have spent the past 3 1/2 years in closed prison conditions and therefore have not on this occasion followed the normal progression of life sentence prisoners. This involves a period in open conditions, giving you the opportunity to demonstrate sustained good behaviour and responsibility in a less secure environment; and to experience the full range of resettlement activities in preparation for release.', 'For these reasons, the Secretary of State considers that you should be transferred to an open prison for a final period of testing and preparation. Your next formal review by the Parole Board will begin 2 years after your arrival there.”', ""18. On 10 June 1997 the applicant was granted leave to seek judicial review of the Secretary of State's decisions to reject the Board's recommendation for immediate release and to require him to spend a further two years in open conditions before the next review."", '19. On 1 July 1997, but for the revocation of his life licence, the applicant would have been released from prison on the expiry of the sentence for fraud, pursuant to provisions whereby prisoners serving determinate sentences of more than four years were released after serving two-thirds of their sentence (section 33 of the 1991 Act).', '20. The Secretary of State acknowledged in the proceedings that there was not a significant risk that the applicant would commit further violent offences, but asserted that he could lawfully detain a post-tariff mandatory life prisoner solely because there was a risk that he might commit further non-violent imprisonable offences.', ""21. On 5 September 1997 Mr Justice Collins quashed the Secretary of State's decision of February 1997, holding that it was beyond his power to detain a post-tariff life prisoner other than on the basis that there existed an unacceptable risk that he might commit a future offence involving a risk to the life or limb of the public."", ""22. On 26 November 1997 the Court of Appeal allowed the Secretary of State's appeal, holding that section 35(2) of the 1991 Act conferred a broad discretion on the Secretary of State to direct the release of mandatory life prisoners and his decision not to release the applicant was in accordance with the previously stated policy whereby the risk of reoffending was taken into account, such risk not having been expressed as being limited to offences of a violent or sexual nature. Lord Bingham CJ stated, however:"", '“The applicant is now serving the equivalent of a determinate sentence of about five years, albeit in open conditions. This term has not been imposed on him by way of punishment, because he has already served the punitive terms which his previous, very serious, offences have been thought to merit. The term has not been imposed because he is thought to present danger to the public, because that is not suggested. It is not submitted that the term imposed bears any relation to the gravity of any future imprisonable offence which the applicant might commit or that such term is needed to ensure future compliance with the terms of his life licence. While a powerful case can be made for testing in open conditions a mandatory life prisoner who has been institutionalised by long years of incarceration in closed conditions, such a case loses much of its force in the case of a man who has, since serving the punitive term of his life sentence, demonstrated his capacity for living an independent and apparently lawful life by doing so for a number of years. The imposition of what is in effect a substantial term of imprisonment by the exercise of executive discretion, without trial, lies uneasily with ordinary concepts of the rule of law. I hope that the Secretary of State may, even now, think it right to give further consideration to the case.”', '23. Lord Justice Buxton, concurring with the latter remarks, added:', ""“The category of imprisonable offence is extremely wide, and can encompass many matters that are wholly unrelated, both in nature and seriousness, to the reasons for the life sentence prisoner being within the power of the State in the first place. I also find it uncomfortable that the criterion should be used as the justification for continued imprisonment. We were told in argument that the test of imprisonable offence, rather than of fault of a purely moral or social nature, was used because faults of the latter nature would be unconnected with the original reasons for the subject's incarceration; but in reality this lack of connection exists, or at least is strongly threatened, by the imprisonable offence criterion also. ...”"", '24. On 16 December 1997 the applicant was moved to open conditions.', '25. By letter dated 21 January 1998, the Secretary of State decided that the applicant should spend only six months in open conditions before his next review.', ""26. On 23 July 1998 the House of Lords dismissed the applicant's appeal against the Court of Appeal's decision. In his speech, with which the rest of the judges agreed, Lord Steyn held that section 35(2) of the 1991 Act conferred a wide administrative discretion on the Secretary of State to decide upon the release on licence of mandatory life prisoners and that there was no fundamental common-law principle of retributive proportionality which restrained him from detaining a mandatory life prisoner by reference to a risk that he may in future commit a serious but non-violent offence. He expressly repeated Lord Bingham's concern that the imposition of a substantial term of imprisonment by exercise of administrative discretion was hard to reconcile with ordinary concepts of the rule of law."", '27. On 22 December 1998 the applicant was released on licence by the Secretary of State.', ""28. Murder carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment under the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965. A person convicted of other serious offences (such as manslaughter or rape) may also be sentenced to life imprisonment at the discretion of the trial judge where there are exceptional circumstances which demonstrate that the offender is a danger to the public and it is not possible to say when that danger will subside. Where an offender is under 18 years of age when the offence of murder is committed, he or she is sentenced to detention during Her Majesty's pleasure (section 53(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933)."", ""29. As at 31 December 2001 there were 3,171 male and 114 female mandatory life prisoners, 228 men and 11 women serving a sentence of detention during Her Majesty's pleasure and 1,424 male and 25 female discretionary life prisoners."", '30. Over the years, the Secretary of State has adopted a “tariff” policy in exercising his discretion whether to release offenders sentenced to life imprisonment. This was first publicly announced in Parliament by Mr Leon Brittan on 30 November 1983 (Hansard (House of Commons Debates) cols. 505-07). In essence, the tariff approach involves breaking down the life sentence into component parts, namely retribution, deterrence and protection of the public. The “tariff” represents the minimum period which the prisoner will have to serve to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence. The Home Secretary will not refer the case to the Parole Board until three years before the expiry of the tariff period, and will not exercise his discretion to release on licence until after the tariff period has been completed (per Lord Browne-Wilkinson, R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte V. and T. [1998] Appeal Cases 407, at pp. 492G-493A).', '31. According to section 34 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 (“the 1991 Act”), the tariff of a discretionary life prisoner is fixed in open court by the trial judge after conviction. After the tariff has expired, the prisoner may require the Secretary of State to refer his case to the Parole Board, which has the power to order his release if it is satisfied that it is no longer necessary to detain him for the protection of the public.', ""32. A different regime, however, applied under the 1991 Act to persons serving a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment (now replaced by the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 (“the 1997 Act”), sections 28-34). In relation to these prisoners, the Secretary of State decides the length of the tariff. The view of the trial judge is made known to the prisoner after his trial, as is the opinion of the Lord Chief Justice. The prisoner is afforded the opportunity to make representations to the Secretary of State, who then proceeds to fix the tariff and is entitled to depart from the judicial view (R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Doody [1994] 1 Appeal Cases 531; and see the Home Secretary, Mr Michael Howard's, policy statement to Parliament, 27 July 1993, Hansard (House of Commons Debates) cols. 861-64)."", '33. In the judicial review proceedings in Ex parte V. and T. (cited above), the House of Lords gave consideration, inter alia, to the nature of the tariff-fixing exercise.', '34. Lord Steyn held:', ""“The starting-point must to be inquire into the nature of the power to fix a tariff which the Home Secretary exercises. Writing on behalf of the Home Secretary the Home Office explained that: 'The Home Secretary must ensure that, at all times, he acts with the same dispassionate fairness as a sentencing judge.' The comparison between the position of the Home Secretary, when he fixes a tariff representing the punitive element of the sentence, and the position of the sentencing judge is correct. In fixing a tariff the Home Secretary is carrying out, contrary to the constitutional principle of the separation of powers between the executive and the judiciary, a classic judicial function. Parliament entrusted the underlying statutory power, which entailed a discretion to adopt a policy and fix a tariff, to the Home Secretary. But the power to fix a tariff is nevertheless equivalent to a judge's sentencing power.”"", '35. Lord Hope held:', '“But the imposition of a tariff, which is intended to fix the minimum period in custody is, in itself, the imposition of a form of punishment. This has, as Lord Mustill observed in R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Doody at p. 557A-B, the characteristics of an orthodox judicial exercise, which is directed to the circumstances of the offence and those of the offender and to what, having regard to the requirements of retribution and deterrence, is the appropriate minimum period to be spent in custody. The judge, when advising the Secretary of State about the tariff, must and does confine his attention to these matters ...', 'If the Secretary of State wishes to fix a tariff for the case – in order to replace the views of the judiciary with a view of his own about the length of the minimum period – he must be careful to abide by the same rules ...”', '36. In Ex parte Pierson [1998] Appeal Cases 539, Lord Steyn stated, in a case concerning mandatory life prisoners:', ""“In public law the emphasis should be on substance rather than form. The case should not be decided on a semantic quibble about whether the Home Secretary's function is strictly 'a sentencing exercise'. The undeniable fact is that in fixing a tariff in the individual case the Home Secretary is making a decision about the punishment of the convicted man. In any event, a majority holding in Ex Parte V. concludes the matter ... This point is therefore settled by the binding authority of a decision of the House.”"", '37. A whole life tariff may be set in appropriate cases. In R. v. the Home Secretary, ex parte Hindley [2001] 1 Appeal Cases, where a provisional tariff of thirty years had been replaced by a whole life tariff, Lord Steyn held that “life-long incarceration for the purposes of punishment is competent where the crime or crimes are sufficiently heinous”. The decision of the Secretary of State to apply a whole life tariff in her case was found in the circumstances to be lawful. He had been entitled to revise his view of the tariff, which had initially been based on incomplete knowledge of her role in the three murders upon which she had faced trial and in ignorance of her involvement in two other murders, matters which came to light later. According to information provided by the Government, there were twenty-two mandatory life prisoners with whole life tariffs at 31 December 2001.', '38. At the relevant time, the Criminal Justice Act 1991 provided in section 35(2):', '“If recommended to do so by the [Parole] Board, the Secretary of State may, after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice together with the trial judge if available, release on licence a life prisoner who is not a discretionary life prisoner.”', ""This is in contrast to the position for other life prisoners, where the Parole Board now has the power of decision – pursuant to the provisions of the 1991 Act for discretionary life prisoners and pursuant to the 1997 Act for detainees during Her Majesty's pleasure. Where, however, a mandatory life prisoner was recalled to prison, the Parole Board did have a power to direct the Secretary of State to release the prisoner immediately (section 39(5) of the 1991 Act, now section 32(5) of the 1997 Act)."", '39. On 27 July 1993 the Secretary of State made a statement in Parliament explaining his practice in relation to mandatory life prisoners. The statement emphasised that before any mandatory life prisoner is released on life licence, the Secretary of State', '“will consider not only (a) whether the period served by the prisoner is adequate to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence and (b) whether it is safe to release the prisoner, but also (c) the public acceptability of early release. This means that [he] will only exercise [his] discretion to release if [he is] satisfied that to do so will not threaten the maintenance of public confidence in the system of criminal justice.”', ""40. In determining the principles of fairness that apply to the procedures governing the review of mandatory life sentences, the English courts have recognised that the mandatory sentence is, like the discretionary sentence, composed of both a punitive period (“the tariff”) and a security period. As regards the latter, detention is linked to the assessment of the prisoner's risk to the public following the expiry of the tariff (see, for example, R. v. Parole Board, ex parte Bradley (Divisional Court) [1991] 1 Weekly Law Reports 135, and R. v. Parole Board, ex parte Wilson (Court of Appeal) [1992] 2 All England Law Reports 576)."", '41. In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Doody ([1993] 3 All England Law Reports 92), the House of Lords observed that, in contrast with the position as regards discretionary life sentences, the theory and practice in respect of mandatory life sentences were out of tune. In his speech, with which the other judges agreed, Lord Mustill explained that the policy whereby murder was treated as an offence so grave that the proper penal element of the sentence was detention for life was inconsistent with the practice adopted by successive Secretaries of State that a mandatory life sentence included a “tariff” period to reflect the requirements of retribution and deterrence. He added:', '“The discretionary and mandatory life sentences, having in the past grown apart, may now be converging. Nevertheless, on the statutory framework, the underlying theory and current practice, there remains a substantial gap between them. It may be – I express no opinion – that the time is approaching when the effect of the two types of sentence should be further assimilated. But this is a task of Parliament, and I think it quite impossible for the courts to introduce a fundamental change in the relationship between the convicted murderer and the State, through the medium of judicial review.”', '42. On 10 November 1997 the Secretary of State made the following parliamentary statement, inter alia:', '“I take the opportunity to confirm that my approach on the release of adults convicted of murder once tariff has expired will reflect the policy set out in the answer given on 27 July 1993. In particular, the release of such a person will continue to depend not only on the expiry of tariff and on my being satisfied that the level of risk of his committing further imprisonable offences presented by his release is acceptably low, but also on the need to maintain public confidence in the system of criminal justice. The position of a prisoner subject to a mandatory life sentence continues to be distinct from that of a prisoner serving a discretionary life sentence, a decision on whose final release is a matter for the Parole Board alone.”', '43. It was noted by the Court of Appeal in R. (Lichniak and Pyrah) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2001] 3 Weekly Law Reports (judgment of 2 May 2001) that the criterion of public acceptability of release identified by the Home Secretary (point (c) in paragraph 39 above) had never been a determining factor, although the current Home Secretary followed the policy of his predecessors.', '44. On 2 October 2000 the Human Rights Act 1998 came into force, permitting the provisions of the Convention to be relied on in domestic proceedings.', ""45. In Lichniak and Pyrah (cited above), the two applicants challenged the imposition on them for murder of a mandatory life sentence, arguing that this was disproportionate and arbitrary and contrary to Articles 3 and 5 of the Convention. In dismissing their appeals, the Court of Appeal found that the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment was in reality an indeterminate sentence, rarely involving imprisonment for life, and as such could not be labelled inhuman and degrading. Nor was it arbitrary as in each case the sentence was individualised from the moment it was imposed. The purpose of the mandatory life sentence was, according to the Government's counsel,"", '“to punish the offender by subjecting him to an indeterminate sentence under which he will only be released when he has served the tariff part of his sentence, and when it is considered safe to release him ... That is not merely the effect of the sentence, it is the sentence”.', 'Lord Justice Kennedy also cited in his judgment the conclusions of the Committee on the Penalty for Homicide, chaired by Lord Lane, issued in 1993:', '46. In R. (Anderson and Taylor) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, two prisoners who had been convicted of murder complained that the Home Secretary had fixed a tariff superior to that recommended by the judiciary – twenty years instead of fifteen years and thirty years instead of sixteen years. They relied on Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, alleging that it was incompatible for the executive to carry out what was in fact a sentencing exercise. The Divisional Court dismissed their claims. The Court of Appeal rejected their appeals on 13 November 2001. In doing so, the appellate judges considered the nature of the tariff-fixing exercise for mandatory life prisoners and the significance of Strasbourg case-law.', 'Lord Justice Simon Brown held, inter alia:', ""“... I accept of course that the mandatory life sentence is unique. But not all the offences for which it is imposed can be regarded as uniquely grave. Rather the spectrum is a wide one with multiple sadistic murders at one end and mercy killings at the other. Lifelong punitive detention will be appropriate only exceptionally. As for 'broader considerations of a public character', it is difficult to understand quite what these are. Regard must not be had to 'public clamour' – see [V.]. There is, of course, 'the need to maintain public confidence in the system of criminal justice' (see the Home Secretary's statement to Parliament on 10 November 1997). To my mind, however, this can and should be catered for in the fixing of the tariff. The retributive element of the tariff should reflect the public's moral outrage at an offence. Surely the maintenance of public confidence in the system cannot require longer incarceration than that which properly reflects society's entitlement to vengeance. Sometimes, I recognise that will require a whole life tariff. But why should not the judges determine that? ... [A]s to retrospectively increasing the tariff ... [t]he same problem could presumably arise in a discretionary life sentence case. In truth, however, it begs rather than answers the question whether the initial fixing of the tariff is properly to be regarded as an exercise in sentencing."", ""In short I find none of Mr Pannick's arguments convincing. Neither singly nor cumulatively do they seem to me to provide a principled basis for treating tariff-fixing in mandatory life cases differently from the similar exercise required for discretionary life prisoners and Her Majesty's pleasure detainees. In all three cases the exercise is in substance the fixing of a sentence, determining the length of the first stage of an indeterminate sentence – that part of it which (subject only to the need for continuing review in Her Majesty's pleasure cases) must be served in custody before any question of release can arise ...”"", ""47. Although he was of the view that the existing mandatory life sentence regime breached Article 6 § 1 and Article 5 § 4, he, and the other two judges, considered that the Strasbourg case-law (in particular, Wynne v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 18 July 1994, Series A no. 294-A) had to be regarded as determinative of the Convention issues in the case. He noted that the European Court of Human Rights was about to re-examine the position in Stafford and, although considering that the final decision should be the Court's, stated that he would be surprised if the present regime for implementing mandatory life sentences survived that re-examination."", '48. In Scotland, the Convention Rights (Compliance) (Scotland) Act 2001 now provides that in the case of mandatory life sentences the trial judge fixes the “punishment part” of the sentence, on the expiry of which the Parole Board decides on possible release on licence. The test applied to determine suitability for release is identical to that applied to discretionary life prisoners in England and Wales, namely, that the Parole Board is satisfied that the prisoner does not present a substantial risk of reoffending in a manner which is dangerous to life or limb or of committing serious sexual offences.', '49. In Northern Ireland, the Life Sentences (Northern Ireland) Order SI no. 2564 provides that the trial judge decides on the tariff for a mandatory life prisoner and that release post-tariff is determined by Life Sentence Review Commissioners (with a status and functions very similar to those of the Parole Board operating in England and Wales). The test applied by the Commissioners is one of protection of the public from “serious harm”, this term meaning the risk of harm from violent or sexual offences.', '50. Justice, a human rights and law reform organisation founded in 1957, submitted written comments regarding domestic law and practice, following the leave granted to it by the President of the Court to intervene as a third party (see paragraph 7 above). Its submissions may be summarised as follows.', '51. The mandatory life sentence imposed by the 1965 Act (see paragraph 28 above) applied to all convictions for murder, covering a whole bundle of offences of vastly differing degrees of culpability, ranging from brutal serial killings to the mercy killing of a beloved partner. It could not be said that murder was a uniquely heinous offence. The mandatory application of life sentences therefore made the arrangements for release all the more critical in terms of fairness and just deserts. Access to regular judicial review once the tariff expired had been extended to discretionary life prisoners and child murderers and the Secretary of State could no longer set tariffs in these cases. Similar provisions were now being extended to mandatory life prisoners in both Scotland and Northern Ireland under legislation to ensure compliance with human rights.', '52. There had been substantial criticism of the current system. In 1989, a Select Committee of the House of Lords, appointed to report on murder and life imprisonment, recommended the abolition of the mandatory life sentence. In 1996 the Home Affairs Select Committee of the House of Commons took evidence and deliberated on the same issues. Their report (Murder: The Mandatory Life Sentence) recommended that the tariff and release decisions be removed from the Home Secretary and left with the trial judge and Parole Board. Lord Lane, formerly Lord Chief Justice, chaired a Committee on the Penalty for Homicide, which also produced a critical report in 1993.', '53. The diversity of circumstances that could lead to a murder conviction meant that murderers as a class of offender did not pose special problems of dangerousness. They had a lower recidivism rate than discretionary life prisoners and the general prison population. The system of tariff-fixing was not easily understood by the prisoners concerned and was subject to delays and uncertainty, both of which factors impinged on the quality of work with life prisoners at the crucial early stages of their sentences.', '54. The United Kingdom had more serving life prisoners than the rest of Europe together, which was attributable primarily to the mandatory life sentence for murder. While some countries, such as Germany, France and Italy, had mandatory life sentences, these were only applied where there were aggravating factors or for a particular type of murder. Article 77 of the Statute for the International Criminal Court provided that a life sentence could only be ordered “when justified by the extreme gravity of the crime and the individual circumstances of the convicted person”.']",['5'],"['5-1', '5-4']",[],[],[],[]

CROATIA,4,No violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Protection of property,Anatoly Kovler;Christos Rozakis;Dean Spielmann;Elisabeth Steiner;George Nicolaou;Khanlar Hajiyev,"['4. The applicant was born in 1945 and lives in Povlja on Brač island.', '5. The applicant was an employee of a company, Ceming, in Solin. Sometime in 1988 another employee of the same company, Z.G., moved into a flat in Split, Pujanke, owned by the company Ceming and measuring 77.38 square metres.', '6. On 6 June 1988 the company Ceming as the owner of the flat instituted administrative proceedings seeking Z.G.’s eviction on the ground that Z.G. had broken into the flat and moved in without any legal basis. The relevant part of the eviction request reads:', '“Z.G. moved into the flat without any authorisation, without a contract on the use of the flat or any other valid basis for entering the flat, by breaking the door ...”', '7. A decision ordering the eviction of Z.G. was issued on 27 June 1988 by the Split Municipality, Committee for Urbanism, Construction, Property and Housing (“the Split Housing Committee”). The parties were, however, not able to submit a copy of this decision because the case file had been lost. It was referred to in the submissions filed by Ceming with the Split State Attorney’s Office on 6 September 1989. The relevant part of these submissions reads:', '“Z.G. moved into the flat without any authorisation, without a contract on the use of the flat or any other valid basis for entering the flat, by breaking the door ...', 'In view of the above [Ceming] instituted administrative proceedings with the Split Municipality, Committee for Urbanism, Construction, Property and Housing, and that Committee ordered the eviction of Z.G. from the flat in question in its decision of 27 June 1988 ...”', '8. On 8 May 1989 the company Ceming allocated to Z.G. another flat in Split, in the same apartment building, measuring 54,18 square metres.', '9. The decision of 8 May 1989 was annulled as illegal on 8 January 1990 by the Split Employment Court. It found that Z.G. had a house where he lived with his family. The relevant part of this decision reads:', '“According to the statement of participant Z.G. and a report of the on-site visit carried out by the Commission of the respondent this court has established that the participant, together with his family, lives in a one-storey family house located in Klis. According to Z.G, the ground floor comprises two rooms, a kitchen, bathroom and toilet, measuring in all fifty square metres while the first floor, measuring about forty square metres, comprises two more rooms and an additional space. It is undisputed that the first floor is in the exclusive ownership of Z.G., while the ground floor, again according to Z.G., is in his co-ownership in 5/8 together with his mother in 1/8, his brother in 1/8 and the children of his late brother in 1/8. The whole building is in sole and undisturbed possession of Z.G, his spouse, one son and Z.G.’s mother, while his other son rents a flat in Kučine. ...”', '10. On 6 December 1990 the company Ceming allocated to the applicant and his family (his wife and three children) a flat in Split, Pujanke, the same one Z.G. had already moved into, consisting of three bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen with a dining room, storage, a bathroom with toilet and a hallway, and measuring 77.38 square metres, by which the applicant acquired a specially protected tenancy of the flat. A note on the allocation decision stated that it became final on 21 September 1990. The flat was publicly owned and the said company had the right to dispose of it. The applicant and his family could not, however, move into the flat because Z.G. occupied it (see § 5 above).', '11. On 28 December 1990 Ceming sought enforcement of the decision of 27 June 1988, namely that the eviction of Z.G. be carried out (see § 7 above). On 15 January 1991 the Split Housing Committee issued an enforcement order against Z.G. on the basis of its decision of 27 June 1988, after which the administrative authorities unsuccessfully attempted on eleven occasions to enforce the eviction order between January 1991 and December 1994.', '12. On 3 June 1991 Parliament enacted the Protected Tenancies (Sale to Occupier) Act (Zakon o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo), which regulated the sale of publicly-owned flats previously let under protected tenancies, giving the right to holders of such tenancies of publicly-owned flats to purchase them from the provider of the flat under favourable conditions. All publicly-owned flats became the property of the municipalities in which they were situated.', '13. On an unspecified date in 1991 the applicant brought a civil action in the Split Municipal Court for Z.G.’s eviction. The applicant argued that Z.G. had no title to occupy the flat, while the applicant had been granted a specially protected tenancy of the flat. On 18 July 1991 the applicant’s claim was allowed and the court ordered Z.G. to vacate the flat within eight days of the date when the decision became final. The relevant part reads:', '“The decision granting the flat to the plaintiff was adopted on 3 December 1990 and it is therefore clear that it could not have become final on 20 September 1990, as is noted on it. ... It is obviously a mistake. However, the fact is that that decision had meanwhile become final because if not, the plaintiff, as a tenant - a holder of a specially protected tenancy - would not have been issued with a decision fixing the amount of the rent for the flat ...', 'The defendant is using the flat in question without any right to do so. The results of the proceedings show that the flat in question has never been allocated for his use ... Therefore, he has no legal basis to live in the flat in question ...”', 'However, the judgment was quashed and the case remitted to the Split Municipal Court for a new trial. On 16 July 1993 that court found that it had no jurisdiction in the matter because the applicant had never moved into the flat. This decision was upheld by the Split County Court (Županijski sud u Splitu) on 22 October 1993.', '14. Meanwhile, in August 1992 Z.G. brought a civil action against the applicant in the Split Municipal Court, seeking the annulment of the decision of 6 December 1990 by which the applicant had been granted the specially protected tenancy of the flat in question. On an unspecified date Z.G. died and his wife, A.G., took over the proceedings.', '15. Under the Protected Tenancies (Sale to Occupier) Act the applicant as the buyer and Split Municipality as the seller concluded a contract for the sale of the said flat on 18 October 1994. A copy of the contract was submitted for approval by the State Attorney’s Office. On 21 October 1994 approval was given. It also stated that that approval could not preclude the State Attorney from seeking annulment of the contract.', '16. After the applicant had become the owner of the flat in 1994, he became entitled to participate in the administrative proceedings concerning the eviction of Z.G. (see § 11 above). On 4 November 1994 the applicant asked for the eviction order to be carried out. The eviction was scheduled for 19 December 1994 but was not carried out.', '17. On 11 January 1995 the Split State Attorney’s Office brought a civil action against the applicant and Split Municipality in the Split Municipal Court, seeking annulment of the contract of sale in question. They argued that the applicant had never obtained a protected tenancy of the flat because he had never moved into it.', '18. On 27 January 1997 the Split Housing Committee discontinued the enforcement proceedings and annulled the enforcement order of 15 January 1991 (see § 11 above), finding that pursuant to the Constitutional Court’s decision of 20 November 1996 by which certain provisions of the Housing Act were revoked, it no longer had jurisdiction in the matter.', '19. As regards the civil action brought by the Split State Attorney’s Office (see § 17 above), the Municipal Court held in favour of the latter and in its judgment of 10 July 2002 annulled the contract of sale between the applicant and the Split Municipality (see § 15 above). It held that the conditions for acquiring protected tenancy were that there should exist a final and enforceable decision on granting such a tenancy and that the holder of the protected tenancy had moved into the flat concerned. It found that the stamped certificate stating that the decision of 6 December 1990, granting the applicant protected tenancy on the flat at issue, had become final, was obviously erroneous since it bore the date 21 September 1990. It was impossible for a decision of 6 December 1990 to become final three months before it was issued. It concluded as follows:', '“... this court considers that the first defendant has never moved into the flat in question and therefore according to the relevant legal provisions has never acquired the status of a holder of a specially protected tenancy. He could not therefore have purchased the flat in question under the provisions of the Specially Protected Tenancy (Sale to Occupier) Act. For that reason this court has not addressed the preliminary question whether the decision on granting the specially protected tenancy had become final, because the criterion for acquiring a specially protected tenancy, namely that the first defendant has moved into the flat, has not been satisfied and thus the first defendant has not acquired the status of a holder of a specially protected tenancy.”', '20. The judgment was upheld by the Split County Court on 27 August 2004. The relevant part of the judgment reads:', '“The findings of the first-instance court that the sale contract concluded on 18 October 1994 between the defendants was null and void are accepted as correct by this court....', 'The first-instance court correctly established the following relevant facts:', '- that the first defendant had been granted the right to occupy the flat in question by a decision of Ceming, ... of 6 December 1990;', '- that the first defendant had never moved into the flat on the basis of a final decision.', 'On the basis of the above facts, which were correctly and fully established, the first-instance court correctly concluded that the first defendant had never acquired the specially protected tenancy of the flat in question because, under section 59 § 1 of the Housing Act (Official Gazette nos. 51/85 – 70/93,...), the specially protected tenancy is acquired on the day of entering the flat on the basis of a final decision to that effect.', 'Since the first defendant has not acquired the specially protected tenancy, he does not have the right under section 6 § 1 of the Specially Protected Tenancy (Sale to Occupier) Act (Official Gazette nos. 43/92 – 58/95) to purchase the flat. Therefore, the conclusion of the first-instance court that the sale contract of 18 October 1994 was null and void, under section 103 § 1 of the Civil Obligations Act (Official Gazette nos. 53/91 – 112/99), is correct.', '...', 'It is undisputed between the parties to the proceedings that the first defendant was granted the flat in question by a decision ... of 6 December 1990 and that it bears a certified stamp that it had become final on 21 September 1990.', 'The conclusion of the first-instance court that the above decision could not have become final before it had been issued is correct.', '...', 'The first defendant, in his evidence given on 17 October 2000, claimed that he had no possession of the flat in question since September 1990 which confirms that the decision of the first-instance court is correct because, even assuming that he actually had possession of the flat in September 1990, such possession was not based on the final decision granting him that flat for his use.”', '21. In his subsequent constitutional complaint the applicant argued that the decision of 6 December 1990 had in fact become final on 6 January 1991 and that he had been prevented from entering the flat because Z.G. had already occupied it illegally in 1988. He also relied on the Supreme Court’s practice that a specially protected tenancy could not be lost where the holder of such a tenancy had failed to enter the flat because it had already been illegally occupied by a third person. It was dismissed by the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) on 26 October 2006 as ill-founded.', '22. In the civil proceedings brought by Z.G. in August 1992 (see § 14 above), on 30 April 2007 the Split Municipal Court declared the decision of 6 December 1990 (granting the specially protected tenancy to the applicant) null and void on the ground that it had not been adopted according to the procedure prescribed for granting a specially protected tenancy. This judgment was upheld by the Split County Court on 6 February 2008 and thus became final.', '23. The relevant provisions of the Housing Act (Zakon o stambenim odnosima, Official Gazette nos. 51/1985, 42/1986, 22/1992 and 70/1993) read as follows:', '“A protected tenancy shall be acquired on the day of entering the flat ...”', '“A person who does not enter the flat [of which he or she is granted a specially protected tenancy] without a justified reason within thirty days of the day when he or she is granted occupancy shall lose the right to occupy the flat [granted to him or her].”', '24. The Protected Tenancies (Sale to Occupier) Act (Zakon o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo, Official Gazette no. 27/1991 with further amendments - “the Act”) regulated the conditions of sale of flats let under protected tenancies.', 'Section 1 of the Act gave the right to the holders of protected tenancies of publicly-owned flats to purchase such flats under favourable conditions, provided that each holder bought only one flat.', 'Section 21 obliged a seller to submit the sale contract for approval by the competent State Attorney’s Office within eight days.', '25.

The Employment of Foreigners Act (Ausländerbeschäftigungs-gesetz) regulates a foreigner's access to the Austrian labour market. Section 2 (5) of this act, as in force at the relevant time, reads as follows:"", '“(5) Key workers are foreigners who have particular training or specific know- how and professional experience which are requested on the domestic labour market and who would receive for their employment a monthly gross salary of at least 60% of the maximum contribution level under Section 108 para. 3 of the General Social Security Act.

GEORGIA,4,Violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security,András Sajó;Françoise Tulkens;Ireneu Cabral Barreto;Nona Tsotsoria;Vladimiro Zagrebelsky,"['5. The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Rustavi.', '6. On 6 December 2003 the applicant was arrested by the police and charged with the offence of the unlawful possession of drugs.', '7. On 8 December 2003 the Vake-Saburtalo District Court in Tbilisi remanded the applicant in custody for three months. The court endorsed the prosecutor’s argument that, in view of the applicant’s prior conviction for which he had been on probation, there was a reasonable suspicion that he might abscond pending the new set of proceedings.', '8. On 19 February 2004 the prosecution brought against the applicant and two other persons additional charges of conspiracy to commit the unlawful possession of arms, robbery and murder.', '9. On 4 March 2004 the Tbilisi Regional Court extended the applicant’s detention until 5 May 2004.', '10. On 29 April 2004 the investigator in charge of the case, notifying the applicant and two other accused persons that the investigation had been terminated, invited them to study the case materials. The applicant contested the termination of the investigation, requesting that additional witnesses be examined. In a decision of 29 April 2004, the investigator, reasoning that the applicant could have made such a request earlier, dismissed it as an attempt to prolong the proceedings.', '11. On 5 May 2004 the authorised period of the applicant’s detention expired without the court ordering its extension.', '12. On 13 May 2004 the applicant complained to the competent prosecution authority that his detention had been unlawful since 5 May 2004. He also challenged the termination of the investigation as premature.', '13. In a decision of 16 May 2004, the Vake-Saburtalo district prosecutor dismissed the applicant’s complaint of 13 May 2004 as unsubstantiated. As regards the alleged unlawfulness of detention since 5 May 2004, the prosecutor reasoned that the time during which the accused studied case materials did not, under the relevant procedural law, count towards the detention term. In so far as the applicant and his representatives had started studying the case materials on 30 April 2004, this fact being proved by the relevant records of the investigator, the applicant’s detention thereafter could not be said to be unlawful.', '14. On 8 July 2004 the Vake-Saburtalo district prosecutor sent the criminal case, along with the bill of indictment, to the Supreme Court of Georgia for trial. According to the indictment, the three accused persons and their lawyers had been examining the case materials between 30 April and 7 July 2004.', '15. On 26 October 2004 the applicant complained to the Supreme Court, reiterating, inter alia, that no judicial decision had authorised his detention since 5 May 2004. As to the prosecutor’s reasoning that the time spent on studying the case materials had not counted towards the detention term, the applicant, relying on numerous factual details, first submitted that his lawyer had fully examined the file on 30 April and 1 May 2004, in two and a half hours. He further argued that, even if the investigator’s formal records were to be trusted, then the examination of the file should be considered to have ended on 28 June 2004. Since his case had been referred for trial only on 8 July 2004, the applicant claimed to have been kept in unlawful detention for at least ten days. In the light of the above arguments, he requested to be released immediately.', '16. On 27 October 2004 the Supreme Court, having examined the admissibility of the case, decided to commit the applicant and the two others for trial under Article 417, 425 and 428 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (“the CCP”). Without replying to the applicant’s allegations about the unlawfulness of his pre-trial detention, the court upheld the restraint measure on the basis of the “nature of the charges” and the inability to conduct, at the admissibility stage, a comprehensive judicial assessment of his arguments for release.', '17. As disclosed by the case file, the Supreme Court relinquished, on 6 May 2005, jurisdiction over the criminal proceedings in favour of the Tbilisi Regional Court. On 31 May 2005 the applicant complained about the unlawfulness of his detention before the latter, reiterating his previous arguments.', '18. On 20 July 2005 the Tbilisi Regional Court dismissed the applicant’ April 2004, immediately after the termination of the investigation on 29 April 2004. This process lasted until 7 July 2004, one day before the case was sent by the prosecutor for trial. Reiterating that, pursuant to Article 406 § 4 of the CCP, the period of examination of the case file did not constitute part of the authorised detention term, the Regional Court concluded that the applicant’s detention between 30 April and 7 July 2004 should not be taken into account.', '19. In an order of 5 July 2006, the President of the Supreme Court noted that, the applicant’s criminal case file having been sent for trial on 8 July 2004, the permissible term of twenty-four months for the defendant’s pre-trial detention under Article 680(4) § 9 of the CCP would expire on 8 July 2006. Using his prerogative under the same Article to extend, in exceptional circumstances, the detention beyond that term, the President remanded the applicant in custody until 8 November 2006.', '20. In a verdict of 22 December 2006 of the Tbilisi Regional Court, the applicant was convicted of the aforementioned offences and sentenced to twelve years in prison. The period of imprisonment started to run, according to the verdict, from the date of the applicant’s arrest on 6 December 2003.', 'Article 406 § 4 – “Time spent on studying the case materials”', '“The time spent by the accused (defendant) and his or her representative on studying the criminal case materials shall not be counted towards the period of detention prescribed by law.”', '“1. Where there is a sufficient basis for hearing the case, the judge (court), without prejudging the merits of the case, shall commit the accused for trial...', '3. During the admissibility hearing, in addition to deciding whether to commit the accused for trial..., the judge (court) shall decide whether to impose a measure of restraint on the accused.”', '“The judge (court) shall decide whether to commit the accused for trial within fourteen days or, in complicated cases, within a month of the date of delivery of a final judgment on the last criminal case registered with the same judge (court).”', 'The CCP distinguished between two periods of detention: detention “pending investigation”, whilst the case was investigated, and detention “pending trial”, whilst the case was tried by a court. Although there was no difference in practice between the two periods of detention, the calculation of the time-limits was different.', 'Incorporated into the Code by an Amendment of 25 March 2005, Article 680(4) contained provisional rules regulating the time-limits of the above-mentioned periods of detention. Pursuant to Articles 680(4) § 1, those provisional rules, particularly that contained in Article 680(4) § 9, were to remain valid until the entry into force of Article 162, the latter provision introducing shorter time-limits of detention.', 'Article 681 § 9 stated that Article 162 would enter into force on 1 January 2006.', 'Pursuant to Article 680(4) § 9, if only two levels of jurisdiction were involved, the permitted term of detention “pending trial” was twenty-four months. However, in “exceptional circumstances”, the President of the Supreme Court could extend that term to a maximum of thirty months.', 'An amendment of 28 April 2006, which entered into force on 13 May 2006, further revised Article 162, by reducing the maximum permissible term of detention pending “investigation” and “trial”, to nine months, both periods taken together. Simultaneously, Article 681 § 2 was amended to bring Article 162 into force on 1 January 2007. Consequently, the provisional rules on the detention time-limits contained in Article 680(4) also remained in force until 1 January 2007 (see Article 680(4) § 1 above).', 'The complainant challenged the constitutionality of Article 406 § 4 of the CCP. On 16 December 2003 the Constitutional Court declared that the provision was not only unconstitutional but also incompatible with Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. However, the Constitutional Court ruled in the operative part of its judgment that, in order “to avoid the creation of difficulties for the investigative authorities”, the enforcement of its judgment by the annulment of the impugned provision should be delayed until 25 September 2004.', 'Pursuant to section 23 § 1, if the Constitutional Court found the challenged legislative provision to be unconstitutional, that provision should be considered null and void from the moment the relevant judgment was pronounced.', 'Under Article 25 § 3, the Constitutional Court’s judgment should be enforced immediately after its announcement, unless another date was fixed.']",['5'],[],[],[],[],[]

The applicant was born in 1981 and lives in Moscow.', '7. On 11 October 2000, at the Luzhniki market, the applicant was arrested on suspicion of drug-dealing by the operative officers I. and K. of the Ramenskiy District police station of Moscow. He was identified by a Mr E. as the person who had sold him heroin. The exact time of the arrest was disputed by the parties. The applicant maintained that he had been apprehended at about noon, the Government claimed that it had happened at 4.30 p.m.', '8. At 6.50 p.m. the applicant was searched at the police station by the police officer R. in the presence of two lay witnesses (ponyatye). A sachet containing 0.004 g of heroin was found on him.', ""9. A record of the applicant's arrest was drawn up at 11.50 a.m. on the following day. On the same day the investigator ordered the applicant's placement in custody. The decision did not specify the duration of the detention period (see paragraph 51 below for relevant legal provisions)."", '10. On an unspecified date a confrontation between the applicant and Mr E. was arranged. Counsel for the applicant was in attendance. Mr E. confirmed his statement that he had bought heroin from the applicant.', '11. The applicant alleged that he had been beaten by police officers at the Ramenskiy District police station on 11 October 2000. The Government denied that allegation.', '12. It follows from the medical certificate of 24 October 2000 issued by the trauma department of clinic no. 8 that on 13 October 2000 at 3.10 p.m. the applicant was brought for a medical examination by the Ramenskiy District police officers. The medical examination revealed “a haematoma in the area of fourth to sixth ribs on the left side, a haematoma in the left side of the lumbar region, an abrasion in the area of the left knee joint”.', ""13. On 18 December 2000 a senior assistant to the Nikulinskiy District prosecutor's office issued a decision not to institute criminal proceedings in connection with the applicant's claim of ill-treatment. The reasoning of the one-page decision was founded on the statements by the police officers R., I. and K. who had taken part in the applicant's arrest and search. They denied that they had exercised any mental or physical pressure on the applicant."", '14. Counsel for the applicant contested the decision of 18 December 2000 before the deputy Moscow Town prosecutor. They submitted that the medical certificate of 24 October 2000 had been left outside the scope of the inquiry. The Moscow Town prosecutor ordered an additional inquiry.', '15. On 29 March 2001 the senior assistant issued a further decision not to institute criminal proceedings. The entire reasoning read as follows:', ""“During the additional inquiry, the Nikulinskiy District prosecutor's office examined the medical certificate which indicated that on 13 October 2000 [the applicant] had been brought to the medical unit where bodily injuries... had been recorded."", 'It follows from the certificate issued by the head of the Krylatskoye District police station Mr Z. that the applicant did not have any health complaints on his placement in the investigations ward, of which he made a handwritten note in the medical register.', 'Moreover, during the additional questioning of [the applicant] by the assistant prosecutor that took place before his placement in custody in the presence of the advocate [the name is unreadable], [the applicant] clarified that the police officers had not exercised pressure on him and that he had given the confession statement voluntarily. He had no claims against the police officers.', ""Having examined the collected materials, I find that [the applicant's] allegations that he had been subjected to mental and physical violence by the police officers, have no objective confirmation. It is impossible to establish the circumstances in which the bodily injuries recorded in the medical certificate had been received because he did not mention these injuries to the assistant prosecutor and because [at that time] he had no visible injuries or health complaints.”"", ""16. On 9 December 2000 the investigation was completed and the case file was transferred to the Nikulinskiy district prosecutor's office for final approval of the charge sheet."", '17. On 13 December 2000 the case against the applicant and Mr E. was submitted to the Nikulinskiy District Court of Moscow for trial.', '18. On 4 January 2001 the Nikulinskiy District Court of Moscow received the case-file.', ""19. On 11 January 2001 the Nikulinskiy District Court of Moscow issued a pre-trial decision. The decision represented a one-page printed template, in which the dates, the applicant's and his co-defendant's names, and the charges against them were filled in by hand. The relevant part read as follows (the pre-printed part in plain script and the part written by hand in italics):"", '“The Nikulinskiy District Court is competent to try the case; sufficient evidence for examination of the case has been collected; the charge sheet has been prepared in compliance with the requirements of the criminal-procedure law; there are no grounds to revoke or vary the measure of restraint imposed on the defendant; the defendant or third parties have not lodged any motions.', 'Recognising that the investigation of the case has been carried out in accordance with the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure and that the rights of the accused Mr E. and [the applicant] have been respected, and that there are no obstacles to the judicial examination, the court –', 'HAS HELD –', 'To fix the hearing of the criminal case against Mr E. and [the applicant] ... for 23 January 2001... with the participation of prosecutor, counsel.', 'The measure of restraint – the same for each defendant...”', 'The decision was issued in the absence of the applicant or his counsel and no copy thereof was served on them.', '20. On 23 January 2001 the hearing was adjourned for one week owing to the absence of counsel for the applicant.', ""21. On 30 January 2001 the District Court held a preliminary hearing in the case. Counsel petitioned the court for the applicant's release pending trial. The court dismissed the request, finding as follows:"", ""“Having heard the parties to the proceedings and submissions by the prosecutor who asked that the petition for [the applicant's] release not be granted, the court finds that there are no grounds to vary the measure of restraint imposed on [the applicant] because [the applicant] is charged with a criminal offence classified as a particularly serious offence punishable with deprivation of liberty and [because] the court has not yet completely examined the evidence collected by the prosecution.”"", ""22. On 5 and 22 February and 5 March 2001 counsel for the applicant appealed against that decision. They submitted that the applicant had a permanent place of residence in Moscow and no criminal record and therefore there were no reasons to believe that he would abscond. They also indicated that the applicant's detention from 11 to 12 October 2000 had not been recorded or covered with any authorisation. Moreover, the applicant had been only remanded in custody for two months and, accordingly, his detention after 12 December 2000 had been unlawful."", '23. On 5 March 2001 the Moscow City Court upheld the decision of 30 January 2001. It found as follows:', '“Pursuant to Article 97 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, pre-trial detention in criminal cases is limited to two months.', ""As it appears from the available materials, the criminal case was opened on 12 October 2000 and on the same day [the applicant] was remanded in custody; on 9 December [2000] [the applicant] was transferred to the Nikulinskiy District prosecutor's office of Moscow where the case-file was sent. Accordingly, there was no violation of Article 97 of the Code of Criminal Procedure during the investigation and the arguments in the appeal to the effect that the detention after 12 December 2000 had been unlawful are not grounded on the case materials."", 'Pursuant to Article 96 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, persons charged with [drug-dealing] can be remanded in custody on the sole ground of dangerousness of the offence; in this connection the court upholds the findings of the first-instance court as to the absence of grounds for varying the measure of restraint, and considers these findings to be lawful.”', '24. On 26 April 2001 counsel for the applicant again petitioned the trial court for his release pending trial. The request was refused. On 3 May 2001 the decision refusing the request was appealed against to the Moscow City Court. It does not appear that any response was received.', ""25. On 26 June 2001 the Nikulinskiy District Court extended, of its own motion, the applicant's detention by a further three months or until such time as the merits of the charges had been examined, finding that his release would “substantially impede a thorough, complete and objective examination of the case”."", ""26. On 5 July 2001 the applicant and Mr E. were convicted of drug-related offences by the Nikulinskiy District Court of Moscow. Mr E. was relieved from the punishment by virtue of the amnesty act. The applicant was sentenced to six years and six months' imprisonment in a high-security colony."", '27. On 17 October 2001 the Moscow City Court quashed the conviction on substantive and procedural grounds and remitted the case for a new trial by a different bench. The City Court directed that the applicant remain in custody, without giving any reasons for that decision.', '28. On 3 December 2001 the trial hearing was adjourned because Mr E. and witnesses did not appear.', '29. On 18 December 2001 the hearing did not take place because the bench was involved in another criminal case.', ""30. On 19 December 2001 counsel for the applicant complained to the president of the Nikulinskiy District Court that, because of previous adjournments of the hearings, the request for the applicant's release had not been examined on the merits. She also pointed to inhuman conditions of the applicant's detention. It does not appear that any response was received."", '31. On 10 January 2002 the hearing was adjourned because the presiding judge was ill.', '32. On 21 January 2002 the court examined the request for release and dismissed it. As witnesses did not appear, the case was adjourned until 4 February 2002. On 27 January 2002 the applicant appealed against the refusal to the Moscow City Court. It does not appear that his appeal was examined.', '33. On 4 February 2002 a new request for release was refused by the court. The hearing was adjourned until 12 February 2002 because of the absence of Mr E. and witnesses.', '34. On 12 February, 5 and 19 March 2002 the hearings were adjourned again, as the witnesses never appeared.', '35. On 17 April 2002 the court held a hearing. It heard the applicant, a witness for the defence and read out statements by witnesses who had failed to appear, including that by Mr E.', ""36. On 18 April 2002 the applicant was found guilty as charged and sentenced to six years and six months' imprisonment in a high-security colony and confiscation of property. As regards the applicant's allegations of ill-treatment by police officers, the court found as follows:"", ""“Statements by the witnesses Er. and G. [who testified] that [the applicant] was neatly dressed at the moment of his arrest, as well as the statement by the witness Ge. [who testified] that at the moment of the personal search [the applicant's] clothing was dirty and that he looked like a tramp cannot, in the court's opinion, confirm the fact that [the applicant] was subjected to physical pressure by police officers because this allegation was examined in the court hearing and found to be unsubstantiated; [this finding is] corroborated with statements by the [police officers] R., I., K., B., Mi. and Mu., and by the decision not to initiate a criminal investigation into [the applicant's] allegations..."", ""It follows from the medical certificate of 13 October 2000 that a doctor of the trauma department examined [the applicant] and found injuries... Before the court [the applicant] testified that these injuries had been inflicted on him by police officers. However, it was established in the court hearing that no physical or mental pressure had been exerted on [the applicant]; the court infers therefrom that the bodily injuries recorded on 13 October 2000 had been caused not under the circumstances described by [the applicant], but in some other way unrelated to [the applicant's] arrest and criminal proceedings against him.”"", '37. In finding the applicant guilty of drug possession and sale, the District Court relied on the material evidence (the sachet with heroin seized from the applicant), the testimony by Mr E. corroborated by statements of the police officers and lay witnesses present during the search and the record of the confrontation between the applicant and Mr E.', '38. On 8 June 2002 the applicant appealed against the conviction. He complained, in particular, that the conviction was based, to a significant extent, on his self-incriminating statements given under the pressure of police officers on the day of his arrest, as well as on the statement by Mr E. who had fled from justice and did not testify in the second trial.', ""39. On 9 September 2002 the Moscow City Court dismissed the appeal and upheld the conviction. It repeated verbatim the first-instance court's findings as regards the applicant's allegations of ill-treatment."", '40. From 11 July to 6 November 2001 and then from 23 April to 5 October 2002 the applicant stayed in remand centre no. IZ-77/3 in Moscow.', '41. In 2001, the applicant was held in cells nos. 405, 406 and 706, measuring approximately 36 sq. m. It follows from the documents submitted by the Government that the exact numbers of detainees could not be established because the registers had already been destroyed, however, the design capacity of the remand centre had been exceeded by 300 per cent.', '42. In 2002, the applicant was held in cells nos. 603, 602, 612. Cell 603 measured 26 sq. m and housed 21 to 37 detainees, cell 602 had 32 sq. m of floor space for 35 to 45 inmates, and cell 612 accommodated 4 to 6 persons on 9 sq. m.', '43. On 3 October 2001 counsel for the applicant complained about “appalling conditions” of his detention to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation and to the Minister of Justice.', '44. On 10 October 2001 the applicant drafted a hand-written complaint to the Presnenskiy District Court of Moscow. He wrote that he had spent more than a year in overcrowded cells that swarmed with bugs and lice. He suffered from lack of fresh air that hardly penetrated through the windows covered with metal bars. A majority of his forty cell-mates were heavy smokers; the light was on round the clock and people had to sleep in shifts. The toilet was not separated from the rest of the cell and offered no privacy whatsoever. He had contracted various diseases, including scabies, “putrefaction of limbs”, constant headaches and hypertension. According to the applicant, he did not send that complaint because he feared the reprisals the prison officials had threatened him with.', ""45. On 10 October 2001 the applicant's representative received two similar responses from the Main Prisons' Directorate of the Ministry of Justice. She was told that on arrival to the detention facility the applicant had been examined by a doctor who found him in good health. On 6 September 2001 a general practitioner gave him preventive treatment for scabies; on 12 September 2001 he was diagnosed with vegeto-vascular dystonia of normotonic type; on 25 September 2001 he received preventive treatment for scabies; on 1 October 2001 the applicant was diagnosed with atypical dermatitis. His state of health was found to be “satisfactory”."", ""46. On 8 and 10 January 2002 the applicant's representative received responses to her further complaints. She was informed that on 11 October 2001 the applicant had sought medical assistance for pyodermatitis and received appropriate treatment. On 6 November 2001 the applicant had been moved to another prison and placed in a common cell with sixty-three other detainees. On 7 December 2001 the administration of the detention facility refused medicines brought by the applicant's mother because the medical office of the facility had had all the necessary medicines. On 20 December 2001 the applicant was diagnosed with skin itch and residual effects of pyodermatitis."", ""47. The RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure (in force until 1 July 2002, “the CCrP”) established that a criminal investigation could be initiated by an investigator upon the complaint of an individual or on the investigative authorities' own initiative when there were reasons to believe that a crime had been committed (Articles 108 and 125). A prosecutor was responsible for general supervision of the investigation (Articles 210 and 211). He could order a specific investigative action, transfer the case from one investigator to another or order an additional investigation. If there were no grounds to initiate a criminal investigation, the prosecutor or investigator issued a reasoned decision to that effect which had to be notified to the interested party. The decision was amenable to an appeal to a higher prosecutor or to a court of general jurisdiction (Article 113)."", '48. On 29 April 1998 the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation held that anyone whose legitimate rights and interests had been affected by a decision not to institute criminal proceedings should have the right to appeal against that decision to a court.', '49. The Russian Constitution of 12 December 1993 establishes that a judicial decision is required before a defendant can be detained or his or her detention extended (Article 22). A decision ordering pre-trial detention could be taken by a prosecutor or a court (Articles 11, 89 and 96 of the CCrP).', ""50. Before 14 March 2001, pre-trial detention was authorised if the accused was charged with a criminal offence carrying a sentence of at least one year's imprisonment (Article 96 of the CCrP). The amendments of 14 March 2001 repealed the provision that permitted defendants to be remanded in custody on the sole ground of the dangerous nature of the criminal offence they committed."", '51. After the arrest the suspect was placed in custody “pending the investigation” for an initial two-month period (Article 97 of the CCrP). Further extensions could be granted by a prosecutor.', ""52. Once the investigation had been completed and the defendant had received the charge sheet and finished reading the case file, the file was transferred to a trial court. From that day the defendant's detention was “before the court” (or “pending the trial”). Until 14 March 2001 the Code of Criminal Procedure set no time-limit for detention “pending the trial”. On 14 March 2001 a new Article 239-1 was inserted which established that the period of detention “during the trial” could not normally exceed six months from the date the court received the file. The time-limit did not apply to defendants charged with particularly serious criminal offences."", ""53. The detainee or his or her counsel or representative could challenge the detention or extension order issued by a prosecutor, to a court. The judge was required to review the lawfulness of, and justification for, the order no later than three days after receipt of the relevant papers. The review was to be conducted in camera in the presence of a prosecutor and the detainee's counsel or representative. The detainee was to be summoned and a review in his absence was only permissible in exceptional circumstances if the detainee waived his right to be present of his own free will. The judge could either dismiss the challenge or revoke the pre-trial detention and order the detainee's release (Article 220-1 of the CCrP).""]","['3', '5']","['5-1', '5-3', '5-4']",['5-1-c'],[],[],[]

On 14 June 2002 the Bogunsky District Court of Zhytomyr rejected the applicant’s complaint about the bailiffs’ inactivity. The court stated that in October 2001, acting in the course of the enforcement proceedings to which the applicant’s case was subsequently joined, the Bailiffs’ Service levied the Police Department’s bank account, which revealed no funds suitable for attachment. The court found that no further actions regarding the Police Department’s account were possible in the absence of budgetary funds earmarked for such purposes. This judgment was upheld by the Court of Appeal on 26 August 2002 and by the Supreme Court on 13 January 2003.', '9. On 17 January 2004 the Koroliovsky District Court of Zhytomyr, on the Police Department’s request, temporarily suspended the enforcement proceedings.

The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr R.-H. Radu, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.', '3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '4. On 16 May 2003 the applicant took to Romania a car he had bought in Germany and for which he had paid 9,650 euros (EUR). An initial customs declaration was filled in on that date at the Romanian border.', '5. Subsequently, at his place of residence the applicant started the process of registering the car. On 20 May 2003 the registration office informed him that the car could be registered only if it passed a technical roadworthiness test.', '6. On 22 May 2003 the Bucharest Customs Office issued a primary customs declaration attesting that until it had been further clarified whether the car could be registered in Romania or not, it would have the status of goods in transit.', '7. Both customs declarations were filled in on behalf of the applicant by companies specialised in providing customs services. The companies’ names were recorded as the person declaring the goods, while the applicant’s name was recorded under the section “recipient of the goods”.', '8. On 23 May 2003, while the car was still in customs transit, the applicant sold it to D.D. He alleged that the car could not be registered in Romania as it was not environmentally friendly and did not fulfil certain technical criteria required by law. On the same day D.D. tried to take the car to the Republic of Moldova, but was prevented from doing so by Romanian border guards on the grounds that the car was still “in transit” and had not been cleared for export.', '9. On 26 May 2003, in the presence of the applicant, a customs officer drew up a report for the offence of selling goods while in customs transit. The applicant was fined 25,000,000 lei (ROL) and the car was confiscated in accordance with Article 386 (f) of the Instructions for the Application of the Romanian Customs Code (IARCC). The applicant signed the offence report without written comments.', '10. On 18 June 2003 the Râmnicu-Vâlcea District Court allowed an action lodged by the applicant and annulled the car sale contract concluded between him and D.D. on the grounds that D.D. had not paid the full price agreed. The court also mentioned that the advance of ROL 10,000,000 had been returned to D.D.', '11. The applicant contested the offence report before the courts, seeking annulment of the fine and the return of the car. He claimed that only D.D. should have been fined, since he had been the owner of the car when the report had been drawn up. On 14 July 2003 the Târgu Bujor District Court rejected the applicant’s action on the grounds that he had committed the offence of selling a car in customs transit, in contravention of Article 386 (f) of the IARCC. The court held that both the fine and the confiscation of the car were prescribed by law in order to prevent fiscal fraud.', '12. The applicant appealed against the decision, claiming that, since the sale contract had been annulled by a final judgment, the offence no longer existed.', '13. On 12 January 2004 the Galaţi County Court analysed the applicant’s allegations and concluded that the annulment of the sale contract subsequent to the discovery of the offence by the customs authorities did not infer that the offence no longer existed or had not been committed. The court further examined whether the offence report fulfilled the formal requirements and finally decided to uphold the first-instance court’s decision.', '14.

The applicant was born in 1944 and lives in Bucharest.', '6. From 1973 he lived in an apartment rented from the State in a nationalised building. On 13 January 1997, under Law no. 112/1995 on the legal status of certain residential property, the applicant bought that apartment from the State.', '7. In a final decision of 23 May 1997 the Bucharest District Court allowed an action (acţiunea în revendicare) brought by the former owner against the State for recovery of possession of the building where the applicant’s apartment was situated.', '8. Based on that decision, the former owner lodged several actions for recovery of possession against the persons who had bought apartments in the building in similar conditions, including the applicant.', '9. In a final decision of 28 January 2003 the Bucharest Court of Appeal ordered the applicant to surrender possession of the apartment to the plaintiff. The court found that the former owner’s property title deed, as it had been confirmed by the final decision of 23 May 1997, prevailed over the applicant’s purchase contract. It also considered that the applicant’s bona fides in concluding the 13 January 1997 contract was relevant only in the event that the applicant lodged an action for compensation against the State.', '10. Meanwhile, the same Court of Appeal did take into account the buyers’ good faith in dismissing actions lodged by the former owner against other persons who had bought apartments in the same building. Thus, on 28 November 2002 the Court of Appeal dismissed the action against T.I. and T.A., who had bought their apartment on 12 December 1996; on 7 February 2003 it dismissed the action against I.E. and M.S. and on 20 June 2003 it dismissed the action against C.D., who had bought his apartment on 27 March 1997.', '11. On 6 April 2006 the High Court of Cassation and Justice, acting on an application by the Procurator General (recurs în anulare), quashed the final decision of 28 November 2002 and sent the case back to the firstinstance court. According to the information available to the Court, the proceedings are still pending with the domestic courts.', 'On 9 February 2006 the High Court allowed a similar application by the Procurator General and set aside the 20 June 2003 decision, thereby allowing the former owner’s action against C.D.', 'A similar action by the Procurator General, lodged against the 7 February 2003 decision mentioned above, was allowed by the High Court on 14 February 2007. The case was sent back to the Bucharest County Court for re-examination of the appeal. The proceedings are still pending with that court.', '12. As to the applicant, eviction proceedings lodged by the former owner against him are currently pending with the domestic courts.', '13. Under Romanian law, an action for recovery of possession is one of the principal remedies for the protection of a right of property. Such action is not governed by statute per se but has emerged from case-law. An action for recovery of possession can be defined as the bringing of proceedings to enforce a right in rem in which a dispossessed owner claims back his or her property from the person currently in possession of it. When both the plaintiff and the defendant have a title deed, the court must compare the two deeds and decide which one is preferred. The main outcome of such an action, if successful, is the acknowledgment by the court of the claimant’s title to the property, with retrospective effect, thus obliging the defendant to return the property. If physical restitution is no longer possible, that obligation is replaced by an obligation to pay compensation on the basis of an equivalent sum (see Străin and Others v. Romania, no. 57001/00, § 26, ECHR 2005VII).', '14. Articles 1337-1351 of the Civil Code institute the seller’s responsibility for eviction. They provide for the evicted buyer to claim reimbursement of the price and also the payment of costs and damages, regardless of the seller’s good or bad faith. The buyer can either join the seller to the proceedings instituted against him by the third party or lodge a new action against the seller after having been evicted. In the latter case, if the seller proves that he could have won the case against the third party had he been joined to the proceedings, he will be exempted from compensating the buyer (Article 1351 of the Civil Code).', 'A bona fide buyer continues to enjoy the benefits of the property until he is no longer considered bona fide, that is at the latest when the action for eviction is lodged against him, at which time enjoyment of the property reverts to the rightful owner. However, the buyer may still claim compensation for his loss from the seller.', '15. At the date of the facts of the present case, Article 51 of Law no. 10/2001 on the rules governing immovable property wrongfully seized by the State between 6 March 1945 and 22 December 1989, as amended by the Government’s Emergency Ordinance no. 184 of 12 December 2002 (“Law no. 10/2001”), prescribed that an action for recovery of the purchase price, indexed to take account of inflation, brought against the State by a buyer whose contract had been declared null and void, was not subject to court fees. It also provided that the indexed price was to be paid by the Ministry of Finance from a special fund.', '16. At the Court’s request, the Government submitted case-law on the different actions for compensation when property is lost in conditions similar to those of the case at hand.', '17. Of the seventeen relevant decisions adopted between 2005 and 2008 by courts all over the country, nine concerned actions lodged against the State authorities by persons who lost their property in actions for recovery of possession. The courts applied the Civil Code and awarded them the indexed purchase price and, in most of the cases, damages and the costs reasonably incurred for the upkeep of the house. Most of the courts considered that Law no. 10/2001 was not applicable to actions for recovery of possession when the sale contract was not declared null and void in such proceedings.', '18. When such contracts are cancelled, however, the decisions submitted to the Court indicate that the courts consistently apply Law no. 10/2001 and award the buyer the indexed purchase price.', '19. In a decision no. 520/C of 3 December 2007 the Constanţa Court of Appeal found in favour of the buyer in an action for recovery of possession lodged by the former owner of a nationalised apartment against the person who in good faith had bought the apartment from the State in 2000. The court decided that the restitution of the apartment to the former owner was no longer possible and, based on the Court’s case-law on Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (in particular: Pincová and Pinc v. the Czech Republic, no. 36548/97, ECHR 2002VIII; Raicu v. Romania, no. 28104/03, 19 October 2006 and Păduraru v. Romania, no. 63252/00, ECHR 2005XII (extracts)), it compelled the State to pay the market value of the apartment in compensation to the former owner. In the court’the monetary award was the only solution to the action for recovery of possession.', '20. In a similar decision of 12 December 2007 the High Court of Cassation and Justice found in favour of the buyer in an action for recovery of possession lodged by the former owner. The High Court took account of the fact that the buyer’s title had been confirmed by the courts in an action in nullity of the sale contract lodged against him by the former owner whereas the former owner’s title had not been upheld by a court. It further considered that dispossessing the buyer regardless of the circumstances, in order to surrender the property to the former owner, would create disproportionate new wrongs in the attempt to attenuate old injuries. It also considered, in a general statement, that the reimbursement of the indexed purchase price under Law no. 10/2001 could not compensate the buyer as it did not reflect the property’s market value.', '21. In a decision no. 1055 of 9 October 2008 the Constitutional Court declared Article 47 of Law no. 10/2001 unconstitutional in so far as it breached the buyer’s property title. Under the provision concerned, persons whose actions based on the Civil Code had been dismissed before the entry into force of Law no. 10/2001 could use this Law in order once again to seek the restitution of their property. The Constitutional Court considered that persons whose title to property had been confirmed by a court decision could not be compelled to surrender that property where there was no serious justification for such a measure, based on public order, under Article 44 § 3 of the Constitution.']",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[]

On 2 May 2005 the Wiener Neustadt Regional Court, sitting as a court with two professional and two lay judges (Schöffengericht) under Presiding Judge I.K., acquitted H.P., a security officer at the Traiskirchen Reception Centre, of a charge of raping K., an asylum seeker from Cameroon, basing its ruling on the principle of in dubio pro reo.', '7. The reasoning of the judgment contained the following passage:', '“Lastly, the statement made by witness K. during her examination [recorded on video tape in a separate room – kontradiktorische Einvernahme], to the effect that she had previously been engaged in prostitution in her country of origin, allows inferences to be drawn with regard to the statement by the accused [P.] that the witness might have become involved with him because she expected – for whatever reason – to gain some advantage.”', '8. In issue no. 19/05 of Falter, an article was published on page 14 concerning the criminal proceedings against P., which read as follows:', '“‘Sex with a nigger woman’', 'The courts: An asylum seeker lodges a criminal complaint alleging rape against a security officer. The case takes on a political dimension because it exposes conditions in the Traiskirchen centre. One year later only the victim is still before the courts. The chronicling of a judicial scandal.', 'F. K.', 'She thought she had made it to safety. Elaine B. (name changed, ed.) had been ill-treated by police officers in Cameroon, kicked by them in the abdomen and placed with 18 other women in ‘stinking, damp cells’ for having demonstrated on behalf of her son, abducted by the authorities. She had survived her escape on a container ship, during which she ‘nearly went mad’ because in mid-ocean she ‘no longer knew whether it was night or day outside’. Finally, after a lorry journey lasting several days, she found herself in Vienna, where all at once, she was ‘surrounded by white people’. She thought she was safe. Her case was so well documented that Austria, in the form of the normally very strict Federal Refugee Office, granted her asylum quickly and without red tape.', 'But then this country revealed its other side. Elaine B., 35, a well-groomed businesswoman and mother of three, holds on tight to her handbag during the interview and breaks down in tears repeatedly, says her life is a mess [and that] she can no longer trust the authorities here because they treat her like a liar and a prostitute.', 'Elaine B. caused a media stir last year when she became the first asylum seeker to lodge a complaint against a blind-drunk security officer who she claims abused his authority in the Traiskirchen centre in order to rape her. Now she faces trial for defamation. A few fellow Cameroonians, as well as the campaigning lawyer W.R. and his colleague R.H., are continuing to stand by her. ‘Otherwise I would have killed myself’, says Elaine.', 'It’s difficult to know where to begin in this case. With the then Interior Minister E.S. who, while the proceedings were in progress, told the National Assembly that the woman’s accusations were ‘unfounded’? With the company European Homecare, engaged by him, which ostensibly ran the centre on a much smaller budget than Caritas, but in fact used subcontractors employing drunken nightwatchmen who had to be dismissed for sexual assault? With centre director F.S., who later commented on the attacks in the washrooms of the women’s quarters by telling the court: ‘According to our information such incidents are very common and no one thinks anything of them’? Or with Judge I.K., who at the end of the drama would no longer ‘refute’ the suggestion that Elaine B. was just a ‘prostitute’ – although not even the accused security officer claimed that that was the case?', 'Spring 2004. With a thousand asylum seekers, Traiskirchen is hopelessly overcrowded. Another hundred arrive every day. The Interior Ministry is coming under political pressure and discredits Caritas. Security officers at the centre later state in court that female asylum seekers could be paid for quick sex. They also tell of pimps rolling up to the centre in their cars. The sexual exploitation seems to have been unbearable. In a series of articles for profil, a female journalist published an email and statements from several women complaining of sexual assaults by security staff. ‘Please help us!’ pleaded the women. The Interior Ministry stated at the time that the police were confronted with a ‘wall of silence’.', 'At that time Elaine B. from Cameroon demanded an interview with the head of the Traiskirchen [branch of the] Gendarmerie. She placed a pair of torn red underpants on the interview room table and described ‘through her tears’ how a drunken security officer had pursued her for days, pointing to his uniform and threatening to have her thrown out of the centre and to slit her throat. One night he had crept into the room, switched on the light and told her to go with him. Elaine B., who had not yet been granted asylum and feared his authority, wrapped a towel around herself and followed the uniformed officer into the office, where there was a bed and a roll of kitchen towel. He had prepared the kitchen towel for ‘ejaculating into’, as he later admitted. ‘At first I didn’t realise what the man wanted. I thought I’d done something wrong. But there in that room I realised that he was going to rape me’, stated Elaine B. She could smell the drink on his breath and didn’t dare cry out.', 'The practising Christian from Cameroon is called upon to describe the incident many more times in the most intimate detail, without contradicting herself. She describes with precision how the man locked the door and removed the key. She tells of the pains in her lower abdomen afterwards and how she washed herself with warm water for weeks. She immediately identifies the security officer in a photo. The officials record in the minutes that Elaine B. appears disturbed.', '‘We were in no doubt that it happened as she described it. The woman was intimidated and seemed very anxious’, recalls District Inspector W.S., who investigated the case, a year later in court. His statement, like that of the victim, is disregarded.', 'Disturbing errors occur. For the first interview in the interview room no trained interpreter can be found; moreover, the traumatised woman is initially interviewed by a man. In their minutes the police officers at times refer to Elaine B. not by her name but as ‘the nigger woman’. She is repeatedly linked to prostitution.', 'H.P., 48, is interviewed as the presumed perpetrator. When first questioned the trained bricklayer with the thick moustache states: ‘I didn’t have sex with the nigger woman.’ The next time his recall is more accurate: ‘It’s possible that I had intercourse with the nigger woman. I’d had twelve and a half litres of beer and one and a half litres of herb lemonade mixed with red wine.’ He claims it was entirely consensual. However, he doesn’t recognise Elaine in a photo. Police officer: ‘Could the woman have left the room if she’d wanted to?’ Answer: ‘No, only I had a key’. Again the question: ‘Did you pay the nigger woman for sexual intercourse?’ Answer: ‘No way!’ Third [interview] record: ‘I’d noticed the nigger woman about a week before we had sex. I fancied her from the beginning. I went into her room and gestured to her to come out.’ According to him, she followed him out of her own accord, undressed in front of him, took hold of his penis, inserted it and then got dressed again. Then she disappeared for good – without making any demands. ‘Maybe she thought she’d be given asylum sooner’ speculates the security officer. Something else occurs to him. He had offered to buy the woman a drink in the bakery a few days before. She had stroked his back and ‘cosied up’ to him.', 'Elaine B. denies this version of events. She says that she had other things on her mind at the time. She is not a whore. She felt repelled by this fat man with a moustache who smelled of alcohol, she was afraid of him. Also: if she had really been hoping to be granted asylum, why would she then have defamed the security officer?', 'Next to take the witness stand are the employees of the bakery. The first to be examined is saleswoman R.Z.: ‘She gave him a kiss. She was fairly young, I’d say between 20 and 25. The two of them were talking quietly. I couldn’t describe the woman.’ When confronted with Elaine B. Z. says: ‘I’m not quite sure whether it’s her.’ At the second confrontation a year later she suddenly says: ‘Yes, that’s her!’ She has something else to get off her chest: ‘I have to say that we’re losing a lot of customers because of the black Africans. It’s bad for business!’ Likewise the second saleswoman. The first time she gives evidence: ‘I’m not sure’. The second time: ‘I’m 99 per cent certain.’', 'Elaine B. is 35 years old and speaks neither German nor English – only French. The quiet talk described could not have taken place. One detail, however, is never mentioned: at the time, the bakery was delivering tens of thousands of bread rolls to the reception centre.', 'The Wiener Neustadt Public Prosecutor’s Office, which sees the Africans from Traiskirchen most often in connection with drug dealing, wants to discontinue the proceedings on the basis of the statements by the bakery employees. Elaine’s lawyer, W.R., then brings a ‘subsidiary private prosecution’ (Subsidiaranklage) before the Court of Appeal. The victim can take over the role of the public prosecutor at his or her own risk. The unexpected happens: the Court of Appeal finds in the woman’s favour and orders the Justice Ministry to prosecute the security officer. ‘As the case file currently stands, both the factual element of the offence of rape and the element of coercion appear to be made out beyond doubt’, states the judgment. According to the court, the bakery employees could not have identified Elaine.', 'The trial with judges and lay assessors before Wiener Neustadt Criminal Court does not last long. No evidence is taken either from other asylum seekers or from the female staff in the women’s quarters. Judge I.K. acquits the security officer. Of course, if she has doubts as to the defendant’s guilt, she has to do so. But this judge and her lay assessors are in no doubt as to the woman’s guilt. They have unfinished business with the African woman and attribute the basest intentions to her – without furnishing any proof. The reasoning is diametrically opposed to that of the Court of Appeal: ‘It cannot be established that the accused performed sexual intercourse against the will of Elaine B.’ And what of the statements of the bakery employees, called into question by the Court of Appeal? ‘Clear proof’ that Elaine B. had also been lying about the sexual encounter. The fact that the bakery employees got her age wrong by ten to fifteen years? ‘The difficulty of correctly estimating the age of persons with a different skin colour is known to the courts.’ And the constantly changing replies of the security officer? ‘He is a very simple man’ and it therefore spoke in his favour ‘that he himself admitted that intercourse with the witness was not easy to achieve.’ The ‘black African’ on the other hand, appeared ‘very confident’, with the result that ‘it is hard to imagine that she could have felt so intimidated by the accused, who appears somewhat unsure of himself, that she left her quarters against her will.’ And what of the only piece of physical evidence, the torn red underpants? ‘These have no evidentiary value’ according to Judge K. Why not? Because the accused said that the underpants had been ‘beige’.', 'Not another word from the detectives who had been faced with a crying, completely intimidated woman. No mention of the fact that the security officer himself admitted locking Elaine in [the room] and removing the key. Not a single line about the predicament in which female asylum seekers found themselves at the time. Complete understanding, on the other hand, for the accused: ‘The accused’s objection that the woman may have hoped, since her asylum claim had not been decided, to obtain Austrian citizenship by marrying him, has not been completely refuted’. Even if this were true, why would she then lodge a complaint against him two weeks later?', 'The judgment fails to give rise to a scandal. ‘Flirtation in Traiskirchen’ runs the title in the Kurier. Then, what women’s shelters have been complaining of for years happens: the woman becomes the presumed perpetrator. With the approval of Justice Minister K.M., the principal public prosecutor’s office institutes preliminary proceedings for defamation. Elaine B. must appear before the investigating judge ‘or be brought by force’. She could face up to five years in prison. ‘That’s just routine, nothing unusual’ says a Justice Ministry spokesman. According to principal public prosecutor P.: ‘After [the] acquittal we have no choice but to initiate proceedings.’', 'Justice Minister K.M. has promised to do more to protect the victims of crime. She should study this case. She is the highest-ranking public prosecutor. She has the right to give instructions. She bears the political responsibility if this woman, in addition to everything else, faces charges.”', '9. Subsequently, Judge I.K. brought an action for defamation against the applicant company under section 6 of the Media Act and Article 111 of the Criminal Code, and requested that the applicant company be ordered to pay compensation and retract the following statements made in the article, which she claimed amounted to a statement that she had grossly misused her office as a judge:', '“Judge I.K. alleges that the asylum seeker had immoral motives.”', 'Judge I.K. alleges in the judgment – without giving any reasons – that the asylum seeker was driven by the basest motives.', '“Judge I.K. acquits the security officer. Of course, if she has doubts as to the defendant’s guilt, she has to do so. But this judge and her lay assessors are in no doubt as to the woman’s guilt. They have unfinished business with the African woman and attribute the basest intentions to her – without furnishing any proof.”', 'Judge I.K. had no doubt about the woman’s guilt.', 'The judge ignored relevant evidence and delivered a scandalous judgment (“The judgment fails to give rise to a scandal.”)', '10. On 1 September 2005 the first hearing in the defamation proceedings was held. The applicant company argued that the impugned statements were true and sought to prove the truth of those statements by asking the court to call several witnesses and admit as evidence the files of the proceedings concerning K.’s asylum request and the criminal proceedings against H.P. It considered that by publishing the impugned statements it had merely expressed criticism, protected by the freedom of speech, which had not concerned the acquittal itself but rather the way in which the victim of the crime had been treated in the written version of the judgment, which had neglected important evidence and had accused the victim, K., of having been a prostitute.', '11. In October 2005 the applicant company sought the disqualification of Judge N.F., the judge assigned to the media proceedings, for bias. It submitted that the lawyer representing the claimant, I.K., had also represented N.F. in the past in court proceedings. As Judge N.F. had to decide on a case in which her previous lawyer was acting as representative of one of the parties, there was reasonable doubt that she would not decide the case objectively. The president of the Vienna Regional Court dismissed the motion on 17 October 2005 and held that the issue raised by the applicant was not sufficient to give rise to doubt that Judge N.F. would not decide the case objectively.', '12. On 17 October 2005 a further hearing was held in the defamation proceedings. The hearing was adjourned in order to hear three witnesses proposed by the applicant company. The Regional Court refused to hear other witnesses proposed by the applicant company, as it considered that those persons could not make any statements relevant to the proceedings. The applicant company had sought to call R., who had been K.’s lawyer in the criminal proceedings, in order to clarify the meaning of statements that K. had given during her examination as a witness which had been recorded on video in order to prevent her as the victim having to face the accused (kontradiktorische Einvernahme). This request was refused by the Regional Court on the grounds that the transcript of K.’s examination had been included in the case file and therefore no additional witness was required.', '13. On 12 December 2005 the Regional Court held another hearing in the defamation proceedings in which it examined two of the witnesses proposed by the applicant company. The third witness proposed did not appear. On the same date the Regional Court found against the applicant company. It held that the impugned statements had constituted defamation under Article 111 of the Criminal Code and that I.K. was therefore entitled to compensation, which it set at 7,000 euros (EUR). It also ordered the applicant company to publish a summary of the judgment.', '14. The Regional Court found that the contents of the article had given a biased account of the taking of evidence at the trial of H.P., taking the side of K. and characterising any statement of a witness which did not coincide with hers as lacking credibility. According to the article, the judge had acted arbitrarily and out of racist motives and had disregarded evidence produced, whereas the rape asserted by K. had been described as proven and the assessment of evidence by the Regional Court as absurd. Such an account was not an objective critique of the judgment.', '15. As regards the criminal proceedings against H.P., the Regional Court observed that: (a) they had been discontinued by the Public Prosecutor; and (b) upon a subsequent decision by the Senior Public Prosecutor H.P. had been committed for trial (Versetzung in den Anklagestand). Following three hearings at which a total of seven witnesses had been heard, the tape recording of the questioning of the victim had been viewed in part by the court and a confrontation between two witnesses and K. had taken place, the court had acquitted the accused.', '16. In its judgment of 2 May 2005 the court had found that it could not be excluded that the sexual intercourse which had taken place between K. and the accused had been consensual, in accordance with the version of events given by the accused and which had, to some extent, been corroborated by the statements of witnesses who had seen the accused and K. together in a coffee shop in town. K.’s assertion that she had been the victim of an assault had not been excluded but because it contradicted the statements of witnesses it had been considered to be partially implausible. The accused had not therefore been acquitted because his innocence had been proven but rather on the basis of the principle of in dubio pro reo.', '17. The Regional Court also referred to one passage of the written judgment on which the article had put much emphasis, namely a reference to a statement by K. made in the course of her questioning as a witness to the effect that she had previously been engaged in prostitution in her country of origin, which the judgment stated had allowed inferences to be drawn with regard to the statement by the accused that the witness might have become involved with him because she expected – for whatever reason – to gain some advantage.', '18. The Regional Court found that the applicant company had not succeeded in proving the truth of the impugned statements. From the case file concerning the proceedings against H.P. and, in particular, the written version of the judgment it appeared that Judge I.K. had dealt with all the evidence taken and had assessed each item of evidence extensively. Therefore, it could not be established that Judge I.K. had made base insinuations (üble Unterstellungen) or disregarded evidence. The judgment had clearly indicated the court’s reluctance to accept the version of events given by K. also. In addition, the indication of K. having been a prostitute in the past had been based on a statement from the questioning of that witness and had not been made up out of thin air. The relevant part of the transcript in question read as follows:', '<Original>', '“Untersuchungsrichter: Es gibt einen Zeugen. Er sagt aus: “im Haus Nr. 8 gibt es Frauen die auf den Strich gehen.” Wissen Sie was davon?', 'Zeugin: Keine Ahnung, ich nicht, nein. Seit meiner Heimat habe ich es nie gewagt.”', '<English translation>', '“Investigating judge: There is one witness. He said: “at no. 8 there are women who walk the streets.” Do you know anything about it?', 'Witness K.: No idea, not me, no. Since leaving my country I haven’t dared it.”', 'An error in the translation of that statement could not be excluded, but that did not allow the conclusion that there had been no basis in the file for the above finding of Judge I.K.', '19. The accusation that a judge, who was under the duty to act objectively and impartially, had without any factual basis and out of racist motives deliberately disregarded evidence in order to acquit an accused from the same country (inländischen Angeklagten) had to be qualified as defamation and there was hardly a more severe accusation which could be levied against a judge. The term scandal of justice was a value judgement, which, however, was based on assertions of fact which had been disproven in the proceedings.', '20. Insofar as the applicant company had relied on Article 10 of the Convention, the Regional Court referred to the case of Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria (26 April 1995, Series A no. 313), and observed that the press had the right and the duty to impart information on matters of public interest, including questions concerning the functioning of the justice system, and to criticise any shortcomings found, but in doing so it had to be mindful of the special role of the judiciary in society. It was therefore necessary to protect public confidence in the judiciary against destructive attacks that were essentially unfounded. Taking these principles into account, the sharp critique of Judge I.K. in the impugned article, which had lacked any sufficient factual basis, had been excessive.', '21. Taking the gravity of the attacks on the claimant’s professional reputation, the broad public attention the article had received and the consequences it had had for the claimant, the Regional Court found that the amount of EUR 7,000 in compensation was appropriate.', '22. The applicant company appealed on 8 March 2006 against the Regional Court’s judgment. On 19 June 2006 the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment. This judgment was served on the applicant’s company lawyer on 29 June 2006.', '23. Section 6 of the Media Act (Mediengesetz), as in force at the time of the events, read as follows:', '“6 (1) If the factual elements of the offence of defamation ... are established in a medium, the person affected shall be entitled to claim compensation from the owner of the medium for [any] damage sustained. ...', '(2) No claim shall lie under (1), if:', '...', '(ii) in the case of defamation:', '(a) the statements published are true;', '...”', '24. Article 111 of the Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch) reads as follows:', '“1.

Anyone who commits this offence in a printed document, in a broadcast or otherwise in such a way as to make the defamatory statement accessible to a broad section of the public, shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding one year or to a fine ...', '3.

The applicant was born in 1970 and lives in Tartu. At the material time he was the owner and manager of the company AS Maarja.', '9. On 10 August 1995 the Tartu police instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant on charges of tax offences under Article 148-1 § 7 of the Criminal Code. In the course of the preliminary investigation the applicant was further charged with the offence of inadequate accounting under Article 148-4 of the Criminal Code as well as with falsification of documents.', '10. On 6 October 1997 the Tartu prosecutor approved the bill of indictment, and the case was sent to the Tartu City Court (Tartu Linnakohus) for trial. The charges set out in the indictment related to acts and omissions of the applicant in the period from April 1993 to October 1995.', ""In particular, under Article 148-1 § 7 of the Criminal Code the acts which were the subject of the charges against the applicant concerned his failures to pay the required taxes, to file by the set deadline revenue statements for the year 1993, to inform the Tax Board of the change of his company's location, and to comply with the order of the Tax Board of 26 October 1995 to pay the required taxes. Under Article 148-4 of the Criminal Code the applicant was accused of having unsatisfactorily arranged his company's bookkeeping, in breach of the legal requirements. The existing records were incomplete and a number of documents had not been preserved, which made it impossible to determine the company's performance."", ""11. By a judgment of 17 February 1999 the Tartu City Court convicted the applicant of the offences under Article 148-1 § 7 of the Criminal Code and sentenced him to 4 years' imprisonment. It also found the applicant guilty of the offence under Article 148-4 of the Code and sentenced him to 4 months' imprisonment. As the latter sentence was absorbed by the former, the aggregate sentence imposed on the applicant was 4 years' imprisonment, which was suspended for 3 years."", ""The City Court found that the application of Article 148-1 § 7 of the Criminal Code, which had been in force as from 13 January 1995, was justified in the case on the grounds that the applicant's failure to pay the required taxes had been intentional and continuous and his criminal activity had lasted until October 1995. It ordered the applicant to pay the city tax authorities 1,596,618.42 Estonian kroons in outstanding taxes. No fine or tax surcharge was imposed apart from the requirement to pay the taxes which were due under the relevant tax laws."", ""As regards the offence of inadequate accounting under Article 148-4 of the Criminal Code, which was in force as from 20 July 1993, the City Court noted that the applicant's company had operated from 5 May 1993 until 1 October 1993. During that period there had been no recording of its economic activity and it was impossible correctly to determine the company's performance, income, expenditure, profit, loss, debts, solvency or amount of its assets. The applicant had failed to comply with the obligations imposed on him by the Law on personal responsibility for the organisation of accounting. The law came into effect on 20 July 1993, i.e. at the time of the operation of the company, and the applicant, being its owner and manager, had to comply with the provisions of the law. The applicant also failed to adopt rules and procedures for bookkeeping and to secure the preservation of the relevant documents, as required under the Government decree of 6 July 1990 concerning the organisation of accounting."", '12. On 26 February 1999 the applicant filed an appeal against the judgment to the Tartu Court of Appeal (Tartu Ringkonnakohus). He argued that in convicting him under Article 148-1 § 7 of the Criminal Code of acts committed prior to its entry into force on 13 January 1995, the City Court had applied the criminal law retrospectively. Before that date a conviction of the offences defined in Article 148-1 could follow only if the person concerned had been previously subjected to an administrative sanction for a similar offence.', 'The applicant further submitted that, in making him responsible for the inadequate bookkeeping in his company during the whole period from 5 May 1993 until 1 October 1993, the City Court had also applied retroactively Article 148-4 of the Criminal Code which had only been in force as from 20 July 1993.', '13. On 3 May 1999 the Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the City Court. It found that the acts with which the applicant was charged under Article 1481 § 7 of the Criminal Code amounted to ongoing crimes. After his first criminal act on 16 April 1993 the applicant had embarked upon a criminal enterprise which had lasted until 26 October 1995, the day on which the Tax Board discovered the abuses and issued its order. Therefore, the City Court had correctly qualified his acts as falling under that law.', ""It also considered that the ongoing nature of the applicant's acts relating to inadequate accounting justified his conviction under Article 148-4 of the Criminal Code."", '14. On 1 June 1999 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law to the Supreme Court (Riigikohus) raising the same arguments as in his appeal to the Court of Appeal.', ""15. By a judgment of 7 September 1999 the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal. It held that, according to the principles of Estonian criminal law, the law to be applied to a criminal act was the law which had entered into force before the end of a criminal activity. As the applicant's criminal activity ended on 26 October 1995, his actions fell under the law in force at that time, i.e. Article 148-1 § 7 of the Criminal Code. The same reasons applied to the applicant's conviction of inadequate accounting under Article 148-4 of the Criminal Code."", '16.

According to the practice of the Supreme Court, if a non-payment of taxes is intentional and continuous the latest version of Article 148-1 is applicable to acts which occurred prior to its entry into force provided that part of the criminal activity took place after the critical date. Criminal liability arises on two alternative, not cumulative, grounds: (1) if a person has committed the offence intentionally or (2) if a person has previously been subjected to administrative punishment for the same offence. Article 148-1 § 7 does not contain a separate offence, but it only qualifies the elements listed in §§ 1-5.

De Gaetano;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"['1. The applicant, Ms Violina Stancheva Dzhidzheva-Trendafilova, is a Bulgarian national who was born in 1953 and lives in Sofia. She was represented before the Court by Mr S. Trendafilov, a lawyer practising in Sofia.', '2. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their agents, Ms N. Nikolova and Mr V. Obretenov, of the Ministry of Justice.', '3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '4. In the State Gazette of 5 February 2008 the Supreme Judicial Council published a notice for a competition based on performance appraisal for five posts of judge at several administrative courts (“the competition”).', '5. Fifty candidates applied for the vacant posts.', '6. On 15 February 2008 the applicant filed an application to take part in the competition for the vacant posts at the Sofia City Administrative Court and the Sofia Regional Administrative Court. There were two vacant posts in the former and one in the latter.', '7. Thereafter, the applicant and all the other candidates were subjected to performance appraisals by the Supreme Judicial Council’s committee on proposals and performance appraisals of judges (“the committee”). Some of these were carried out in the context of a separate competition.', '8. On the basis of the committee’s recommendation, on 10 and 31 July 2008 the Council determined an overall rating for each candidate in accordance with section 193(1) of the Judiciary Act 2007. All but two of the candidates obtained the rating “very good”, the highest possible rating. The applicant was one of the forty-eight candidates in that category.', '9. At its session on 31 July 2008, under item 1.2 of the agenda, the Council then proceeded to rank the candidates in accordance with section 193(2) and (3) of the Judiciary Act 2007, on a proposal from the committee’s chairman, and listed them in order of merit, grade and length of service. The list contained fifty candidates and the applicant was ranked eighteenth on the list. Out of the seventeen candidates ranked higher than the applicant, at least twelve had applied for the same posts for which she had applied.', '10. Finally, under item 1.3 of the agenda, the Supreme Judicial Council, relying on section 194(1) of the Judiciary Act 2007, took a vote in respect of each candidate in order to decide whether or not to promote him or her to the post of judge at the relevant administrative court, until all the vacant posts had been filled.', '11. The voting, which was conducted in secret, followed the order in which candidates were ranked on the list and continued until all the vacant posts were filled.', '12. According to the full text of the minutes of the Council’s session, the first twelve candidates did not obtain the requisite majority of thirteen votes and their applications were therefore rejected. Candidate number thirteen obtained one of the two vacant posts at the Sofia City Administrative Court. The voting then continued. The applicant, who was eighteenth on the list, obtained twelve votes in her favour for the posts in one of the two courts for which she had applied and eleven votes in her favour for the post in the other court. As the minimum number of votes required were thirteen (see paragraph 21 below), her applications were rejected (items 1.3.18 and 1.3.18.1 on the agenda). The voting then continued. As regards the posts for which the applicant had applied, the candidate ranked twenty-seventh obtained thirteen votes in her favour and was appointed to the post of judge at the Sofia Regional Administrative Court, and the candidate ranked fortyseventh obtained sixteen votes and was appointed to the second vacant post at the Sofia City Administrative Court (items 1.3.27.1. and 1.3.47. on the agenda). As all the vacant posts had been filled at that point, no voting took place with regard to the remaining three candidates.', '13. Other than the number of votes for and against each candidate and the number of abstentions, no further information or reasons were given in the minutes of the session as to why, on what basis and in application of what criteria the Council had voted the way it did for each candidate and why certain judges had been promoted or transferred to the vacant posts while others had not.', '14. On 6 August 2008 the applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court against the decisions of the Council adopted under item 1.3 of the agenda of its session of 31 July 2008 (“the appeal”). She argued that the decisions had been adopted in contravention of the applicable legislation, since the Council was required under section 194(1) of the Judiciary Act 2007 to fill the vacant posts by following the order in which the successful candidates were ranked. She considered that her rights had been violated when, instead of her, the Council had promoted to the vacant posts two persons ranked below her in the list, in twenty-seventh and forty-seventh place. She further considered that the whole competition procedure had been violated because, in comparison with her, those persons were on lower grades and had a shorter period of service.', '15. On 11 August 2008 the Council officially informed the applicant, by way of an extract from the minutes of the session of 31 July 2008, of its vote of that date by which it had decided not to promote her to the vacant posts. Apart from the number of votes for and against her promotion, no further information or reasons were given as to why the Council had voted the way it had.', '16. On 24 and 27 October and 14 November 2008 the applicant supplemented her appeal with the extract from the minutes sent to her on 11 August 2008, together with proof of her grade, length of service and performance appraisal and copies of her employment and insurance records.', '17. At a hearing on the applicant’s appeal held on 19 November 2008 the Supreme Administrative Court declared the case ready for decision.', '18. In a judgment of 3 December 2008 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal, holding, inter alia, as follows:', '“Section 193(2) of the Judiciary Act provides that the [Council] must rank [the candidates] for each post according to the results of the performance appraisals. Paragraph 3 of the same text stipulates that when several candidates for the same post have the same rating in the performance appraisals, priority is given to the candidate on the highest grade. When the candidates are also on the same grade, priority is given to [the candidate] who has served longest in the judiciary.', 'The ranking of the candidates for the posts of judge at the Sofia City Administrative Court and the Sofia Regional Administrative Court is in compliance with the law as regards the overall rating [in the performance appraisal], grade and length of service, whereby the requirements of section 193(3) of the Judiciary Act are also taken into account. The order in which candidates are placed [in the ranking, drawn up] in accordance with the criteria in the text cited [above] for determining priority (grade and length of service) does not oblige the [Council] to appoint candidates to the vacant posts in the order in which they were ranked. It is obliged to vote on candidates’ promotion or transfer [to the vacant posts] in the order in which they are ranked until the vacant posts are filled, as required by section 194(1) of the Judiciary Act. Acting on the basis of operational independence, the [Council] decides on promotion to a post at its own discretion, which includes [an assessment] of candidates’ inherent professional and ethical qualities. This [right to] choose is conferred on the appointing body as part of its discretionary powers and is not subject to judicial review.', 'The complaint concerning the lack of reasoning is manifestly ill-founded. The factual grounds and the specific reasons for adopting the impugned decisions are contained in the documentary evidence in the administrative file and the statements [made by] the members of the [Council]. The positive assessments made in the proposal of the [Council’s] committee on performance appraisals regarding the professional and ethical qualities of [the persons ranked in twenty-seventh and forty-seventh place] were the reasons for the decisions to promote them, [which] predate the adoption of these decisions.', 'In view of the above considerations, the court holds that the appeal by [the applicant] is manifestly illfounded and, as such, should be dismissed.”', '19. The judgment was not subject to appeal and therefore became final.', '20. The Act came into force in August 2007. The provisions on competitions for career development (promotion) and transfer of judges, as in force at the relevant time and until 1 January 2011, provided as follows:', '...', '“(1) Vacant posts in the courts ..., other than those [at entry level], shall be ... filled following a competition carried out on the basis of performance appraisal.', '...”', '“(1) The committee on proposals and performance appraisal of judges ... shall appraise the performance of every candidate satisfying the requirements for the available post.', '...”', '“(1) The chairperson of the committee on proposals and performance appraisal of judges ... shall submit to the Supreme Judicial Council a reasoned opinion, summarising the results of the performance appraisal for each candidate.', '(2) The Supreme Judicial Council shall rank [the candidates] for each post in accordance with the results of the performance appraisal.', '(3) If several candidates for the same post have the same result in the performance appraisal, the candidate on the highest grade shall have preference. If the candidates also share the same grade, preference shall be given to the candidate who has served longest in the judiciary.”', '“(1) The Supreme Judicial Council shall adopt a decision to promote or transfer judges ... by following the order of ranking until the vacant posts are filled.', '(2) The decision under paragraph 1 may be appealed against [to the Supreme Administrative Court].', '...”', '“A performance appraisal shall be carried out:', '...', '2.

[the judge’s] adherence to the professional ethical rules for judges ...;', '(2) For the purpose of the performance appraisal, the overall workload in the relevant court’s area of jurisdiction ..., as well as the workload of the judge being appraised ..., compared with that of other judges ... at the same [court], shall also be taken into consideration.”', '“(1) The specific criteria for the performance appraisal of judges shall be:', '1. compliance with the schedule for conducting court hearings;', '2. the ability to conduct court hearings and draft records of proceedings.', '...”', '“(1) The overall rating from the performance appraisal may be positive or negative.', '(2) The categories of positive overall rating shall be:', '1. Satisfactory,', '2. Good,', '3. Very good.', '...”', '“(1) The Supreme Judicial Council shall take a decision determining the overall rating [from the performance appraisal].', '(2) The decision under paragraph 1 may also contain recommendations to the judge being appraised ..., the implementation of which will be taken into consideration in the next performance appraisal.', '...”', '“(1) In the performance appraisal methodology, the indicators relating to the examination and disposal of files and cases shall be given the greatest weight.”', '21. Under section 38(8) of the Act, Supreme Judicial Council’s decisions on proposals for the promotion or transfer of judges must be taken by a majority of the Council’s twentyfive members. It follows that a minimum of thirteen votes are required for a decision to promote or transfer a judge.', '22. The Council’s decisions concerning the appointment, promotion, demotion, transfer or dismissal of judges, prosecutors or investigators are adopted by secret ballot (Article 131 of the 1991 Constitution). All other decisions are adopted by open ballot (section 34(2) of the Judiciary Act 2007). Where a decision of the Council is adopted by secret ballot, it is considered – in the case of a decision not to adopt a proposal submitted to a vote – that the negative opinions, if any, expressed by members of the Council in relation to the proposal constitute the reasons for the Council’s decision (section 34(3) of the Judiciary Act 2007). In the case of a decision to adopt a proposal submitted to a vote, the grounds put forward in support of the proposal are deemed to be the reasons given by the Council (ibid.).', '23. This decree, adopted by the Supreme Judicial Council, regulates in greater detail the procedure established in the Judiciary Act 2007 for organising competitions within the judiciary for entry level posts, promotions and transfers, and for appointment to senior management posts.', '24. In respect of promotions and transfers, section 37(4) provides that the performance appraisal must be carried out following the methodology approved by the Council. The latter regulates in significant detail the documentary information and data to be collected in respect of each judge being appraised and the appraisal forms to be completed. It details the performance indicators to be used when appraising judges, the scores to be allocated under each item and the weight that they are to be given in the performance appraisal. In particular, it provides that judges are also appraised on their adherence to the ethical rules for judges.', '25. In the examination of appeals against Supreme Judicial Council decisions refusing promotion to judges or prosecutors, the Supreme Administrative Court, in a series of judgments in 2008, 2009 and 2010, consistently interpreted the provisions of the Judiciary Act 2007 as meaning that the ranking of the candidates determined the order in which the Council had to vote but could not guarantee the outcome of the vote. In all cases the court held that the Council, as the body in which the power to appoint and promote judges and prosecutors was vested, was free to decide on these matters. Judicial review of the lawfulness of its decisions did not extend to the Council’s assessment of the candidates’ qualities (see, among many others, реш. № 11134 от 27 октомври 2008 г. по адм. д. № 10468/2008 г., ВАС, VІІ о., and реш. № 3548 от 18 март 2010 г. по адм. д. № 16558/2009 г., ВАС, VІІ о.).', '26. The ethical rules for judges, adopted by the Supreme Judicial Council on 10 March 2004 and replaced on 27 May 2009 by the Judicial Officers’ Code of Ethics, detailed the special requirements imposed on judges as to the manner in which they were to conduct themselves in their professional, private and public lives.', '27. The Supreme Judicial Council has the power to appoint, promote, demote, transfer and dismiss – including by way of disciplinary punishment – judges, prosecutors and investigators (Article 129 § 1 and Article 130 § 6 (1) and (2) of the 1991 Constitution). The Council consists of twentyfive members. The presidents of the Supreme Court of Cassation and of the Supreme Administrative Court and the Chief Prosecutor are members as of right (Article 130 § 1). The remaining twentytwo members have to be lawyers possessing high professional and moral qualities and having at least fifteen years of professional experience (Article 130 § 2). Eleven of them are elected by the National Assembly and eleven by the judicial authorities (Article 130 § 3). Out of the latter eleven members, the judges elect six, the prosecutors four and the investigators one (section 17(3) of the Judiciary Act 2007). The term of office of the Council’s members is five years, and is not immediately renewable (Article 130 § 4 of the Constitution). The Council’s sessions are presided by the Minister of Justice, who cannot however take part in voting (Article 130 § 5).', '28. The European Commission has repeatedly expressed concern about appointment and promotion decisions in the Bulgarian judiciary. In its 2011 Report to the European Parliament and the Council on Progress in Bulgaria under the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism, it stated, inter alia: “The quality and transparency of several important appointments within the judiciary since the beginning of this year have been questioned, leading to unprecedented public protests and a debate on possible constitutional amendments. In addition, allegations of corruption within the judiciary are still not pursued in a systematic way as recommended by the Commission.”']",[],[],[],[],[],[]
001-97286,ENG,GBR,ADMISSIBILITY,2010,BAILEY v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,4,Inadmissible,Giovanni Bonello;Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Nebojša Vučinić;Nicolas Bratza;Päivi Hirvelä,"['The applicant, Ms Yvonne Bailey, is a British national who was born in 1959 and lives in Denbyshire, Wales. She is represented before the Court by Mr Scott, a solicitor practising in London.', 'The applicant’s son, Joseph Scholes (“JS”) born on 20 February 1986, hanged himself while in detention at Stoke Heath Young Offenders Institution (“Stoke Heath”) on 24 March 2002. This application concerns issues relating to his death.', 'By December 2000 three social services investigations had been carried out into allegations of ill-treatment of JS (then 14 years of age), concluding that the allegations were unfounded. During the third, concerns were raised about JS’ mental health. From January 2001 he was treated for depression and the relevant child services reported his behaviour as unpredictable and aggressive. During 2001 his behaviour continued to degenerate and in April 2001 he was referred to a psychiatrist (Dr F, a specialist in child and adolescent psychiatry) who found that he suffered from a conduct disorder with possible co-morbid depressive illness, that he was very vulnerable and that he risked harming himself. On 10 November 2001 an ambulance arrived at JS’ home following reports of his violent behaviour and he was abusive to the ambulance men. He was arrested for affray. A psychiatric assessment (mid-November 2001) diagnosed depressive conduct with abuse of alcohol and other substances and found that JS was a risk to himself and others and that custody would increase the risk of self-harm. Given his unstable family situation, a protection order was made and he was admitted to a local authority children’s home. On 6 December 2001 JS and two other children from the children’s home carried out three street robberies of mobile phones (it was accepted in later proceedings that JS had played a peripheral role).', 'On 11 December 2001 he was convicted on the prior affray charge. He was sentenced to a one year supervision order: he would continue in the children’s home and follow training and treatment options. JS continued to demonstrate vulnerability and present serious management problems and self-harm risk. Another psychiatrist who examined JS in February expressed much concern about his fragile emotional state, recommending containment and constant vigilance.', 'On 26 February 2002 he appeared at the Crown Court and pleaded guilty to the three charges of robbery. He was convicted and remanded on bail to the children’s home pending sentencing. In early March 2002 he slashed his face in his room in the children’s home over 30 times. The following day JS was reported as being under a great deal of pressure. He also went missing from the home from 7 to 9 March 2002 but returned of his own volition, after which he was charged with a breach of bail.', 'At the later hearing at the Crown Court for sentencing on the robbery charges, his counsel drew the trial judge’s attention to the Pre-Sentence Report (prepared by the Trafford Youth Offending Team, “Trafford YOT”) and, in particular, to references to his “history of self harm and ... threatened suicide” and to Dr F.’s belief that the “self harming behaviour may escalate”. Attention was also drawn to a letter from the applicant’s social worker which accompanied the Pre-Sentence Report and which also referred to attempted self-harm and to concern “for his safety and welfare given his history of low mood of self-harm when in distress”. When sentencing JS, the judge referred to those passages and stated that they had to be “most expressly drawn to the attention of the authorities”: that remark was made in the course of his counsel’s submissions and was substantially repeated in the trial judge’s sentencing remarks. The Pre-Sentencing Report concluded that JS would be at particular risk in the event of a custodial order and it recommended (supported by his social worker) a Community Punishment and Rehabilitation Order.', 'On 15 March 2002 in passing the sentence, the trial judge referred to remarks of the Lord Chief Justice that those who commit street robberies should receive immediate custodial sentences (Attorney General’s Reference Nos. 4 and 7 of 2002 [2002] 2 Cr App (R(S) 77). He made a 2-year detention and training order (a custodial order, “DTO”). JS could have been detained in a Young Offender Institution (“YOI”), in a Secure Training Centre (“STC”) or in a Local Authority Secure Children’s Home (“LASCH”). The Youth Justice Board (“YJB”) placed JS in Stoke Heath YOI and he was transferred on 15 March 2002.', 'Although his counsel advised in favour of an appeal against sentence (as manifestly excessive), an application for leave was not pursued.', 'On arrival at Stoke Heath JS was on an open F2052SH form (at risk of self-harm) and placed in the health care unit. He was initially put in strip clothing (simple linen tunic, held together by adhesive strips under which he was naked). He was placed in a cell with reduced ligature points, a surveillance camera and high levels of observations. Within days he was moved to a single cell (in the health care unit) with no surveillance camera or reduced ligature points. Observation was reduced to 30 minute intervals.', 'An application was made by the Trafford YOT for JS’ transfer from the YOI but, prior to that being decided, on 24 March 2002 JS was found dead, hanging from strips of linen attached to the bars of the window of his cell.', 'On the day following JS’ death the West Midlands area manager for prisons instigated a prison service investigation (assisted by an advisory panel made up of experts from the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman’s office, Social Services and the YJB) and it was completed on 17 May 2002.', 'Deaths in custody are also automatically subject to a Serious Incident Review by a senior YJB manager or an independent consultant. A Local Management Report into the circumstances of JS’ death was prepared by the Operations Manager of the YOT (which had completed JS’ Pre-Sentence Report) and it was completed on 17 April 2002. This report was forwarded to the YJB in June 2002 and contributed to the Serious Incident Review. An interim report was presented to the YJB on 18 September 2002. A final report was prepared and presented to the YJB Audit Committee on 11 May 2004 following the receipt of the Coroner’s verdict (see below).', 'Following advice received from the Social Services Inspectorate and the YJB, the relevant Area Child Protection Committee (ACPC) agreed to conduct a full investigation of JS’ case under Chapter 8 of Department of Health guidance “Working Together to Safeguard Children” 1999. An independent author was commissioned to prepare the overview report and to chair the multi-agency panel established to steer the review process. The “Chapter 8 Case Review” began on 20 September 2002 and the Trafford ACPC adopted the final overview report in the summer of 2004.', 'On 1 April 2004, during a debate in the House or Lords, one of the questions put to the Government was whether there would be an independent inquiry into the death of JS. Lord Bassam of Brighton responded on behalf of the Government. He noted that the Inquest would resume soon, that that would be complemented by a comprehensive summary of the lessons learned by the various agencies involved (which results would be shared with the applicant) and that, in the meantime, other improvements had been made to reception, protection and healthcare processes including training programmes.', 'The applicant brought a civil claim against the Home Office and the YJB regarding JS’ death alleging negligence and a breach of the Human Rights Act 1998 (Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention) in relation to his allocation by the YJB to Stoke Heath and his treatment there. She also made a claim against the YJB under Article 14 (in conjunction with Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention) on the basis that the YJB was operating a discriminatory policy under which girls aged 16 years of age, whether vulnerable or not, were given priority over vulnerable boys over 16 years of age, for placement outside the prison service. The civil claim did not challenge the sentence imposed on JS as such a claim would have been prevented by section 9 of the Human Rights Act 1998.', 'A payment into court was made by the respondents. The applicant’s solicitor and counsel both advised her that the lodgement was a “reasonable offer” and a sum that she could reasonably expect from a court if the entirety of her claim was accepted. (The Court of Appeal later described this sum as “substantial”). She requested but was refused an admission of liability. The applicant felt obliged to accept the lodgement and the proceedings were settled in April 2004, before the Inquest opened.', 'The Inquest into JS’ death took place between 19 and 30 April 2004. The applicant was legally represented and present. The Inquest heard evidence, either in writing or in person, from 55 witnesses including the Chief Executive of the YJB and the Governor of Stoke Heath. The applicant submitted an expert report which outlined a number of factors which meant that boys of 16-17 years of age were most likely to be allocated to YOIs given the increase in child imprisonment particularly of girls; the increase of periods of custodial detention; and the policy of the YJB to prioritise children of 12-14 years of age for placement in STCs or LASCHs which inevitably reduced places for older juveniles. The above-noted reports of investigations already conducted were before the Coroner and he also commissioned his own expert psychiatric report in which the view was expressed that JS “simply should never have been allocated to Stoke Heath”.', 'The Coroner defined the scope of the Inquest as follows:', '“(a) JS having been sentenced (we cannot go behind the sentence), was all relevant and necessary information available to properly reach a decision as to the appropriate allocation for [JS]?', '(b) With that information and the sentencing judges’ remarks, what allocation options were available, what were considered and what criteria [were] used to exercise them? The inquest cannot go into matters of resources, save perhaps for observing that, if it is the case, that lack of resources may have been a factor whether critical or contributory?', '(c) Having been allocated to [Stoke Heath] what then should have happened to [JS]?', '(d) What should have been the correct approach once [JS] was on the hospital wing? Should more liaison have taken place between the Agencies. Did Stoke Heath have all the necessary relevant information, did it make the correct risk/ care plan assessment?', '(e) To what extent did the differing Agencies know what the other was doing? It appears that the Trafford [YOT] were still trying to get [JS] transferred to a [LASCH] whereas those within the [YOI] were seeking to integrate him into the main wing i.e. further within the prison system. On the face of it, these aims conflict.', '(f) Should it have been clear that [JS] was to remain on the hospital wing until secure accommodation was found? If so, should [JS] have been told this?', '(g) Is it correct that in the light of the experience of others in [JS’] position being successfully integrated into the main wing that it was then right for [JS]? What if any thing was there to distinguish [JS] from any other inmate who had exhibited similar history and symptoms? What if anything could have been done to indicate that [JS] was different to the previous inmates and that he would react in the way that he did?', '(h) Allocation and re-allocation I take as the same issue. The fact that the initial allocation did not succeed would that, as a matter of principle, negate the need to continue that process? ...', '[Sentencing policy] or change in policy, which may on may not increase the number of children in custody, is not within the scope of this inquest. It is a matter of national interest which should be dealt with at that level.', 'The Inquisition form completed by the jury recorded a unanimous verdict of “Accidental death in part contributed because the risk was not properly recognised and appropriate precautions were not taken to prevent it.” The jury also responded to a “Middleton questionnaire” (R (Middleton) v. West Somerset Coroner and Another [2000] 2AC 182) which had been prepared by the Coroner in consultation with the parties’ legal representatives. A later report prepared by Mr Lambert (see below) summarised the jury Inquest’s conclusions and recommendations as follows:', '“Quality of Pre-sentence Information', 'The Inquest concluded there were weaknesses in both the quality and handling of information at the pre-sentence stage. Although the Jury accepted that the Asset format was an appropriate way to bring together relevant information about the young person, they were critical of the [YOT] for its completion of the Asset assessment material and drew attention to the ‘Don’t Know ‘responses to key aspects of the Asset framework that they considered inadequate. Attention was drawn towards the importance of providing additional documentary evidence to support the Asset judgement, especially where vulnerability was the issue. The Coroner emphasised throughout the importance of providing a good psychiatric assessment of the young person and ensuring that the court and all relevant parties were in possession of this material.', 'Allocation Arrangements', 'The Inquest was unanimous in its conclusion that the placement of [JS] in a YOI was not appropriate and that he should have been placed in a [LASCH]. The Inquest heard evidence about the allocation arrangements and the difficulties in matching young people’s needs and appropriate services given the limited capacity of the local authority secure sector. The Coroner expressed great concern about this situation and also drew attention to those vulnerable 16 year olds who, because of their age, appeared even less likely to be able to access a secure children’s home.', 'The Coroner also recommended that the system for placement should hold open for a longer period the possibility of transfer to more suitable accommodation. Young people who are disturbed and vulnerable need to feel, and be made aware, that their initial placement may be reviewed. The Jury recommended that young people such as [JS] should be held in some temporary intermediate provision outside the main YOI estate while such considerations took place.', 'Quality of communication', 'The Coroner and Jury were concerned by what they perceived as failures in the communication arrangements and the passing of information between professionals. They made a general recommendation that these arrangements should be subject to review and improvement. In particular, they drew attention to their concern about the availability of the psychiatrist’s report and the gaps in communication between the [YOT] and Stoke Heath in respect of the transfer application. They also felt that more prominent means should be found by which to signal levels of risk.', 'Stoke Heath YOI Health Care Centre', 'The Inquest concluded that the care and attention given to [JS] by the medical, nursing and YOI staff at Stoke Heath Health Care Centre was provided in an appropriate way. However, there was unanimous condemnation of the building and its facilities.', 'Use of Safe Clothing', 'The Inquest learnt that [JS] had spent his first four days and nights in the Health Care Centre wearing only safer cell clothing with no underwear. Although this clothing was issued for [JS’] self protection, the Coroner and his Jury were concerned with the possible de-humanising aspects of this approach and recommended that the practice be reviewed.”', 'The single judge in later judicial review proceedings found that the Inquest was “a model of what was required to discharge the State’s investigative obligation under Article 2”.', 'On 5 May 2004 the Coroner wrote to the Secretary of State (Rule 43 of the Coroners Rules 1984) requesting a public inquiry:', '“Without going behind the sentence [JS] received at this Inquest it does seem to me essential that there is an urgent and comprehensive review of the pre-sentence exercise, the allocation process and the availability and provision of [LASCHs]. The statistics indicate that more young offenders are being sent to custody without a proportionate increase in [LASCHs] to accommodate the inevitable increased proportion of those receiving such sentences who are considered to be vulnerable. ...', 'It seemed clear to me that the allocation of disturbed and vulnerable young children (typically 15 and 16 year old boys) should be determined on a needs basis and not a resources basis. This is all the more important if Courts are sentencing such vulnerable and disturbed young offenders in the belief, mistaken or not, that recommendations, such as that contained in the pre-sentence report and endorsed by the Sentencing Judge can be implemented ...', 'In all the circumstances, and so that it can include Sentencing Policy which is an essential ingredient but outside the scope of the Inquest, I consider that the Review should take the form of a Public Inquiry where all interested parties can make their views known.”', 'On 16 September 2004 the Secretary of State responded to the Coroner that a public inquiry was not necessary given three reviews which he had initiated as regards the broader issues underlying JS’ death:', '“In fact the new Sentencing Guidelines Council [“SGC”], established by the Government, and which is chaired by the Lord Chief Justice, is currently considering new guidelines on sentencing for robbery. I think it is right for the [SGC] to be the body which addresses the issues arising from [JS’] sentence, and I am formally asking the [SGC] to do this. I understand why you wanted to recommend a public inquiry to tackle this, but I think that the [SGC] does provide the most appropriate forum.', 'The operational issues you drew attention to are important and need to be looked into by someone with the necessary expertise to identify the realistic scope for improvement. I am asking David Lambert, a former Assistant Chief Inspector of the Social Services Inspectorate, to do this. David Lambert conducted the recent inquiry into the death of [X]. I enclose a copy of his terms of reference.', 'The configuration and development of the juvenile secure estate is a longer-term issue, which the [YJB] is addressing as part of its work on a new vision for the future of juvenile custody - on which it will be putting proposals to Ministers later this year. We have asked the [YJB] to take full account of the concerns expressed in the verdict of the inquest jury and relayed in your letter.”', 'In response to the applicant’s request for a public inquiry, on 16 September 2004 the Parliamentary Under-Secretary essentially repeating the above response of the Secretary of State. By letter dated 20 December 2004 the applicant was again informed that the Secretary of State did not intend to hold a public inquiry.', 'On 3 December 2004 the Coroner wrote to the Secretary of State re-expressing his concerns about the failure to hold a public inquiry. He welcomed the above-noted three lines of inquiry but was concerned that they might not adequately coordinate between each other.', 'On 14 December 2004 Parliament’s Joint Committee on Human Rights issued its Third Report of Session 2004-05 on Deaths in Custody. Referring to JS’ death and noting that there had never been a public inquiry into the death of a child in custody, it recommended a public inquiry and, further, that LASCHs should be used wherever possible with use of prison custody reduced to an absolute minimum. The Government’s detailed response to the Committee was published on 10 March 2005 and it, inter alia, referred to the three internal reviews and the Inquest into JS’ death. The three concerns of the Coroner would each be addressed by an appropriate review: the appropriateness of the sentence would be addressed by the SGC, the effectiveness of pre-sentence and placement procedures would be addressed by an operational review by Mr Lambert and the YJB would review whether the juvenile secure estate as then configured was able to fully provide for vulnerable young people. The Government firmly believed that those measures were the most appropriate, useful and focussed.', '“The Government agrees with the Committee’s view that [LASCH] should be used wherever possible for children, with the use of Prison Service custody reduced to an absolute minimum. The Government uses only [LASCH] and comparable places in secure training centres for children under the age of 15, and for the more vulnerable 15 and 16 year olds. ... [A]ny sort of custody for young people should be a last resort, and that approach is enshrined in legislation .... For those young people whom the courts do send to custody, the [YJB] seeks to make the best possible use of available accommodation, taking full account of age and other factors that contribute to vulnerability. [LASCH] and [STCs] provide for the youngest trainees. It would not be appropriate for these young people to mix with older juveniles, who are generally placed in a [YOI]. The most vulnerable 15 and 16 year olds are also held outside [YOI]. The [YJB] considers that more provision is needed for vulnerable 15 and 16 year old boys, and its recent consultation paper Strategy for the Secure Estate for Juveniles proposes a new form of ‘intermediate’ accommodation, with smaller-scale units and more intensive staff support for trainees, which would address this need ...', 'The juvenile secure estate has evolved considerably since it was set up in 2000 and continues to develop. The Government believes the proposals in Strategy for the Secure Estate for Juveniles – the consultation period ends on 28 February – set a clear direction for the future of the estate.”', 'On 27 August 2004 the Secretary of State requested the SGC to review the JS case during its current consideration of guidelines for robberies. The SGC considered advice from the Sentencing Advisory Panel on sentences for robberies (notably of the type in JS’ case) and of juveniles. The SGC published draft guidelines and consulted publicly. In July 2006 “The Definitive Sentencing Guidelines on Robbery” were published by the SGC. The foreword noted that it was not intended to significantly change the prior practice of non-custodial sentences for the majority of young offenders who committed robbery. Certain recommendations were, however, made as regards the factors to be taken into consideration prior to making custodial sentences on young offenders including emphasising the welfare of the child. The Court of Appeal (see below) noted that the applicant was invited to make representations to the SGC but she submitted to this Court that she could not make an effective contribution to this process as her sole entitlement was to express her views as a member of the public.', 'Following the adoption of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 with additional provisions as regards sentencing young offenders (including a comprehensive list of new community orders and a statutory recognition that a sentencing court must have regard to the welfare of the offender), the SGC then published further draft Guidelines (June 2009) entitled “Overarching Principles - Sentencing Youths”, requesting comments by 28 August 2009. As regards both the underlying principles/approach to sentencing and the choice of sentencing options (non-custodial and custodial sentences), the draft Guidelines emphasised the necessity for the trial court to consider the welfare of the young offender including the high incidence of mental health issues amongst young people in the criminal justice system, the vulnerability of young persons to self-harm (particularly within a custodial environment) and the high risks associated with young offenders in a custodial setting.', 'The Secretary of State also requested the YJB to take full account of the issues raised in the Inquest and by the Coroner in its current work on the configuration and development of juvenile secure estate.', 'In November 2004 the YJB published a draft strategy for the juvenile secure estate setting out the assumptions and principles that the YJB would use in developing the secure estate (including enhanced provisions for vulnerable older boys) and the steps it intended to take in the following three years to deliver these within available resources.', 'The context of the draft report was described as follows:', '“... the YJB has sought to incorporate within this strategy the lessons learnt from serious incidents that have occurred in the secure estate for children and young people. This includes a specific request ... to take account of the Coroner’s concerns about the configuration and development of the secure estate in relation to vulnerable young offenders (concerns expressed following the inquest into the tragic death of [JS]).”', 'Responses were invited from interested parties. The applicant was given a copy of the draft Report and was asked for her views and advice: she did not make submissions as she considered that it was not an independent inquiry as the YJB would not accept its responsibility in JS’ death.', 'The final report (entitled “Strategy for the Secure Estate for Children and Young People, Plans for 2005/06 to 2007/08”) described the “Context” as including: a central theme of developing secure estate was that services in custody for young people were the same in custody as in the community; the publication of the Government green paper (“Every Child Matters” and the companion document (“Youth Justice – the Next Steps”) which again underlined the necessity to apply community service standards of child care in custody settings; the adoption of the Children Act 2004 (further to the Green Paper) had explicitly placed responsibility for safeguarding and promoting welfare on, inter alia, providers of custody for children and young people, which was the first time that custody providers had been drawn into mainstream children’s legislation in such an explicit way; and it repeated the reference to the lessons to be learned from the death of JS.', 'The assumptions that underpinned the Strategy were outlined. Custody should be used only as a last resort (citing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child) and the YJB would work with the SGC to agree on an operational definition of “last resort”. Custody should be used particularly sparingly for young offenders because of their dependent, developing and vulnerable status and, while proportionately greater use was made of custody for them in the United Kingdom, the YJB was committed to developing community-based alternatives in which sentencers had sufficient confidence so that their proportionate use of custody for children and young people would fall progressively and the average daily number in custody was reduced; the principle, that punishment of custody lies in the loss of liberty itself and not in any gratuitously punitive aspect of the regime, should apply absolutely; and secure establishments, whatever form they take, were scarce and expensive, and their portfolio and characteristics could only be changed slowly so that the YJB would work closely with existing providers and explore whether additional providers can be encouraged to enter the field. While the demand for places and the Government’s provision of resources for such places were not determined by the YJB, it actively sought to influence both; the type of regime or interventions provided in custody should be based on what research considers was effective in preventing children and young people from offending and reoffending; and the rights of children and young people held in custody should be respected and upheld.', 'As regards the guiding principles, the YJB’s strategy was aspirational in the sense that it could not be achieved easily or quickly, given its starting point. The guiding principles of the YJB included ensuring a child-based culture, adequate and targeted training, safeguards and services needed to properly protect and assist young offenders.', 'Finally, it noted that the present portfolio of provision for children and young people in custody remained less than ideal and that its ambition was to create a suitable secure estate based on the above principles as rapidly as reasonably possible. The speed at which the YJB would achieve its ambitions would depend on the sentencing rates and resources attributed so that even a three-year strategy might be ambitious but the YJB was working with the relevant bodies on these two issues. The YJB went on to make detailed proposals for consolidating and enhancing the provision of places and services in the secure estate including for STCs, YOIs and LASCHs.', 'It concluded that evidence of independent assessors demonstrated that there had been significant achievements in commissioning secure accommodation for children and young people since April 2000, even if much remained to be done. An update to the strategy was published in 2007.', 'Mr Lambert (a former Assistant Chief Inspector of the Social Services Inspectorate and Chairman of the Norfolk ACPC) examined the operational issues arising from JS’ case and, notably, the roles of the YOT, the YJB as well as the YOI itself. Having sent a draft of the Report to the Home Office in December 2004, he requested the applicant to make submissions. The applicant’s solicitors requested a copy of the report. She maintained that she heard nothing further until August 2005 when Mr Lambert contacted her indicating that a final draft of the Report had been submitted to the Minister: the applicant again requested a copy of the report and, while Mr Lambert was not at liberty to disclose the Report, he wished to meet with her. A further request for a copy of the report was made. The applicant was not provided, as she requested, with access to the draft report, and she did not therefore make submissions.', 'His final report entitled “Review of the effectiveness of Operational Procedures for the Identification, Placement and Safeguarding of Vulnerable Young People in Custody” was published by the Home Office on 18 September 2006. The agreed scope of the review, including the agreed Terms of Reference, was described in the Report as follows:', '“The review will analyse:', '- The policies, procedures and practices for the placement of young offenders, taking account of any recommendations that the [YJB] or Home Office have made since [JS’] death, and whether further improvements can be made. The review will refer to the Prison Service investigation, the Serious Incident Review on [JS] undertaken by the YJB and the work commissioned by the YJB Placement Programme Board and the Trafford ACPC Chapter 8 review. These contain recommendations that encompass both correctional services and the safeguarding of children.', 'The review will consider:', '- Whether the information and documentation that a [YOT] prepares for sentencers on young people at risk of a custodial sentence/placement is adequate and appropriate, taking into account the work that the YJB is doing on the management of risk in the community.', '- Whether improved guidance is needed on the [YOT’s] assessment of vulnerability or risk.', '- Whether existing methods for the transfer of documentation between the [YOT], the court, the [YJB] Placements Team and the receiving establishment need improvement.', '- The adequacy of YOI reception procedures and arrangements for the care of vulnerable trainees.', '- The appropriateness of protective clothing for young offenders at risk of self-harm.', '- Whether relevant changes are needed to staff training, in particular regarding the quality of the Asset assessment form, the risk of harm section and advice that the YJB is producing for [YOTs]: and the reception and care of vulnerable trainees.', 'The review will be a fundamental part of informing the family of [JS] about progress and ensuring action is undertaken by the key agencies following his death.', 'The review, in addition to findings on the matters listed above, will include a summary account of all investigations that have been conducted into [JS’] death and the operational issues arising from them. It will outline any implications for the juvenile secure arrangements as a whole and identify any recommended improvements. The review may make recommendations to the Minister on any good practice that is relevant to or becomes apparent during the review.”', 'The Report went on to highlight the main themes arising out of the three internal investigations and the Inquest and from the terms of reference. It summarised the conclusions of the investigations and Inquest, the subsequent domestic developments and any further recommendations:', 'As to the “Appropriateness of Placement”, the Report stated:', '“All of the Investigations into the circumstances of the death in custody of [JS] concluded that young men who presented his level of risk are not appropriately placed in YOIs and that every effort should be made to secure their placement in a [LASCH]. There should be consideration of the development of discrete facilities within the YOI sector for young people demonstrably at risk of self-harm or suicide.”', 'As to “Quality of Assessment Work and the Management of Risk”:', '“All the Investigations concluded that, by one means or another, the court considering [JS’] sentence had received explicit advice about his vulnerability, his history of self-harm and attempted suicide. Comparison was drawn between the quality of the pre-sentence report and the Asset assessment, the latter being considered incomplete and lacking in supporting evidence.”', 'As to “Placement of children and young people at High Risk in the Secure Estate”:', '“All the Investigations closely examined the operations of the YJB Placements Team. There was a generally agreed conclusion that, accepting the complexity of the team’s task and the difficulties inherent in managing three sectors with differential levels of availability, more clarity needed to be introduced into the placement arrangements. Issues concerning the quality and transmission of information, and the arrangements for transfer between placements were also highlighted.”', 'As to “Reception of young people into YOIs”', '“The Investigations into [JS] death concluded that at his admission all reception procedures in force at that time were carried out satisfactorily and that [JS] received a high level of care and attention. However, all four Investigations expressed reservation and uncertainty about the robustness of the transmission of information between the [YOT] and the YOI; in particular the timely availability of his psychiatric history. “', 'As to “Care and Sentence Planning”:', '“One of the key issues identified by the various investigations into the death of [JS] related to the arrangements to plan for his stay at the YOI. There were concerns about the organisational arrangements for the planning meeting and its optimum timeliness. Some of the investigations recommended that a much shorter time than the YJB National Standard ... of within 10 working days of admission should now be adopted. The Investigations also expressed concern about arrangements for recording at YOIs”', 'As to “Provision of Health Care”', '“Each of the four Investigations into the death of [JS] concluded that the care and attention given to Joseph by the medical, nursing and YOI staff at the YOI Health Care Centre was of good quality and appropriate to his level of need. There was unanimous criticism of the physical state of the Health Care Centre.”', 'As to “Management of self-harm and suicide in YOIs”', '“Overall, the Investigations into the death of [JS] concluded that the YOIs suicide awareness strategy was sound and that it was applied with care and attention. The Prison Service Investigation recommended that some tightening of procedures would improve effectiveness.', 'As to “Accommodation of young people at risk in ‘safer’ cells:', '“When in the Health Care Centre at Stoke Heath YOI, [JS] was subject to a prescribed 30 minute observation regime. As [JS] died within 20 minutes of the last recorded observation, the Trafford ACPC Chapter 8 Review recommended that YOIs adopt a 15 minute observation interval where young people are assessed as at serious risk of self-harm and are accommodated in a ‘safer’ cell. The Chapter 8 Review recommended continuous, direct observation in all other circumstances. The Prison Service Investigation recommended that telephone conversations of trainees under ‘at risk’ supervision be monitored.”', 'As to “Use of Protective Clothing”', '“At the [the Inquest] the Jury were concerned to learn about the use of protective clothing and recommended a review of the practice.”', 'As to “Anti-Bullying Strategies”:', '“The Investigations into the death of [JS] all agreed that one aspect of YOI life that he feared or that fed his apprehension about his sentence was the threat or belief that he would be subject to bullying should he move from the Health Care Centre to a residential unit.”', 'The conclusion in the executive summary of this report noted:', 'Since [JS’] tragic death, a wide range of measures have been taken to improve safeguarding of young people in [YOIs]. This [operational review] has carefully examined them and made recommendations for improvement. The YJB and the Prison Service have shown a commitment to change and have developed a set of policies and procedures that focus directly on safeguarding issues and have the potential capacity to deliver a more effective and safer service. But much more can be and needs to be done.”', 'On 21 February 2005 the applicant requested leave to apply for judicial review arguing that two central issues regarding the death of JS remained unresolved despite the Inquest: the extent to which the sentencing policy resulted in JS being detained in conditions that gave rise to an unacceptable risk of suicide and, secondly, the reasons why JS was allocated to a YOI rather than a LASCH (including any lack of resources contributed to that allocation). The applicant maintained that the Secretary of State, in deciding not to convene a full public inquiry, had failed to comply with his duty under Article 2 of the Convention to investigate the circumstances of the death of JS. The Secretary of State argued that policy issues were beyond the scope of Article 2 and, alternatively, that the combination of the three internal investigations, the Inquest and the three reviews proposed by the Secretary of State satisfied the requirements of Article 2 of the Convention. On 13 June 2005 the applicant was granted leave to apply for judicial review. By judgment delivered 16 January 2006 the High Court dismissed the judicial review proceedings. On 1 March 2006 leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal was granted.', 'On 17 October 2006 the Court of Appeal rejected the appeal.', 'The principal judgment was that of Lord Justice Pill. He noted the evidence at the Inquest to the effect that JS should not have been at Stoke Heath but at a LASCH, that he would have been placed in a YOI even had the judge’s remarks been considered by the YJB and, given the available resources, it was almost inevitable, or overwhelmingly likely, that JS would go to a YOI. The trial judge was not at fault: his sentence was lawful, he specifically requested that information as to JS’ vulnerability be passed to the appropriate authorities and he was not obliged to inquire further since the duty to place offenders is upon the Secretary of State. While Lord Justice Pill did not exclude that a sentence could itself breach Articles 2 or 3 of the Convention, the present sentence did not.', 'The evaluation of the circumstances in which JS died was “thorough and no complaint about it is made in an Article 2 context”. Where failures were identified, however, investigation of the facts did not complete performance of the State’s obligations “unless consideration is given to effecting improvements” (Lord Justice Pill referring to domestic jurisprudence and to Öneryıldız v. Turkey, (no. 48939/99, 18 June 2002). He continued:', '“Where the failures are of the kind identified in the present case, I do not consider that the Commission’s statement in Taylor that “wider questions” fall outside the scope of Article 2 is, as the law has now been interpreted, applicable to render unnecessary enquiries beyond the factual investigation provided by the Inquest. The statement in Jordan that detailed investigation of policy issues may not be necessary was in the context of a defective investigation of the facts. Such a defect does not necessarily give rise to policy issues. ...', 'The evidence at the Inquest revealed a worrying situation with regard to the detention of young offenders. On the evidence, vulnerable young offenders, such as [JS], have been detained in conditions unsuitable for their safety and their lives. That having been revealed in a properly conducted Inquest, there is, in my judgment, a duty upon the Secretary of State to investigate further what remedial action can be taken. Thorough investigation of facts at an Inquest would have little value in preventing a repetition and in maintaining public confidence, unless followed up.”', 'As a fact finding tribunal, the Inquest jury operated effectively. However, the jury could not be expected to give answers to questions of resources and policy which could provide reliable guides to an improvement in conditions.', 'However, there had been a substantial public debate and it was continuing. The investigations, assessments and debates in progress were such that the applicant had not established that the Secretary of State was in breach of Article 2 by failing to convene a public inquiry:', '“I am far from persuaded that setting up a public inquiry is the only way in which the obligation under Article 2 can be discharged in this case. It is not a case in which the respondent, either expressly or by inaction, has failed to confront the issues which have emerged or failed to give serious consideration to possible improvements. The combination of the Inquest and the measures taken, including the input into the deliberations of the SGC, have achieved compliance with the Article 2 obligation.', 'Questions of sentencing policy and of the allocation of resources are essentially for collegiate consideration and decisions by the Government, following procedures which are well established, including those by which guidance is given to judges. I cannot hold that the only appropriate action is for a judge, however eminent, to be given the task of resolving such issues, at or following a public inquiry.”', 'As to the participation of the family of JS in the investigation, Lord Justice Pill noted that the family and their advisors were fully involved at the Inquest and in subsequent representations to the Secretary of State. They had also been invited to make representations to the SGC.', '“The bereaved family and their advisors were fully involved at the Inquest and in subsequent representations to the Secretary of State. They have been invited to make representations to the SGC. It is recognised that they can make an input into questions of policy and resources but, because broad issues of public concern are involved, many other factors have to be taken into account and involvement in those issues cannot be expected to be to the same degree. Participation in issues of sentencing policy and the allocation of resources are in a different category from the investigation of facts in the particular case.', 'He concluded:', '“If I am right that the Article 2 duty may extend beyond a factual investigation into a search for improvements, issues of policy may arise. In addressing them, the appropriate extent of the family’s involvement required, however serious the impact of the events upon them, is likely to be less than with the investigation of the facts. I do not accept that concern for the family’s involvement imposes an obligation on the Secretary of State to hold a public inquiry.', 'Lady Justice Arden agreed with the above reasoning and added that a distinction was to be drawn between “legal and political questions”. The applicant could not, by way of individual rights under Article 2, intervene in the political process which determined the allocation of resources as this would be to carry Convention rights further than Convention jurisprudence required (citing Taylor Family and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 23412/94, Comm. Dec. 30.8.94, D.R. 79 p. 127).', 'On 14 March 2007 the House of Lords dismissed the applicant’s appeal: it did not raise an arguable point of law of general public importance which ought to be considered by the House of Lords, bearing in mind that the case had already been the subject of judicial decision and reviewed on appeal.', 'The main custodial sentence for young offenders is a DTO, it amounts to a sentence to custody of between four months and two years and it can be awarded against those of 12-17 years of age. Section 100 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 (“the 2000 Act”) provides:', '“A detention and training order is an order that the offender in respect of whom it is made shall be subject, for the term specified in the order, to a period of detention and training followed by a period of supervision.”', 'Accordingly, the first half of the sentence is spent in custody whilst the second half is spent in the community under the supervision of the YOT.', 'Section 102(1) of the 2000 Act provides that the DTO shall be served in such secure accommodation as may be determined by the Secretary of State or by an authorised body. The YJB exercises this role.', 'The SGC was established in 2004 (the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the 2003 Act”) to develop, in place of the Court of Appeal, comprehensive sentencing guidelines for the courts to apply. The SGC is chaired by the Lord Chief Justice and has seven further judicial members (appointed by the Lord Chief Justice) from every tier of court that deals with sentencing in criminal cases. Four non-judicial members (experienced in policing, criminal prosecution, criminal defence and the interests of victims) are appointed by the Lord Chancellor, after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice and the Home Secretary. The SGC receives advice from the Sentencing Advisory Panel (which itself consults widely before tendering that advice). The SGC then produces a draft guideline on which it consults and the final guidelines, amended as appropriate following consultation, are published in final form approximately two months later.', 'The YJB is an executive non-departmental public body, created by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. At the relevant time it was funded and overseen by the Ministry of Justice, and the relevant Secretary of State appointed its Board members (10-12).', 'The YJB supervises the youth justice system in England and Wales. It advises the Secretary of State on the operation of, and standards for, the youth justice system; it monitors the performance of the youth justice system; it commissions secure estate for young people (it spends around 70% of its budget on providing custodial places); it sets and promotes the best standards for these facilities; it places children and young people remanded or sentenced to custody in appropriate accommodation within the secure estate; it makes grants to local authorities and other bodies to support the development of effective practice; and it commissions research and publishes information.', 'The bulk of young men sentenced to DTOs are placed in YOIs managed by the prison service. YOIs hold young offenders between the ages of 15 and 21. There are some differences between YOI and adult prison regimes: the YOI has a better staff/offender ratio; at least 25 hours of education per week; and its overall objectives are helping the detainee improve behaviour, develop practical skills and prepare for employment.', 'STCs are purpose built centres for young offenders up to the age of 17 whose regimes are constructive and education-focused. STCs have a better staff/offender ratio and are smaller in size than YOIs, which means that individual needs are met more easily.', 'LASCH are designed to focus on very vulnerable children who present a range of serious physical, emotional and psychological problems. They are run by local authority social services departments, overseen by the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills. They have the best staff/young person ratio of all and are generally small facilities (6-40 beds). LASCH accommodate, not only juveniles on secure remand or following a DTO, but also children who are being looked after for welfare or behavioural reasons. LASCHs generally accommodate young offenders (12 to 14 years of age), girls under 16 years of age as well as boys who are 15-16 years of age assessed as vulnerable.', 'An Inquest must be conducted where a body lies in the district of the Coroner and there are grounds to suspect that the person died a violent or an unnatural death or a sudden death of which the cause is unknown (section 8(1) of the Coroners Act 1988). The Inquest must determine the identity of the deceased as well as how, when and where he came by his or her death (section 11(5((b) of the 1988 Act) but the Coroners Rules 1984 provide that the verdict shall not accord blame to individuals for wrong doing or otherwise ascribe specific responsibility for death (Rules 36 and 42.', 'Rule 43 provides that:', '“A coroner who believes that action should be taken to prevent the recurrence of fatalities similar to that in respect of which the inquest is being held may announce at the inquest that he is reporting the matter in writing to the person or authority who may have power to take such action and he may report the matter accordingly.”', 'The Committee noted its extreme concern at the conditions experienced in detention and that children did not receive adequate protection or help in YOIs and it noted a very poor staff/child ratio, high levels of violence, bullying, self-harm and suicide, inadequate rehabilitation opportunities, solitary confinement in inappropriate conditions for a long time as a disciplinary measures or for protection, and the fact that girls and some boys in prison were still not separated from adults.', 'Following his visit to the United Kingdom in November 2004, the Commissioner reported on numerous matters including the detention of juveniles (under 18 years of age) and young offenders (18-20 years of age).', 'The United Kingdom had one of the highest rates of juvenile detention in Western Europe. Having been in line with the European average during the early nineties, the numbers of juvenile and young offenders increased significantly between 1995 and 1997 before stabilising. Those high rates of incarceration had inevitably impacted on the conditions of detention. Special attention to the educational and psychological needs of juveniles and young offenders was required if their detention, at such a critical time in their development, was to contribute to their rehabilitation and reinsertion and it was difficult to conclude that those imperatives were being entirely satisfied. Indeed the overall impression of the Commissioner was of a detention system that placed too much emphasis on punishment and control and not enough on rehabilitation.', 'As far as juveniles were concerned, the Commissioner was informed that their conditions of detention had improved in recent years with greater investment in LASCHs and STCs and in the services provided to children detained in YOI. However, he noted two serious shortcomings. He was struck on his visit to one YOI by the apparent lack of appropriate psychological care and the inadequate educational assistance provided. His discussions with other actors suggested that these problems arose, to a greater or lesser extent, throughout the juvenile and young offender detention estate.', 'In its response of 8 June 2005, the Government referred to a comprehensive review of each custodial establishment where young people were held, to new measures to address self-harm and suicide, to a new staff training package with an enhanced child protection module and to further funding for 25 local authority staff to undertake duties in YOIs.', 'The Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal expressed the following opinion in this case:', '“In giving this judgment we are not seeking to set new guidelines. If we were intending to do so, we would have sought the advice of the Sentencing Advisory Panel before giving this judgment. Instead, we are seeking to draw together the principles which are already clearly established by the reported decisions of this court. Before coming to the facts of the individual applications, we wish to set out certain information which has been obtained by research conducted on behalf of the Home Office. It is published as Study 235, dated December 2001, entitled “Mobile Phone Theft”. The research contains certain findings as to the level of mobile phone thefts and robberies and identifies a marked increase in the incidents of such offences. ... Twelve per cent of those asked said that they had been victimised at least once. The risk of phone theft for those in the ages between 11 and 16 is five times higher than that for adults. The results show a substantial growth involving the theft of telephones. Figures from six police forces suggest that the number of recorded phone thefts has at least doubled between 1998/99 and 2000/01. There was an increase in the proportion of robberies involving telephones from about 8 per cent in 1998/99 (an estimated 5,500 phone robberies), to about 28 per cent in 2000/01 (an estimated 26,300 phone robberies). No doubt part of the increase was due to the greater phone ownership during that period. ...', 'Faced with that background the courts have no alternative but to adopt a robust sentencing policy towards those who commit these offences. Those who do so must understand that they will be punished severely. Custodial sentences will be the only option available to the courts when these offences are committed, unless there are exceptional circumstances. That will apply irrespective of the age of the offender and irrespective of whether the offender has previous convictions. However, both those factors are very important when a judge comes to decide on the length of sentence.”']",[],[],[],[],[],[]

The applicant was born in 1975 and lived in Sevastopol.', '7. In June 2003 the applicant, who at that time was on probation after receiving a sentence for burglary, was arrested and placed in police custody (затриманий) on suspicion of another count of burglary. The date of his arrest is in dispute between the parties. The applicant contended that this occurred on 17 June 2003, whereas according to the Government he was apprehended on 18 June 2003.', '8. On 18 June 2003 the applicant was questioned by the police, in the course of which he admitted that he had participated in the burglary of a house belonging to the sister of his alleged accomplice, Mr Zh.', ""On 20 June 2003 the Balaklavsky District Court of Sevastopol (Балаклавський районний суд м. Севастополя, hereafter “the District Court”) extended the term of the applicant's police custody up to a maximum of ten days."", '9. On 27 June 2003 the District Court ordered the applicant to be placed in pre-trial detention on the grounds that the offence he was suspected of had been committed while he was on probation in connection with a prior suspended sentence and that if at large the applicant would abscond and thereby obstruct justice.', '10. On an unspecified date in August-September 2003, the applicant was committed for trial before the District Court. In the trial proceedings, he was represented by his mother Ms S., and he retracted the confession statements he had given during his detention in police custody, claiming that these had been given under duress.', ""11. During a hearing on 11 September 2003 the applicant informed the trial court that he felt unwell and thus could not participate in the hearing. The presiding judge called an ambulance to assess the applicant's medical condition."", ""12. On 29 April 2004 the District Court found the applicant guilty as charged. It rejected the applicant's argument that his confession statements had been given under duress and found that a certificate issued by the Sevastopol City Hospital, according to which the applicant had been treated in that hospital on 21 June 2003 for bruises on his legs, could not be regarded as conclusive evidence of police brutality, as the applicant himself had failed to give any explanation before the court as to how he had come by those injuries."", ""13. On 22 March 2005, following an appeal by the applicant, the Sevastopol City Court of Appeal (Апеляційний суд м. Севастополя, hereafter “the Court of Appeal”) quashed the judgment of 29 April 2004 and remitted the case for a fresh examination. The court indicated, inter alia, that the first-instance court had addressed the issue of the applicant's alleged ill-treatment in police custody, although he had never complained before the court that he had suffered any ill-treatment by the police. Without giving any reasons, the Court of Appeal also ordered that the applicant should remain in detention."", ""14. On 23 November 2005 the District Court convicted the applicant of burglary and sentenced him to three years and seven months' imprisonment. It based this conviction on the confession statements given by the applicant and Mr Zh. during the pre-trial stage of the proceedings, the victim's oral evidence in court, and statements given by two other witnesses in the course of the pretrial investigation. It rejected as unfounded the applicant's allegation that he had been ill-treated by the police."", ""15. The applicant appealed against the judgment of 23 November 2005, asking for a reduction of his sentence. On 17 October 2006 the Court of Appeal granted the applicant's appeal and reduced his sentence to three years, six months and one day's imprisonment. The applicant did not appeal in cassation."", '16. According to the applicant, after his arrest on 17 June 2003 he was taken to the Balaklavsky District Police Department of Sevastopol (Балаклавський РВВС м. Севастополя, hereafter “the Police Department”). There he was allegedly subjected to ill-treatment by the police officers, who coerced him into confessing to burglary, with which he was subsequently charged.', '17. On 21 June 2003 the applicant was taken to the Sevastopol City Hospital No. 1 (Севастопольська міська лікарня № 1). According to the certificate issued by this hospital on 15 December 2003 the applicant had bruises on his left thigh and buttocks.', '18. After having received the required assistance in the Sevastopol City Hospital No. 1, the applicant was taken to the Sevastopol City Temporary Detention Centre (Севастопольський міський ізолятор тимчасового тримання, hereafter “the Sevastopol ITT”).', '19. According to the entry in the Sevastopol ITT register the applicant did not have any visible injuries on his admission and did not complain of any illtreatment.', ""20. During the trial proceedings before the District Court in MarchNovember 2005, the trial court ordered the Balaklavsky District Prosecutor's Office of Sevastopol (Прокурора Балаклавського району м. Севастополя, hereafter “the Prosecutor's Office”) to carry out criminal inquires into the applicant's allegations of ill-treatment. On an unspecified date before November 2005 the Prosecutor's Office decided that there was no prima facie case of ill-treatment and refused to institute criminal proceedings in respect of the applicant's complaints."", '21. As indicated above (see paragraph 18), on 21 June 2003, the applicant was transferred from the Police Department to the Sevastopol ITT. On 16 July 2003 he was admitted to the Simferopol Pre-Trial Detention Centre no. 15 (Сімферопольський слідчий ізолятор № 15, hereafter “the Simferopol SIZO”). However, since the police, prosecution and judicial authorities involved in his criminal case were based in Sevastopol the applicant was transferred each month from the Simferopol SIZO to the Sevastopol ITT, where he stayed for ten days. From 8 to 28 April 2006 the applicant remained in the Sevastopol ITT as, according to a letter of 4 March 2006 from the Deputy Head of the Sevastopol City Police Department (Управління МВС України в м. Севастополі), the Simferopol SIZO refused to admit inmates of the Sevastopol ITT who were suffering from tuberculosis.', '22. On 28 April 2006 the applicant was admitted to the Sevastopol City Infectious Diseases Hospital (Севастопольська міська інфекційна лікарня, hereafter “the Infectious Diseases Hospital”).', '23. Therefore, between 21 June 2003 and 28 April 2006 the applicant spent a total of around a year in the Sevastopol ITT.', '24. According to the applicant, during his stay in the Sevastopol ITT he was held in small cells which were constantly overcrowded. In support of this claim, the applicant relied on a letter from the head of the Sevastopol City Police Department, issued on 10 May 2005 and addressed to a third person. In that letter it was stated that some 240 inmates were being held in the Sevastopol ITT instead of its capacity of 82.', '25. The applicant stated that he had been held in cell no. 9 for most of the time and for short periods in cells nos. 4 and 5.', '26. Cell no. 9 measured about 15 square metres and had been occupied by 25 inmates. There were three double bunks for three inmates. Cells nos. 4 and 5, both of around 22 square metres, the applicant shared with 30 fellow inmates. They were equipped with one double bunk and wooden planking on the floor, which was also used by the inmates for sleeping.', '27. Owing to the lack of bunks, the inmates had to take turns to sleep. The cells were situated in the basement and were thus deprived of daylight. They were dimly lit by electric lamps fixed into the ceiling, which were never switched off, contributing further to the lack of sleep. Moreover, the air in these overcrowded basement cells could be supplied only though the ventilation system, which was often out of order.', ""28. The applicant's cell was infested with cockroaches and ants, and no attempt was made to exterminate them. The inmates in the Sevastopol ITT cells were furthermore exposed to infectious diseases like tuberculosis, which the applicant contracted whilst being detained there."", '29. The applicant further claimed that the food supplied in the Sevastopol ITT was meagre and of poor quality and was supplemented with food sent by his mother.', ""30. The Government submitted that whilst in the Sevastopol ITT the applicant shared cells measuring 16 square metres with 4-6 other detainees. The Government maintained that the cells were equipped with wooden planking, ventilation, water supply and sewerage systems. The applicant was provided with hot meals three times a day and the opportunity to wash at least once a week. There were windows, which allowed daylight and fresh air in. In general, the conditions of the applicant's detention corresponded to the relevant hygiene and sanitation standards."", '31. As indicated above, the applicant was transported to and from the Sevastopol ITT each month.', '32. The distance between Sevastopol and Simferopol is about 80 kilometres. The transportation (етап) started at 8 a.m. and, according to the Government, ended at 4 p.m. on the same day. The applicant submitted that it usually took 36-48 hours for him to reach the destination. The applicant was informed beforehand about the journey, and, according to the Government, fed before it started. The applicant submitted that not once was he provided with breakfast before the transportation.', ""33. The applicant and the other inmates were transported in police vans to and from the railway stations. These journeys usually lasted 30 minutes. The Government indicated that the vans' design capacity of 20-21 persons was never exceeded. The applicant argued that normally the vans carried as many as 30 persons in a stuffy and dimly lit compartment of 6 square metres."", ""34. When in a train the applicant was held in carriages of special design with a capacity of 104 persons. According to the Government, the number of persons in a carriage never exceeded 70. The applicant alleged that it was always more than 100. According to the applicant's account, during this part of the journey he was not provided with food or water."", ""35. The applicant's health started to deteriorate in mid-2005. However, as confirmed in the above-mentioned letter of 10 May 2005 by the Head of the Sevastopol City Police Department, the Sevastopol ITT staff did not include a doctor and the “acting paramedic” (виконуючий обов'язки фельдшера) was not medically trained or qualified. As a result, the applicant received no medical assistance from the Sevastopol ITT."", ""36. According to a letter of 25 April 2006 by the Governor of the Simferopol SIZO, the applicant had undergone treatment for bronchitis in the medical unit of the Simferopol SIZO between 14 and 27 February 2006. Two Xray examinations carried out on 1 and 10 February 2006 did not reveal any pathological changes in his heart or lungs. This letter further stated that on 14 February 2006 the applicant's blood was tested for HIV antibodies. On 21 February 2006 the Crimean anti-Aids Healthcare Centre diagnosed the applicant as HIV positive. The applicant alleged that neither he nor his mother had been informed of this diagnosis."", '37. On 8 April 2006, while he was in the Sevastopol ITT, an ambulance was called for the applicant. The doctor found the applicant to be suffering from “fever of unknown origin” and administered him a dose of a painkiller, which had a short-term effect. According to the applicant the ambulance doctor stated that the applicant required an examination in a specialist hospital.', '38. On 12 April 2006 the applicant complained about further deterioration of his health. An ambulance was called, whose doctor found the applicant to be suffering from an “acute respiratory virus infection”.', '39. On 14 April 2006 the applicant was taken to the Infectious Diseases Hospital. According to the applicant, during this examination he was diagnosed as suffering from tuberculosis of the lymph nodes and hospitalisation was recommended, which was refused by the administration of the Sevastopol ITT, because it could not afford to detach four officers to guard him in a hospital. The Government stated that the doctors did not find it necessary to hospitalise the applicant, but that they took samples of his blood for HIV testing and prescribed him vitamins.', '40. On 20 April 2006 the applicant was taken to the Infectious Diseases Hospital for further examinations. He was diagnosed as suffering from tuberculosis and prescribed anti-tuberculosis treatment. The Government submitted that on that occasion the doctors did not recommend his hospitalisation either. The Government further stated that during this examination it was established for the first time that the applicant was HIV positive. The applicant alleged that it was the first time he had been informed about this condition; whereas the prison authorities had been aware of it long before this date.', ""41. In a letter of 21 April 2006 the head doctor the Infectious Diseases Hospital informed the applicant's mother that a commission of doctors from this hospital diagnosed the applicant as being HIV positive and suffering from tuberculosis and recommended his urgent hospitalisation."", ""42. On that same date the applicant's mother lodged a complaint with the Prosecutor-General, stating that the administration of the Sevastopol ITT had unlawfully refused to hospitalise her son, whose health condition was extremely grave. She stated in particular that since the beginning of April 2006 the applicant's body temperature had remained at around 40 C0, and that he could hardly eat or move without help. The outcome of this complaint is unknown."", ""43. On 28 April 2006, pursuant to the Court's request made under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, the applicant was transferred to the Sevastopol AntiTuberculosis Healthcare Centre (Севастопольський протитуберкульозний диспансер)."", '44. According to a letter from the head doctor of the Infectious Diseases Hospital dated 28 August 2006 the applicant was registered at the Sevastopol Anti-Aids Centre as an HIV patient in May 2006 and received the appropriate treatment.', '45. The relevant provisions of the Constitution of Ukraine and the PreTrial Detention Act can be found in the judgment of 12 October 2006 in the case of Dvoynykh v. Ukraine (no. 72277/01, §§ 28-31, 33-35 and 37).', '46. Article 236-1 of the Code provides:', '“Within seven days of notification, a decision of the body of inquiry, investigator or a prosecutor not to institute criminal proceedings can be appealed against by an interested party or their representative to the district (town) court within whose area of jurisdiction the authority which took the decision falls...”', '47. Article 236-2 of the Code, in so far as relevant, provides:', '“An appeal against the decision of the body of inquiry, investigator or prosecutor not to institute criminal proceedings shall be examined [by a court] in a single-judge formation within ten days of being lodged.', 'The judge shall request the materials, on the basis of which the decision not to institute criminal proceedings was made, examines them, and informs the prosecutor and the appellant of the date on which the hearing of the appeal is listed.', 'Having examined the case, the judge ... may take one of the following decisions:', '1) to set aside the decision not to institute criminal proceedings and to remit the case for further preliminary inquiries...', '2) to dismiss the complaint ...”', '48. Section 17 of the Act provides that persons suffering from tuberculosis detained in pre-trial detention centres (SIZOs) receive appropriate treatment in the medical units of these detention centres. Prisoners detained in penitentiary establishments should be treated in specialist prison hospitals.', '49. Paragraph 2.1 of the Decree provides that persons detained with HIV/Aids should be provided with obligatory outpatient monitoring, treatment for opportunistic infections (infections that can affect people with a weak immune system) and antiretroviral treatment.', '50. In accordance with paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2.1 of this Decree, antiretroviral treatment should be prescribed by the prison infectious disease doctors who have undergone the relevant training or by doctors from local anti-Aids establishments. The antiretroviral monitoring of the persons detained in pre-trial detention centres is being carried out by the local anti-Aids establishments.', '51. Paragraph 3.5 of the Decree provides that immediately upon the admission of a person with HIV/Aids to a pre-trial detention centre, the head of the medical unit of that facility should provide him or her with antiretroviral drugs from the local antiAids establishment.', '52. In accordance with paragraph 3.6 of the Decree, when a person with HIV/Aids is being transferred from one penitentiary establishment to another it should be ensured that the relevant medical documents accompany him or her to the new establishment.', '53. This Report states the following:', '“It should be acknowledged that the police authorities do not follow the demands of [the CPT] expressed during their visit in October last year in respect of immediate cessation of the unlawful and long-term holding of arrested and detained persons in police custody ...', 'In the majority of the ITTs the rights of the detainees are not respected. ... The requirements of the Combating Tuberculosis Act in respect of the obligation of the authorities to provide detainees suffering from tuberculosis with treatment in specialist medical establishments are not being met. Many people suffering from this disease are being held in ITTs for long periods without any medical assistance. In total, of 2,434 persons suffering from tuberculosis held in the ITT only 719 were treated in the specialist establishments of the Ministry of Health. This not only violates the rights of the detainees, but also contributes to the further dissemination of this disease.', 'The conditions under which arrested and detained persons in the ITTs of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea are held... may be equated to inhuman or degrading treatment. Detainees are being held in basements or in premises where there are not even the most basic conditions for long-term occupation.', 'Police officers systematically infringe the law in respect of the maximum ten-day detention of arrested, detained and convicted persons in ITTs. In the Sevastopol ITT, in breach of the law, there were 85 persons who had been held more than ten days, 28 who had been held for more than three months, eleven for more than six months and five for more than a year, including seventeen convicted persons.', '54. The relevant extract from the report reads as follows:', ""Under Section 4 of the Pre-trial Detention Act and Article 155 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, persons remanded in custody should be held in the centres for pre-trial detention [SIZOs]. Only in exceptional cases should these persons be held in establishments such as the Ministry of the Interior's Temporary Detention Centres. It is also to be noted that the law clearly defines the time-limits for holding persons in the ITTs, that is three days, and in cases where the ITT is situated far from the relevant SIZO or there are no suitable roads available, ten days. In breach of the above laws, the governors of many SIZOs unreasonably refuse to admit detainees transferred from the ITTs. This attitude on the part of governors of SIZOs has led to inhuman, dreadful and unbearable conditions of detention in the ITTs and their overcrowding (almost twice their capacity) in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, ... and the cities of ... Sevastopol. In particular, in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea an inmate is admitted to the Simferopol SIZO only in exchange for one inmate being transferred to the ITT."", ""55. The relevant extracts from section XV of the report “The observance of prisoners' rights in Ukraine” read as follows:"", '“...The Ministry of Internal Affairs is in charge of 501 temporary holding facilities (ITT – izolyator tymchasovoho trymannya), where they may be held for a maximum of 3 days (10 days in exceptional circumstances) before being moved to a pre-trial detention centre (SIZO – an acronym for slidchy izolyator). However there are instances when this time period is exceeded. Each day in Ukraine around 7,000 people who have been detained are held in ITT, with a capacity for 10,400 places. According to information from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 127 ITT are in need of repair.', 'The greatest number of cases involving ill-treatment while in custody occur specifically during the time that individuals detained are held in police institutions. The conditions in such institutions are, furthermore, excessively harsh. This is connected to a large degree with poor financing, however, funding has recently been allocated to provide for detainees held in ITT. “Donetsk Memorial” sent formal requests for information to ten regional departments of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) with questions about the conditions in which prisoners were held in ITT. Information from the responses received is presented in Table 1: “Conditions in which prisoners are held in temporary holding facilities”.', 'According to figures from the departments, in 2004-2005 from 16 to 70 UH was allocated for each individual while being held in an ITT...', '...One of the problems with police custody is the fact that detained individuals suffering from tuberculosis cannot be sent to SIZO. As noted in the Council of Europe (Monitoring Committee Report, on the basis of a number of normative legal acts of the State Department for the Execution of Sentences, individuals suffering from infectious diseases (including tuberculosis) cannot be transferred to pre-trial detention centres (SIZO) from the temporary holding facilities (ITT) under the competence of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. According to some reports, 739 arrested people were not admitted to SIZO during 2004. TB-infected people were thus held in detention in the ITT, which are not fit for holding such persons, beyond the legally established maximum term of arrest (3 or 10 days). This not only violates the rights of the arrested but also promotes the spread of diseases in the ITT. According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, more than 1,000 people are held daily in ITT after the maximum time-limit established by law, including 100 people ill with TB. The situation has not improved even after an Instruction (No. 419-p of 5 July 2004) was issued by the Cabinet of Ministers whereby the State Department for the Execution of Sentences was ordered to ensure admission of those arrested who are ill with TB. According to the comments of the Ukrainian authorities, there are plans to solve this problem by delegating the treatment of persons in detention on remand to special establishments of the Ministry of Health which will be guarded by Ministry of Internal Affairs units. This requires changes to the relevant legislation...', '...One of the activities of the Human Rights Ombudsperson is the overseeing the conditions in which individuals detained by the police are being held.', ""A check made by the Human Rights Ombudsperson in June 2005 of a temporary holding facility (ITT) in the city of Feodosia found that the cells were still without windows. Many ITT have semi-basement dark concrete cells, without fresh air, drinking water, or plumbing, posing a risk to people's health and reminiscent of the middle ages. They furthermore constantly hold one and a half or even twice as many people as they have capacity for, and it is possible to breathe there only through forced ventilation."", 'The Human Rights Ombudsperson found that the rights of citizens regarding three-hour detention in holding rooms were infringed, and that in half of the 808 district police departments people detained were not given anything to eat, despite several submissions from the Human Rights Ombudsperson, on the basis of which State Deputies and the Government allocated funding. Such conditions are also a form of torture, yet due to the continuing large numbers of detentions and arrests, people are placed in the rooms set aside for those detained.

The visit of the CPT delegation to Ukraine took place from 10 to 26 September 2000, in the course of which the delegation inspected six centres for temporary detention (police-run detention facilities designated for a short stay of detained suspects), including the Sevastopol ITT.', '57. The relevant parts of the CPT report read as follows:', '“50. The majority of ITTs visited were overcrowded. For example, in Sebastopol ITT, up to 10 persons were being held in cells of 15 m² and in several cells there were more persons than beds.', '51. In all the ITTs visited, access to natural light was obstructed by dense metal netting on the windows or jalousies and the artificial lighting was, in general, insufficient. Reading of any kind was a strain on the eyes. The ventilation was inadequate and the air in the cells visited heavy. The lack of ventilation was exacerbated by the fact that the cells tended to be fetid, detainees being provided with neither products for cleaning their cells nor the possibility of washing themselves other than in a basin of cold water..... Further, the sanitary facilities in nearly all the ITTs visited left something to be desired. A notable exception was Simferopol ITT, where the delegation noted the cells were clean and the detainees possessed basic hygiene products.', 'In several ITTs there was an insufficient quantity of mattresses and blankets for all the detainees, while the cleanliness of those available was questionable. Further, with one or two exceptions, the ITTs visited did not possess outdoor exercise facilities. Nor was there any provision for activities; in many ITTs, detainees were not even permitted newspapers.', '52. In most ITTs, the single daily meal was supplemented by food parcels from relatives. Those without relatives shared the food of others. Given the fact that the Militia are unable financially to provide sufficient food to detainees, food parcels should not be subject to undue restrictions.', '53. In the light of the unacceptable conditions referred to above, the CPT was all the more concerned to learn that a significant number of detainees were being held in ITTs for periods much longer than the 10 day legal limit.', '...', ""55. Health-care issues have been a matter of concern to the CPT since its first visit; no improvements were observed during the 2000 visit. To begin with, the CPT's delegation noted that in several ITTs (Bakchisaray, Lytne) there was no feldsher at all to maintain the health-care service. Further, the CPT must insist on the importance of all detainees receiving a thorough medical examination upon being admitted to an ITT; this is still not the norm at present. Further, the feldsher should take a proactive stance in dealing with health-care issues arising within an ITT; the cramped living space under which detainees are held and the lack of general hygiene constitute an environment conducive to the spread of diseases, in particular tuberculosis.”"", '58. In its Report to the Ukrainian Government on the visit to Ukraine carried out from 24 November to 6 December 2002 the CPT stated as follows (original emphasise):', '“11. The legal framework governing deprivation of liberty by the Militia has already been described in previous CPT visit reports. The Militia, it will be recalled, can, on its own authority, hold a person suspected of a criminal offence for up to 72 hours.', 'However, by law of 21 July 2001, the Code of Criminal Procedure was brought into line with the Ukrainian Constitution. Now, within 72 hours of detention, the investigating bodies are required, if they wish to have a suspect remanded in custody, to bring the suspect before a judge (Articles 106 and 165-2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). The judge can order that the suspect be remanded in custody for up to 15 days, and thereafter grant extensions for a maximum total period of 18 months.', 'A person remanded in custody is in principle transferred to a pre-trial prison (SIZO). The person may nevertheless be detained in an ITT for a maximum period of up to 10 days if the transfer to the SIZO cannot be effected owing to the distance or the absence of appropriate means of communication.', '12. In their reply to the report on the 2001 visit (document CPT/Inf (2002) 24), the Ukrainian authorities claimed that, thanks to the intervention of judges, overcrowding in police establishments had been substantially reduced. Unfortunately, the visit carried out at the end of 2002 demonstrated the contrary. With the sole exception of the Kyiv ITT, all the other establishments of this kind were overcrowded. It emerged that, in the various regions visited, the judges favoured an approach whereby suspects were remanded in custody, as was generally requested by the investigating bodies and prosecutors.', 'The CPT recommends that the Ukrainian authorities raise the awareness of the investigating bodies and prosecutors/judges of the new legislation and encourage them to make extensive use of their power to apply non-custodial preventive measures to persons suspected of a criminal offence (cf. also paragraph 85 below).', ""13. Moreover, in 2002, in examining the relevant records, the CPT's delegation again found cases of remand prisoners being held in ITTs for considerably longer than the 10 days permitted (for example, up to 48 days at the ITT of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the District Directorate of Khust).”"", '59. The relevant extracts from the Report of the CPT on a visit to Ukraine from 8 to 24 February 1998 read as follows (original emphasise):', '“189. During its visit to the Kyiv SIZO of the Security Service of Ukraine, the delegation also had the opportunity to examine a prison van. This vehicle contained three compartments with benches. The artificial lighting was very poor and the ventilation was non-existent. In addition, one of the compartments was extremely small (0.50m²). According to the staff in charge of the vehicle, this type of van was used only for short journeys within the city. However, the delegation heard allegations from prisoners that vehicles of this kind were sometimes used for longer journeys.', 'The CPT would like to receive a copy of any regulations which might exist concerning the characteristics of vehicles used for transporting prisoners. In addition, it recommends that the Ukrainian authorities check the lighting and ventilation in prison vans, and cease placing prisoners in compartments as small as 0.50m².”', '60. The 2000 Report also contains the findings of the CPT concerning the conditions in which detainees were being transferred from one place of detention to another (original emphasise):', '“129. Concerning road transport of prisoners, the delegation inspected two Internal Affairs Ministry vans in Simferopol SIZO. Each vehicle had collective compartments and an individual compartment. The individual compartments were as small as 0.5 m²; in paragraph 189 of the report on its 1998 visit, the CPT has already recommended that the practice of placing prisoners in compartments of this size cease. Conditions in the vehicle were also similar in other respects to those described in the aforementioned paragraph of the report on the 1998 visit (poor artificial lighting, inadequate ventilation).', '130. Concerning rail transport, the delegation examined the facilities in one of the special carriages used for transporting prisoners. It had compartments measuring 2 and 3.5 m², with folding benches. The authorised capacity in the smaller compartments was six persons for journeys lasting not more than four hours, and four persons for longer journeys. In the larger 3.5 m² compartments, up to sixteen persons could be accommodated for short distances and twelve for long distances. The compartments had some access to natural light; however, ventilation was poor. The toilets for prisoners were in a disgusting state, clogged with excrement, despite the fact that prisoners were due to board a few minutes later for a long journey.', 'There were no arrangements to provide prisoners with food, even over long distances; as for drinking water, only a small container was provided to supply the prisoners throughout the journey.', '131. The manner in which prisoners are transported, particularly by train, is unacceptable, having regard, inter alia, to the material conditions and possible duration of travel.', ""The CPT recommends that conditions of prisoners' transport in Ukraine be reviewed in the light of the foregoing remarks. As an immediate measure, it recommends that the Ukrainian authorities take steps to:"", '- significantly reduce the maximum number of prisoners per compartment in a railway carriage: 3.5 m² compartments should never contain more than six persons, and 2 m² compartments never more than three persons;', '- ensure that during rail transport, prisoners are supplied with drinking water and that for long journeys, the necessary arrangements are made for them to be properly fed;', '- no longer use 0.5 m² compartments in vans for transporting prisoners.”', '61. In its Report to the Ukrainian Government on the visit to Ukraine carried out from 24 November to 6 December 2002 the CPT stated as follows (original emphasise):', '“142. In its report on the 2000 visit (paragraph 131), the CPT made a number of recommendations concerning the transport of prisoners by road and rail. The matter was raised again in 2002 with the Ukrainian authorities, who stated that a working group had been set up to transfer responsibility for escorting prisoners from the Ministry of Internal Affairs to the Department for the Execution of Sentences. In the light of the critical findings again made by the delegation which carried out the 2002 visit, concerning transport vans, the CPT recommends that the Ukrainian authorities give a high priority to resolving the issue of the conditions under which prisoners are transported, with due regard to the recommendations in paragraph 131 of its report on the 2000 visit.”', '62. As regards the situation in the Sevastopol ITT, AI stated in a briefing on Ukraine for the United Nations Committee against Torture that took place on 30 April 2007:', '“According to the World Health Organization, Ukraine has an estimated tuberculosis (TB) case rate of 95 cases per year per 100,000 people which is the eighth highest in Europe and Eurasia. In a country with a very high rate of TB, overcrowding and poor conditions in pre-trial detention have led to a high rate of infection among detainees. In January 2006 the Sevastopol Human Rights Group reported to Amnesty International that there were 3040 TB infected detainees in the Sevastopol ITT in the Crimea. These people are detained for the full period of their pre-trial detention in the ITT, in violation of the Criminal Procedural Code, because of a long-standing practice that the nearest SIZO in Simferopol will not accept detainees infected with TB. In January 2006, 20 TB infected detainees were held in a cell designed for six people. They are provided with drugs, but reportedly they do not receive special food or the vitamins needed to counteract the effects of the drugs.”', ""63. In a report “Europe and Central Asia. Summary of Amnesty International's Concerns in the Region. JanuaryJune 2004” AI stated the following:"", '“At a meeting with AI delegates in June the National Human Rights Ombudsperson Nina Karpacheva stated that torture was still widespread. The main problems were lack of immediate access to a lawyer and conditions in pre-trial detention centres (SIZO) and temporary holding facilities (ІТТ). The problem was aggravated by a very high number of arrests and a failure to use alternative methods such as bonds and bail. Nina Karpacheva also stated that conditions in the Sevastopol ITT were particularly poor and have led to a very high rate of infection with tuberculosis (TB) among the detainees. Cells are overcrowded and detainees are forced to share bunks or sleep in shifts, food is inadequate and until January 2004 when Nina Karpacheva discovered a possible site for an exercise yard, there was no possibility to take exercise.', 'The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment has repeatedly expressed concern about the spread of TB in prisons and places of detention in Ukraine, and in their report on conditions in 2000 expressed concern that no improvements could be observed. Andrey Ovsiannikov was arrested in June 2003 on suspicion of drug dealing and held in the Sevastopol ITT. He was not ill with TB at the time, but by September had been diagnosed with TB. He was not informed and found out only by chance in November when his health worsened. He did not receive any treatment until March when through the efforts of his family and the Sevastopol Human Rights Group he was hospitalized and received treatment. On 30 June he was returned to the ITT. AI is concerned that he has been held since June 2003 in pre-trial detention in the ITT when domestic law stipulates that detainees may be held in such facilities for a maximum of 72 hours, and that conditions in the Sevastopol ITT constituted cruel and inhuman treatment.”', '64. Relevant international reports and other materials concerning the treatment of tuberculosis in Ukrainian penitentiary establishments can be found in the judgment of 28 March 2006 in the case of Melnik v. Ukraine, (no. 72286/01, §§ 47-53).']","['13', '3']",[],[],[],[],[]

The applicant was born in 1978. She lived in the village of Solnechnoye in the Khasavyurt district of Dagestan, Russian Federation. Currently she lives abroad after seeking asylum. The applicant is the mother of Summaya (also spelled Sumaya) Abdurashidova, born in 1998.', ""6. At about 5.30 a.m. on 14 March 2005 approximately fifty men in two APCs (armoured personnel carriers) and a white VAZ 2121 Niva car with the registration plate 008 26 arrived at the applicant's house in Solnechnoye."", ""7. The men were armed and equipped with portable radio sets. They neither introduced themselves nor produced any documents. The applicant thought that they were State servicemen. It appears that the servicemen arrived to apprehend the applicant's husband and two men who were staying in the house that night. The men broke into the applicant's house and opened gunfire. The applicant's husband shouted to the servicemen: “Do not shoot! There are children in the house.” In spite of the warning the servicemen continued shooting. They took the applicant's husband outside; the applicant's three children remained in their rooms and the applicant was in the corridor."", ""8. During the shooting the applicant's two sons Bilal (born in 1997) and Ilyas (born in 2002) ran out from their bedrooms into the corridor. At some point Bilal ran out of his sister's bedroom, screaming that Summaya had been wounded and was bleeding. It appears that Summaya Abdurashidova had been hit by a fragment of a rifle grenade."", ""9. The applicant tried to go into her daughter's room, but the servicemen pushed her outside the house into the yard. When the applicant asked them to let her go inside, the servicemen forbade her under gun point. She was made to lie down on the ground with her hands behind her head."", '10. When the shooting was over, their neighbour Mr I.I. went into the house and carried out the body of Summaya Abdurashidova.', ""11. As a result of the shooting the two men who were staying in the applicant's house were killed, and the applicant's husband was taken to the Department of the Interior of the Khasavyurt district (“the Khasavyurt ROVD”)."", ""12. After the shooting the applicant saw that her house, as well as her family possessions in it, had been damaged by the gunfire. In addition, the family's identity documents, including passports and birth certificates, had been taken away by the servicemen."", ""13. The applicant submitted that after the shooting, the servicemen had taken away two plastic bags with the applicant's family documents and valuables, including the applicant's golden bracelet and two rings."", ""14. The applicant's description of the events of 14 March 2005 is based on several undated accounts provided by her to her representatives and on the letters which the applicant sent to the authorities. The applicant also submitted articles published in the newspaper “Druzhba” (Дружба) on 8 April 2005 and on 15 April 2005 and an article published in the newspaper “Niyso-Dagestan” (Нийсо-Дагестан) on 14 April 2005."", ""15. The Government submitted, with reference to the documents from the criminal investigation file (see below), that the two men who had been at the applicant's house on the night of 14 March 2005 had been suspected of the armed robbery of a woman and of an attack on a serviceman of the traffic police, Mr M.M., who had later died. The crimes had been committed by three persons on 31 December 2004, and on 1 January 2005 the Khasavyurt district prosecutor's office (the district prosecutor's office) opened a criminal investigation into the incident. The investigation was assigned file number 5111. It has been established that during the attack the criminals took hold of M.M.'s police identity document and his PM service pistol with a known serial number."", ""16. The police obtained information that two suspects, Mr S.Ya. and Mr R.Yu., had found refuge at the applicant's house and that they had stored weapons and armaments there, including the PM pistol. On 14 March 2005 the investigator of the district prosecutor's office decided to carry out an urgent search at the applicant's house with the aim of finding the two suspects and the weapons. Since the suspects could have been armed, the prosecutor had been assisted by servicemen of the Khasavyurt ROVD and of the special police force of Dagestan."", ""17. Upon arrival at the applicant's house, police officers Mr P.A. and Mr S.O. informed the applicant and her husband about the aim of their visit and suggested that they evacuate the building for their own safety. The applicant, her husband and their two sons Bilal and Ilyas came out of the house. Then the applicant informed the policemen that her daughter Summaya had remained in the house. Mr P.A. and Mr S.O. returned to the house in order to take the child out, but Mr S.Ya. and Mr R.Yu., who had taken refuge in the house, threw hand grenades at them. Both policemen were injured. Their colleagues, in order to cover them, opened gunfire and killed both suspects."", ""18. After the skirmish was over, the site was inspected by the investigator of the district prosecutor's office and by forensic and medical experts, in the presence of two attesting witnesses. They discovered the bodies of Mr S.Ya. and Mr R.Yu. and of the applicant's daughter, Summaya Abdurashidova. In the room where the two fugitives had been hiding, they also found safety pins from hand grenades and a PM hand pistol with the serial number corresponding to the one stolen from M.M."", '19. Shortly after the shooting had ended, experts from the Khasavyurt ROVD took pictures of Summaya Abdurashidova and wanted to take her body to the morgue for an autopsy. The applicant and her relatives refused to give their permission and wrote down an official statement of refusal.', ""20. From the beginning of her correspondence with the authorities the applicant was assisted by Mr B., head of the local human rights organisation Romashka (Ромашка). The applicant and Mr B. contacted various official bodies, including the Russian President, the Dagestan Government, the Khasavyurt district administration, the mass media and prosecutors' offices at different levels, describing the circumstances of Summaya Abdurashidova's killing and requesting an investigation into the crime. The applicant retained copies of a number of their letters and submitted them to the Court. The relevant information is summarised below."", ""21. On 16 March 2005 the applicant wrote to a number of the State authorities, including the district prosecutor's office, the Dagestan prosecutor's office and the Prosecutor General. She described the events of 14 March 2005 and requested an investigation into the death of her daughter and prosecution of the culprits. The applicant also complained that her property had been unlawfully destroyed during the special operation and requested compensation for the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage caused by the actions of the servicemen."", ""22. In March or April 2005 the applicant informed the Dagestan prosecutor's office that servicemen of the Khasavyurt ROVD had participated in the special operation on 14 March 2005."", ""23. On 20 April 2005 the Dagestan prosecutor's office informed the applicant that her complaint about unlawful actions of servicemen of the Khasavyurt ROVD during her husband's apprehension had been forwarded to the district prosecutor's office for examination."", '24. On 26 April 2005 the district State registry office (ЗАГС) issued a statement confirming the death of Summaya Abdurashidova on 14 March 2005.', '25. On 26 April 2005 the Solnechnoye village administration issued a death certificate for Summaya Abdurashidova.', ""26. On 28 April 2005 the applicant again wrote to the authorities, including the district prosecutor's office, the Dagestan prosecutor's office and the Prosecutor General. In her letter she pointed out that on 16 March 2005 she had already complained about her daughter's killing, but the authorities had failed to initiate a criminal investigation into the death. She requested explanations concerning the reasons for the failure to initiate the investigation and to prosecute the perpetrators."", ""27. On 17 May and 30 June 2005 the Dagestan prosecutor's office informed the applicant that her complaint about the death of Summaya Abdurashidova had been forwarded to the district prosecutor's office for examination."", ""28. On 25 May 2005 the Khasavyurt District Court sentenced the applicant's husband to three months' imprisonment for harbouring two criminals. In its judgment the court stated, inter alia, that his “minor daughter Summaya had been killed in the course of a special operation aimed at apprehending the criminals who had been hiding in the house”. The applicant's husband accepted his guilt and did not appeal against the sentence."", '29. It appears that Mr B., who had assisted the applicant in the preparation of her complaints to the domestic authorities, was arrested in November 2005 on suspicion of illegal possession of weapons. Following allegations of torture and ensuing public pressure, he was released and acquitted. He left Russia in 2006 and sought asylum in another country.', ""30. On 15 March 2005 a commission of the administration of Solnechnoye, including the head of the administration, the chief accountant and the applicant's two neighbours, visited the applicant's house. They examined the scene and drew up the following report on damage:"", '“During the special operation on 14 March 2005 the house ... was practically destroyed; as a result of gunfire and explosions the windows and doors were blown out, the roof was damaged by shots, a powerful blast resulted in cracks in the walls and in the ceiling; the furniture in the living room and in the kitchen, the refrigerator and the TV set were rendered unusable.”', ""According to the report, the applicant's house was uninhabitable and required major repairs. The report further estimated the cost of repairs at between 650,000 and 800,000 Russian roubles (RUB), without specifying additional details."", '31. In response to a specific request from the Court, the Government submitted 26 pages of documents from the criminal investigation files mentioned above. Although this was not marked on many documents, it appears that the Government submitted copies of the decisions to open the criminal proceedings in the cases assigned file numbers 5111, 51151 and 51153.', ""32. The Government submitted that on 14 March 2005 the district prosecutor's office had opened criminal investigation no. 51151 into the attack on the police officers and the unlawful purchase and storage of arms and ammunition. The investigation was opened in view of the wounding of two policemen, Mr P.A. and Mr S.O. The decision did not mention the suspects' and the applicant's daughter's deaths. The investigation obtained information that Mr S.Ya. and Mr R.Yu. had been involved with illegal armed groups and had fought against the authorities in Chechnya. Thus, on 14 March 2005, the district prosecutor's office opened a new investigation file concerning participation in illegal armed groups, which was assigned number 51153."", ""33. On 14 March 2005 the investigator of the district prosecutor's office, assisted by medical and forensic experts, in the presence of two witnesses, examined the body of Summaya Abdurashidova. They noted two large open wounds: one measuring 10 cm by 8 cm to the head and one measuring 10 cm by 6 cm to the upper part of the torso. The Government submitted a copy of the expert report. The experts also took photographs; however, as follows from subsequent documents and the Government's submissions, the photographs could not be developed because the film was defective."", ""34. On 21 March 2005 criminal investigation files nos. 51151 and 51153 were joined and assigned number 51151. The decision did not refer to the death of the applicant's daughter or to the deaths of the suspects."", ""35. No separate criminal investigation was opened into the applicant's daughter's death. The Government submitted that in the course of the investigation of file no. 51151 the authorities had established that Summaya Abdurashidova had died of splinter wounds caused by hand-grenade explosions. The police officers had not used grenades and had only employed hand guns. The forensic reports on the bodies of Mr S.Ya. and Mr R.Yu. concluded that they had died as a result of bullet wounds. Seeing that no autopsy had been carried out on the body of Summaya Abdurshidova owing to her relatives' refusal to submit it for such an examination, the investigation relied on the description of her body, which referred to splinter wounds. It concluded that her death had resulted from the explosion of hand grenades thrown by the suspected criminals."", '36. On 2 April 2005 the criminal proceedings against Mr S.Ya. and Mr R.Yu. were terminated on account of their deaths. The investigation of criminal case no. 5111 continued.', ""37. On 26 April 2005 the district prosecutor's office took statements from two investigators, medical and forensic experts who had examined the child's body and two attesting witnesses. The Government submitted copies of their testimonies, except for the medical expert's statement and one witness's statement. The forensic expert explained that he had taken photographs of the house, of two male bodies in the courtyard and of the girl's body in the neighbouring house. Once the film was developed, some photographs were spoiled because the film was defective. Thus, no photographs of the girl's body came out."", ""38. According to the Government, the medical expert stated that he had examined the girl's body in the neighbouring house and noted two large open wounds to the head and upper part of the torso. These wounds could have been caused by splinters from an explosive device. The body had then been transferred to the relatives, who had refused to submit it for an autopsy."", ""39. The investigator submitted that late at night on 14 March 2005 he had been alerted that the suspects in the murder of Inspector M.M. were hiding in the house of the imam of Solnechnoye. Early in the morning he went to the scene, accompanied by servicemen of the Khasavyurt ROVD and of the special police unit of Dagestan. They also invited two witnesses residing in Khasavyurt, Timur E. and Murat. Once at the house, the servicemen surrounded the house. After that the police ordered everyone to leave the house. A woman, a man and two children came out into the entry hall and the police led them outside the house. The woman said that another child remained in the house. Two servicemen of the special police unit entered the house and immediately afterwards there came the sound of explosions. Several policemen ran to the house and started to shoot in order to cover up their colleagues. The persons taking refuge in the house fired back and threw hand grenades, some of which exploded outside the house, and some inside the house. As soon as the two policemen were led out of the building, other servicemen shot at the doors and windows of the house with machine guns and automatic rifles. When the shooting from inside the house subsided, the policemen went in and brought out two male bodies. They said that there was a child's body in the house. A neighbour walked in and carried the body to the nearby house. Then the body was examined by the officials from the prosecutor's office, in the presence of two witnesses. They noted two large open splinter wounds – one to the front of the head and another near the shoulder blade. The investigator added that the police had not used hand grenades; they had fired from machine guns and automatic rifles. The investigator also answered a number of questions concerning the missing property and identity documents and the damage caused to the applicant's house. He stated that they had collected and seized two yellow rings and the applicant's passport. No other documents or valuables had been found or seized. As to the state of the house, the investigator specified that the window glazing, furniture and parts of the roof had been damaged. The walls had not been damaged. Some parts of the house were in any event unfinished and were not inhabitable. The state of the house could be ascertained from the photographs taken immediately after the attack."", ""40. Another investigator, a member of the team working on M.M.'s murder, stated that he had arrived at the applicant's house at about 9 a.m. on 14 March 2005. There he was instructed to examine the child's body, together with the criminal and forensic experts. They noted two large wounds, caused by splinters from an explosive device. The mother of the child refused to submit the body for an autopsy and signed a document to that effect. After the body was examined, the relatives took it for burial. The criminal expert later informed the investigator that the film had been defective and no photographs could be developed."", ""41. The witness Marat G. stated that he and his friend Timur E. had been doing their morning jogging when the police asked them to be witnesses to a search in Solnechnoye. When the two men arrived at the house, it was surrounded by police. They saw a man, a woman and two children come out, accompanied by servicemen. The woman said that another child remained in the house. Two police officers went in and there followed several explosions. Then several more policemen ran to the house and the witnesses were taken away to a safe distance, from where they could not see the house. They could hear shots being fired and explosions. Once the shooting was over, the witnesses were invited by the investigator to be present during the search. In front of the house there were two male bodies. Someone brought out a child's body, which was taken to the neighbouring house. The investigator found and seized two yellow rings and a woman's passport. The investigator also noted and seized a number of safety pins from hand grenades and empty cartridges, as well as a hand pistol. The rooms were first inspected by a bomb expert and then by the investigators and witnesses. The house was partially damaged, but the load-bearing walls and the roof were intact. Some rooms were unfinished. The Government submitted a copy of Marat G.'s testimony and stated that Timur E. had made similar statements."", ""42. In their observations the Government extensively cited an undated statement by Mr A.A., the head of the criminal investigation department of the Khasavyurt ROVD, no copy of which has been submitted. According to the Government, Mr A.A. stated that the department had been tipped off about the location of the suspects in M.M.'s murder. Early in the morning on 14 March 2005 he had arrived at the applicant's house, accompanied by servicemen of the special police force. The servicemen surrounded the house. One serviceman of the special police force walked up to the house and knocked on the door. He was let inside. About one minute later he came out of the house, together with a man, a woman and two children. The woman said that a third child remained in the house. She wanted to return to the house, but was not allowed to. Two servicemen of the special police force went to the house in order to retrieve the child. As soon as they had gone in, there came the sounds of explosions. Several more servicemen ran to the house to help their colleagues. They were shot at from inside the house and more grenades were thrown. The two wounded policemen were assisted in leaving the house, and the servicemen shot at the windows and doors of the house. The policemen were not equipped with grenades. When the shooting from inside the house subsided, several policemen went into the house. They found the bodies of two men and a girl. The male bodies were taken into the courtyard. A local resident took out the child's body and took it to the neighbouring house. Mr A.A. was told by his colleagues that the body had two large splinter wounds. An expert in explosives examined the house, following which an investigator conducted a search in the presence of two witnesses. Mr A.A. also stated that he had seen the seized pistol with the serial number corresponding to that taken from M.M. and a number of empty cartridges. The investigators put them in bags and sealed off the courtyard of the house."", ""43. The Government submitted a note dated 14 March 2005, in which Mrs Raisa Ya. stated that the family had refused to submit the body of Summaya Abdurashidova for an autopsy with the aim of establishing the cause of her death. The note stated that the family knew the cause of the child's death and that they wanted to proceed with the burial in accordance with religious rites."", ""44. The Government submitted an undated note signed by the applicant to the effect that she had received from the investigator of the district prosecutor's office two golden rings and her passport, which had been seized at her house on 14 March 2005."", ""45. The Government also submitted a number of letters sent by the district prosecutor's office to the applicant. On 4 April 2005 the investigator informed the applicant that the investigation had established that her daughter had died as a result of grenade explosions caused by S.Ya. and R.Yu. The criminal proceedings against the two men had been terminated on account of their deaths. Two rings had been returned to the applicant.

From the documents submitted it does not appear that the investigators attempted to take statements from the applicant, her husband or their neighbours.', '47. The Government stated that the investigation of criminal case file no. 5111 was in progress and that disclosure of other documents would be in violation of Article 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, since the files contained information of a military nature and personal data concerning the witnesses or other participants in the criminal proceedings.', ""48. On 14 June 2005 the applicant complained to the Khasavyurt District Court of Dagestan (“the district court”) about the destruction of her property during the special operation conducted on 14 March 2005 and the failure of the authorities to initiate criminal proceedings into the death of Summaya Abdurashidova. She sought a ruling obliging the district prosecutor's office to initiate an investigation into the crime and to prosecute the perpetrators."", ""49. On 2 August 2005 the district court refused to examine her complaint. It stated that the applicant was entitled to appeal against actions of the district prosecutor's office only within the course of an ongoing criminal investigation or that she could appeal against the authorities' refusal to initiate criminal proceedings. The court pointed out that she had failed to submit any evidence of an ongoing criminal investigation or of the authorities' refusal to initiate criminal proceedings."", '50. The applicant did not appeal against that decision.', '51. For a summary of the relevant domestic law see Akhmadova and Sadulayeva v.

The applicant was born in 1980 and lives in Yerevan.', '5. On 25 June 1998 the applicant was drafted into the army and assigned to military unit no. 33651, situated next to the border with Azerbaijan.', '6. On 3 December 1998 the applicant, together with five fellow servicemen, was placed on watch in position no. 24.', '7. On 4 December 1998 one of the six watchmen, serviceman H., was found dead in a nearby trench, having been killed by a machine-gun shot. At the time of the killing, only three of the remaining five watchmen were in the area of position no. 24, namely the applicant and servicemen T. and A. The latter two were apparently cutting wood together not far from the position. It appears that the applicant had been seen to have an argument with H. earlier that day.', '8. On 4 March 1999 servicemen T. and A. were brought to a military police station. On 5 March 1999 the applicant was also brought to the same police station. The military police officers started to beat them, seeking to force them to confess to serviceman H.’s murder. According to the applicant, they told the police officers that serviceman H. must have been shot from the other side of the border, to which the officers replied that it had already been established that serviceman H. had been killed at close range, and continued to beat them.', '9. The applicant was initially punched and kicked. The police officers then began to hit him with rubber clubs. The applicant lost consciousness on several occasions but was revived and continued to be beaten. After a while the police officers began to squeeze the applicant’s fingertips with pliers. The same torture techniques were applied to servicemen T. and A.', '10. On 5 March 1999 serviceman T. confessed to the investigator that he had witnessed how the applicant had taken his machine gun and shot H. Since serviceman A. was with serviceman T. at the time of the murder, he was coerced into making a statement to the effect that serviceman T. had told him that he had witnessed the murder.', '11. The police officers subsequently continued to torture the applicant, forcing him to confess to the murder. According to the applicant, this continued for over a month. He was unable to walk and talk properly, and all his fingertips were swollen.', '12. On 16 April 1999 the applicant was interrogated as a suspect by the investigator examining the case, to whom he confessed that he had accidentally shot serviceman H.', '13. On 17 April 1999 the applicant was formally charged with premeditated murder and questioned as an accused by the investigator; during this interview he repeated his confession. Thereafter he was taken to the crime scene, where he made the same statement in front of a video camera and the relevant record was drawn up. On the same date the applicant was placed in pre-trial detention.', '14. According to the applicant, immediately after their release from the police station on an unspecified date, servicemen T. and A. informed the Military Prosecutor of Armenia (ՀՀ զինվորական դատախազ) in writing that they had been coerced into slandering the applicant.', '15. On 19 June 1999 the applicant and servicemen T. and A. were subjected to medical examinations, during which various injuries to their fingers and A.’s head were noted.', '16. On 11 August 1999 a confrontation was held between the applicant and serviceman T., during which the latter confirmed his earlier testimony against the applicant.', '17. On an unspecified date, the applicant’s criminal case was brought before the Syunik Regional Court (Սյունիքի մարզի առաջին ատյանի դատարան).', '18. On 26 October 1999 a hearing was held during which serviceman T. confirmed his earlier testimony against the applicant.', '19. On 6 December 1999 the Syunik Regional Court found the applicant guilty of premeditated murder and sentenced him to thirteen years’ imprisonment.', '20. On 15 June 2000 the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal (ՀՀ քրեական և զինվորական գործերով վերաքննիչ դատարան) quashed this judgment and remitted the case for additional investigation.', '21. On 12 September 2000, following the additional investigation, the case was brought again before the Syunik Regional Court.', '22. On 13 June 2001 the Syunik Regional Court decided to remit the case for further investigation.', '23. On 3 August 2001 the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal quashed this decision on an appeal by the prosecutor and remitted the case to the Syunik Regional Court for examination on the merits.', '24. In the proceedings before the Syunik Regional Court, the applicant’s lawyer asked that the applicant’s confession statements of 16 and 17 April 1999 and the statements made by witnesses T. and A. during the investigation in 1999 be declared inadmissible, since they had been obtained under torture. By that time criminal proceedings had already been instituted against the relevant military police officers on account of the torture of the applicant and servicemen T. and A.', '25. On 19 June 2002 the Syunik Regional Court found the applicant guilty of premeditated murder and sentenced him to ten years’ imprisonment. The sentence was to be calculated from the first day of the applicant’s detention on 17 April 1999. In its judgment, the Regional Court stated that “[T]he following ha[d] been established during the court examination” and went on to describe the circumstances in which the applicant had shot serviceman H. The Regional Court then stated:', '“For these actions [the applicant] was charged [with premeditated murder].', 'During ... questioning on 16 April 1999 [the applicant] admitted to the investigating authority that [serviceman H.] had died from a bullet accidentally shot from [the applicant’s] machine gun.', 'On 17 April 1999 during questioning as an accused he again admitted that [serviceman H.] had died from a bullet which had been shot by [the applicant] as a result of a violation of the rules for the handling of weapons.', '[The applicant] confirmed this statement during the re-enactment of the circumstances of the incident [on 17 April 1999], the video recording of which has been examined during the court proceedings.', '[The applicant] later revoked this confession.', 'During the court proceedings [the applicant] pleaded not guilty and stated that he had not killed [serviceman H.]; they had not had an argument on the day of the incident, they had not sworn at each other, he was unaware of the circumstances of [serviceman H.’s] death, and his confession had been made under the influence of the violence and threats inflicted on him by the [police officers].', 'Such arguments [by the applicant] are unfounded, contradict the evidence obtained during the court examination and cannot serve as a basis for avoiding criminal liability and punishment.', '[The applicant’s] ... arguments have been rebutted and his commission of the offence has been proven by the following evidence obtained during the court examination: ...”', '26. As an example of such evidence, the Regional Court went on to cite the statement made by witness T. on 5 March 1999. It further stated:', '“[Witness T.] made the same statement before the Syunik Regional Court at [the hearing of 26 October 1999].', 'During the investigation [witness T.] confirmed this statement at a confrontation with [the applicant on 11 August 1999]. Thereafter [witness T.] revoked this statement and submitted that he had not witnessed the circumstances in which [serviceman H.] had been killed. He also made a similar statement during this court examination, indicating that his statement about witnessing the killing of [serviceman H. by the applicant] had been made under the influence of the violence inflicted on him by the [police officers].', 'A similar statement was also made by [witness A.].”', '27. The Regional Court went on to cite a number of circumstantial and hearsay witness statements and an expert opinion to the effect that the shot had been fired at close range, and concluded that:', '“Having evaluated the contradictory statements made by [witnesses T. and A.] during the investigation and the court examination, the court finds that in reality the coercion was applied by [the police officers] at the military police station for the purpose of ensuring disclosure of the truth.', '... The revocation at a later stage by [witness T.] of his [statements made during the investigation] was aimed at helping [the applicant] to avoid criminal liability. The fact that [witness T.] was aware of the circumstances of [serviceman H.’s] death was confirmed by the unconstrained submissions he made at the [court hearing of 26 October 1999], without being subjected to any ill-treatment or threats, and the stories he told to [two fellow villagers] following his demobilisation.”', '28. The Regional Court concluded by citing other evidence substantiating the applicant’s guilt, such as (i) a forensic examination of the victim’s tissue samples and a medical examination of his corpse, according to which he had died from a shot fired at close range; (ii) a ballistic examination, to the effect that the shell found at the crime scene had been fired from AK-74 type machine gun no. 916236, which had been issued to the applicant; (iii) the record of examination of the crime scene, drawn up on 17 April 1999, and a number of other materials.', '29. On 9 October 2002 the Avan and Nor Nork District Court of Yerevan (Երևան քաղաքի Ավան և Նոր Նորք համայնքների առաջին ատյանի դատարան) found military police officer M. and three other police officers guilty of abuse of power and imposed sentences ranging from three to three and a half years’ imprisonment. The District Court found:', '“On 4 March 1999, in connection with the murder of [serviceman H.], ... [police officer M.] brought [servicemen A. and T.] and others to the military police station. On 5 March 1999 [the applicant was also brought to the station]. There [the police officers] beat them for several days, delivered numerous blows to [the applicant] and others with a rubber club and squeezed their fingertips with pliers, causing injuries of various degrees. Then [the police officers] forced them to take off their shoes, put their hands on the backs of their heads and get down on their knees, and started to club their soles. By threatening to continue the ill-treatment, [the police officers] forced [the applicant] to confess that he had murdered [serviceman H.], [serviceman T.] to state that he had witnessed that murder, and [serviceman A.] to state that he was aware of the murder. [The police officers] also threatened the victims with retaliation if they informed any higher authority about the ill-treatment ...', 'On 5 January 2000, in his office in the military police department in Yerevan, [police officer M.] forced [serviceman A.] to state in relation to the ill-treatment that he was not familiar with [police officer M.], that nobody had beaten him and that the injuries on his fingers had been sustained as a result of his hand being squashed by a car door ...', 'The systematic, unprecedented, essentially cruel and degrading actions inflicted by [the police officers on the applicant and others], which had the attributes of torture, entailed grave consequences in that such actions violated the legally guaranteed rights and interests of [the] servicemen ...”', '30. This judgment was based on various witness statements, including those of the applicant and servicemen T. and A., and the results of the medical examinations.', '31. In his witness statement, the applicant submitted, inter alia, that he had been detained until the end of March 1999 in the military police station, where he was regularly beaten. At the end of March 1999 he was transferred to a military prosecutor’s office but then brought back to the police station on 10 April 1999. On his return journey, police officer M. threatened him with retaliation if he refused to confess. On the same day another police officer also threatened him, but promised to qualify the offence as accidental if the applicant agreed to confess; after this the applicant made his confession statement.', '32. In his witness statement, serviceman A. submitted, inter alia, that after testifying to the investigator, he and serviceman T. were kept in the canteen of the police station for about a month. At the beginning of April, police officer M. called him and serviceman T. and demanded that, when questioned by the investigator, they tell him that they had not been beaten or ill-treated in the police station, and that the injuries on their fingers had been sustained as a result of their fingers being squashed by a car door. On 5 January 2000 police officer M. threatened to kill him if he informed the investigator about the ill-treatment.', '33. In his witness statement, serviceman T. submitted, inter alia, that on 30 November 1999, under pressure from police officer M., he had testified to the investigator that nobody had beaten him.', '34. On an unspecified date the applicant’s lawyer lodged an appeal against this judgment.', '35. On 14 November 2002 the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal refused to examine the appeal since, according to the domestic law, a victim in criminal proceedings had the right to appeal only if the proceedings had been instituted on the basis of his or her complaint.', '36. On 26 December 2002 the Court of Cassation (ՀՀ վճռաբեկ դատարան) upheld this decision.', '37. On an unspecified date the applicant lodged an appeal against his conviction of 19 June 2002.', '38. In the proceedings before the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal, the applicant submitted that he was not aware of the circumstances of serviceman H.’s death and that he had been coerced into making his confession statement.', '39. Witness T. submitted that he had not seen who had killed serviceman H., since he and witness A. had been absent at the material time. He further submitted that the statement made by him during the preliminary investigation, to the effect that he had witnessed the murder, was untrue and that he had been forced to make it. Immediately after the incident all five servicemen had agreed to say that serviceman H. had been killed by an Azeri sniper, but in reality he knew nothing about the circumstances of H.’s death. Witness A. made similar submissions.', '40. On 1 April 2003 the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal decided to uphold the applicant’s conviction. In doing so, the Court of Appeal found that the above submissions were made as a result of collusion between the applicant and the witnesses, aimed at helping him to avoid criminal liability. These submissions were rebutted by the evidence obtained in the case, such as:', '(a) The applicant’s confession of 16 April 1999 to the investigator. Later and in court the applicant had revoked this statement, as having been made under coercion, but had failed to indicate the details of any coercion applied to him in the investigator’s office.', '(b) Submissions by witnesses T. and A. to the Syunik Regional Court at the hearing of 26 October 1999, to the effect that one of them had witnessed and the other was aware of the murder. Witnesses T. and A. had later revoked these submissions but accepted that no coercion had been applied to them in court and that these submissions, albeit untrue, had been made voluntarily.', '(c) Other circumstantial and hearsay witness statements, the relevant expert opinions, various records and the video recording.', '41. The Court of Appeal concluded by statfor the charges and had not been used as evidence.', '42. On 14 April 2003 the applicant’s lawyer lodged an appeal. He argued, inter alia, that the applicant’s confession statement of 16 April 1999, and the record and the video recording prepared at the crime scene on the following day, had been made as a result of the beatings, ill-treatment and threats inflicted on the applicant, and could not therefore be used as evidence against him. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal should not have relied on the submissions made by witness T. at the very early stage of the proceedings, including the hearing of 26 October 1999, to justify the credibility of his first accusatory statement, made under torture. These submissions had been the result of the fear experienced by witness T. following the unprecedented violence inflicted on him. He had been under constant pressure from the investigators, having been detained on several occasions, and at the time of the above-mentioned hearing he had not yet been demobilised and was afraid of being taken back into custody and subjected to ill-treatment again. As an example of witness T.’s fear of telling the truth, the applicant’s lawyer referred to T.’s testimony of 30 November 1999, in which he had submitted that the injuries to his fingers had been sustained as a result of his fingers being squashed by a car door. For the last three years, however, since he had revoked his earlier statements, witness T. had been insisting that he was not aware of the circumstances of serviceman H.’s death. Finally, the applicant’s lawyer argued that, contrary to what had been indicated in the Court of Appeal’s judgment, witness A. had never made any accusatory submissions against the applicant during the court examination of the case. On the contrary, he had always insisted that witness T. could not have witnessed the murder since they had been together at the material time.', '43. On 8 May 2003 the Court of Cassation dismissed the lawyer’s appeal and upheld the Court of Appeal’s judgment. In doing so, the Court of Cassation found, inter alia, that:', '“The conclusions in the judgment are corroborated by the evidence examined in court, in particular, statements by [witnesses T., A. and others, and the results of various expert opinions].', '... It has been established that after the incident [servicemen T. and A., the applicant and others] agreed ... to testify that [serviceman H.] had been killed by [the Azeris], nevertheless, [serviceman T.] testified in the first-instance court on 26 October 1999 that [serviceman H.] had been killed ... by [the applicant].', 'The arguments of [the applicant’s] lawyer that the judgment was based on statements by [witnesses T. and A.] which had been obtained under torture are groundless, contradict the materials of the case and are rebutted by the following evidence.', '[The applicant and witnesses T. and A. were beaten for several days by the police officers] who demanded that they make honest statements concerning the murder of [serviceman H.]. The police officers did not take any statements from them. The statements were taken by the relevant investigator from the military prosecutor’s office, who did not ill-treat them ...', '[The relevant police officers were convicted]. No criminal proceedings were brought against any of the investigators dealing with the case.', '... On 11 August 1999 a confrontation was held between [the applicant and serviceman T. in the presence of the applicant’s lawyer], during which [serviceman T.] contended that [serviceman H.] had been killed with a machine gun [by the applicant]. It has been established that no ill-treatment was inflicted on him at that time.', 'At a later stage [serviceman T.] revoked the above statements and submitted that he had not seen who had killed [serviceman H.], although he did not deny that on several previous occasions he had submitted that it was [the applicant] who had killed [serviceman H.]. The Court of Appeal rightly considered [T.’s] confession statement as reliable and regarded it as proof of [the applicant’s] guilt.', 'During the preliminary investigation [the applicant] testified to the investigator from the military prosecutor’s office that it was he who had killed [serviceman H.], albeit accidentally.', 'Thus, irrespective of the fact that during the preliminary investigation the military police officers ill-treated [the applicant and witnesses T. and A.], the evidence obtained in the case, if evaluated from the perspective of relativity and admissibility, is sufficient in its entirety to convict [the applicant] of the incriminated crime.”', '44. On 22 December 2003 the applicant was released on parole.', '45. The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (ՀՀ քրեական դատավարության օրենսգիրք) read as follows:', '“In the course of criminal proceedings no one shall be subjected to torture and to unlawful physical or mental violence, including such treatment inflicted through the administration of medication, hunger, exhaustion, hypnosis, denial of medical assistance and other cruel treatment. It is prohibited to coerce testimony from a suspect, accused, defendant, victim, witness and other parties to the proceedings by means of violence, threat, trickery, violation of their rights, and through other unlawful actions.”', '“No one shall be obliged to testify against himself ...”', '“The following materials cannot constitute the basis for charges and be used as evidence in criminal proceedings: (1) materials obtained under violence, threat, trickery, humiliation of a person, and through other unlawful actions ...”', '“The inadmissibility of factual data as evidence, and the possibility of their limited use in the proceedings, shall be established by the examining authority of its own motion or upon the request of a party.”', '“Evidence obtained in the case must be thoroughly and objectively examined: it must be analysed, compared with other evidence, new evidence must be collected, and its sources must be verified.”', '“A judgment shall be composed of introductory, descriptive-motivational and concluding parts.”', '“The descriptive-motivational part of a judgment shall contain: (1) the content of the accusation; (2) the court’s conclusions with regard to tested and the defendant’s guilt; (3) the evidence on which the court’s conclusions are based; and (4) the legal provisions on which the court relied in reaching its decision.”', '46. The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, as adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 10 December 1984 (resolution 39/46), provides:', '“Each State Party shall ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made.”']",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[]
001-23375,ENG,ITA,ADMISSIBILITY,2002,BORGHI v. ITALY,1,Inadmissible,,"['The applicant, Mario Borghi, is an Italian national who was born in 1964 and lives in Ozieri.', 'In 1996 four prostitutes, X, Y, V and Z, lodged a criminal complaint, alleging armed robbery, and gave the police information which they claimed would enable them to identify those responsible. After a police investigation proceedings were instituted against the applicant and two other persons, A and B. Among other offences, the applicant, a carabinieri officer, was charged with trafficking in soft drugs (hashish) and hard drugs (heroin), fraud, forgery, receiving and a number of counts of armed robbery and abuse of a public office.', 'During the preliminary inquiries A and B made confessions, stating that the applicant was the person who had committed the armed robberies with them. W, a client of the prostitutes, identified the applicant as one of their assailants.', 'In a decision of 27 December 1996 the Sassari judge responsible for preliminary investigations committed A, B and the applicant for trial in the Sassari District Court.', 'A hearing at which W was due to give evidence was fixed for 24 April 1997. Having received a number of threats by telephone, W had installed a system for recording calls onto audio cassettes. In the evening of 23 April 1997 the applicant rang W. A detective sergeant friend of W who was at his home at the time of the incoming call, suspecting that it might contain threats to the witness, switched on the recording apparatus.', 'The hearing scheduled for 24 April 1997 did not take place because one of the two parties did not appear. W at first kept the cassette at his home and then, a few days later, decided to give it to the police, who seized it. W gave evidence at a public hearing on 22 May 1997 and a transcript of the conversation of 23 April 1997 was added to the judge’s file. The applicant challenged the production of the transcript, asserting that it was the result of illegal and unauthorised telephone tapping. However, his arguments were rejected on the ground that the cassette had never been listened to by the detective sergeant, who had done no more than switch on the recording apparatus. W, who enjoyed the right to keep his communications secret, had then freely decided to give the cassette to the police. Accordingly, there had been no “telephone tapping” within the meaning of Articles 267 to 271 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (“the CCP”); the transcript was a document created by a private individual who had authorised it and produced it legitimately during the trial.', 'In the course of the proceedings it was established that X, Y, V and Z were now untraceable. Accordingly, on 22 May 1997, the District Court, having taken formal note of the parties’ agreement on the point, ordered the statements the witnesses concerned had made to the police to be added to the judge’s file (Article 512 of the CCP). A and B declared that they wished to exercise their right under Article 210 of the CCP to remain silent. Pursuant to Article 513 § 1 of the CCP, the statements they had made before the trial were also added to the file and used when the court determined the merits of the charges against the applicant.', 'At a later hearing the applicant challenged the production of the records of the statements made by three of the prostitutes, X, Y and Z, observing that it had been entirely foreseeable that they would be tempted to make themselves scarce. The court dismissed the applicant’s objection, noting that the prostitutes had given addresses in Italy where they could be contacted and that there was nothing to suggest that they would become untraceable. Moreover, the applicant had not immediately objected to the inclusion in the file of the statements he now sought to challenge, so that he was estopped from objecting to their use.', 'In a judgment of 5 December 1997 the Sassari District Court sentenced the applicant for armed robbery, trafficking in soft drugs (hashish), fraud, forgery and abuse of a public office to six years’ imprisonment and a fine of 4 million Italian lire (approximately 2,065 euros). It acquitted him of trafficking in hard drugs (heroin) and receiving, and of one count of abusing a public office.', 'The judgment was based on the statements by A and B, which were held to be precise, credible and corroborated by other evidence. In particular, the applicant, A and B had been recognised by some of the victims, and the version of events given by the women matched the evidence of the applicant’s two co-defendants. In addition, W had identified the applicant and, as appeared from the transcript of the telephone conversation on 23 April 1997, the latter had unlawfully tried to bring pressure to bear on his accuser. Admittedly, the applicant had pleaded that W’s evidence had been unlawfully admitted, since he should have been considered a co-defendant, not a witness, but the District Court held that it had not been established that W had been guilty of obscene behaviour in a public place. Lastly, a security guard had seen a car identical to the applicant’s near the place where one of the armed robberies had been committed, and it had been established, on the basis of evidence given at the trial and his own partial admissions, that the applicant had paid for certain goods with a cheque stolen from one of the victims.', 'The applicant appealed, contesting the credibility of the prosecution witnesses. He repeated his objections concerning the unlawfulness of admitting in evidence the conversation with W and the prostitutes’ statements.', 'In a judgment of 21 October 1998 the Cagliari Court of Appeal upheld the first-instance judgment. It repeated, for the most part, the reasoning of the Sassari District Court and observed that at the hearing on 22 May 1997 the applicant had accepted the reading out of the prostitutes’ statements and had thus implicitly waived any objection to their use.', 'The applicant appealed on points of law, arguing in particular that his co-defendants’ statements had not been credible and that the recording of the conversation on 23 April 1997 had amounted to unauthorised and therefore illegal telephone tapping.', 'On 14 September 1999 the applicant, as he was entitled to do by virtue of Law no. 14 of 19 January 1999, requested application of a sentence negotiated with the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation. At the same time he withdrew all his grounds of appeal.', 'In a judgment of 29 September 1999, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 5 November 1999, the Court of Cassation reduced the applicant’s sentence to four years and six months’ imprisonment and a fine of 3 million lire. It observed that the applicant and the prosecuting authorities had reached an agreement about the appropriate sentence and that examination of the decisions at first and second instance had not revealed any circumstance warranting the applicant’s acquittal.', '...', 'In the version in force at the material time, Article 512 of the CCP provided:', '“At the request of one of the parties, the judge shall order to be read in court documents resulting from enquiries by the police [or] by the representative of the prosecuting authorities ... where, on account of unforeseeable events or circumstances, [those enquiries] can no longer be repeated.”', 'Article 513 § 1 of the CCP, as amended by the Constitutional Court’s judgment no. 60 of 24 February 1995, read as follows:', '“Where the defendant ... refuses to answer questions, the judge, at the request of one of the parties, shall order to be read in court records of the statements made by the defendant to the representative of the prosecuting authorities [or to the police acting on the instructions of the prosecuting authorities] ... during the preliminary investigation...”', 'As a consequence of being read out the documents and statements referred to in Articles 512 and 513 of the CCP are added to the judge’s file and may be used for assessment of the merits of the charges.', 'By means of the Constitutional Amendment Act no. 2 of 23 November 1999 the Italian parliament added the principle of a fair trial to the Constitution itself. Paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of Article 111 of the Constitution, as now worded, provide:', '“3. In criminal proceedings, the law shall guarantee that the person accused of an offence is informed promptly and in confidence of the nature and grounds of the charge against him; that he shall have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence; that he shall be given an opportunity before the court to examine or to have examined anyone giving evidence against him, to obtain the attendance and examination of any defence witnesses on the same conditions as witnesses called by the prosecution and to obtain the production of any other evidence in his favour; and that he will have the assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used at the trial.', '4. The principle of adversarial process shall be observed during criminal proceedings with regard to the examination of evidence. An accused’s guilt cannot be established on the basis of statements made by a person who has freely and wilfully eluded examination by the accused or his lawyer.', '5. Rules shall be made governing the circumstances in which adversarial examination of the evidence is to be dispensed with, either because the accused has consented or because there is due evidence that such examination is objectively impossible or that there has been unlawful conduct.”', 'Section 3 of Law no. 14 of 19 January 1999 provides that where an appeal on points of law is pending in criminal proceedings in which a Court of Appeal gave judgment before 31 January 1999 the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation and the defendant may agree on the acceptance, in whole or in part, of some of the grounds of appeal, provided that the other grounds are withdrawn. Where acceptance of the grounds of appeal which the defendant has not withdrawn has a bearing on the severity of the sentence, the parties are required to inform the Court of Cassation what sentence they have agreed upon.']",[],[],[],[],[],[]

The applicant was born in 1946 and lives in Roubaix.', '5. On 21 March 2002 the applicant was arrested by the police on the public highway and taken in the course of the evening to Lommelet de Saint-André Psychiatric Hospital, where she was compulsorily admitted at the request of a third party.', 'The Government submitted that the applicant had been “picked up” on the public highway by a police officer who had asked for her to be admitted to hospital. They added that her admission had been ordered on the basis of two medical certificates issued by different doctors to the effect that she required hospital treatment.', 'The applicant disputed that account and stated that she had been arrested while cycling to the shops and taken to the police station, where she had promptly been examined by a doctor who had been requisitioned to draw up a medical certificate for her admission to hospital.', '6. She submitted that after her admission at the hospital she had immediately been undressed and made to lie down with all four limbs attached to the bedposts in a seclusion cell, without being given any explanation. She had not undergone a medical examination on arrival but had been injected with unknown substances. She had remained in that position for five days, and was released only briefly at mealtimes.', '7. She remained in the hospital until 8 April 2002, without being allowed to receive visits or to make or receive telephone calls.', ""8. In the meantime, on 23 March 2002, the applicant's mother applied by registered letter to the President of the Lille tribunal de grande instance for her daughter's immediate discharge. The parties have been unable to establish the date on which the letter was received. However, in a letter of 8 April 2002, Lille State Counsel replied that he was not empowered to deal with the subject matter of her correspondence and that her daughter was required to apply directly to him to be discharged."", ""On 28 March 2002 Afcap in turn applied to the President of the Lille tribunal de grande instance for the applicant's immediate discharge."", ""9. On 22 April 2002 State Counsel's Office decided to take no further action on that application as it was devoid of purpose."", '10. Neither the President of the Lille tribunal de grande instance nor the judge responsible for matters relating to personal liberties and detention (juge des libertés et de la détention – “the liberties and detention judge”) ever gave a ruling on the applications.', '11. The following provisions of the Public Health Code are relevant to the present case:', '“Persons who have been admitted to hospital without their consent or have been detained in any public or private institution for patients being treated for mental disorders, or their guardian if they are minors, their guardian or adviser if they are above the age of majority and a court order for such appointment has been made, their spouse or cohabitant, a parent or a person capable of acting in their interests or, where appropriate, a court-appointed adviser in relation to personal welfare may appeal at any time by means of an application to the President of the tribunal de grande instance for the judicial district in which the institution is situated, who, in his capacity as urgent-applications judge, shall, after hearing representations from each party and carrying out the necessary checks, order their immediate discharge where appropriate.', ""An appeal to the same effect may be lodged by a person who has requested the patient's compulsory admission or by State Counsel, of his own motion."", ""The President of the tribunal de grande instance may also of his own motion make an order at any time for the discharge of a person who has been compulsorily admitted to hospital. To that end, any interested parties may bring to his attention any information they consider useful about the patient's circumstances."", ""N.B. Section 49 XI of Law 2000-516 of 15 June 2000 amends Article L. 351 of the Public Health Code as follows: in the first paragraph, 'President' is replaced by 'liberties and detention judge'; at the start of the last paragraph, 'President of the tribunal de grande instance' is replaced by 'liberties and detention judge'. This amendment has not been inserted into the wording of the new Article L. 3211-12 of the Public Health Code (former L. 351), as resulting from Ordinance no. 2000-548 of 15 June 2000.”"", '“A person with a mental disorder cannot be admitted to hospital without his consent at the request of another unless', '(1) his disorder makes it impossible for him to consent; and', '(2) his condition requires immediate treatment and constant monitoring in a hospital environment.', ""An application for compulsory admission may be made either by a member of the patient's family or by a person capable of acting in his interests, but not by any medical personnel serving in the institution in question."", 'The application must be handwritten and signed by the person making it. If the person is unable to write, the application shall be received by the mayor, the police superintendent or the director of the institution, who shall take formal note of it. It shall contain the surname, forenames, profession, age and home address both of the person making the application and the person whose admission is being requested, together with an indication of the nature of the relationship between them and, where relevant, their degree of kinship.', 'The application for admission shall be accompanied by two detailed medical certificates issued less than fifteen days previously, attesting that the conditions laid down in the second and third paragraphs above are satisfied.', ""The first medical certificate may be issued only by a doctor not practising in the institution to which the patient is to be admitted; he shall observe the person's mental state, indicate the particular features of his disorder and explain the need for his compulsory admission. It must be confirmed by a certificate issued by a second doctor who may practise in the institution to which the patient is to be admitted. The two doctors shall not be related by blood or marriage, up to the fourth degree inclusive, either to each other or to the directors of the institutions referred to in Article L. 32221, or to the person making the application or to the person whose admission is being sought.”"", '“A person admitted at the request of another to an institution referred to in Article L. 3222-1 shall likewise cease to be detained there as soon as his discharge is requested by:', '...', '(3) if the person is unmarried, the ascendants;', '...”']",['5'],['5-4'],[],[],[],[]

De Gaetano;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"['5. The applicant was born in 1952. He is currently detained in Czerwony Bór Prison.', '6. On 12 January 2005 the applicant was arrested in Poland and charged with trafficking large amounts of drugs from Venezuela.', '7. On 14 January 2005 the Gdańsk District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded him in custody. The decision was upheld on 18 April 2005 by the Gdańsk Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy).', '8. In its decision to detain the applicant, the District Court relied on a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the aforementioned offence. It attached particular importance to the likelihood that a severe sentence of imprisonment would be imposed on the applicant and to the risk that he would attempt to obstruct the proceedings.', '9. The applicant’s pre-trial detention was subsequently extended by decisions of the Gdańsk Regional Court given on 22 March 2005 (upheld by the Gdańsk Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) on 27 April 2005), on 23 June 2005, on 15 September 2005 (upheld by the Gdańsk Court of Appeal on 11 October 2005), on 13 January 2006 and on 18 April 2006 (upheld by the Gdańsk Court of Appeal on 26 April 2006).', '10. In its decisions extending the applicant’s detention, the Regional Court observed that it had been necessary to extend the pre-trial proceedings in order to obtain translations of certain relevant case documents from Spanish into Polish, to hear new witnesses and to supplement the original charges. It took into account the fact that the applicant had a handicapped mother, but concluded that she had been receiving adequate care and, therefore, that there were no special reasons, family-related or other, militating against the applicant’s detention.', '11. On 17 June 2005 the bill of indictment was lodged with the Gdańsk Regional Court.', '12. On 6 October 2005 the Gdańsk Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s request for release, finding that the initial grounds for his detention continued to apply.', '13. On 28 December 2006 the Gdańsk Court of Appeal extended the applicant’s detention, restating the grounds initially invoked for the detention order. It emphasised that the offence with which the applicant had been charged had been committed in an organised criminal group. Consequently, the court took the view that detention on remand constituted the only measure capable of securing the proper conduct of the proceedings.', '14. The applicant’s appeal against the decision of the Gdańsk Court of Appeal was dismissed by the same court on 16 January 2007.', '15. On 25 April 2007, 11 December 2007 and on further unspecified dates the Gdańsk Court of Appeal again extended the applicant’s detention. In its decision of 11 December 2007 the court held that another extension of the applicant’s detention was necessary in order to allow the trial court to examine additional evidence and hear more witnesses. The court moreover observed that one of the co-accused had also been charged in another set of proceedings and remained at the disposal of the Kraków Regional Court, which made it necessary to have him escorted from there to each of the hearings before the Gdańsk Regional Court. The applicant’s appeal against this decision was dismissed on 28 December 2007.', '16. On 30 December 2008 the Gdańsk Regional Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to 10 years’ imprisonment.', '17. On 2 March 2010 the Gdańsk Court of Appeal upheld the lower court’s judgment.', '18. The applicant lodged a cassation appeal and the proceedings before the Supreme Court are currently pending.', '19. On 14 January 2005 the applicant was committed to Sztum Remand Centre.', '20. On 30 September 2005 he was transferred to Gdańsk Remand Centre.', '21. From 12 October 2006 to 15 November 2006 the applicant was held in Kraków Remand Centre.', '22. On 16 November 2006 he was transferred back to Gdańsk Remand Centre. He remained there until 6 March 2007.', '23. On 7 March 2007 the applicant was once more transferred to Kraków Remand Centre and detained there until 21 March 2007.', '24. From 22 March 2007 onwards the applicant was detained in Gdańsk Remand Centre.', '25. Following his conviction, on 17 January 2009 he was transferred to Iława Remand Centre to serve his term of imprisonment. He remained there until 17 October 2009, with the exception of the period from 30 June 2009 to 3 September 2009 when he was detained in Racibórz Remand Centre.', '26. On 18 October 2010 the applicant was transferred to Czerwony Bór Prison where he is currently detained.', '27. The parties gave partly differing accounts of the conditions of the applicant’s detention in the above-mentioned establishments.', '28. Upon his arrest on 12 January 2005 the applicant was committed to Sztum Remand Centre where he was initially held in a cell of an unspecified size.', '29. On 20 June 2006, in Gdańsk Remand Centre, he was placed with five other detainees in a cell of 16 m². The free area in the cell, furniture and other equipment excluded, amounted to approximately 1 m² per person.', '30. Subsequently, on an unspecified date the applicant was transferred to a cell which measured 20 m² and was shared by six detainees. The cell in question was furnished with three bunk beds, two tables, six stools and a number of cupboards. A toilet cubicle was also inside the cell. The free area in the cell was approximately 1.5 m² per detainee.', '31. From 17 October to 15 November 2006 the applicant was held in Kraków Remand Centre. Despite being a non-smoker, he was detained in a cell designated for smokers.', '32. In a letter of 9 November 2009 the applicant informed the Court that he had been continuously held in a cell where the statutory requirement of 3 m² of living space per prisoner had not been respected. The toilet was not properly separated from the rest of the cell and the conditions were unhygienic.', '33. In a letter of 15 October 2010 the applicant informed the Court that from 9 November 2009 to 26 November 2009 the authorities of Iława Prison had placed him together with one other detainee in a cell where the living space per detainee amounted to 2.48 m².', 'In the same letter he further stated that on 26 November 2009 he was moved to cell no. 18 in ward B where the requirement of 3 m² of living space per prisoner had been respected and the conditions of his detention were more or less satisfactory.', '34. The Government supplied the following details concerning the conditions of the applicant’s detention in each establishment.', '35. As regards Gdańsk Remand Centre, the Government acknowledged that the applicant had been temporarily placed in cells where the living space per prisoner had amounted to less than 3 m². The cell space in different cells occupied by the applicant ranged from 2.26 m2 to 4.06 m2 per prisoner. The period during which the applicant had been detained in cells where the living space was less than 3 m² per prisoner amounted to a total of 235 days.', '36. The Government explained that throughout his detention the applicant had been entitled to a one-hour daily walk in the remand centre’s courtyard and to take part in various sports activities. The sanitary conditions of Gdańsk Remand Centre were adequate, the cells were properly lit and equipped with all necessary furniture.', '37. With regard to Kraków Remand Centre, the Government also conceded that the applicant had been at times held in cells where the living space per prisoner amounted to less than 3 m². He was initially placed in a cell with non-smokers but at his own request he was later moved to a different cell. In this remand centre also the applicant was entitled to a one-hour daily walk in the remand centre’s courtyard. The overall sanitary conditions of the remand centre were satisfactory and the applicant had been provided with the necessary products for his daily hygiene.', '38. In a letter of 26 November 2009 the Government submitted that the applicant was being detained in Iława Remand Centre, in a cell where the statutory minimum standard of 3 m² per person was respected.', '39. The applicant lodged a complaint with the Ombudsman, complaining about the conditions of his detention in Kraków Remand Centre. He did not lodge a similar complaint in respect of Gdańsk Remand Centre because, as he explained, such a complaint would have had no prospects of success and moreover he had feared persecution by the prison authorities of Gdańsk Remand Centre.', '40. The applicant did not bring a civil action in tort to seek compensation for the infringement of his personal rights on account of the conditions of his detention.', '41. The applicant submitted that during his stay in Sztum Remand Centre he had been entitled to one family visit per month. During the first visit he was allowed to see his common-law wife in person and in the presence of a police officer. During all subsequent visits he was separated from his visitors by a perspex partition and could only communicate with them via internal phone. He was only allowed to receive one visitor at a time.', '42. In March 2005 the applicant’s wife was refused the right to see him. According to the applicant’s submissions, the authorities had explained their refusal by the fact that a personal search performed on the applicant’s wife at the remand centre’s entrance had allegedly revealed a prohibited “kite” message (gryps) and some unauthorised medication. The applicant maintained that the authorities had unfairly mistaken his common-law wife’s personal memo note for a prohibited message. He also explained that the medication she had been carrying had been her own, ordinary medication for blood circulation problems. He moreover pointed out that during the visit scheduled for that particular day he would in any event have been separated from his wife by a perspex partition, a circumstance of which both the authorities and his wife had been aware.', '43. In Gdańsk Remand Centre the applicant was entitled to receive visitors once a month. He was usually separated from his visitors by a perspex partition and could communicate with them via internal phone.', '44. The applicant submitted that on numerous occasions his commonlaw wife and other members of his family had filed repeated requests to be allowed to see him physically in person but that all these requests had been refused. He maintains that he was allowed to meet his family in a manner allowing for direct physical contact only on six occasions.', '45. From the copies of documents provided by the applicant it can be seen that the requests filed by various members of his family on 12 July 2005, 5 August 2005, 29 May 2006, 9 July 2006 and on 5 September 2006 were all refused by the Gdańsk Regional Court, usually by handwritten notes made on their requests – “permission refused” (“nie wyrażam zgody”).', '46. As a result of a request filed on 30 June 2006, on 3 July 2007 the court decided to “only exceptionally” allow the applicant’s common-law wife to see him without their being physically separated (“sąd wyjątkowo wyraża zgodę na widzenie umożliwiające kontakt bezpośredni”).', '47. Also, the applicant’s own request to be allowed to have direct physical contact with his visitors, filed on 10 July 2006, was refused by the court on 18 July 2006.', '48. According to a certificate issued on 25 July 2007 by the authorities of Gdańsk Remand Centre, provided by the applicant, up until 23 July 2007 he had been allowed to see:', '- his common-law wife 16 times: during 9 visits they had been separated by a perspex partition and on 7 other occasions they had been allowed to have direct physical contact;', '- his son P. 9 times: on 7 occasions with the perspex partition and 2 occasions with direct physical contact;', '- his daughter E. once, being separated from her by the perspex partition.', '49. The Government pointed out that during his stay in Gdańsk Remand Centre the applicant had been allowed to see his family 46 times, on 20 occasions in a manner allowing for direct physical contact. Nearly all requests filed by the applicant’s family members had been allowed. The visits took place on:', '- 11 and 18 October 2005;', '- 8, 10, 23, 25 November 2005;', '- 1, 8, 13, 20 December 2005;', '- 12 and 20 January 2006;', '- 7 and 17 February 2006;', '- 1, 10, 24 March 2006;', '- 10, 12, 14 and 21 April 2006;', '- 12 and 17 May 2006;', '- 6, 21, 30 June 2006;', '- 11 and 21 July 2006;', '- 31 August 2006;', '- 7 and 21 September 2006;', '- 23 November 2006;', '- 16 December 2006;', '- 22 January 2007;', '- 22 February 2007;', '- 27 March 2007;', '- 8 and 30 May 2007;', '- 8 June 2007;', '- 24 July 2007;', '- 21 August 2007;', '- 21 September 2007;', '- 12 October 2007;', '- 29 November 2007;', '- 14 and 22 December 2007.', '50. During his stay in Kraków Remand Centre from 7 to 21 March 2007, the applicant was not allowed to make any telephone calls and did not receive any visits.', '51. On 19 May 2010 the Elbląg Regional Court refused to grant the applicant’s request for release on probation (warunkowe przedterminowe zwolnienie). The court held that the applicant could not be given a positive socio-criminological forecast and that his resocialisation process had not been completed yet. It noted that the applicant’s behaviour in detention had been proper, but also observed that he had been a declared member of the prison subculture in violation of prison regulations, that he had not shown a critical attitude towards his crime and, lastly, that the end of the applicant’s sentence was still remote. It recalled that, according to the prevalent jurisprudence, release on probation was a kind of “reward” for prisoners who, by their behaviour, had demonstrated that they had made substantial progress in their resocialisation.', '52. On 22 June 2010 the Gdańsk Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It restated the reasons invoked for the decision of the lower court. In addition, it considered that the fact that the applicant had never throughout his detention been given a disciplinary penalty and that he had received a dozen or so rewards for his behaviour (nagroda) could not suffice to conclude that his socio-criminological forecast should be regarded as positive. The court further invoked the applicant’s membership of the prison subculture, the serious nature of his criminal conviction and his lack of remorse in respect of the committed crime.', '53. A detailed description of the relevant domestic law and practice concerning general rules governing conditions of detention in Poland and domestic remedies available to detainees alleging that conditions of their detention are inadequate are set out in the Court’s pilot judgments given in the cases of Orchowski v. Poland (no. 17885/04) and Norbert Sikorski v. Poland (no. 17599/05) on 22 October 2009 (see §§ 75-85 and §§ 45-88 respectively). More recent developments are described in the decision given by the Court in the case of Łatak v. Poland (no. 52070/08) on 12 October 2010 (see §§ 25-54).', '54. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of pretrial detention on remand (aresztowanie tymczasowe), the grounds for its extension, release from detention and rules governing other, so-called “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze) are set out in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Gołek v. Poland (no. 31330/02, §§ 27-33, 25 April 2006) and Celejewski v. Poland (no. 17584/04, §§ 22-23, 4 May 2006).', '55. The relevant statistical data, recent amendments to the Code of Criminal procedure designed to streamline criminal proceedings and references to the relevant Council of Europe materials can be found in the Court’s judgment in the case of Kauczor (see Kauczor v. Poland, no. 45219/06, § 27-28 and 30-35, 3 February 2009).', '56. Pursuant to Article 217 § 1 of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences, a detainee is allowed to receive visitors, provided that he has obtained a visit permission (“zezwolenie na widzenie”) from the authority at whose disposal he remains, i.e. an investigating prosecutor (at the investigative stage) or from the trial court (once the trial has begun) or from the appellate court (in appeal proceedings). A detainee is entitled to a single, onehour long visit per month.', '57. According to paragraphs 2 and 3, a visit should take place in the presence of a prison guard in a manner making it impossible for a detainee to have direct contact with a visitor but the authority which issued the permission may set other conditions. In practice, there are 3 types of visits: an “open visit”, a “supervised visit” (widzenie w obecności funkcjonariusza Służby Więziennej) and a “closed visit”.', '58. An open visit takes place in a common room designated for visits. Each detainee and his visitors have at their disposal a table at which they may sit together and can have an unrestricted conversation and direct physical contact. Several detainees receive visits at the same time and in the same room.', '59. A supervised visit takes place in the same common room but the prison guard is present at the table, controls the course of the visit, may restrict physical contact if so ordered under the visit permission, although his principal role usually is to ensure that the visit is not used for the purposes of obstructing the proceedings or achieving any unlawful aims and to prevent the transfer of any forbidden objects.', '60. A closed visit takes place in a special room. A detainee is separated from his visitor by a perspex partition and they communicate through an internal phone.', '61. The relevant extracts from Recommendation Rec(2006)2 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the European Prison Rules, adopted on 11 January 2006, read as follows:', '“Part II Conditions of imprisonment', 'Contact with the outside world', '24.1 Prisoners shall be allowed to communicate as often as possible by letter, telephone or other forms of communication with their families, other persons and representatives of outside organisations and to receive visits from these persons.', '24.2 Communication and visits may be subject to restrictions and monitoring necessary for the requirements of continuing criminal investigations, maintenance of good order, safety and security, prevention of criminal offences and protection of victims of crime, but such restrictions, including specific restrictions ordered by a judicial authority, shall nevertheless allow an acceptable minimum level of contact.', '24.3 National law shall specify national and international bodies and officials with whom communication by prisoners shall not be restricted.', '24.4 The arrangements for visits shall be such as to allow prisoners to maintain and develop family relationships in as normal a manner as possible.', '24.5 Prison authorities shall assist prisoners in maintaining adequate contact with the outside world and provide them with the appropriate welfare support to do so. ”']","['5', '8']",['5-3'],[],[],[],[]

All are Turkish nationals and live in Istanbul.', '10. In February and March 1996, as part of a police operation against an illegal Marxist organisation, the TKEP/L (Communist Labour Party of Turkey/Leninist), the Istanbul police arrested the applicants and held them for questioning at the headquarters of the anti-terrorist branch of the Istanbul security police (“Security Headquarters”) for questioning.', '11. The facts in each individual case may be summarised as follows:', '12. Mr Batı was arrested on 8 February 1996.', '13. On 19 February 1996 he informed the public prosecutor during an interview that he had been ill-treated by the police while in custody. He was later brought before a judge of the Istanbul National Security Court (“the judge”), to whom he repeated the statement he had made to the public prosecutor. The judge ordered his detention pending trial.', '14. Mr Batı says that his ill-treatment at Security Headquarters took various forms: he was beaten, forced to remain standing, deprived of sleep, and threatened with death, rape and sexual assault with a truncheon.', '15. He was given only one medical examination. In his report of 19 February 1996, the forensic doctor, a member of the Istanbul Institute of Forensic Medicine, found partly healed bruising measuring 0.5 cm by 0.5 cm in the sternal region. He noted that Mr Batı had complained of pain in his shoulders and certified him unfit for work for one day.', '16. Mr Gedik was arrested on 6 February 1996.', '17. On 19 February 1996 he informed the public prosecutor during an interview that he had been coerced into making a statement which he had signed without reading. He subsequently repeated this account to the judge, who ordered his detention pending trial.', '18. Mr Gedik says his ill-treatment in custody included suspension by the arms, death threats and electric shocks.', '19. He was given three medical examinations:', '(a) In a report of 19 February 1996, a forensic doctor noted scab-covered lesions measuring 3 cm by 3 cm to the rear of the thighs and an old bruise measuring 3 cm by 3 cm in the upper scapular region. He certified Mr Gedik unfit for work for three days.', '(b) In a report of 27 February 1996, the Bayrampaşa Prison doctor found bruising with scabs to the left arm and a leg. He noted that Mr Gedik complained of pain in various parts of the body and referred him to a forensic doctor for a final report.', '(c) Mr Gedik was re-examined by a forensic doctor on 7 March 1996. The doctor recorded his complaints of pain in the left shoulder in the medical certificate. However, he considered that a final report could only be drawn up once Mr Gedik had been examined by a hospital neurology service. It appears from the case file, however, that the additional examination was never carried out.', '20. Mr Erhan İl was arrested on 6 February 1996.', '21. On 19 February 1996 he was interviewed by the public prosecutor, before whom he denied all the offences he was alleged to have committed. Subsequently he was brought before the judge, to whom he complained of ill-treatment by police officers while in custody. The judge ordered his detention pending trial.', '22. Mr Erhan İl says that he was subjected to various forms of ill-treatment while in custody at Security Headquarters: suspension by the arms, blows, threats and insults.', '23. He was given three medical examinations:', '(a After examining Mr Erhan İl, a forensic doctor drew up a medical report in which he noted reduced extension and impaired supination and pronation in both arms. He said that a final report could be drawn up once Mr Erhan İl had been examined by a hospital neurology service.', '(b) In his report of 27 February 1996, the Bayrampaşa Prison doctor noted that Mr Erhan İl had complained of pain in his shoulders, thorax, back and respiratory tract, and numbness in both arms and hands. He referred him to a forensic doctor for a final report.', ""(c) On 6 March 1996, in the light of the medical certificate issued on 19 February 1996, the forensic doctor ordered Mr Erhan İl's transfer to hospital for neurological examination. It appears from the case file, however, that no such additional examination was ever carried out."", '24. Mr Öktem was arrested on 8 February 1996.', '25. On 19 February 1996, after being interviewed by the public prosecutor, he was brought before the judge to whom he complained of ill-treatment by police officers while in custody. The judge ordered his detention pending trial.', '26. Mr Öktem says that he was subjected to various forms of ill-treatment while in custody, including suspension by the arms and beating of the soles of the feet (falaka).', '27. He was given three medical examinations:', ""(a) According to a medical certificate issued on 19 February 1996, the forensic doctor initially did not find any marks of violence on Mr Öktem's body.

They also lodged a complaint against O.T. (the Istanbul police commissioner) and R.A. (the deputy director of the Istanbul anti-terrorist branch). They argued that these two senior police officers were the hierarchical superiors of the police officers who had subjected them to torture. This complaint was dismissed on 24 February 1998 for lack of sufficient evidence. That decision was upheld by the President of the Beyoğlu Assize Court on 23 September 1998.', '75. On 12 April 1996 the public prosecutor questioned four police officers (Fatih Berkup, Mehmet A.

They denied having ill-treated the applicants concerned.', ""76. Meanwhile, on a date that has not been specified by the parties, a complaint was lodged by Ebru Karahancı, Özgür Öktem and ĺsmail Altun.

However, the applicants say that on 5 December 1997 the President of the Beyoğlu Assize Court set aside that decision following an appeal by the applicants' representative."", '77. By an indictment that was lodged on 4 March 1997, the public prosecutor instituted criminal proceedings in the Istanbul Assize Court against five police officers (Mustafa Taner Paylaşan, Ahmet Bereket, Fatih Berkup, Mehmet A. Çavdar and Yakup Doğan) for an offence under Article 243 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 96 below).', '78. The first hearing in the case took place on 26 May 1997 in the Istanbul Assize Court, in the absence of the five police officers. The Assize Court heard the applicants, who complained in particular of the decision not to prosecute Mustafa Sara. In addition, Mrs Öktem testified that she had suffered a miscarriage after being assaulted and subjected to repeated blows to the abdomen while in custody. With the exception of İzzet Tokur, Ebru Karahancı, Özgür Öktem and ĺsmail Altun, the applicants applied to be joined to the criminal proceedings as civil parties under Article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 98 below). That application was granted.', '79. On 7 July 1997 a brawl broke out between the applicants and members of the security forces as nine of the applicants (Zülcihan Şahin, Sinan Kaya, İsmail Altun, Müştak Erhan İl, Arzu Kemanoğlu, Okan Kablan, Devrim Öktem, Özgür Öktem and Bülent Gedik) were being taken to the hearing room in the Istanbul court-house. The Istanbul Assize Court proceeded with the hearing, which it began by hearing evidence from the four defendant police officers who were present, namely Mustafa Taner Paylaşan, Fatih Berkup, Mehmet A. Çavdar and Yakup Doğan.', '80. At the hearing the applicants formally identified those police officers. The Assize Court decided that it was unnecessary to remand the accused in custody and adjourned the question of whether Mustafa Sara should be prosecuted to a later date.', '81. At a hearing on 20 October 1997, Mr Öktem (the father of Mrs Öktem and Mr Öktem) and Miss Karahancı gave evidence. The latter said that she was unable to identify anyone, as she had been kept blindfolded throughout her time in police custody.', '82. The testimony of one of the accused, Ahmet Bereket, was obtained on commission and placed in the case file of the Assize Court on 29 July 1997.', '83. At a hearing on 25 December 1997, the Assize Court sought to establish the addresses of two of the victims, A. Kılıç and Ay. Kılıç, so that their testimony, which was not on the case file, could be obtained.', '84. At a hearing on 11 March 1998, Mr A. Tunga gave evidence.', '85. On 7 January 1998 a supplementary indictment was lodged by the public prosecutor, accusing police officer Mustafa Sara of ill-treatment with a view to extracting confessions.', '86. On 14 April 1998 evidence was taken from Mustafa Sara on commission and placed in the case file.', ""87. Between 21 May 1998 and 25 December 2002 the Assize Court held approximately thirty hearings, at which it sought, inter alia, to establish the addresses of a witness and of a victim with a view to serving them with witness summonses. Although the applicants' representatives urged the Assize Court on 24 June 1999, 20 November 2001 and 23 December 2001 to dispense with the evidence of the two people concerned, it did not accede to their request until 13 February 2002."", '88. At a hearing on 17 July 2002, the representative acting for Mustafa Taner Paylaşan, Fatih Berkup and Yakup Doğan informed the Assize Court that he was withdrawing from the case. The court was also informed that Mehmet A. Çavdar had died.', ""89. On 1 October 2002 the applicants' representatives asked the Assize Court to expedite the proceedings, as there was a danger that the prosecution of the offences would become statute-barred."", '90. At a hearing on 20 November 2002, Yakup Doğan sought an adjournment to enable him to obtain legal representation. Mustafa Sara lodged a medical certificate excusing his absence. The Assize Court granted the defendants an extension of time. From the case file it would seem that Mustafa Sara never in fact appeared before the Assize Court.', '91. At a hearing on 25 December 2002, the public prosecutor made his submissions. He sought an order dismissing the criminal proceedings against Mehmet A. Çavdar, who had died, and against Mustafa Taner Paylaşan, Ahmet Bereket, Fatih Berkup and Yakup Doğan under the statute of limitations. As regards Mustafa Sara, he sought a conviction only on the count of torturing Bülent Gedik. He submitted that Mustafa Sara should be acquitted on the other charges.', ""92. In a judgment of 5 February 2003, the Assize Court decided to discontinue the proceedings against the defendants Mustafa Taner Paylaşan, Ahmet Bereket, Fatih Berkup and Yakup Doğan by virtue of the statute of limitations and against Mehmet A. Çavdar on the ground of intervening death. It found Mustafa Sara guilty of torturing Mr Gedik and Mrs Öktem and sentenced him to two years' imprisonment. It also made an order prohibiting him from holding public office for a period of six months. However, it acquitted him on the other charges."", '...', '94. The case is currently pending before the Court of Cassation.', '95. At the material time section 16 of Law no. 2845 on procedure in the national security courts provided that any person arrested in connection with an offence within the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts had to be brought before a judge within forty-eight hours at the latest or, if the offence was a joint one committed outside the region under emergency rule, within fifteen days, not including the time needed to convey the detainee to the judge.', ""96. Under the Turkish Criminal Code, it is an offence for a public official to subject a person to torture or ill-treatment (Article 243 in relation to torture and Article 245 in relation to ill-treatment). The authorities' obligations in respect of conducting a preliminary investigation into acts or omissions capable of constituting such offences that have been brought to their attention are governed by Articles 151 to 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Offences may be reported to the authorities and the security forces as well as to the public prosecutor's office. Complaints may be made orally or in writing. If a complaint is made orally, the authority must keep a record (Article 151)."", ""By Article 235 of the Criminal Code, any public official who fails to report to the police or a public prosecutor's office an offence of which he has become aware in the course of his duties is liable to imprisonment. A public prosecutor who is informed by any means whatsoever of a situation that gives rise to suspicion that an offence has been committed is obliged to investigate the facts in order to decide whether or not there should be a prosecution (Article 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure)."", '97. Under Article 102 of the Criminal Code, taken in conjunction with Articles 243 and 245, a prosecution for an offence of ill-treatment or torture by a public official must be brought within five years.', ""98. Article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure also contains a provision allowing victims of crime to join the proceedings as “intervening parties” alongside the prosecution. As a direct victim, an intervening party may also claim reparation for any loss sustained as a result of the offence provided that he or she has not previously brought an action in the civil courts. The admissibility of applications to join the proceedings as an intervening party is determined by the judge, after hearing representations from the public prosecutor's office (Article 366 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). A person who has been given leave to intervene in proceedings may, like the public prosecutor, appeal to the Court of Cassation against the verdict (Article 371 of the Code Criminal Procedure)."", ""99. Under the Code of Obligations, anyone who suffers damage as a result of an illegal or tortious act may bring an action for damages for pecuniary loss (Articles 41 to 46) and non-pecuniary loss (Article 47). The civil courts are not bound by the findings or the verdict of the criminal court on the issue of the defendant's guilt (Article 53)."", ""However, under section 13 of Law no. 657 on State employees, anyone who has sustained loss as a result of an act done in the course of an official's duties under public law may, in principle, only bring an action against the authority for whom the official concerned works and not directly against the official (Article 129 § 5 of the Constitution and Articles 55 and 100 of the Code of Obligations). This is not an absolute rule, however. When an act is found to be illegal or tortious and, consequently, is no longer an “administrative act” or deed, the civil courts may allow a claim for damages to be made against the official concerned, without prejudice to the victim's right to bring an action against the authority on the basis of its joint liability as the official's employer (Article 50 of the Code of Obligations)."", ""100. The Manual on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the Istanbul Protocol) was submitted to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on 9 August 1999.

The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Bielsko-Biała.', '10. On 10 August 1991 the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having committed homicide. On 12 August 1991 the Bielsko-Biała District Prosecutor (Prokurator Rejonowy) charged the applicant with homicide and uttering threats, and detained him on remand.', '11. On 30 April 1992 the Bielsko-Biała Regional Prosecutor lodged a bill of indictment with the Bielsko-Biała Regional Court (Sąd Rejonowy). The applicant was indicted on the charges of homicide and uttering threats.', '12. The trial began on 16 June 1992.', '13. On 14 October 1992 Court quashed the order for the applicant’s detention and released him. The Regional Prosecutor appealed.', 'The Katowice Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on 4 November 1992. It held that a “reasonable suspicion” that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged was no longer justified because S.U., the witness who had incriminated him in the investigation, had fundamentally changed his original testimony.', '14. Between 16 June 1992 and 1 May 1993 the trial court held fourteen hearings. It heard evidence from twenty lay witnesses and one expert witness.', '15. Between 4 May 1993 and 25 May 1994 the Bielsko-Biała Regional Court held ten hearings and heard evidence from forty-one witnesses and two experts. It needed to rehear evidence from some witnesses several times.', '16. On 25 May 1994 the court acquitted the applicant on all charges. On 12 October 1994 the Bielsko-Biała Regional Prosecutor appealed against the acquittal.', '17. The appeal was heard before the Katowice Court of Appeal on 9 March 1995. The court quashed the contested judgment and remitted the case to the Bielsko-Biała Regional Prosecutor, holding that a further investigation should be carried out. In particular, the Court of Appeal ordered the prosecutor to reconstruct the scene of the crime and to obtain evidence from experts in psychology. It considered that in order to assess the credibility of evidence given by S.U., the main prosecution witness, it was necessary to diagnose his personality and establish his perception skills.', '18. On 12 May 1995 the Bielsko-Biała Regional Prosecutor asked the Institute of Forensic Experts (Instytut Ekspertyz Sądowych) in Cracow to prepare a comprehensive report on S.U.’s psychological profile. Furthermore, since in the course of the original investigation the prosecution had already obtained two, albeit inconsistent, reports from psychologists, the prosecutor also adduced copies of those reports and asked experts from the Institute to resolve contradictions.', '19. The experts set the dates of the examination for 19 December 1995 and for 12 February 1996 respectively. However, S.U. did not keep his appointment for the examination on either of these dates. Eventually, he appeared before the experts on 9 May 1996 and was examined by them on that day. Their report was ready on 6 September 1996.', '20. On 30 December 1996 the Bielsko-Biała Regional Prosecutor lodged a new bill of indictment with the Bielsko-Biała Regional Court.

On 30 April 1997 the Bielsko-Biała Regional Prosecutor indicted the applicant on the same charges for the third time.', '23. The retrial started on 4 September 1997. The subsequent hearings were held on 4 November 1997, 6 January and 8 April 1998. On 12 February 1998 the court cancelled a hearing because the applicant was ill.', '24. On 9 June 1998 the trial was adjourned since a new judge rapporteur had in the meantime been appointed and needed to study the case-file.', '25. The trial was to be resumed on 26 March 1999 but it was again postponed. The applicant was absent at that hearing. He was also absent at the hearing listed for 7 May 1999. The applicant’s lawyer informed the court that he had left for Greece in search of odd jobs and that he would be absent for some four months. In fact, the applicant returned after three weeks.', 'Also, at that time, the court found that the witness S.U. had left his place of residence without indicating his new address and that his whereabouts were unknown. In the circumstances, the court stayed the proceedings.', '26. On 7 November 2000, at the applicant’s request, the proceedings were resumed. In 2001 the Regional Court held three hearings. They took place on 20 April, 15 June and 31 October respectively.', '27. Further hearings were scheduled for 4 January, 6 February, 6 March, 9 April and 14 May 2002. The court heard evidence from twenty witnesses.', 'At the hearing held on 9 April 2002 the court, at the Regional Prosecutor’s request, ordered that evidence from a DNA identification test of several hairs found on the victim be obtained to determine whether they belonged to the applicant. However, on 13 May 2002, experts from the Forensic Laboratory of the Silesian Regional Police Headquarters informed the court that it was not possible for them to make any DNA identification of the specimens as they had to be analysed through a chondrosome test, which only the Cracow Institute of Forensic Experts or the Bydgoszcz Forensic Institute could carry out. On 20 May 2002 the court asked the Cracow Institute to make the relevant test and adjourned the trial sine die.', 'In the meantime, the Regional Court had tried to establish the whereabouts of S.U., who was a homeless person. It appears that those efforts have so far been unsuccessful.', 'The proceedings are pending.']",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[]

The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Chişinău.', '11. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '12. The applicant was a deputy mayor of Chişinău and was also a lecturer at the Academy of Economic Studies in Moldova. Between 24 September 2004 and 25 February 2005 he was held in the remand centre of the Centre for Fighting Economic Crime and Corruption (“the CFECC”). On 25 February 2005 he was transferred to Ministry of Justice Remand Centre no. 3 in Chişinău (also known as “Prison no. 3”, subsequently renamed “Prison no. 13”). The applicant suffers from a number of illnesses (see paragraphs 22 and 25 below).', '13. The applicant was accused in three separate sets of criminal proceedings under Article 185 (3) of the old Criminal Code and Article 327 (2) of the new Criminal Code (“the CP”) of abuse of power and acting in excess of authority (excesul de putere sau depăşirea atribuţiilor de serviciu; abuzul de putere sau abuzul de serviciu).', '14. On 17 September 2004 the CFECC opened a criminal investigation concerning the applicant and on 24 September 2004 he was taken into custody.', '15. On 27 September 2004 the Buiucani District Court issued a warrant for his arrest and detention for thirty days. The reasons given by the court for issuing the warrant were that:', '“[The applicant] is dangerous to society. If released he may reoffend, destroy evidence or abscond from the law-enforcement authorities, obstruct the normal course of the investigation or the taking of evidence and influence evidence and witnesses.”', 'On 4 October 2004 the Chişinău Court of Appeal upheld that decision. Judge M.B. dissented, finding no reason to detain the applicant as the prosecution had not submitted any evidence of the alleged danger of his absconding or interfering with the investigation. The applicant had a family and a permanent residence in Chişinău, was ill and had no criminal record.', '16. The applicant made habeas corpus requests on 5, 13 and 19 October, 2 November and 29 December 2004 and 22 February, 23 June and 20 September 2005. He relied on the following elements: his poor state of health; the fact that he had no criminal record; his impeccable reputation as a doctor of economics and a university lecturer; the fact that his identity documents had been seized by the prosecuting authorities so that he could not leave the country; the fact that his family and permanent residence were in Chişinău; the fact that he was supporting his 75-year-old mother who was an invalid; the fact that he had the personal guarantee of three wellknown persons (who had already deposited 3,000 Moldovan lei (MDL) and each of whom was prepared to pay the further MDL 8,000 initially requested by the court); and the lack of reasons for his arrest. All these requests were rejected on grounds similar to those cited in the decision of 27 September 2004.', '17. On 22 October 2004 the case file was submitted to the trial court.', '18. On an unspecified date in October 2004 the prosecution submitted to the trial court a second case file in which the applicant was also identified as one of the accused. The investigation into that case had begun on 28 March 2003. The investigators had twice closed it for lack of evidence (on 15 July and 26 September 2003) but on both occasions a prosecutor had ordered its reopening. On 27 October 2004 both cases were joined.', ""19. On 2 November 2004 Judge L.V., President of the Centru District Court, rejected the applicant's request for release against the personal guarantee of three well-known persons, without giving any reasons."", '20. The applicant appealed but Judge L.V. refused to forward his appeal to the Court of Appeal, on the ground that the law did not provide for an appeal against such decisions. The applicant submitted the appeal to the Chişinău Court of Appeal directly, which also refused to examine it for the same reason. A similar response was given to appeals lodged on 25 February and 27 September 2005.', '21. On 30 December 2004 a third criminal case file was submitted to the trial court, accusing the applicant of abuse of power in his own personal interest. This case was also joined to the two cases against the applicant referred to above.', ""22. On 24 September 2004 the applicant was detained in the CFECC remand centre. On 29 September 2004 a medical advisory board examined the applicant's medical file at his wife's request and made the following diagnosis: type II diabetes (insulin-dependent), polyneuropathy, diabetic angiospasm, stage II autoimmune thyroiditis, after-effects of trauma to the head with intracranial hypertension, vagovagal spasms, chronic obstructive bronchitis, recurrent chronic pancreatitis with endocrine failure, chronic active hepatitis and asthenic syndrome. On 14 November 2004 the applicant's wife informed the trial court of the findings of the medical board."", ""23. According to the applicant, the CFECC remand centre had no medical personnel until late February 2005, when a general practitioner was hired to work there. He claimed that he had requested medical assistance on a number of occasions but had received treatment only from doctors from other institutions who visited him when there was an emergency. On 28 September 2004 an ambulance was called to treat the applicant for acute hypertension. The doctor prescribed a consultation with an endocrinology specialist, who saw the applicant on 21 December 2004. The applicant also informed the prosecutor and the court of his special dietary and medical needs but received no reply. He submitted copies of complaints from his wife, his mother and a parliamentary group to the CFECC authorities, the Prisons Department, the trial court, the President of Moldova, the Minister of Justice and other authorities. The applicant's wife received several formal replies, essentially informing her that her husband had been seen on a number of occasions by various doctors and that he would be given medical assistance should the need arise."", '24. On 15 February 2005 the applicant was seen by Doctor B.E., a psychoneurologist, who concluded that his state of health was “unstable with a slight improvement” and that he needed to continue treatment under supervision. On 25 February 2005 the applicant was transferred to the remand centre of Prison no. 3 in Chişinău.', '25. On 2 March 2005, in accordance with a court order, the applicant was examined by a medical board of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. B.I., a neurologist and member of the board, diagnosed him with encephalopathy, polyneuropathy of endocrinal origin, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease and inferior paraplegia. He recommended that the applicant be treated on an in-patient basis. Z.A., an endocrinologist and member of the board, diagnosed the applicant with diabetes, macro- and micro-angiopathy, cardiomyopathy, arterial hypertension, diabetic steatorrhoeic hepatosis, thyroiditis, hypothyroiditis and encephalopathy. He recommended a special diet and treatment on an in-patient basis in specialised clinics (endocrinology-cardiology-neurology). E.V., head of the Cardiology Department of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and a member of the board, diagnosed the applicant with ischaemic cardiomyopathy and mixed cardiopathy, unstable pectoral angina, prolonged attacks during the previous two weeks, third-degree arterial hypertension, second-degree congestive heart failure, hypertension and endocrinal renal failure, diabetic vascular disease and thoracic dilatation. E.V. recommended that the applicant be treated on an inpatient basis in a cardiology unit in order to investigate and prevent the risk of myocardial infarction. She considered it necessary to undertake anticoagulant treatment but noted that, given the risk of gastric haemorrhage, such treatment could take place only under conditions of strict supervision and with surgeons at hand to intervene if necessary.', ""26. On the basis of these recommendations, the trial court ordered the applicant's transfer to a prison hospital."", '27. On the basis of an order by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Doctor V.P., a neurologist from the Republican Neurology Centre of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (“the RNC”), examined the applicant on 20 May 2005. He confirmed the earlier diagnoses and recommended complex treatment in a specialised neurological unit of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, including treatment with hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy.', ""28. On 30 May 2005 the director of the prison hospital where the applicant was being held informed the court of V.P.'s recommendations and said that the applicant was being given the medication prescribed but not HBO therapy, which it was impossible to administer at the prison hospital due to the lack of the necessary equipment. He also informed the court that the applicant's condition prevented him from attending court hearings."", ""29. On 1 June 2005 the Centru District Court found that the condition of the applicant and of another co-accused had worsened, and suspended examination of their cases “until recovery”. The court did not respond to the applicant's wife's request for his release to allow treatment or to the abovementioned letter from the director of the prison hospital."", '30. By letters of 9, 17 and 22 June, 5 July and 1 August 2005 the director of the prison hospital again informed the court of the lack of the necessary equipment at the hospital for the treatment prescribed by V.P.', '31. On 7 and 15 September 2005 a medical board of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare which included doctors from the RNC examined the applicant and on 16 September 2005 recommended, inter alia, HBO treatment in a specialised neurological unit.', ""32. On 16 September 2005 the director of the prison hospital confirmed on the applicant's behalf that the hospital did not have the necessary equipment for the recommended neurological treatment. That information was submitted to the Centru District Court."", ""33. On 19 September 2005 the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights filed an amicus curiae brief with the court after visiting the applicant in hospital. It considered that the applicant's state of health was irreconcilable with his conditions of detention and treatment and protested against the decision to suspend examination of the case pending his recovery."", '34. In view of the findings of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare medical board of 16 September 2005 recommending that the applicant be treated in a specialised neurological unit, the Centru District Court on 20 September 2005 ordered his transfer to the RNC, a State-run institution, for thirty days. According to the Government, the usual period of treatment at the RNC in September-November 2005 was eight to nine days.', ""35. On 27 September 2005 the applicant requested the Centru District Court to order an expert report on his state of health before and after his arrest as well as his condition on the date of lodging the request. In its decision of the same day the Centru District Court rejected the applicant's request on the ground that no doubts had been raised regarding his state of health."", ""36. On an unspecified date the applicant requested the RNC management to provide a description of his state of health and the treatment received. He received no answer. On 17 October 2005 the court ordered the RNC to answer immediately and the court received its answer on 20 October 2005. In it, the RNC set out its diagnosis of the applicant's condition and found that his health was unstable and that he needed further treatment. On 20 October 2005 the Centru District Court extended the applicant's treatment until 10 November 2005 on the basis of the letter from the RNC."", ""37. According to a certificate issued by the HBO therapy unit of the Republican Clinical Hospital (“the RCH”), the applicant received five HBO therapy sessions there starting on 2 November 2005. The applicant was prescribed a twelvesession course, scheduled to continue until 28 November 2005. According to the applicant, he was escorted from the RNC to the RCH every other day for the procedure and also began a course of acupuncture there. The applicant submitted a copy of the certificate to the Centru District Court, which on 10 November 2005 decided that he should be transferred to the prison hospital. The court based its decision on the RNC's letter of 9 November 2005, which stated that the applicant's condition had stabilised and that he would be discharged on 10 November 2005. The applicant's diagnosis as stated in the letter of 9 November 2005 was as follows: serious, subcompensated type II diabetes (insulindependent), diabetic retinopathy, autoimmune thyroiditis, hypothyroiditis, ischaemic cardiomyopathy, pectoral angina, second-degree arterial hypertension with very high risk, mixed cardiopathy, rare supraventricular extrasystolia, stage II dyscirculatory mixed encephalopathy, cerebral atrophy, pyramidal insufficiency, particularly on the right side, diabetic polyneuropathy and astheno-depressive syndrome. The letter also noted that the applicant's continued detention would “contribute to a permanent state of psycho-emotional tension which, in turn, [would] cause fluctuations in arterial pressure and blood-sugar levels”. The same diagnosis was noted in the medical form for the applicant's discharge from the RNC on 10 November 2005."", '38. Since the RNC letter did not include HBO therapy among its recommendations for treatment, the court found the schedule of HBO treatment extending until the end of November to be irrelevant.', ""39. On 16 November 2005 the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare replied to the Government Agent's questions regarding the need to treat the applicant. The letter stated that on 17 November 2005 the applicant's medical records had been examined by a group of doctors, who found that he did not need in-patient treatment “in any medical establishment, including the [RNC]” and that he could be treated as an outpatient."", '40. On 24 November 2005 the applicant was examined by a psychotherapist, who diagnosed him with cerebral-organic asthenic disturbance, anxious-depressive disturbance of organic-psychogenic origin and severe existential stress.', ""41. On 29 November 2005 the applicant was due to be discharged from the RNC. The medical form for the applicant's discharge from the RNC on 29 November 2005 repeated the diagnosis made on 9 November 2005, adding a diagnosis of prostate abscess. Amongst the recommendations made by the RNC was HBO treatment every second day. On 30 November 2005 the trial court ordered the applicant's transfer to the Republican Clinical Hospital (“the RCH”) for ten days in order to receive HBO treatment. After the hearing the applicant lost consciousness and was taken by ambulance to the Municipal Clinical Hospital (“the MCH”) with suspected myocardial failure. As a result, the trial court amended its decision of the same date and ordered that the applicant be treated in the MCH."", '42. In a letter of 12 February 2007 the applicant submitted to the Court a certificate stating that on 20 June 2006 he had been recognised as having a seconddegree disability.', ""43. On 11 March 2008 the Minister of Health ordered the setting-up of a medical commission for the purpose of determining the applicant's state of health during the period from 21 September to 30 November 2005. The commission established that the applicant had been given all the treatment prescribed by the RNC while in detention in the prison hospital. It further found that HBO treatment had not been required in the applicant's case but was simply an additional treatment for diabetes and its complications. The interruption of the applicant's HBO treatment had not affected his state of health, as proved by his stable blood-sugar levels before and after interruption."", '44. On 23 June 2005 the trial court rejected a habeas corpus request made by the applicant, on the following grounds:', ""“... the reasons for prolonging the accused's detention pending trial remain valid because the charges against him are based on circumstances not yet examined by the court, and altering the preventive measure may hinder the establishment of the truth in the criminal trial.”"", '45. On 8 July 2005 the applicant made another habeas corpus request, relying on Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention and emphasising that while examination of his case had been suspended pending his recovery, he had been refused the medical treatment necessary to ensure such recovery. The court postponed examination of the request. Examination of the request was again postponed on 11 July 2005 for an indefinite period.', '46. On 18 July Judge L.V. was absent and examination of the case was postponed. On 22 July 2005 other members of the court were absent and examination of the case was once more postponed.', '47. On 25 July 2005 the applicant requested a copy of the court transcripts of 8 and 11 July 2005 and informed the court of the worsening of his condition. The request was refused. On 3 August 2005 the Centru District Court informed the applicant that examination of his habeas corpus request had been postponed pending an answer from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare to its enquiry of 7 July 2005 regarding his condition.', ""48. On 20 September 2005 the Centru District Court rejected the applicant's habeas corpus request “because the reasons for prolonging his detention remain valid”. The court also rejected the applicant's complaint that the inadequate medical treatment he had received amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment:"", '“... because the representative of the [prison hospital] declared that [the applicant] had been given the necessary medical treatment on an in-patient basis; there is no evidence of inhuman or degrading treatment.”', ""At the same time, however, the court ordered the applicant's transfer to the RNC (see paragraph 34 above)."", '49. On 27 September 2005 an appeal by the applicant against the refusal of his habeas corpus request was not examined, the court finding that no further appeal was possible. The court also rejected his request for a medical examination to establish his current state of health and the manner in which he had been treated during his detention.', '50. On 11 October 2005 the applicant made another habeas corpus request challenging, inter alia, the persistence of any reasonable suspicion justifying his continued detention. He referred to the finding of a violation of Article 5 of the Convention in the case of Sarban v. Moldova (no. 3456/05, 4 October 2005) as a new circumstance warranting reexamination of the need to detain him. The court rejected the request, finding that it could not be submitted until one month at least after the last such request had been examined. It also found that the judgment referred to was not a new circumstance, as it related only to Mr Sarban and not to the applicant.', '51. On 10 November 2005 the applicant asked the Centru District Court to order his continued treatment at the RNC or his release based on his habeas corpus request. The court rejected the request to continue treatment at the RNC (see paragraph 37 above) and did not examine the habeas corpus request.', ""52. On 15 November 2005 the Centru District Court rejected the applicant's habeas corpus request of 10 November 2005, finding that:"", '“... not all the evidence has been examined; [the applicant] has worked as a deputy mayor of Chişinău and continues to have influence over witnesses yet to be questioned; he may obstruct the presentation to the court of authentic evidence still being kept by Chişinău Municipality.”', ""53. On 15 December 2005 the applicant's detention pending trial was replaced with an obligation not to leave his city of residence."", '54. On the evening of Thursday 10 November 2005 the Court indicated by facsimile to the Moldovan Government an interim measure under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, stating that “the applicant should not be transferred from the [RNC]. This interim measure will be valid until the Court will have the opportunity to examine the case, i.e. until 29 November 2005 at the latest”. The same message was sent several times by facsimile during the morning of Friday 11 November 2005. On 11 November 2005, the Deputy Registrar of the Fourth Section made several calls to the telephone numbers indicated by the Government Agent, but received no response.', ""55. On the morning of Friday 11 November 2005 the applicant's lawyer requested the trial court to stay execution of its decision of 10 November 2005 and to prevent the applicant's transfer from the RNC. He submitted a copy of the facsimile from the European Court of Human Rights regarding the interim measure. The Centru District Court did not hold a hearing and did not reply to his request. The applicant was finally transferred to the prison hospital on the same day."", ""56. On Monday 14 November 2005 the applicant's lawyer informed the President of the Supreme Council of the Judiciary (Consiliul Superior al Magistraturii) of the failure of Judge L.V., President of the Centru District Court, to examine his request of 11 November 2005, and asked for urgent action in order to ensure compliance with the Court's directions for interim measures. On the same day the lawyer submitted a similar request to the Agent of the Moldovan Government before the Court and to the Prosecutor General's Office, noting that the prosecutor in charge of the case had supported the applicant's request to continue being treated at the RNC. He also noted that the decision to transfer the applicant to the prison hospital had not been enforced by 10 a.m., when he had lodged his request with the Centru District Court."", ""57. On the same date and following the Government Agent's request, the Centru District Court ordered the applicant's readmission to the RNC until 29 November 2005. The subsequent events are disputed by the parties. According to the applicant, he was brought to the RNC at 6.30 p.m., but for six hours the management refused to admit him. When the applicant began to feel ill, the management admitted him after midnight. According to the Government, the applicant was admitted on the day the Centru District Court ordered his admission and the delay resulted from the doctors' view that the applicant did not require further treatment at the RNC. The Government Agent personally oversaw execution of the order."", '58. The applicant submitted a copy of a news report broadcast on the PRO-TV television channel, which showed the events at the RNC. The reporter stated that the applicant had been kept waiting for six hours for a decision and that he had finally been admitted after midnight. The doctors informed the reporter that they had refused initially to admit the applicant because they did not have his personal medical file, and had admitted him only when the medical file was brought to them. In an interview given to the same reporter, the Government Agent stated that the reason for the delay in admitting the applicant had been “certain technical, organisational issues”. This was confirmed by a statement from the deputy head of the Prisons Department.', ""59. On 12 December 2005 the Supreme Council of the Judiciary informed the applicant's lawyer, in response to his letter of Monday 14 November 2005, that the Centru District Court had been officially informed of the European Court's directions for interim measures via a facsimile from the Government Agent on 14 November 2005 at 2.19 p.m. Following an urgent court hearing, the trial court had ordered the applicant's readmission to the RNC."", '60. The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (“the CCP”) read as follows:', '“1. Preventive measures may be applied by the prosecuting authority or by the court only in those cases where there are serious grounds for believing that an accused ... will abscond, obstruct the establishment of the truth during the criminal proceedings or reoffend; alternatively, they can be applied by the court in order to ensure the enforcement of a sentence.', '2. Detention pending trial and alternative preventive measures may be imposed only in cases concerning offences in respect of which the law provides for a custodial sentence exceeding two years. In cases concerning offences in respect of which the law provides for a custodial sentence of less than two years, they may be applied if ... the accused has already committed the acts mentioned in paragraph 1.', '3. In deciding on the necessity of applying preventive measures, the prosecuting authority and the court shall take into consideration the following additional criteria:', '(1) the nature and degree of harm caused by the offence;', '(2) the character of the ... accused;', '(3) his/her age and state of health;', '(4) his/her occupation;', '(5) his/her family status and the existence of any dependants;', '(6) his/her economic status;', '(7) the existence of a permanent place of abode;', '(8) other essential circumstances...”', '“1. Requests ... shall be examined and decided upon immediately after being lodged. If the authority to which the request is addressed cannot decide upon it immediately, it shall give its decision within three days from the date of receipt. ...”', '61. Following the entry into force of the new Code of Criminal Procedure on 12 June 2003, the first-instance courts were obliged to ensure that a judge was on duty at weekends and on public holidays to deal with any urgent matters. According to a certificate issued by the President of the Centru District Court, that court had put in place a duty roster of this kind.', '62. In its judgment in LaGrand (judgment of 27 June 2001, ICJ Reports 2001, §§ 111-115)), the International Court of Justice decided that:', '“111. As regards the question whether the United States has complied with the obligation incumbent upon it as a result of the Order of 3 March 1999, the Court observes that the Order indicated two provisional measures, the first of which states that', ""'[t]he United States of America should take al1 measures at its disposal to ensure that Walter LaGrand is not executed pending the final decision in these proceedings, and should inform the Court of al1 the measures which it has taken in implementation of this Order'."", ""The second measure required the Government of the United States to 'transmit this Order to the Governor of the State of Arizona'. ... the State Department had transmitted to the Governor of Arizona a copy of the Court's Order. ..."", ""The United States authorities have thus limited themselves to the mere transmission of the text of the Order to the Governor of Arizona. This certainly met the requirement of the second of the two measures indicated. As to the first measure, the Court notes that it did not create an obligation of result, but that the United States was asked to 'take al1 measures at its disposal to ensure that Walter LaGrand is not executed pending the final decision in these proceedings'. The Court agrees that due to the extremely late presentation of the request for provisional measures, there was certainly very little time for the United States authorities to act."", '112. The Court observes, nevertheless, that the mere transmission of its Order to the Governor of Arizona without any comment, particularly without even so much as a plea for a temporary stay and an explanation that there is no general agreement on the position of the United States that orders of the International Court of Justice on provisional measures are non-binding, was certainly less than could have been done even in the short time available. ...', ""113. It is also noteworthy that the Governor of Arizona, to whom the Court's Order had been transmitted, decided not to give effect to it, even though the Arizona Clemency Board had recommended a stay of execution for Walter LaGrand."", ""114. Finally, the United States Supreme Court rejected a separate application by Germany for a stay of execution, '[g]iven the tardiness of the pleas and the jurisdictional barriers they implicate'. Yet it would have been open to the Supreme Court, as one of its members urged, to grant a preliminary stay, which would have given it 'time to consider, after briefing from al1 interested parties, the jurisdictional and international legal issues involved . . .' (Federal Republic of Germany et al. v. United States et al., United States Supreme Court, 3 March 1999)."", ""115. The review of the above steps taken by the authorities of the United States with regard to the Order of the International Court of Justice of 3 March 1999 indicates that the various competent United States authorities failed to take al1 the steps they could have taken to give effect to the Court's Order. The Order did not require the United States to exercise powers it did not have: but it did impose the obligation to 'take al1 measures at its disposal to ensure that Walter LaGrand is not executed pending the final decision in these proceedings ...'. The Court finds that the United States did not discharge this obligation."", 'Under these circumstances the Court concludes that the United States has not complied with the Order of 3 March 1999.”']","['3', '34', '5']",['5-1'],[],[],[],[]

On 24 October 1997, the prosecutor committed the applicant for trial before the Bucharest County Court.', '6. The Bucharest County Court acquitted the applicant in a judgment of 2 December 1998, upheld, on 9 June 1999, by the Bucharest Court of Appeal. However, in a final decision of 21 March 2000, the Supreme Court of Justice reversed the judgment, convicted the applicant and sentenced him to four years and six months’ imprisonment.

On 8 October 2001, the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the extraordinary appeal. It quashed the final decision of 21 March 2000, the decision of 9 June 1999 and the judgment of 2 December 1998 and sent the case back to the prosecutor to continue the investigations. It held that the evidence adduced in the case was contradictory and needed further clarification before the case could be tried by the courts.', '9. In a decision of 10 July 2002, the prosecutor attached to the Supreme Court of Justice closed the criminal investigations against the applicant. On 23 May 2003, the same prosecutor informed the applicant that he had reversed his previous decision and reopened the criminal investigations in the case.', '10. On 18 March 2004 the prosecutor again committed the applicant for trial before the Bucharest County Court, which acquitted the applicant in a judgment of 15 December 2005.', '11. The prosecutor attached to the Bucharest County Court appealed against this judgment to the Bucharest Court of Appeal, where the case is still pending today.', '12. In a judgment of 26 June 2003, the Bucharest County Court dismissed as premature a civil action lodged by the applicant against the State through its Ministry of Finances, seeking damages for his arrest, which he judged to have been illegal. It appears from the file that the applicant did not appeal against this judgment.']",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[]

The applicant, Ayten Ünal Tekeli, is a Turkish national, born in 1965 and living in İzmir.', '10. After her marriage on 25 December 1990 the applicant, who was then a trainee lawyer, took her husband’s name pursuant to Article 153 of the Turkish Civil Code. As she was known by her maiden name in her professional life, she continued putting it in front of her legal surname. However, she could not use both names together on official documents.', '11. On 22 February 1995 the applicant brought proceedings in the Karşıyaka Court of First Instance (“the Court of First Instance”) for permission to use only her maiden name, “Ünal”. On 4 April 1995 the Court of First Instance dismissed the applicant’s request on the ground that, under Article 153 of the Turkish Civil Code, married women had to bear their husband’s name throughout their married life.', '12. An appeal by the applicant on points of law was dismissed by the Court of Cassation on 6 June 1995. The decision was served on the applicant on 23 June 1995.', '13. By one of the amendments made to Article 153 of the Civil Code on 14 May 1997, married women acquired the right to put their maiden name in front of their husband’s surname. The applicant preferred not to make use of that possibility because, in her view, the amendment in question did not satisfy her demand, which was to use her maiden name alone as her surname.', 'On 22 November 2001 the new Civil Code was enacted. Article 187 was worded identically to the former Article 153.', '14. The Civil Code:', '“Married women shall bear their husband’s name. ... .”', '“Married women shall bear their husband’s name. However, they can make a written declaration to the Registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths on signing the marriage deed, or at the Registry of Births, Marriages and Deaths after the marriage, if they wish to keep their maiden name in front of their surname... .”', '15. The Constitution:', '“All individuals shall be equal before the law without any distinction based on language, race, colour, sex, political opinion, philosophical belief, religion, membership of a religious sect or other similar grounds.', '...”', '“...', 'International treaties that are duly in force are legally binding. Their constitutionality cannot be challenged in the Constitutional Court.”', '“Where a court considers that the applicable provisions of a law or legislative decree are contrary to the Constitution or that one of the parties has raised a serious objection on grounds of unconstitutionality, it shall defer its decision until the Constitutional Court rules on the question.', '...', 'The Constitutional Court shall rule and deliver its judgment publicly within five months of the date on which the case was referred to it. If judgment has not been delivered within the aforesaid time-limit, the lower court shall rule on the case in accordance with the statutory provisions in force. However, if it receives the judgment of the Constitutional Court before the judgment on the merits becomes final, the lower court is obliged to comply with it.', '... .”', '16. After Article 153 of the Civil Code was amended the Ankara District Court raised an objection with the Constitutional Court, arguing that the provision was unconstitutional. In a decision of 29 September 1998 (E 1997/61, K 1998/59) the Court dismissed the objection for the following reasons:', '“The rule according to which married women bear their husband’s name derives from certain social realities and is the result of the codification of certain customs that have formed over centuries in Turkish society. According to the thinking behind family law, the purpose of the rule is to protect women, who are of a more delicate nature than men, strengthen family bonds, nurture the prosperity of the marriage, and preclude bicephalous authority within the same family.', 'For the sake of protecting family unity the legislature has recognised the primacy of the husband’s name over the wife’s. Considerations of public interest and policy have been decisive. Moreover, under the new provision women are now allowed to keep their maiden name in front of their surname ... .', 'Furthermore, the contention that this provision infringes Article 10 of the Constitution, which prohibits any discrimination on the ground of sex, is not founded either. The principle of equality within the meaning of Article 10 of the Constitution does not mean that everyone is subject to the same rules of law. The special characteristics of each person or each group of persons may reasonably justify the application of different rules of law... .”', '17. Two texts of the Committee of Ministers deal with the issue of family name or equality between the sexes in general contexts: Resolution (78) 37 of 27 September 1978 on equality of spouses in civil law (which precedes the said Protocol) and Recommendation R (85) 2 of 5 February 1985 on legal protection against sex discrimination.', 'In the resolution the Committee of Ministers observes that certain forms of sex discrimination still exist in the legislation and practice of some member states and calls on these states to eliminate all such discrimination in the choice of family name and the transmission of parents’ surnames to their children. Paragraph 6 of the resolution proposes a number of solutions to this effect:', '“6. ... regulate matters concerning the family name of the spouses to ensure that a spouse is not required by law to change his family name in order to adopt the family name of the other spouse and, in doing so, to be guided for instance by one of the following systems:', 'i. choice of a common family name in agreement with the other spouse, in particular the family name of one of the spouses, the family name formed by the addition of the family names of both spouses or a name other than the family name of either spouse;', 'ii . retention by each spouse of the family name he possessed prior to marriage;', 'iii. formation of a common family name by the operation of law by the addition of the family names of both spouses;”', 'In the recommendation the Committee of Ministers, aware that equality between men and women has not yet been fully achieved in this area in spite of the extensive work carried out by member states, recommends the member states to take or reinforce, as the case may be, all measures they consider appropriate with a view to achieving that equality in respect of, among other things, the family name. The measures may be implemented not only by legislative changes, but also by the creation of effective legal remedies against discrimination and sanctions in case of failure to comply with such provisions. It also recommends the adoption of suitable machinery to promote this equality (mediation body for example).', '18. In its Recommendation 1271 (1995) of 28 April 1995 on discrimination between men and women in the choice of a surname and in the passing on of parents’ names to children the Assembly recommends that the Committee of Ministers identify those member states which retain sexist discrimination and ask them to take the appropriate measures to, inter alia, “ensure strict equality in the event of marriage with regard to the choice of a common surname for both marriage partners” (no. 5, ii).', '19. In its reply of 3 April 1996 the Committee of Ministers accepted that each country had its own legal system in this area, depending on “customs and local traditions”, but stressed that these legal systems should not include any discriminatory provisions. It was with this in mind that the recommendation was transmitted to the Governments of the member states.', '20. In its Recommendation 1362 (1998) of 18 March 1998 the Assembly considered that it was not enough for the Committee of Ministers merely to transmit the 1995 recommendation to member states. It recommended that the Committee of Ministers ask each member state to advise it of the period within which it undertook to comply with the principle of non-discrimination. As to the rest, it reiterated its previous recommendations.', '21. In reply the Committee of Ministers stated on 20 October 1998 that it shared the views of the Parliamentary Assembly in that respect and informed it that it had transmitted both recommendations to the European Committee on Legal Co-operation (CDCJ) and to the Steering Committee for Equality between Women and Men (CDEG) for them to examine the situation in detail and suggest action to be taken within a reasonable time scale.', '22. The Committee had already examined the issues raised by the choice of family name by married couples in 1982-1983 as a follow-up to Recommendation no. 2 of the XIIIth Conference of European Ministers of Justice. In its final activity report of 5 October 1983 concerning the acquisition of a family name the Committee concluded that the wide variety of solutions adopted by national laws made any attempt at harmonisation in this field difficult.', '23. The Committee reconsidered the question in 1995 and then in 1999 after the Committee of Ministers had transmitted the two recommendations by the Parliamentary Assembly. The examination of the issue was entrusted to the Committee of Family Law Experts. Experts from different countries were asked to submit observations on the legal position and practice in their country. From the observations submitted by the various Governments it emerged that many countries had recently reformed their legislation or that a reform was then underway in respect of other countries (see, for example, Albania, CDCJ (99) 33, Switzerland, CDCJ (99) 9, Turkey, CDCJ (99) 23). The reforms promoted greater clarity and complete equality between men and women before the law regarding their surname.', '24. The Committee examined these observations in the light of Resolution (78) 37 and Recommendation R (85) 2 of the Committee of Ministers. While noting that the solutions provided by the resolution were still valid, it found that implementation of the resolution by some countries was still incomplete even if most had eliminated all discrimination concerning the surname of spouses. Although the existence of different customs and traditions precluded a unique solution, paragraph 6 of Resolution (78) 37 provided a large choice of non-discriminatory solutions. The committee proposed, lastly, that the Committee of Ministers fix a time-limit for undertaking legislative reforms.', '25. The European Committee on Legal Co-operation reconsidered the matter on the basis of that opinion. In 1995 it noted that certain States did not meet the conditions contained in the resolution regarding, among other things, the joint name of married couples (Extract from the report of the 64th meeting of the CDCJ, CDCJ (95) 76, Appendix III) and asked them to re-examine their laws on this subject. It also encouraged them to implement the principle contained in paragraph 1.g of Article 16 of the Convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women (adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 18 December 1979, Treaty Series, vol. 1249, 1981, no. I-20379, pp. 24 et seq.) and to withdraw the reservations made to this provision. In its conclusions the CDCJ considered that the diversity of customs and local traditions should be respected, but that the States concerned should be requested to take all necessary steps to avoid such discrimination between men and women (nos. 9 and 10).', '26. In its draft opinion sent to the Committee of Ministers in 1999 the CDCJ found that several States had recently amended their domestic laws in this respect, but that others had not yet done so (no. 4). It considered that the diversity of customs and local traditions should be respected and that there was no reason to impose a uniform system. Paragraph 17 of Resolution (78) 37 already provided a large choice of solutions (no. 5). States which still have provisions that discriminate against women in respect of surnames must take all necessary steps, in due course, to avoid such discrimination (no. 6).', '27. Article 3 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 19 December 1966) provides that “the States Parties to the present Covenant undertake to ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all civil and political rights set forth in the present Covenant.” This requirement of equality is confirmed in respect of marriage in Article 23, paragraph 4, the text of which served as a basis for Article 5 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention, which Turkey has not yet ratified (see above):', '“States Parties to the present Covenant shall take appropriate steps to ensure equality of rights and responsibilities of spouses as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution. In the case of dissolution, provision shall be made for the necessary protection of any children.”', 'The Covenant has been ratified by many member states of the Council of Europe, but not by Turkey (which signed it on 15 August 2000).', '28. The United Nations Human Rights Committee has interpreted Article 23, paragraph 4, as obliging States Parties to ensure that there is no discrimination between men and women, including in respect of the right of each spouse to keep using their own surname or to have an equal say in the choice of new surname.', '29. In addition, Article 16, paragraph 1(g) of the Convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women provides:', '“States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in all matters relating to marriage and family relations and in particular shall ensure, on a basis of equality of men and women:', '...', '(g) The same personal rights as husband and wife, including the right to choose a family name, a profession and an occupation;”', '30. Many member states of the Council of Europe have ratified this convention, including Turkey. When it ratified it, on 19 January 1996, Turkey made a reservation to the effect that certain provisions of the Civil Code concerning family relations might not be compatible with Articles 15 and 16 of the Convention, including Article 16, paragraph 1(g). In a declaration of 20 September 1999 the Turkish Government withdrew that reservation.', '31. The committee with the task of applying this convention (Part V, Articles 17 et seq.) has, in reports concerning different countries (CEDAW Report of 1 May 2000, A/55/38 part I (2000) 21, §§ 172-75 and CEDAW Report of 20 April 2001, A/56/38 part I (2001) 26, §§ 211-16), affirmed women’s rights regarding the choice of family name and the possibility of keeping their own name if they so desire.', 'THE LAW', '32. The Government raised two preliminary objections based, respectively, on the applicant’s lack of victim status and the failure to comply with the six-month time-limit.', '33. The Government disputed that the applicant was a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention. They observed that at the time of her marriage the applicant, who was a trainee lawyer, was not qualified to practise as a lawyer. When she began practising she had already taken her husband’s name. The Government therefore maintained that the applicant’s change of name following her marriage could not have created problems in her professional life.', '34. The applicant contended that it was during their legal training that trainees established their first professional links and that this period could not be dissociated from the rest of their career. She also submitted that, beyond the professional aspect, a person’s name was particularly important in the construction of their identity. The obligation on the applicant to change her maiden name as a result of her marriage had thus given rise to an irreversible severance with her past.', '35. The Court is not required to determine whether the obligation on the applicant to change her surname as a result of marrying when she was a trainee lawyer may adversely affect her subsequent professional life. It reiterates that besides professional or business contexts, the surname concerns and identifies a person in their private and family life regarding the ability to establish and develop social, cultural or other relationships with other human beings (see, mutatis mutandis, Niemietz v. Germany, judgment of 16 December 1992, Series A no. 251-B, § 29). The Court considers that in the instant case the refusal to allow the applicant to use just her own surname, Ünal, by which she claimed to have been known in private circles and in her cultural or political activities may have considerably affected her non-professional activities.', 'The applicant is therefore a victim of the impugned decisions (see, to the same effect, Burghartz v. Switzerland, judgment of 22 February 1994, series A no. 280B, § 18).', '36. The Government pleaded failure to comply with the six-month rule. In their submission, given that the situation complained of flowed from the domestic law the national courts were not in a position to accede to the applicant’s request. In these conditions the application should have been lodged within six months of the date of her marriage, that is, by 25 June 1991 at the latest.', '37. The Court reiterates that where no domestic remedy is available in respect of an act alleged to be in violation of the Convention, the six-month time-limit in principle starts to run from the date on which the act complained of took place or the date on which an applicant was directly affected by such an act. However, special considerations might apply in exceptional cases where applicants first avail themselves of a domestic remedy and only at a later stage become aware of the circumstances which make that remedy ineffective. In such a situation, the six-month period might be calculated from the time when the applicant becomes aware of these circumstances (see Aydın v. Turkey (dec.), nos. 28293/95, 29494/95 and 30219/96, ECHR 2000III (extracts)).', '38. In the instant case it is true that the position complained of before the Court was actually in conformity with the provisions of Article 153 of the Civil Code. However, the Court notes that in the proceedings before them the domestic courts could have directly applied the provisions of the Convention, which forms an integral part of the domestic law by virtue of Article 90 of the Constitution, or raised an objection that Article 153 of the Civil Code was unconstitutional (under Article 152 of the Constitution) and, lastly, they could have granted the applicant’s request. Consequently, even if it is accepted that the remedy offered only a remote prospect of success, as alleged here, it was not a futile step. Accordingly, it had the effect at least of postponing the beginning of the six-month period (see, mutatis mutandis, A. v. France, judgment of 23 November 1993, Series A no. 277-B, § 30).', 'This preliminary objection of the Government must therefore be rejected.', 'II. ALLEGED BREACH OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 8', '39. The applicant submitted that the national authorities’ refusal to allow her to bear only her maiden name after her marriage amounted to a breach of Article 8 of the Convention, read alone and in conjunction with Article 14.', 'Article 8 of the Convention provides:', '“1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.', '2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”', 'Article 14 provides:', '“The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.”', '40. In view of the nature of the allegations made, the Court considers it appropriate to examine the case directly under Article 14 of the Convention taken together with Article 8.', '41. The Government disputed the applicability of Article 8 of the Convention in the present case. They maintained that the choice of name was not entirely a matter of a person’s individual choice and that the States had a wide margin of appreciation in the area. In their submission, the legislation on assigning names had to remain within the State’s domain and did not come within the scope of the Convention.', '42. The Court reiterates that Article 8 of the Convention does not contain any explicit provisions on names, but as a means of personal identification and of linking to a family, a person’s name nonetheless concerns his or her private and family life. The fact that there may exist a public interest in regulating the use of names is not sufficient to remove the question of a person’s name from the scope of private and family life, which has been construed as including, to a certain degree, the right to establish relationships with others (see Burghartz, cited above, § 24).', 'The subject-matter of the complaint thus falls within the scope of Article 8 of the Convention.', '43. The applicant complained that the authorities had refused to allow her to bear only her own surname after her marriage whereas Turkish law allowed married men to bear their own surname. She submitted that this resulted in discrimination on grounds of sex and was incompatible with Article 8 taken together with Article 14 of the Convention.', '44. The Government acknowledged that it amounted to a difference in treatment on grounds of sex but argued that this was based on objective and reasonable grounds which prevented it from being in any way discriminatory.', '45. Referring to the Burghartz judgment cited above, they submitted that there was a link between family unity and the family name and that by providing that families should take the husband’s surname the Turkish legislature had opted for a traditional arrangement whereby family unity was reflected in a joint name. In the Government’s submission, family unity was a public policy consideration and private life ceased where the individual entered into contact with public life.', '46. Referring to the Constitutional Court’s decision of 29 September 1998 (E 1997/61, K 1998/59, see above), the Government argued that the difference of treatment on grounds of sex was justified in view of the social reality in Turkey. Pointing out that “68.8% of women had very limited economic freedom”, the Government argued that a joint surname – reflected through the husband’s surname – was designed to strengthen the wife’s position in the family.', '47. The Government reiterated that since Article 153 of the Civil Code had been amended on 14 May 1997 married women could now keep their maiden name in front of their family name.', '48. The Government also pointed out that major difficulties would be occasioned by a change in the system of keeping registers of births, marriages and deaths.', '49. The Court reiterates that Article 14 of the Convention affords protection against discrimination in the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms safeguarded by the other substantive provisions of the Convention. However, not every difference in treatment will amount to a violation of this Article. It must be established that other persons in an analogous or relevantly similar situation enjoy preferential treatment and that this distinction is discriminatory (see, for example, National & Provincial Building Society, Leeds Permanent Building Society and Yorkshire Building Society v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 23 October 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VII, § 88).', '50. According to the Court’s case-law a difference of treatment is discriminatory within the meaning of Article 14 if it has no objective and reasonable justification. The existence of such a justification must be assessed in relation to the principles which normally prevail in democratic societies. A difference of treatment in the exercise of a right laid down by the Convention must not only pursue a legitimate aim: Article 14 is likewise violated when it is clearly established that there is no “reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised” (see, for example, Petrovic v. Austria, judgment of 27 March 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998II, § 30, and Lithgow and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 102, § 177).', '51. In other words, the notion of discrimination includes in general cases where a person or group is treated, without proper justification, less favourably than another, even though the more favourable treatment is not called for by the Convention (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, § 82). Article 14 does not prohibit distinctions in treatment which are founded on an objective assessment of essentially different factual circumstances and which, being based on the public interest, strike a fair balance between the protection of the interests of the community and respect for the rights and freedoms safeguarded by the Convention (see, among other authorities, G.M.B. and K.M. v. Switzerland (dec.), no. 36797/97, 27 September 2001).', '52. The Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment in law. The scope of the margin of appreciation will vary according to the circumstances, the subject-matter and its background (see Rasmussen v. Denmark, judgment of 28 November 1984, Series A no. 87, § 40, and Inze v. Austria, judgment of 28 October 1987, Series A no. 126, § 41).', '53. However, very weighty reasons have to be put forward before a difference of treatment based on the ground of sex alone can be regarded as compatible with the Convention (see Schuler-Zgraggen v. Switzerland, judgment of 24 June 1993, Series A no. 263, § 67).', '54. Since the Convention is first and foremost a system for the protection of human rights, the Court must however have regard to the changing conditions in Contracting States and respond, for example, to any emerging consensus as to the standards to be achieved (see, mutatis mutandis, Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, § 68, ECHR 2002IV).', '55. The applicant’s complaint concerns the fact that, legally, married women cannot bear their maiden name alone after they marry whereas married men keep the surname they had before they married. This is undoubtedly a “difference in treatment” on grounds of sex between persons in an analogous situation.', '56. The factual differences between the two categories (married men and married women) to which the Government refer, that is, those relating to their social situation and their economic independence respectively, do not lead the Court to a different conclusion.', 'It is precisely this distinction which is at the heart of the issue whether the difference in treatment complained of is justifiable.', '57. In the Government’s submission, the interference in question pursued the legitimate aim of reflecting family unity through the husband’s surname and thereby ensuring public order. The applicant refuted that argument.', '58. The Court reiterates that although the Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation under the Convention regarding the measures to be taken in reflecting family unity, Article 14 requires that any such measure, in principle, applies even-handedly to both men and women unless compelling reasons have been adduced to justify a difference in treatment.', 'In the present case the Court is not persuaded that such reasons exist.', '59. The Court reiterates in the first place that the advancement of the equality of the sexes is today a major goal in the member States of the Council of Europe. Two texts of the Committee of Ministers, namely, Resolution (78) 37 of 27 September 1978 on equality of spouses in civil law and Recommendation R (85) 2 of 5 February 1985 on legal protection against sex discrimination, are the main examples of this. These texts call on the member states to eradicate all discrimination on grounds of sex in, among other things, choice of surname. This objective has also been stated in the work of the Parliamentary Assembly (see paragraphs 19-22 above) and the European Committee on Legal Co-operation (see paragraphs 23-27 above).', '60. On an international level, developments in the United Nations concerning the equality of the sexes are heading in this specific area towards recognition of the right of each married partner to keep his or her own surname or to have an equal say in the choice of new family name (see paragraphs 23-27 above).', '61. Moreover, the Court notes the emergence of a consensus among the Contracting States of the Council of Europe in favour of choosing the spouses’ family name on an equal footing.', 'Of the member states of the Council of Europe Turkey is the only country which legally imposes – even where the couple prefers an alternative arrangement – the husband’s name as the couple’s surname and thus the automatic loss of the woman’s own surname on her marriage. Married women in Turkey cannot use their maiden name alone even if both spouses agree to such an arrangement. The possibility made available by the Turkish legislature on 22 November 2001 of putting the maiden name in front of the husband’s surname does not alter that position. The interests of married women who do not want their marriage to affect their name have not been taken into consideration.', '62. The Court observes, moreover, that Turkey does not position itself outside the general trend towards placing men and women on an equal footing in the family. Prior to the relevant legislative amendments, particularly those of 22 November 2001, the man’s position in the family was the dominant one. The reflection of family unity through the husband’s surname corresponded to the traditional conception of the family maintained by the Turkish legislature until then. The aim of the reforms of November 2001 was to place married women on an equal footing with their husband in representing the couple, in economic activities and in the decisions to be taken affecting the family and children. Among other things the husband’s role as head of the family has been abolished. Both married partners have acquired the power to represent the family. Despite the enactment of the Civil Code in 2001, however, the provisions concerning the family name after marriage, including those obliging married women to take their husband’s name, have remained unchanged.', '63. The first question for the Court is whether the tradition of reflecting family unity through the husband’s name can be regarded as a decisive factor in the present case. Admittedly, that tradition derives from the man’s primordial role and the woman’s secondary role in the family. Nowadays the advancement of the equality of the sexes in the member states of the Council of Europe, including Turkey, and in particular the importance attached to the principle of non-discrimination, prevent States from imposing that tradition on married women.', '64. In this context it should be recalled that while family unity can be reflected by choosing the husband’s surname as the family name, it can be reflected just as well by choosing the wife’s surname or a joint name chosen by the couple (see Burghartz, cited above, § 28).', '65. The second question that the Court is asked to address is whether family unity has to be reflected by a joint family name and whether, in the event of disagreement between the married partners, one partner’s surname can be imposed on the other.', '66. The Court observes in this regard that, according to the practice of the Contracting States, it is perfectly conceivable that family unity will be preserved and consolidated where a married couple chooses not to bear a joint family name. Observation of the systems applicable in Europe supports this finding. The Government have not shown in the present case that concrete or substantial hardship for married partners and/or third parties or detriment to the public interest would be likely to flow from the lack of reflection of family unity through a joint family name. In these circumstances the Court considers that the obligation on married women, in the name of family unity, to bear their husband’s surname – even if they can put their maiden name in front of it – has no objective and reasonable justification.', '67. The Court does not underestimate the important repercussions which a change in the system, involving a transition from the traditional system of family name based on the husband’s surname to other systems allowing the married partners either to keep their own surname or freely choose a joint family name, will inevitably have for keeping registers of births, marriages and deaths. However, it considers that society may reasonably be expected to tolerate a certain inconvenience to enable individuals to live in dignity and worth in accordance with the name they have chosen (see, mutatis mutandis, Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28957/95, § 91, ECHR 2002VI).', '68. Consequently, the objective of reflecting family unity through a joint family name cannot provide a justification for the gender-based difference in treatment complained of in the instant case.', 'Accordingly, the difference in treatment in question contravenes Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8.', '69. Having regard to that conclusion, the Court does not consider it necessary to determine whether there has also been a breach of Article 8 taken alone.', 'III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION', '70. Article 41 of the Convention provides:', '“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”', '71. The applicant alleged that she had sustained non-pecuniary damage which she assessed at 15,000 euros (EUR).', '72. The Government disputed that claim.', '73. The Court considers that it is for the Turkish State to implement in due course such measures as it considers appropriate to fulfil its obligations to secure to each married partner, including the applicant, the right to keep their own surname or to have an equal say in the choice of their family name in compliance with this judgment.', 'While there is no doubt that the applicant has suffered distress and anxiety in the past, it is the inability of married women under Turkish law to keep their maiden name which lies at the heart of the complaints in the instant case. The Court does not therefore find it appropriate to make an award to the applicant, seeing that in the circumstances of the present case the finding of a violation, with the consequences which will ensue for the future, may be regarded as constituting just satisfaction.', '74. The applicant also claimed EUR 1,750 for the costs and expenses incurred before the domestic courts and the Court. She referred to resolution no. 36 of 24 June 2003 of the executive committee of the İzmir Bar (rate applicable from 1 July 2003 to 31 December 2003).', '75. Having regard to the information before it and to its relevant case-law, the Court awards the applicant EUR 1,750.', '76. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.']","['14', '8']",[],[],[],[],[]

The first applicant was born in 1968 and is currently in prison in the Isle of Wight, the second was born in 1961 and lives in London and the third was born in 1980 and lives in Leeds. The fourth applicant was born in 1976.', '6. On 15 March 1996 the applicant was sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment following a conviction for causing grievous bodily harm.', '7. It was later alleged that on 5 June 1998, as he was being transferred to HMP Parkhurst, a fight broke out during which he “headbutted” one of the prison officers. On 6 June 1998 he was charged with assault contrary to Rule 47(1) of the Prison Rules 1964.', '8. The adjudication hearing before the governor commenced on 22 June and continued on 23 June 1998 when a letter was received from the applicant’s solicitor requesting that he be legally represented at the hearing. The governor adjourned the hearing until 14 July 1998 to consider the request. On 7 July 1998 legal aid was granted by the Legal Aid Board for representation prior to and at the adjudication hearing.', '9. On 8 July 1998 the applicant orally outlined to the governor why he needed legal representation but the governor rejected the request:', '“I have considered the case for legal [representation]. I do not feel there is an issue of seriousness or potential penalty. You are able to conduct your defence. You have access to check original with the prisoners you may call as witness. I do not consider you have been unfairly treated in comparison with the other prisoner so charged. No points of law are in question”.', '10. By letter of 28 July 1998 the applicant’s solicitors asked the governor to reconsider. By letter of 30 July 1998 the prison service responded explaining that in considering requests for representation governors did not need to be sure beyond reasonable doubt that representation was not needed before rejecting a request but were required to take account of the six criteria set out in the “Tarrant principles” (R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Tarrant [1984] QB 251).', '11. The adjudication hearing resumed on 25 September 1998. The applicant again requested legal representation for the hearing without success. The governor found the applicant guilty (adding “whether your actions were deliberate or reckless, although you have not advanced that as a defence”) and sentenced him to 21 “additional days” pursuant to Rule 50 (1) (f) of the Prison Rules 1964.', '12. On 5 November 1998 his solicitors appealed to the Secretary of State referring to the imminent incorporation into domestic law of Article 6 of the Convention and to the failure to grant legal representation for the hearing. By letter dated 10 December 1998 the Secretary of State rejected the appeal stating that the adjudication had been thoroughly reviewed, that the hearing had been fairly conducted and that the findings should be upheld.', '13. The applicant was granted legal aid to obtain counsel’s opinion on the lawfulness of the governor’s decision of 8 July 1998. Counsel advised on 11 January 1999 that the applicant had no realistic prospects of success given the Hone and McCartan case (Hone and McCartan v. Maze Prison Board of Visitors [1998] 1 All ER 381). As to whether the governor’s exercise of discretion was unreasonable, the “Tarrant criteria”, the “relatively minor nature of the offence” and the capacity of the applicant, meant that the prospects of passing the “high hurdle of irrationality” on judicial review were remote.', '14. In December 1987 the applicant was sentenced to seventeen years’ imprisonment for armed robbery and making threats to kill.', '15. Following a fire in his cell, on 15 November 1998 he was charged with intentionally endangering the health or personal safety of others by his conduct, or of being reckless as to whether such health or safety was endangered, contrary to rule 49 of the Prison Rules 1964. He appeared at an adjudication hearing before the governor on 16 November 1998. He pleaded not guilty and the hearing was adjourned.', '16. On 24 November 1998 a solicitor submitted a written request to the governor to represent the applicant at the adjudication hearing.', '17. On 16 December 1998 the adjudication reconvened. The applicant made written representations in which he admitted telling a prison officer that he had caused the fire by throwing a lighted taper on the bed. However, he explained that that was untrue and that he believed his cell had been deliberately set on fire by other prisoners who thought that he was an informant. He had not explained this to the prison officers at the time as he was in the presence of other prisoners and he feared reprisals. He consistently maintained throughout the hearing that he had not started the fire. He cross-examined various witnesses called by the governor. The hearing continued the following day when he formally applied for legal representation for the remainder of the hearing, on the grounds that there were a large number of witnesses to be called, that the charge was a serious one and that it was difficult to be his own representative given the issue about his false admission. The governor refused his request taking the view that the offence was not sufficiently serious to warrant legal representation and that the applicant had demonstrated that he was capable of presenting his own defence. The hearing was adjourned until 22 December 1998 to enable a particular prison officer to be called.', '18. On 22 December 1998 the applicant was due for early release from custody pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. On the morning of that day he fell down a flight of stairs and was injured. He was treated for head and back pain by a doctor at a hospital. Once informed of developments, the applicant’s solicitor submitted orally to the governor that, given the applicant’s injury, the interests of natural justice required the charge to be dismissed and the applicant to be released. Further written representations were also made: due to the nature of the injuries and the medication received, it was unreasonable for the applicant to represent himself and the charge should be dismissed and that the solicitor should be informed should the proceedings continue so that he could make further representations. These written representations were not seen by the governor until after the adjudication hearing. The applicant returned to prison after his treatment and was certified by the prison doctor as fit for adjudication. The adjudication recommenced that day (22 December 1998) and the applicant was accompanied at the hearing by a medical officer. While prison staff maintained that he was alert and able to conduct his defence (even asking for the hearing to commence), the applicant stated that he felt so dizzy and ill that he could not concentrate and was incapable of asking questions or putting forward his case. The same day he was found guilty as charged and was sentenced to 35 additional days’ detention to commence on that day.', '19. The applicant applied to the Secretary of State to review the hearing. He maintained that he had been unable to conduct his defence properly because of the medication and that the governor erred in refusing legal representation given the seriousness of the charge. The Secretary of State upheld the finding and punishment. An application for leave to apply for judicial review was lodged, leave was granted, the High Court hearing took place on 18 January 1999 but the substantive application for judicial review was dismissed.', '20. The applicant was released on 26 January 1999.', '21. On 31 March 1999 the applicant was sentenced to 23 months’ imprisonment following conviction for violent disorder, affray, criminal damage and breach of a supervision order. He was detained at a young offenders’ institution in Doncaster.', '22. On 5 April 1999 he was charged with assaulting (punch in the face) another inmate (H) contrary to Rule 50(1) of the Young Offender Institution Rules 1988. The applicant claimed that he asked to see a solicitor but was told that he was not allowed to do so. He then pleaded guilty to the charge. On 6 April 1999 the deputy controller of the prison commenced the adjudication of the charge. However, once it became apparent that H’s jaw had been broken, the adjudication was adjourned and the charge was referred to the police for investigation.', '23. On 9 April 1999 the applicant’s solicitors wrote to the controller requesting confirmation that the applicant could be legally represented at any adjudication. On 12 April 1999 the controller responded stating that the adjudication had been adjourned as the charge had been referred to the police. He also noted that the applicant had not requested legal advice or representation at the hearing, had pleaded guilty to the charge and had apologised for the injuries caused. On 19 April 1999 the controller wrote to the applicant’s solicitors, stating that:', '“I write to advise that the victim of the alleged assault will not co-operate with the police investigation and wishes for the matter to be dealt with internally.', 'In view of the foregoing it is our intention to complete the hearing forthwith. As your client pleaded guilty at the initial hearing I am not prepared to allow him to be legally represented. I have applied the ‘Tarrant’ criteria and am satisfied that he can adequately conduct his own defence and, if necessary, mitigate his actions.”', '24. On 21 April 1999 the applicant’s solicitors asked the controller to re-consider his refusal of legal representation: since the applicant had instructed them that it was self-defence, his guilty plea was not satisfactory. The applicant submitted that his solicitor had also advised that that defence was potentially a good one. By letter of 21 April 1999 the controller rejected their request: the applicant could claim self-defence at the hearing and that claim would be examined on adjudication.', '25. On 23 April 1999 he was refused leave by the High Court to seek judicial review of the controller’s decision of 21 April 1999: there was no arguable case that the controller had failed to exercise his discretion in accordance with the above-noted Tarrant criteria. On 26 May 1999 the applicant’s renewed application for leave to seek judicial review to the Court of Appeal was refused. It was considered a simple case in which the applicant had sworn an affidavit setting out his account of the incident including a passage which claimed self-defence and the adjudicator would have to decide whether he believed the applicant or H. The Convention case-law opened to the Court (Campbell and Fell v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 June 1984, Series A no. 80, Benham v. the United Kingdom judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-III, and Findlay v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports 1997-I) did not establish an inflexible rule that legal representation should be accorded in every case or even a looser rule that it should be generally accorded. It was held that there was no need for legal representation and that there was no identifiable legal error in the controller’s refusal.', '26. On 1 June 1999 the adjudication hearing took place. The applicant was found guilty as charged. He was awarded 35 additional days’ imprisonment and he was to be excluded from associated work for 14 days. Fourteen days of canteen privileges together with associated dining and recreation privileges were also forfeited.', '27. On 22 July 1999 the applicant was sentenced to four months’ imprisonment for motoring offences. His ordinary release date would have been 18 September 1999.', '28. On 6 September 1999 he was charged with a breach of prison discipline contrary to paragraph 51(16) of the Prison Rules 1999, it being alleged that he had thrown burning material from a cell window. The hearing was adjourned to allow it to be heard by the deputy governor.', '29. On 13 September 1999, upon his return from annual leave, the applicant’s solicitor received a letter from the applicant denying the charges and requesting urgent assistance. The solicitor sent a facsimile to the governor at 9.30 a.m. on 13 September 1999 requesting an adjournment to enable him to take urgent instructions and provide legal advice. The hearing resumed on 14 September 1999 when the deputy governor refused an adjournment. It is recorded on the applicant’s “Record of Hearing and Adjudication” that the deputy governor stated the following:', '“I have a letter from your solicitor requesting that you be allowed legal advice. I have considered your request and refuse it on the following grounds.', '1. No points of law are likely to arise.', '2. You can present your own case.', '3. Although the charge is serious it does not require a solicitor to mitigate it.', '4. There are no procedural difficulties.', '5. There is a need for reasonable speed. There has already been a delay.”', 'The deputy governor found the applicant guilty as charged and awarded 18 additional days’ imprisonment.', '30. An application for leave to apply for judicial review was made arguing that the imprisonment was based upon a punishment, the legality of which was seriously flawed both on grounds of irrationality and procedural unfairness. On 21 September 1999 Mr. Justice Moses granted leave but refused bail. On 23 September 1999 the Secretary of State quashed the punishment in the following terms:', '“The adjudication detailed above has been reviewed and it has now been decided that the finding of guilt should be quashed on the grounds that the adjudicator should have offered Mr. Clarke a limited opportunity to consult with his solicitors. Although Mr. Clarke did not apply for legal advice or assistance at the original hearing on 6 September he should have been given the opportunity to discuss matters with his solicitor, possibly by telephone to arrange for a meeting the next day, and given a deadline for obtaining the advice he sought. A time limit could have been set to ensure that the prisoner did not delay the hearing unnecessarily. In view of the urgency of this case, please arrange for Mr. Clarke to be released immediately as this decision means that he is serving added days now.”', '31. The applicant was released at 17.10 hours on 23 September 1999, having served five of the additional days awarded.', '32. By letter dated 26 November 1999 the Treasury Solicitor refused to admit liability in respect of the alleged unlawful imprisonment. Counsel was therefore asked to advise whether there existed any effective domestic remedy which the applicant could pursue in respect of the relevant five-day period of detention. Counsel advised that there was no such remedy: under English law a disciplinary finding was presumed to be valid and, in effect, the order for additional days’ detention was valid until it was set aside.', '33. On 28 January 2000 the applicant’s solicitor wrote to the Treasury Solicitor pointing out that, in the light of Counsel’s advice, no claim for false imprisonment or misfeasance in public office would be commenced. However, it was alleged that the deputy governor’s conduct violated Article 6 of the Convention. A request was therefore made for an ex gratia payment to compensate the applicant for the 5 days’ detention resulting from the adjudication. The Treasury Solicitor responded that the matter would be considered after the publication of the House of Lords judgment in R. v. Governor of Brockhill Prison, ex parte Evans. No. 2 ([1999] 2 WLR 103). The Government have not submitted that any payment was made.', '34. The Court refers to the law and practice outlined in the case of Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom ([GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, §§ 37-62, ECHR 2003X).', '35. A charge was, in general, drawn up by a prison officer against whom the alleged offence was committed or who witnessed or dealt with the incident during which the alleged offence took place. Such reporting officers could consult a more senior officer on what charges were to be laid against the prisoner. A charge was formally laid when form a Notice of Report was handed to the accused. A charge had to be laid as soon as possible and, save in exceptional circumstances, within 48 hours of the alleged offence being discovered.', 'Every charge laid against a prisoner had to be inquired into by the prison governor. The governor also determined the charge against the accused during the adjudication hearing and imposed punishments from those available to him under the prison rules.', 'Since the 1990s the management of certain prisons has been contracted out to private security companies. All such “contracted out” prisons have a “Controller” (a Crown employee) linking them to the Home Office and the governors are called “Directors”. Adjudcation hearings are conducted by the Controller rather than by the Director.']",['6'],"['6-1', '6-3']",['6-3-c'],"['13', '5']",[],[]

The case of Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (""the Commission"") and the Government of the Kingdom of Belgium (""the Government"") on 14 March and 23 April 1980, respectively. The case originated in two applications (nos. 6878/75 and 7238/75) against that State introduced in 1974 and 1975 by three Belgian nationals, Dr. Herman Le Compte, Dr. Frans Van Leuven and Dr. Marc De Meyere.', '2. On 1 October 1980, the Chamber constituted to examine the case relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the plenary Court (Rule 48 of the Rules of Court). By a judgment of 23 June 1981, the latter held that there had been a breach of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention in that the applicants’ case had not been heard publicly by a tribunal competent to determine all the aspects of the matter. It found, on the other hand, that there had been no violation of that Article (art. 6-1) as regards the applicants’ other complaints, and no violation of Article 11 (art. 11) (Series A no. 43, points 2 and 3 of the operative provisions and paragraphs 54-66 of the reasons, pp. 24-28).', 'The only outstanding matter to be settled is the question of the application of Article 50 (art. 50) in the present case. Accordingly, as regards the facts, the Court will confine itself here to giving the pertinent details; for further particulars, reference should be made to paragraphs 8 to 34 of the above-mentioned judgment (ibid., pp. 7-17).', '3. At the hearings of 25 November 1980, the applicants’ lawyer had asked the Court, in the event of its finding a breach of the Convention, to afford his clients just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50). He had, however, stated that he was not yet in a position ""to establish the exact amount of any damages, in view of the possibility of compensation, if only partial, being granted under Belgian law"".', 'In its judgment of 23 June 1981, the Court reserved the whole of the question of the application of Article 50 (art. 50) and referred it back to the Chamber under Rule 50 § 4 of the Rules of Court. On the same day, the Chamber invited the Commission to submit, within the next two months, its written observations on the said question, including notification of any friendly settlement at which the Government and the applicants might have arrived (ibid., p. 45).', '4. The President granted extensions of this time-limit on 25 August and on 16 October.', 'On 15 December, the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Agent of the Government found it impossible to put forward the slightest proposal on the Article 50 (art. 50) issue. On the instructions of the Delegates - who reserved the right to submit observations at a later date -, the Secretary transmitted to the Court a copy of a note drafted by the applicants’ lawyer. The note, dated 18 August 1981, may be summarised as follows:', 'The applicants sought an undertaking from the Government to take measures providing partial reparation in the shape of', '(i) the complete and effective expunction of ""all the disciplinary and penal sanctions"" of which they complained;', '(ii) the reimbursement of the legal expenses and fines, the former including the following fees of lawyers practising before the Court of Cassation:', '- 25,000 BF for Dr. Le Compte;', '- 11,000 BF for Dr. Van Leuven;', '- 11,000 BF for Dr. De Meyere.', '(i) as his principal claim, a provisional award of one Belgian franc, pending the outcome of his second application to the Commission (no. 7496/76, - judgment of 23 June 1981, Series A no. 43, p. 10, § 13 in fine), referred to the Court on 12 March 1982 (the case of Albert and Le Compte);', '(ii) in the alternative, an award', '- of ""a fair proportion"" of the 732,608 BF he had paid in legal costs;', '- 30,000 BF for travel and subsistence expenses and by way of attendance allowances;', '- 20,000,000 BF for pecuniary and non-pecuniary loss.', 'Dr. Van Leuven claimed', '- 50,000 BF for legal costs;', '- 30,000 BF for travel and subsistence expenses and by way of attendance allowances;', '- 15,000,000 BF for pecuniary and non-pecuniary loss.', 'Dr. De Meyere claimed', '- 60,000 BF for loss of income during the fifteen days’ suspension of his right to practise medicine;', '- 50,000 BF for legal costs;', '- such sum as the Court deemed fit for non-pecuniary loss.', '5.

The applicants were born in 1933 and 1974 respectively and live in Diyarbakır.', '10. The facts surrounding the arrest and subsequent death of Mehmet Şah İkincisoy (“Mehmet Şah”) are in dispute between the parties.', ""11. On 22 November 1993 at about 1 a.m. plain-clothes police officers arrived at the first applicant, Abdurrazak İkincisoy's (“Abdurrazak”), apartment in Diyarbakır. They entered the apartment, carried out a quick search and inquired about Mehmet Şah. Abdurrazak informed them that Mehmet Şah was spending the night in his uncle Abdülkadir İkincisoy's apartment. Leaving one of the officers with Abdurrazak1, Garipşah İkincisoy, Hüseyin İkincisoy, Makbule İkincisoy and Nefise İkincisoy, the rest of the officers left taking the second applicant, Halil İkincisoy (“Halil”), with them to show them the way."", ""12. When they arrived at Abdülkadir İkincisoy's apartment, one of the police officers remained at the entrance of the building. Halil and two officers went up to the second floor. When they entered the apartment, the police officers carried out a search and an identity check. Several members of the İkincisoy family were present in the apartment, namely Mehmet Şah, Abdülkadir, Nasır, Adile, Sabriye, and Bilgi İkincisoy, as well as fourteen grandchildren of Abdülkadir İkincisoy and two of Mehmet Şah's friends. One of the police officers interrogated these two men in one of the rooms. The rest of the group was held in the sitting room. Suddenly, a gun shot was heard from the room and an armed clash broke between the police officers and the two men. The police officer who was interrogating the two men was shot dead. When the shooting started, the second police officer grabbed Mehmet Şah by his arm and dragged him downstairs. Halil and the others saw the two men try to escape. They heard further gunshots from downstairs. The group subsequently learnt that one of the men had died, the other had escaped and the officer who was waiting outside the building had been wounded."", '13. Approximately ten minutes following the incident, several police teams surrounded the building. Halil, Abdülkadir, Adile, Nasır, Sabriye and Bilgi İkincisoy were arrested and taken to the Çarşı Police Station by a minibus. When they arrived at the Çarşı Police Station, they were detained in the entrance hall. On the right hand side of the entrance hall, there were three rooms, two of which were used for interrogation and the third was the office of the superintendent. Halil was called in to one of the small rooms for interrogation. When he entered the room, he saw his brother Mehmet Şah, lying on the floor face down, with his red leather jacket pulled over his head. In the meantime Abdurrazak, Hüseyin, Makbule, Nefise and Garipşah İkincisoy were also arrested and brought to the Çarşı Station by another minibus. When the second group entered the station, they were told to cover their heads with their jackets. Abdurrazak1 however was able to see through the parting of his jacket. He also saw his son Mehmet Şah standing behind him. The group was subsequently transferred to another location by a minibus. Abdurrazak1 saw Mehmet Şah also in this second location. They were then brought to the Rapid Intervention Headquarters for interrogation, where the applicants heard the cries of Mehmet Şah.', '14. The first applicant was held in custody until 25 November 1995. When he was released, the police officers told him that if anyone asked about his son Mehmet Şah, the applicant had to say that he had fled to the mountains to join the guerrillas. The second applicant was released on 3 December 1993, eleven days after his arrest.', ""15. On 6 December 1993 the first applicant went to the Diyarbakır State Security Court Public Prosecutor and submitted a petition outlining his concerns for the fate of his son. The public prosecutor showed him some photographs and from these photos the first applicant identified the body of Mehmet Şah. The public prosecutor informed him that Mehmet Şah had died in an armed clash on 25 November 1993 and that his body had been buried. When Abdurrazak went to the cemetery, two unmarked graves were shown to him and he was told that one of them belonged to Mehmet Şah. On 13 December 1993 Abdurrazak1 submitted a petition to the Diyarbakır State Security Court Chief Public Prosecutor's office and requested permission to open his son's grave. His request was rejected verbally. On 13 December 1993 Abdurrazak1 lodged two petitions with the Diyarbakır State Security Court Chief Public Prosecutor's Office. He requested that an autopsy be conducted on Mehmet Şah's body in order to learn the true circumstances surrounding his death. He was told to go to the court to get permission for an autopsy. He filed another petition with the State Minister responsible for human rights and requested an investigation of the circumstances surrounding the death of his son. On 21 March 1993 the Ministry replied that Mehmet Şah had never been taken into custody."", ""16. Following the communication of the application to the Government, Abdurrazak1 was summoned to the Diyarbakır public prosecutor's office on 6 June 1995. He was questioned about his application to the Commission and was forced to sign a statement in which he expressed his wish to retract his application. Thereafter he went to the Diyarbakır Human Rights Association and informed them about this incident."", ""17. The Government stated that while the Anti-Terrorism Department of the Diyarbakır Security Court was taking a statement from an arrested person in connection with an ongoing investigation, they were informed that a person called Mehmet Şah İkincisoy was aiding and abetting the PKK. Accordingly a team of police officers went to Abdurrazak's1 apartment searching for his son Mehmet Şah. When they arrived at the apartment, the officers were informed that Mehmet Şah was spending the night at his uncle's apartment. Taking Halil with them to show them the way, the officers subsequently went to Abdulkadir İkincisoy's apartment. The officers carried out a search and found four men sleeping in one of the rooms. As they interrogated them, one of the men opened fire and killed one of the police officers. Another officer was wounded during the incident. The Government further stated that the four men tried to escape however one of them was shot dead."", ""18. The Government further submitted that on 23 November 1993 the security forces received an anonymous telephone call, informing them that two armed men had been seen hiding in a hut near the Ongözlü Bridge. Accordingly, an operation was conducted. When the officers arrived near the hut, an armed clash broke out and lasted approximately twenty minutes. Following the clash, two men were found dead in the hut. The officers took photographs of the bodies to enable their identification. On 24 November 1993 an autopsy was conducted on one of the bodies, which was later identified as Mehmet Şah from the photographs.

The parties submitted various documents to the Court. While delivering its judgment, the Court had particular regard to the following documents:', ""20. The report stated that in connection with an ongoing investigation, a search was conducted in a house on 22 November 1993.

Accordingly, taking Halil with them to show them the way, the police officers left the apartment. When they arrived at the second apartment, the officers conducted a quick search and found four or five men sleeping in one of the rooms. When the officers asked the men to show their identification paper, they were attacked and a gun was fired. One person was arrested and while he was being taken to the police vehicle downstairs, another police officer was shot and wounded. The arrested person escaped and the person who had shot the officer was killed."", '21. According to the report, which was signed by officer Mustafa Şen, on 23 November 1993 at about 3 a.m. the anti-terrorism department received an anonymous telephone call informing them that the perpetrators of the incident of the previous day, who had caused the death of a police officer and the wounding of another, had been seen in a hut near the Ongözlü Brigde.', '22. The report states that following information from an anonymous telephone call at about 3 a.m. that two armed men were hiding in a hut near the Öngözlü Bridge, a police operation was carried out.

A Browning pistol was found on the second body. There were no identity cards on the bodies, which were subsequently taken to the State Hospital morgue.', '23. The autopsy report stated that rigor mortis had set in and bruising had appeared on the body. Two bullet entrance holes on the back side of the neck and two exit holes in the chest were noted. The report further stated that no other signs were observed. As the gunshot wounds were the certain cause of death, it was not considered necessary to carry out a full post-mortem examination.

According to the report prepared by the Diyarbakır State Security Court Public Prosecutor, Abdurrazak identified the body of Mehmet Şah from the photographs.', ""35. The first applicant requested information about the fate of his son, who had been arrested on 22 November 1993 at Abdülkadir İkincisoy's apartment."", '36. Upon learning from the public prosecutor that his son, Mehmet Şah, had died in a clash on 25 November 1993, the first applicant submitted to the prosecutor that he believed that his son had died in custody. He accordingly requested that an autopsy be conducted on the body of Mehmet Şah to clarify the exact cause of his death.', '37. The first applicant maintained that his son was taken into custody on 22 November 1993 together with twelve members of his family. He further stated that he had seen him both at the Çarşı Police Station and at the Rapid Intervention Headquarters. Although the first applicant was informed by the Diyarbakır State Security Court Public Prosecutor that his son had died in a clash on 25 November 1993, he requested the Minister to conduct a further investigation into the real circumstances surrounding the death.', '38. In his letter the Minister informed the first applicant that Mehmet Şah was never taken into custody.', '39. In their letter, the Ministry of Justice requested the Diyarbakır Chief Public Prosecutor to conduct an investigation concerning the individual application of Abdurrazak1 and Halil İkincisoy to the European Commission of Human Rights. The prosecutor was asked to take statements from the two applicants concerning certain documents that they had sent to the Commission.', ""40. In response to the public prosecutor's question about the individual application that he had lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights, the first applicant explained that following the death of his son, Mehmet Şah, he had gone to the Diyarbakır Human Rights Association where he had signed certain documents. However he stated that he did not recall giving authorisation to British lawyers to initiate proceedings in Europe. He further indicated that he wished to retract his application."", ""41. In his statement, which was addressed to the European Commission of Human Rights, the first applicant stated that he had been taken by plain-clothes police officers to the public prosecutor's office in May 1995. On the way to the public prosecutor's office, the officers forced him to deny that he wanted to pursue his application with the Commission. He maintained that he had to sign a statement in the public prosecutor's office out of fear and without knowing its content as he is illiterate."", '42. The facts of the case being in dispute between the parties, three Delegates of the Commission took oral evidence in Ankara between 28 June and 2 July 1999 from ten witnesses, including the applicants. The evidence of those who attended the hearing may be summarised as follows:', ""43. The witness, who is the first applicant, stated that on the day of the incident at about 1 a.m. police officers had come to his house, looking for his son Mehmet Şah. He informed the officers that Mehmet Şah was staying at his uncle's house and told his other son Halil to show them the way. About half an hour after they had left, police officers came back and arrested everyone in the apartment, namely Hüseyin, Nefise, Makbule and Garipşah İkincisoy. They were first taken to the Çarşı Police Station. The police officers forced them to cover their heads with their jackets but the witness was able to see through the parting of his jacket. He saw that his two sons Halil and Mehmet Şah were also in the station. Thereafter, they were taken to the police headquarters by minibus. The witness further recalled seeing Mehmet Şah in the minibus. They waited for about half an hour at the police headquarters before being taken to the Rapid Intervention Force Headquarters, where they were blindfolded and the witness was able to hear the cries of Mehmet Şah. The witness and his daughters were released from custody three days after their arrest. At the time of his release, the officers told him that his son had fled to the mountains. They gave him Mehmet Şah's leather jacket but the witness refused to take it stating that his son would be cold without his jacket. The younger son of the witness, Halil, was released fourteen days after his arrest. When Mehmet Şah did not return home, the witness went to the Diyarbakır public prosecutor and asked about his son's whereabouts. The public prosecutor showed him some photos and asked him whether any of were of his son Mehmet Şah. The applicant identified his son's body. The prosecutor informed him that his son had died during an armed clash between the PKK and the security forces."", ""44. The witness further explained that after he filed his application with the European Commission of Human Rights, he was summoned to the public prosecutor's office in 1995. The public prosecutor was angry with him for filing an application with the Commission. Out of fear, the witness stated before the public prosecutor that he would retract his application. However, before the Delegates, the witness affirmed that he intended to pursue his application. Finally he stated that he was able to visit his son's grave and pray for him."", ""45. The witness, who is the second applicant, stated that on 22 November 1993 police officers had come to their house at about 1 a.m. He saw Feyzi Tatlı, a distant relative, with the police officers. The police officers carried out a quick search in the house and asked for his brother Mehmet Şah. His father, Abdurrazak, told them that Mehmet Şah was staying at his uncle's house. Accordingly, the witness accepted to accompany the three police officers to his uncle's house. When they arrived, the witness knocked on the door. Sabriye İkincisoy answered the door and let them in. One of the police officers remained outside and two of them entered. The officers conducted a search and carried out an identity check. When they found Mehmet Şah, they arrested him. Taking Mehmet Şah by his arm, one of the officers went out. The witness followed them. As they were walking along the corridor, they heard gunshots. The police officer, who was holding Mehmet Şah by his arm, dragged him downstairs. At that time, the witness saw Mehmet Şah's two friends running downstairs but he did not see where they went. The witness then fled to the neighbour's flat. His uncle Abdülkadir, his cousin Nasır, Nasır's wife and Abdülkadir's wife also joined him. Some time later, they were all arrested by the police and taken to the Çarşı Police Station. The police officers told them to cover their heads with their jackets. When they arrived at the Çarşı Station, they were forced to wait in a corridor. He described the entrance of the station and stated that there was a small hall followed by a long corridor, at the end of which there was a room. The witness saw Mehmet Şah lying face down on the floor in that room. Mehmet Şah was wearing a shirt, a pull over, a brownish leather jacket and denim jeans."", ""46. The witness further confirmed seeing his father and sisters in the Çarşı Station. Subsequently, they were taken to a second place in a car, where they waited for a few minutes. The witness stated that he did not see Mehmet Şah in the second place. Then they were taken to a third place. The witness did not see anyone in this third place but heard the voices of his uncle, Feyzi Tatlı, and Mehmet Şah. Mehmet Şah was screaming in pain. The witness was kept there for thirteen days and he was allegedly ill-treated. The officers told him that his brother had escaped to the mountains. He was forced to sign a statement without reading its content. When he was released from custody, the witness went to the public prosecutor with his father to discover the fate of Mehmet Şah. The witness stated that when Mehmet Şah's body was identified from the photographs, they were told that he had been buried. An officer showed them two graves and informed them that he did not know which one was Mehmet Şah's."", ""47. The witness, who is the first applicant's nephew, stated that on the night of 22 November 1993, he was at his father's house. His father (Abdülkadir İkincisoy), his mother (Adile), his wife (Sabriye), his children, his brother (Muhlis), and his brother's children were also at home. He recalled that his uncle's son, Mehmet Şah and his two friends had spent the night with them. The witness maintained that at about 1 a.m. two plain-clothes police officers had come to their house, together with his cousin Halil, searching for Mehmet Şah. At that time Mehmet Şah was sleeping in the guest room, together with his two friends and the brother of the witness, Muhlis. The police officers carried out an identity check and then told Mehmet Şah and his two friends that they had to come to the police station for interrogation. One of the officers held Mehmet Şah by the arm. At that moment they heard a gun shot. The police officer who was holding Mehmet Şah also started shooting. Mehmet Şah tried to prevent the police officer from shooting but the same police officer dragged him down the stairs. The witness further recalled that the family members fled to their neighbour's to protect themselves. After some time, more police officers arrived and arrested everyone. While they were being taken to the police station, the witness saw that one of the persons who had come with Mehmet Şah had been shot dead. The witness was put in a car and taken to the Rapid Intervention Headquarters. He remembered standing in a long corridor. Despite the fact that he was blindfolded, the witness was able to see around. He saw that his mother, his wife, the daughter of Muhlis and his uncle were also there. He also saw Feyzi Tatlı, a distant cousin. The witness said that he was taken to a room which was wet, where he saw Mehmet Şah, who was being tortured. Mehmet Şah was lying on the floor. He said to the witness “Our family is ruined. They will kill us all. What is this we are going through?”. The witness stated that this was the last time he saw Mehmet Şah."", ""48. The witness, who is the daughter of the first applicant and the sister of the second, was at her father's house on the night of the incident. She said that while they were sleeping at home, some police officers came to their house and asked about her brother Mehmet Şah. When her father explained to the police officers that Mehmet Şah was staying at his uncle's house, the police officers left the house, taking Halil with them. Some time after, the police officers came back and arrested everyone in the house, including the witness. They were first taken to Çarşı Police Station and then to the police headquarters. The witness explained that she had not seen Mehmet Şah in the Çarşı Station but she had seen him at the police headquarters. When they arrived at the police headquarters, they walked upstairs and were taken into a hall. Their eyes were not covered but they were forced to hold their hands behind the back of their necks. They were made to stand facing the wall. When the witness glanced over her shoulder, she saw that Mehmet Şah was standing next to her. This was the last time she saw him. However she recalled hearing his voice at the Rapid Intervention Force, which was the third place they were taken to. He was moaning. She was kept in a cell, together with Makbule, Nefise, Adile, Bilge and Sabriye İkincisoy. At some point, Sabriye and Makbule were taken out of the cell and when they came back they were shivering. They therefore requested a blanket from the guardians and the guardians gave them a brown leather jacket which belonged to Mehmet Şah."", ""49. The witness affirmed that he was a police officer at the Anti-Terrorism Branch of Diyarbakır Security Directorate at the time of the events. He recalled that after receiving information from Feyzi Tatlı, a person who was under custody, that Mehmet Şah had been aiding and abetting the PKK, an operation was prepared. Feyzi Tatlı was asked to point out the house of Mehmet Şah to a group of five police officers, including the witness. On 22 November 1993 at about 1 a.m. they arrived at the apartment of Abdurrazak, the father of Mehmet Şah. Abdurrazak1 told them that his son was staying at his uncle's house. Accordingly, taking a young person with them to show them the way, and leaving one police officer in the house of Abdurrazak1, they left. When they arrived at Mehmet Şah's uncle's house, one police officer remained near the patrol car, and the witness stayed outside the building. Two police officers went upstairs. A few minutes later the witness heard gun shots from upstairs. One of the police officers, Mustafa Hünerlitürkoğlu, came downstairs, holding someone by the wrist. He told the witness that the third police officer, Alişan, had been shot. The witness entered the building to help his colleague. At that time Mustafa went outside, still holding the detainee by the wrist. The witness then heard footsteps and he hid under the stairs. A person fired a Kalashnikov rifle at the witness and wounded him in the abdomen. The witness fired back and killed the person who had fired at him. He then went out of the building to get help. When officer Mustafa saw that the witness was wounded, he left the detainee and ran towards him. The person who had been in custody ran away. The witness was subsequently taken to hospital, where he underwent an operation. When he regained consciousness in the hospital, his colleagues asked him to sign the incident report they had prepared. The public prosecutor further took his statement while he was still in intensive care. The witness accepted that there had been a mistake in the names that appeared in the incident report. He agreed that instead of Hanefi İkincisoy, the name should have read Mehmet Şah İkincisoy. The witness further explained that he had not been involved in the arrests or interrogations of the people who had been in the house at the time of the incident."", ""50. The witness confirmed that he was one of the five police officers who had gone to Mehmet Şah's apartment on 22 November 1993 at about 1 a.m. He recalled that after Feyzi Tatlı, a detainee, confessed during a police interrogation that Mehmet Şah was aiding and abetting the PKK, an operation was conducted to apprehend this person. Feyzi Tatlı showed them where Mehmet Şah lived. When they set off to arrest Mehmet Şah, the officers did not know what he looked like. One of the police officers stayed in the car, and the other four went into the house. Feyzi Tatlı was sent back to the police station in another vehicle. An elderly person opened the door, and informed them that Mehmet Şah was staying at his uncle's house that night. A young person accompanied the officers to the house in question. One of the police officers stayed behind in the house to ensure that no one could call Mehmet Şah to warn him. Accordingly, the three police officers and the young person went to the house of Mehmet Şah's uncle. A middle aged lady opened the door. The witness stated that they told the lady they would carry out an identity check and they entered the apartment. The witness went inside the room that was on the opposite side of the entrance. In that room, there were women and children. In the meantime, his colleague Alişan went inside another room from which an old man and a younger man had come out. The officers found a third room, in which four persons were sleeping. The witness made them stand in the corridor, while Alişan stayed in the room and called them in one by one for an identity check. A few minutes later, the witness heard noises coming from the third room and when he went in, he saw that a man was struggling with officer Alişan. The witness tried to help however the other persons interfered. One of the men had a Kalashnikov rifle and he fired at Alişan. When the witness saw that Alişan was shot, he grabbed one of the men, who did not have a gun, to use him as a shield. The witness ran downstairs to get help, still holding that man by his wrist. Downstairs, he met the third officer, Şerif, and told him that an armed clash had broken out upstairs and that Alişan had been shot. The witness then went outside the building to go to the car to use the radio. At that time, he heard Şerif ordering someone to surrender and subsequently he heard gun shots. The witness ran back to the building, letting go off the person he was holding. When he entered the building he saw that Şerif had been shot and the person who had shot at him had been killed. They called for reinforcements. 15 to 20 minutes after the incident, they were able to send Şerif to the hospital and thereafter he drafted the incident report by hand. The witness further explained that he had given the incident report to his colleagues who had arrived at the scene of incident and they had typed it up. He remembered signing the typed incident report at the hospital. When asked about the names indicated in the incident report, the witness admitted that there was a mistake. He had written Mehmet Şah's name as Hanefi İkincisoy. The witness further maintained that he had given a statement to the public prosecutor in the hospital. The witness also stated that he had not seen the photos of the two terrorists who were killed in a clash, the day after the incident."", '51. The witness confirmed that he had signed the autopsy report of Mehmet Şah İkincisoy. He is a doctor specialised in forensic medicine and pathology. He has been a forensic doctor since 1991. The witness did not recall the autopsy of Mehmet Şah however by looking at the documents he explained that the estimated time of death was 36 hours before the autopsy was carried out. There were no bruises on the body. There were certain discoloured spots but these were not signs of beating or force. The cause of death was the two bullets that had entered from the upper back region. There was an exit hole around the left breast, and another exit hole on the upper right side of the chest. Dr Eğilmez concluded that the entry and exit holes made it clear that the person had not been shot at close range.', '52. The witness affirmed that he was the head of Diyarbakır Anti-Terrorism Department at the time of the incident. He recalled that on the basis of information received from a detainee, Feyzi Tatlı, an operation was carried out to apprehend certain people. The witness was the head of the Central Branch however the interrogation office was located in the Rapid Intervention Force Building, which was also known as the police school. Officer Sürücü stated that as a general rule, the detainees were taken directly to the police school for interrogation. When asked about the armed clash, during which Mehmet Şah had allegedly been killed, the witness stated that he had not been directly involved in the operation. Although his name appeared on the incident report, he explained that these reports were usually signed by the officers who were replacing him and who had the power to sign for him. He remembered however that, on the day of the clash, they had received an anonymous call indicating that the two terrorists, who had escaped the day before, were hiding in a hut.', '53. The witness further confirmed that he had never been interrogated concerning the allegation that Mehmet Şah had died under torture.', '54. The witness, who is a police officer, stated that he was serving at the interrogation office of the Anti-Terrorism Department of Diyarbakır police headquarters in November 1993. He was police superintendent. The witness explained that, at that time, there were three interrogation teams and he was in charge of the first team. When asked about the general procedure that was followed after a person was arrested, he explained that before being brought for interrogation, all arrested persons were first sent for a medical examination. He emphasized the fact that the detainees were not blindfolded during the interrogation and that no one had been ill-treated. The interrogation office command was located in the headquarters of the Rapid Intervention Force in Diyarbakır. All the interrogations were conducted there. He refused the suggestion that the detainees could first be taken to the Çarşı Police Station. When a detainee was interrogated, the officers first asked about his past, and then certain questions were put to him. There was no standard form of procedure for interrogation.', '55. The witness affirmed that he had been involved in the interrogation of Feyzi Tatlı as well as the İkincisoy family members. However he could not remember the interrogation of the İkincisoy family members very clearly as it was almost six years ago. He recalled that upon receipt of intelligence to the effect that the two persons who had escaped the day before had been seen in a hut, an operation was conducted to apprehend them. The witness further took part in the operation together with 14 police officers. They were all wearing bullet proof vests. Before the armed clash, the officers asked the two persons to surrender but the two men started shooting at the officers. The clash lasted for about twenty minutes. They were about 15 metres away from the hut. No officer was wounded. When no-one returned their fire, the officers entered the hut and found two bodies. The hut was about ten square metres, it had a wooden door and a small window. Shortly after the armed clash, another team arrived and took photographs in the hut. The witness explained that he had never referred to this incident or showed the photographs to the İkincisoy family members during their interrogation.', ""56. The witness affirmed that he had been the Diyarbakır Public Prosecutor from December 1993 to September 1995. He recalled that he had taken a statement from the first applicant concerning his application to the European Commission of Human Rights on 6 June 1995. The witness explained that, by a letter dated 24 May 1995 from the International Law and Foreign Affairs Directorate of the Ministry of Justice, he was instructed to take the applicant's statement concerning his application to Strasbourg and to verify certain signatures on some documents. Accordingly, he had written to the Diyarbakır Security Department to notify the applicant that he was called to the office of the public prosecutor. The public prosecutor stated that the applicant had come to his office alone, of his own free will. No police officer had accompanied him to the public prosecutor's office. His statement was taken in the office of the clerks and not in the interrogation room. While they were in the office, the applicant seemed relaxed. The public prosecutor showed him certain documents, which were annexed to the letter from the Ministry. While accepting that these signatures belonged to him, the applicant stated that he did not remember signing these documents. The public prosecutor further recalled that the applicant had clearly stated that he did not want any foreign lawyers to make any applications before international bodies. The public prosecutor wrote down everything the applicant told him and read it out. The applicant accordingly signed his statement. The public prosecutor further admitted that he had not taken any steps to investigate the complaint, mentioned in the applicant's statement, that he had been ill-treated in custody and that his ribs had been broken."", '57.

The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '6. On 27 November 1990 the liquidation of the Diósgyőr Machine Factory Ltd. (“the Factory”) was ordered by the Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County Regional Court. However, during the liquidation procedure, the Factory remained partly active, in order to minimise losses.', '7. Between April 1991 and January 1994, the predecessor of the applicant was a supplier of the Factory. As the Factory was unable to pay for the services already rendered – the outstanding fees amounted to 8,528,183 Hungarian Forints (approximately 32,421 euros) – the applicant became a creditor in the liquidation proceedings.', ""8. On 31 August 1994 the Factory's liquidator prepared the closing balance sheet. The liquidator was of the view that the satisfaction of all the creditors in cash was impossible. Instead of payment in cash, it therefore offered shares in the Factory, but the applicant declined the proposal."", '9. On 21 February 1995 the applicant objected (kifogás) to the closing balance sheet and insisted on payment in cash.', ""10. On 4 July 1995 the Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County Regional Court accepted the closing balance sheet. On appeal on 29 May 1997, the Supreme Court, acting as a second-instance court, quashed this decision due to procedural shortcomings. It found, inter alia, that the Regional Court had not dealt with the applicant's objection. The Supreme Court held that the liquidator was under an obligation to attempt to sell the shares of the Factory first and then satisfy the creditors from the sums received. The Supreme Court's decision arrived at the Regional Court on 15 July 1997."", '11. On 10 December 1997 the Regional Court ordered the liquidator to prepare a new closing balance sheet.', ""12. On 19 January 1998 the liquidator informed the Regional Court that the sale of the shares was only possible well below their nominal value. The liquidator also informed the Regional Court about the ongoing negotiations with possible investors and requested an extension of the time-limit for the preparation of the closing balance sheet. The Regional Court registered the liquidator's request."", '13. On 17 September 1998 the liquidator announced that its attempt to sell the shares had been unsuccessful and requested the Regional Court to accept an amended closing balance sheet.', '14. On 18 February 2000 the liquidator informed the Regional Court about an update to the closing balance sheet.', '15. On 22 January 2001 the applicant initiated negotiations with the liquidator. At a meeting held on 20 February 2001, the liquidator acknowledged that it had satisfied some of the creditors more favourably than the applicant, but had only done so to keep the Factory at least partly active.', '16. On 23 January 2001 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Regional Court about the lack of a final decision in the case.', '17. On 29 March 2001 the applicant raised an objection before the Regional Court, asking the court to terminate the liquidation proceedings.', ""18. On 1 July 2004 the Regional Court dismissed the applicant's complaint without examining its merits."", '19.

On 4 March 2002 the liquidator informed the Regional Court that the liquidation procedure was at an advanced stage, but requested the court to forbear from demanding the closing balance sheet “because of difficulties in obtaining, handling and classifying certain documents”. The liquidator added that the unsuccessful attempt to reach a settlement with the applicant had also delayed the proceedings.', '23. On 8 June 2004 the Regional Court again requested information from the liquidator about the obstacles to finishing the procedure.', '24. On 1 July 2004 the liquidator informed the Regional Court that it was still facing the same difficulties and, therefore, was not able to produce the closing balance sheet.', '25.

It pointed out that the domestic courts dealing with the matter had kept regular contact with the liquidator and repeatedly ordered it to produce the closing balance sheet. It also noted that the relevant domestic law did not contain a specific deadline to finish a liquidation procedure. The Regional Court acknowledged that there had been some delays imputable to the courts dealing with the case, but was of the view that these delays had not caused any damage to the applicant, given that the possibility of recovering the money owed by the debtor had in any event been very low."", '36.

On 22 February 2000 the Housing Commission replied to the court in the negative."", ""16. On 10 March 2000 the Municipal Court declared the applicant's action inadmissible for lack of jurisdiction.

Accordingly, instead of bringing a civil action the applicant should have applied for repossession of her property to the competent housing commission, as provided by the Termination Act."", '17. As neither party appealed against the decision, it became final on 31 March 2000. On the same day the applicant applied for repossession of her property to the Housing Commission.', ""18. On 16 October 2000 the Housing Commission decided to set aside the Takeover Commission's decision by which M.V. had obtained the right to use the applicant's property.

M.V. failed to comply with that warrant. However, the Housing Commission brought no action against him.', '21. On 1 October 2002 the Amendments to the Act on Areas of Special State Concern (“the 2002 Amendments”) entered into force. They transferred the jurisdiction in the matter from the housing commissions (which were abolished) to the Ministry of Public Works, Reconstruction and Construction (Ministarstvo za javne radove, obnovu i graditeljstvo – “the Ministry”).', '22. On 21 February 2003 the Ministry invited the applicant to contact its competent regional office in order to repossess her flat and/or receive compensation for the prolonged inability to use it, in accordance with the 2002 Amendments.', '23. One day later the Ministry issued a decision by which it established that M.V. had a right to housing which was to be satisfied by providing him with construction material, in line with the 2002 Amendments. Pursuant to that decision M.V. was obliged to vacate the flat within 90 days of the final shipment of the construction material. The date on which M.V. received the final shipment is unknown.', '24.

On 23 June 2003 the Ministry made an offer for a settlement according to which the State was to pay compensation to the applicant. However, the applicant declined the offer as unsatisfactory. She submitted that the amount of compensation offered had covered only the period from 1 November 2002 onwards. Moreover, the compensation had amounted to only 314 Croatian kunas (HRK) per month while the amount of the rent for the flat of that size (45 m²) should have been assessed at HRK 2,500.', '26.

The applicants were born in 1977, 1969, 1961 and 1959 respectively and live in Budesti and Chişinău.', '7. The present case concerns the circumstances surrounding the death of Leonid Ghimp, who was the first applicant’s husband, the second and the third applicants’ sibling and the fourth applicant’s brother-in-law.', '8. Leonid Ghimp, who was thirty-five years old at the time of the events in question and the father of two children aged six and ten years old, worked as a truck driver. On Saturday 10 December 2005 at approximately eight o’clock in the morning he went to work in order to load his truck and prepare it for the following Monday. According to witnesses, he finished work at approximately 2 p.m. After that and before going home, he spent time enjoying drinks with his co-workers, first at their workplace and later in two bars. At approximately 10.00 p.m. he left the bar and took a taxi. He subsequently had a dispute with the taxi driver because the driver had allegedly not taken him to the agreed destination. Because he refused to pay the fare, the taxi driver drove him to Ciocana police station. According to witnesses from the police station, the taxi driver left after a short time and after being paid by Leonid Ghimp. The report of the latter’s arrest, however, stated that he had been found drunk and sleeping at a bus station. There was no mention of the incident with the taxi driver in the report.', '9. According to the applicants, at the police station, Leonid Ghimp was beaten up by three police officers: A.P., S.C. and I.B, and was left lying in the corridor on a dirty concrete floor. He was released the next morning at approximately 11 a.m.', '10. According to the accused police officers, Leonid Ghimp was not beaten up at the police station and was told that he was free to go shortly after being brought in. However, being severely intoxicated he refused to leave and preferred to sleep on the floor until the next morning.', '11. After being released at approximately 11 a.m. the next day, Leonid Ghimp went home. According to his wife and a person who had seen him walking home, he was pale and walking very slowly. He told his wife that he had stomach ache and spent all day in bed. Only later during the evening, after the pain had intensified, did he tell his wife about the beating at the police station. He told her that the pain had started after a blow to his stomach which had caused him to feel a sharp pain and lose his breath. Later during the night Leonid Ghimp started vomiting and his wife called an ambulance, which took him to a hospital. On 12 December 2005 at 6.35 a.m. Leonid Ghimp died in hospital.', '12. On an unspecified date the first applicant informed the Prosecutor’s Office of Leonid Ghimp’s account of his beating at Ciocana police station. On 5 January 2006 criminal proceedings were initiated by the Ciocana Prosecutor’s Office.', '13. An autopsy report dated 23 January 2006 stated that his death had resulted from diffuse purulent peritonitis after a perforated ulcer of the small intestine. The perforated ulcer had developed after a blow with a blunt object with a small impact area, possibly on the night of 10 December 2005.', '14. In another forensic report dated 31 May 2006, a panel of forensic doctors composed of doctors G.M., N.S. and I.C., after examining the victim’s medical documents and his exhumed corpse, came to a similar conclusion, namely that he had died as a result of a rupture of the small intestine resulting in intestinal contents flowing into the abdominal cavity and causing bacterial contamination of the abdominal cavity – in other words, purulent inflammation of the peritoneum. According to the doctors, the injury causing his death had resulted from a blow from a blunt object with a small surface area to Leonid Ghimp’s stomach, possibly on the evening of 10 December 2005. The doctors did not find any traces of alcohol in his blood and concluded that he had been sober at the time of his death. They also concluded that there was a chance that his life could have been saved had he gone to a hospital within the first few hours after being injured.', '15. During the criminal investigation, the prosecutor in charge of the case questioned numerous witnesses, including police officers from Ciocana police station. The three police officers suspected of ill-treating Leonid Ghimp denied that he had been treated violently and unanimously maintained that he had been found drunk and sleeping at a bus stop and brought to the police station. They also stated that after questioning him, Leonid Ghimp had refused to go home because it was late and he had no money and preferred to sleep on the floor of the police station. All the police officers submitted that Leonid Ghimp had been intoxicated but that he had not presented any signs of violence or injuries.', '16. Two other police officers from Ciocana police station, who were not suspects, submitted that the victim had come to the police station together with a taxi driver, whom he had been refusing to pay for a fare. After several minutes the taxi driver had been paid by Leonid Ghimp and had left the premises of the police station. The police officers also denied having witnessed acts of violence against Leonid Ghimp and also stated that he had preferred to sleep on the floor in the corridor of the police station rather than go home.', '17. A witness, O.O., who had been brought to the police station on the same evening (10 December 2005), stated that she had had an argument with her family and had been taken to Ciocana police station from her home. At the police station she had been in the same room as a man who had had an argument with a taxi driver. She had understood that from the discussion which that man had had with three police officers. Because he had continued to refuse to pay the taxi driver, the police officers had beaten him up in front of her. She had seen the police officers punching the man until he had collapsed to the floor. Then one of the police officers had grabbed the man by his coat, dragged him into the corridor and left him lying on the concrete floor. She had later been released after being forced to sign a document stating that she was being fined for appearing drunk in public. As in Leonid Ghimp’s case, the report of her arrest stated that she had been arrested on the street.', '18. The prosecutor also questioned the people with whom Leonid Ghimp had spent the day on 10 December 2005. All of them stated that he had appeared to be in good health and had not shown any signs of illness throughout the entire day. The prosecutor’s attempt to find the taxi driver who had brought Leonid Ghimp to the police station was not successful.', '19. On 6 July 2006 one of the accused police officers, A.P., changed his initial statement. He admitted to having lied in his previous statement and admitted that Leonid Ghimp had been brought to the police station by a taxi driver. He submitted that another co-accused, police officer I.B., had punched the victim several times in the stomach area. Then I.B. had taken money from the pocket of Leonid Ghimp’s trousers and had paid the taxi driver. After that, he had punched Leonid Ghimp several more times. A.P. also stated that the beating had taken place in his presence and that of two other people, a police officer and a person who had been brought to the police station that evening and had been in the same room. A.P. stated that he had decided to change his initial statement because he had felt remorseful and sorry for Leonid Ghimp’s children and wife. His statement was given in the presence of a lawyer between 10.17 p.m. and 11 p.m. and was videotaped. At the time of his questioning he was not detained in custody.', '20. During further questioning of the other two police officers suspected of ill-treating Leonid Ghimp, they also admitted that he had been brought by a taxi driver to the police station – not found sleeping at a bus stop as had been mentioned in the report of his arrest and as initially stated by them. They continued, however, to deny having ill-treated him.', '21. The prosecutor also examined the room where questioning usually took place in the Ciocana police station and in which the victim had allegedly been beaten up, and discovered numerous blood stains on the walls and furniture.', '22. During the subsequent court proceedings, suspect A.P. changed his statement again and submitted that nobody had ill-treated Leonid Ghimp on the evening of 10 December 2005. When asked why he had admitted on 6 July 2006 to one of the co-accused having ill-treated Leonid Ghimp in his presence, he replied that he could not remember having made such a statement because he had been very tired and hungry on that day, as he had been on duty the previous night and had worked around the clock. He remembered, however, that the prosecutor had threatened him and had used a swear word in doing so and that he had not been assisted by a lawyer of his choice. He also argued that at the time of questioning he had not realised the questioning was being filmed.', '23. On 9 July 2007 the Ciocana District Court found police officers A.P., S.C. and I.B. guilty of acts of violence against Leonid Ghimp causing his death. They were also found guilty of making false statements in the report of Leonid Ghimp’s arrest and in the report of witness O.O.’s arrest and were each sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment. The court also ordered them to pay compensation to the first applicant in respect of non-pecuniary damage in the amount of 300,000 lei (MDL) and ruled that the rest of the claims made by her be examined in separate civil proceedings.', '24. The police officers appealed against conviction. During the appeal proceedings, one of the officers, I.B., presented a new version of events, namely that Leonid Ghimp had fallen down in the police station and that a table had fallen on top of him. On 7 November 2007 the Chişinău Court of Appeal partially allowed the officers’ appeals and reduced I.B.’s sentence to six years’ imprisonment and that of A.P. and S.C. to five years each.', '25. On 11 March 2008 the Supreme Court of Justice allowed an appeal on points of law brought by the officers and, after concluding that the case had not been thoroughly examined, quashed the judgment of the Court of Appeal and ordered a re-examination of the proceedings by the same court.', '26. On 6 June 2008 the Chişinău Court of Appeal acquitted the police officers of all charges. A.P.’s statement of 6 July 2006 was excluded on the grounds that it had been obtained in breach of the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, namely that it had been obtained late in the evening when A.P. had been very tired and in the absence of a lawyer of his choice. In excluding A.P.’s statement the court relied on the statement of a psychologist, who submitted that in cases of extreme tiredness a person may be prone to making false self-incriminating statements. As to the statement of O.O., the court considered it unreliable because she had reason to resent the police officers who had arrested her on 10 December 2005. Moreover, some of the assertions she had made in her statement were considered to be contradictory. As to the findings of the panel of forensic doctors, the court held that they were refuted by the statements of one of the experts who had signed the report dated 31 May 2006, I.C. That expert had been invited to testify by one of the accused police officers. He had changed his opinion and had stated that Leonid Ghimp’s injuries could have been caused between 6.35 a.m. on 9 December and 6.35 a.m. on 10 December 2005 that is prior to his detention. In accepting I.C.’s new opinion, the court did not explain why it preferred it over the conclusion of the panel of forensic doctors or what had made I.C. change his opinion after two years had passed. In so far as the charges of making false statements in the arrest reports were concerned, the court found that the accused had indeed made false statements; however, as there was no personal gain involved, they were acquitted.', '27. On 27 January 2009 a panel of the Supreme Court of Justice dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by the Prosecutor’s Office and by the first applicant. The Prosecutor’s Office challenged this judgment with an extraordinary appeal.', '28. On 1 March 2010 the Plenary Supreme Court of Justice accepted the extraordinary appeal and quashed both the judgment of the Court of Appeal and that of the Supreme Court of 27 January 2009. The Supreme Court found, inter alia, that the findings of the first panel of forensic doctors could not be rebutted by the opinion of a single doctor and that only the opinion of another panel of doctors could be acceptable. A fresh re-examination of the appeal against the judgment of 9 July 2007 was ordered.', '29. During the proceedings, the Court of Appeal ordered a repeated forensic examination in respect of the circumstances of Leonid Ghimp’s death by a panel of doctors from the National Institute of Forensic Medicine. In the meantime, I.C., the expert who had testified during the previous proceedings before the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 26 above), had become the chief doctor of the National Institute of Forensic Medicine.', '30. In an expert report dated 1 November 2010, a panel of doctors reached, on the basis of medical documents, a conclusion identical to that expressed by I.C. during the previous proceedings before the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 26 above), namely that the victim’s injury had been caused between 6.35 a.m. on 9 December and 6.35 a.m. on 10 December 2005. According to the report, the rupture of his intestine had initially been incomplete and only on 12 December 2005 had it become complete, causing Leonid Ghimp’s death.', '31. On 28 February 2011 the Chişinău Court of Appeal upheld the appeals lodged by the officers, reversed the judgment of the Ciocana Disctrict Court of 9 July 2007 and acquitted the officers of all the charges against them. In so doing, the Court of Appeal attributed substantial weight to the new forensic report of 1 November 2010.', '32. On 29 May 2012 the Supreme Court of Justice dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by the Prosecutor’s Office.', '33. The Police Act of 18 December 1990 states:', '“Police officers are only entitled to use force and special fighting techniques for the purpose of ending criminal activities and for neutralising resistance to lawful demands in cases in which non-violent methods are not sufficient to discharge their obligations.”']",['2'],['2-1'],[],[],[],[]

He was represented before the Court by Mr I. Uvarov, a lawyer practising in Chernigiv. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Mrs V. Lutkovska and Mr Y. Zaytsev.', 'The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', 'On 18 February 2001 the applicant brought a car registered in Lithuania (a 1986 Volvo 740) into the customs territory of Ukraine. When crossing the border he undertook an obligation to re-export the car before 27 February 2001. According to the State authorities he failed to do so.', 'On 23 June 2003, the Chernigiv Customs Office (“the Customs Office”) drew up a report on an infringement of customs regulations due to the applicant’s failure to remove the car from the customs territory of Ukraine (Article 113 of the Customs Code 1991). This case of a violation of customs regulations was referred to the Novozavodsky District Court of Chernigiv (“the Novozavodsky Court”) for consideration.', 'On 26 December 2003, having heard the applicant, who stated that he had taken the car to Russia, although he had no confirmation for this, and the Customs Office, which explained that a check of the records did not confirm that the car had crossed the border into Russia, the Novozavodsky Court returned the case to the customs authorities for corrections and additional verification. In particular, the court noted that the information submitted by the Customs authority contained an inaccuracy as to the chassis number of the vehicle (00761 instead of 007612) and therefore the court ordered that the customs records be checked once again with the correct chassis number.', 'On 23 January 2004 the applicant left Ukraine to take up permanent residence in Russia without informing the court about his new address.', 'The Novozavodsky Court summoned the applicant for a further hearing in February 2004.', 'By a letter of 16 February 2004, the applicant’s lawyer informed the court that the applicant had registered as having left his apartment in Ukraine and had left for Russia at the end of January.

The applicant’s mother, who appeared before the court, confirmed that his actual place of residence was unknown. The court considered the applicant’s failure to appear before it as an intentional evasion from justice and decided that the case could be considered in the applicant’s absence. The court then found the applicant guilty of having failed to re-export the car in violation of Section 113 of the Customs Code 1991 and reclassified the offence under Section 348 of the Customs Code 2002. The court ordered the confiscation of the vehicle, but given that the car’s location was unknown, it replaced confiscation with payment of 16,779.31 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH) (about 2,237 euros (EUR)), which corresponded to the value of the car, in accordance with Section 450 of the Customs Code 2002.', 'On an unknown date the applicant lodged a request for review of the decision of 16 March 2004 with the President of the Chernigiv Court of Appeal.', 'By a letter of 7 July 2004 the President of the Chernigiv Court of Appeal informed the applicant that he had examined his case file and his request and found no reason for the review.

The applicant pointed out that he was entitled to take his legal correspondence unopened unless the governor had reasonable cause to suspect an illicit enclosure, but the officer refused to give it to him. The officer proceeded to inform the applicant that he would be referring the letters to the principal officer in his wing.', 'On 17 September 1998 another prison officer summoned the applicant to his office and told him that there were two legal letters for him. Each envelope was marked with a reference to Rule 37A of the Prison Rules 1964 (“the Rule,” later replaced by Rule 39 of the Prison Rules 1999, see Relevant Domestic Law below) and each bore a franked strip containing details of the solicitor from whom the correspondence originated. The officer pulled out legal paperwork from a larger envelope which had already been opened. When the applicant complained, the officer told him that the envelope was already open when he had entered the office. The officer then inspected the contents of the envelope before he handed the envelope and the legal papers over to the applicant. The officer then picked up a smaller envelope, opened it, and inspected its contents before handing it over. When the applicant protested about the breach of the applicable Rule, the officer laughed and said “So report me to John Major” (the British Prime Minister between 1990 and 1997). The following day the applicant made a formal complaint about the matter which led to the promulgation of a notice to staff drawing attention to the effect of the Rule in question.', 'On 5 October 1998 the applicant noticed that his name was on a board indicating that he had received mail. When the applicant asked for his mail he was told that there was a letter for him marked with reference to the Rule, but the officer on duty refused to hand it over to him unless he was willing to open it in his presence. Later that day another officer called the applicant and informed him that there was a letter for him. The officer then proceeded to rip the letter open. When the applicant asked him why he was doing this, the officer told him that the new notice mentioned above only applied to outgoing mail. The applicant made a complaint ten days later.', 'On 5 December 2000, whilst the applicant was pursuing County Court proceedings against one of the prison officers, that particular officer opened two letters marked “Durham County Court” addressed to the applicant without the latter’s knowledge or consent. The officer then handed them to the applicant already opened.', 'The applicant made several complaints to the effect that his correspondence, both outgoing and incoming, was being treated by prison officers in a manner that conflicted with the requirements of the Rule.', 'The applicant found his attempts to pursue the matter both through the formal prison complaints systems and the Prisons Ombudsman unsatisfactory, and he was eventually granted legal aid to bring an action for damages in the courts.', 'On 15 July 2003 the County Court gave judgment refusing the applicant’s claims for damages for misfeasance in public office against the Home Office and 14 named prison officers. The judge found that most of the prison officers had committed a breach of the Rule but that they had not acted in bad faith. He found further that some misunderstandings had arisen in prison W. from the fact that although the prison governor had notified both prisoners and prison staff on 21 September 1998 about the effect of the Rule, he had overlooked the fact that the letters which a court sent to a prisoner bore the name of the court on the envelope but contained no reference to Standing Order 5 (see Relevant Domestic Law below). Moreover, the judge was satisfied that some of the officers had opened the relevant letters accidentally and in other cases he ascribed the breach of the Rule to inadequate training. Therefore, the applicant’s claims against those officers failed as bad faith was an essential ingredient of the tort of misfeasance in public office.', 'Though the County Court judge found that three prison officers had, on the balance of probabilities, acted in bad faith when dealing with the applicant’s legally privileged correspondence in breach of the Rule, he was not satisfied that the applicant had suffered any loss or damage as a result. In particular, the judge stated that at its highest, the applicant’s case was that he had suffered embarrassment and injury to his sense of pride and dignity. Without minimising in any way the effect of the breaches of confidentiality in issue, the judge found that the reactions suffered by the applicant came nowhere near to mental, still less physical injury. Neither had there been any allegation of financial loss or actual prejudice to his position in any of the litigation in which he was engaged. Furthermore, having listened to the evidence and seen the applicant in the witness box, it was considered that he had not been particularly embarrassed or humiliated. In sum, the applicant seemed to the County Court judge to be “ a man of some intelligence who had acquired some knowledge of the legal process and, without in any way trivialising his complaints or minimising the effect upon him, ... it could be said that in many ways he appeared to thrive on these conflicts.”', 'An application for permission to appeal was made but refused by the County Court judge. The application for leave to appeal was then renewed before the Court of Appeal and permission to appeal was granted on the papers on 17 October 2003. The applicant appealed against the dismissal of his claims against the three officers who had acted in bad faith, contending that the tort of misfeasance in public office was a tort actionable per se, and so capable of being established without proof of damage, or alternatively capable of being established by proof of anxiety and distress falling short of physical or mental injury.', 'On 20 July 2004 the Court of Appeal gave judgment on the applicant’s appeal against the County Court’s decision of 15 July 2003. The applicant’s appeal was allowed on the ground that, acting in bad faith, the three officers had infringed a constitutional right of such importance, namely, that of unimpeded access to court and access to confidential legal advice, that the applicant’s cause of action in misfeasance in public office was complete even without proof of damage. The Court of Appeal held that the County Court judge’s conclusion on the issue was therefore wrong and that the applicant was entitled at least to nominal damages against the officers who had acted in bad faith. The Court of Appeal further stated that it was for the trial judge and not itself to determine whether exemplary damages should be awarded.', 'The applicant’s appeal was allowed, a nominal award of GBP 5 (British pounds sterling) was entered against the three defendants who had been found to have acted in bad faith and the case was remitted back to the County Court judge to determine whether to make an exemplary award against any of the defendants and if so, for assessment of the sums to be awarded. The Court of Appeal also granted the Home Office leave to appeal to the House of Lords on condition that it paid the applicant’s costs irrespective of the outcome.', 'On 29 March 2006 the House of Lords allowed the Home Office’s appeal and restored the judgment of the County Court judge. The House of Lords found that, though in the present context the unlawfulness of what was done to interfere with the applicant’s enjoyment of his right to confidential legal correspondence was clear, the House should not take the novel step of introducing into the tort of misfeasance in public office a right to damages (based on the importance of the constitutional right infringed) in the absence of material damage to the victim. It was noted in this regard that the great weight of authority treated damage as an element of the tort. Furthermore, it was considered that the applicant had legal remedies available to him, namely, judicial review against prison officers who acted in breach of the applicable rules (even in the absence of bad faith) and the prison governors. Moreover, it was suggested that errant officers would be susceptible to disciplinary sanctions and that failure to initiate such proceedings could also on appropriate evidence be challenged by judicial review, or alternatively that the officers in question might well be indictable for the common law offence of misconduct in public office.', 'The House of Lords also considered that any breach of a fundamental human or constitutional right would be covered by section 7 of the Human Rights Act 1998. It could reasonably be inferred that Parliament had intended that infringements of the core human and constitutional rights protected by the Act should be remedied under it and not by the development of parallel remedies. As it was held that there was no existing right to damages where misfeasance in public office had caused no material damage to the victim, the European Court of Human Rights could be expected to award compensation for non-pecuniary loss in cases where the evidence showed an egregious and deliberate abuse of power by a public officer.', 'Though ultimately agreeing with the majority that the appeal should be allowed, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe commented that if the Home Office were successful in their appeal, the applicant would have no private law remedy at his disposal and that judicial review would not offer him a prospect of damages. He considered that judicial review, with the preliminary filter of the need for leave and little prospect of obtaining an order for cross-examination of witnesses, was hardly a satisfactory substitute for an action in the county court.', 'The House of Lords ultimately ruled that the tort of misfeasance in public office was never actionable without proof of material damage as its function was to compensate the claimant and not punish the public officer. Consequently, it was held that the Home Office’s appeal should be allowed, that the Court of Appeal’s order should be set aside save as to costs and that the order of the County Court judge should be restored.', 'Rule 39 of the Prison Rules 1999 (SI 1999/728) which replaced rule 37A of the Prison Rules 1964 (SI 1964/388) in identical terms provides as follows:', '“(1) A prisoner may correspond with his legal adviser and any court and such correspondence may only be opened, read or stopped by the governor in accordance with the provisions of this rule.', '(2) Correspondence to which this rule applies may be opened if the governor has reasonable cause to believe that it contains an illicit enclosure and any such enclosures shall be dealt with in accordance with the other provision of these Rules. (3) Correspondence to which this rule applies may be opened, read and stopped if the governor has reasonable cause to believe its contents endanger prison security or the safety of others or are otherwise of a criminal nature.', '(4) A prisoner shall be given the opportunity to be present when any correspondence to which this rule applies is opened and shall be informed if it or any enclosure is to be read or stopped.', '(5) A prisoner shall on request be provided with any writing materials necessary for the purposes of paragraph (1).', '(6) In this rule, ""court"" includes the European Commission of Human Rights, the European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice; and ‘illicit enclosure’ includes any article possession of which has not been authorised in accordance with the other provisions of these Rules and any correspondence to or from a person other than the prisoner concerned, his legal adviser or a court.”', 'Standing Order 5 includes a direction that an envelope carrying correspondence between an inmate and his/her legal adviser should be marked with a reference to the above Rule. It further explains the effect of the new Rule as follows:', '“Prison Rule 37A [now Rule 39] ... applies to all correspondence between an inmate and his or her legal adviser or a court (including the European bodies referred to in the Rules). Such correspondence carries special privileges under the Rules and may not be read or opened for examination unless in accordance with instructions laid down by Prison Service Headquarters...”', 'Home Office instruction (113/1995, 21 December 1995) to prison governors requires them to protect such correspondence against inadvertent or deliberate opening by, in particular, the training of staff handling prisoners’ mail.', 'Part 54.3 of the Civil Procedure Rules and section 31 (4) of the Supreme Court Act 1981 contain the relevant rules governing the bringing of a claim for damages in tort in the same proceedings as a judicial review claim. Claims for public law remedies (such as a mandatory order, prohibitory order or quashing order), injunctions or declarations may be made by way of judicial review proceedings. Damages may also be claimed alongside such remedies provided that a cause of action for such damages exists under the law of tort.', 'Since the coming into force of the Human Rights Act 1998 (“HRA 1998”) on 2 October 2000, a court may grant such relief or remedy within its powers as it considers just and appropriate for breaches of Convention rights (section 8 of HRA). In deciding whether to award damages, or the amount of any award, the court must take into account the principles applied by this Court in relation to the award of compensation under Article 41 of the Convention.']",[],[],[],[],[],[]

From 1990 to 1997 the applicant was the leader of the drivers' trade union of a bread-making company in Galaţi. He was also a member of the National Christian-Democrat Agrarian Party (“PNTcd”, Partidul Naţional Ţărănesc creştin şi democrat). On 3 February 1997 his work contract was terminated on disciplinary grounds."", ""4. In the February-March 1998 issue of the monthly local journal Opinia P.C. published an article under the heading: “The snake within the PNTcd – because of him, Galaţi was almost left without bread” (Sarpele din sânul PNTcd – din cauza lui Galaţiul era să rămână fără pâine) in which he accused the applicant mainly of maintaining an ungrounded conflict with the company's management, of harassing and defaming its director, of having repeatedly neglected his work duties alleging trade union needs and of having jeopardised bread distribution in Galaţi in pursuit of his personal goals."", 'The relevant parts of the article read as follows:', ""“... Through his actions – lying, defaming and falsifying – he does nothing but undermine the PNTcd's credibility... That is why Victor Truţă may be called, without hesitation:"", 'The snake within the PNTcd', 'Paradoxically, sometimes bad faith comes from within the trade unions. I say this because the conflict between an uninspired trade union leader and the management of [the bread-making company in Galaţi] jeopardised the bread supply of the inhabitants of Galaţi on several occasions.”', ""The article was accompanied by the applicant's photograph and several documents issued by the employer or the trade union concerning the applicant's activity."", '5. On 30 April 1998 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint with the Galaţi District Court against A.Z., the director of Opinia, and P.C., its chief editor. He accused them of having damaged his reputation by publishing that article. He sought 400,000,000 Romanian Lei (ROL) in respect of nonpecuniary damage.', '6. Between 19 October 1998 and 28 October 1999, the Galaţi District Court held several hearings in the case. However, it could not examine the case, as P.C. had not been properly identified and summoned (according to the applicant, another person with the same name had been summoned to appear in court instead). In addition, the applicant claimed that on 20 April 1999 the court had informed him that the next hearing would take place on 11 May, whereas in reality the court had met on 6 May, and thus he was not able to participate in the court hearing. He was present at the other hearings.', ""7. On 28 October 1999 the court sent the case to the Prosecutor's Office and asked it to identify the accused P.C."", ""8. On 17 March 2000 the prosecutor sent the case back with the information requested and it was registered in the District Court's list of cases again."", '9. The applicant complained six times against the judges or prosecutors, asking them to step down. His requests were all dismissed.', '10. The parties were heard and documents were adduced. The applicant claimed that the court had refused to hear his witness and had not asked for additional evidence.', ""11. The court gave judgment on 3 June 2002. It acquitted the journalists and dismissed the applicant's claim for damages. It also ordered the applicant to pay ROL 2,500,000 to the State in respect of costs incurred in the proceedings."", '12. It noted that P.C. had written the article in good faith, had based it on documents provided by A.Z. and information available in other press articles previously published on the subject, and had checked the facts by means of a journalistic investigation. Furthermore, the applicant had failed to prove that the journalists had acted with the intent to defame him.', ""13. The applicant appealed, arguing notably that the court's decision contradicted the evidence in the file, that the court had not examined the offensive language used in the article, had not given reasons for rejecting the civil claims and had unlawfully ordered him to pay the costs incurred by the State. He also requested that the court declare null and void an interlocutory judgment by means of which the District Court upheld a request by one of the judges to be allowed to step down from the case."", '14. In addition, on 26 June 2003 he also lodged a constitutional complaint against the order to pay costs. On 8 July 2003 the complaint was dismissed as unfounded by the Constitutional Court, on the ground that justice was not free of charge and that court fees did not as such restrict or deny access to court, as in any case the authorities were bound to investigate and decide on the case even when the parties refused to cover the expenses.', '15. In a final decision of 17 September 2003 the Galaţi County Court upheld the judgment.', ""16. The County Court had examined the applicant's arguments one by one. In essence, it found that the first-instance court had correctly interpreted the facts and the evidence in the file and considered that the reasons given for acquitting the journalists constituted relevant justification for dismissing the civil claim. It also considered that the complaints against the interlocutory judgment and against the obligation to reimburse the costs were unfounded.""]",[],[],[],[],[],[]

The applicant, Mr Dumitru-Aurel Daniliuc, is a Romanian national who was born in 1967. He is currently detained in Arad Maximum Security Prison. The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms I. Cambrea, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.', '2. By a final judgment of 15 January 2003 the Arad County Court convicted the applicant of aggravated murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment. He was imprisoned in Arad Maximum Security Prison.', '3. The applicant lodged his first application with the Court on 23 August 2003; however, his file was destroyed because he had not submitted a complete application pack by the required time-limit.', '4. The applicant lodged a second application with the Court on 24 January 2006 alleging that he had sent the first application pack by the required time-limit as instructed by the Court’s letter of 17 September 2003, but that the Arad Prison authorities had failed to post his letter.', '5. According to the information submitted by the applicant, the food provided by the Arad Prison authorities was insufficient, poorly cooked, failed to include certain food groups (meat, milk, sweets and fruit), was lacking in nutritional value, and was served in unhygienic conditions. Moreover, he did not have adequate access to drinking water because the supply was repeatedly cut off.', '7. On 22 January 2008 the applicant submitted five statements by fellow inmates in support of his application, which generally back up his complaints concerning the quality of the food and lack of adequate access to drinking water.', '8. In a letter of 28 September 2011 the applicant informed the Court that his phone problem had been solved and that he now had daily access to phone conversations.', '9. According to the information submitted by the Government, the Arad Prison was connected to the public water network and was permanently supplied with drinking water.', '10. Between 26 and 31 January 2007 the applicant was hospitalised in Jilava Prison Hospital because he was suffering from gastritis. Upon his discharge from the prison hospital he was recommended a diet suitable for his gastritis. He was given a special diet until October 2009, when this was modified to take into account the applicant’s medical condition of dystrophia which led to the wasting of his muscles.', '11. The applicant’s daily diet contained 4,000 calories and included all the food groups. The food was varied and was not cooked in the same way all the time. The quality of the ingredients was checked on a daily basis by the prison’s governor, a doctor and a representative of the prisoners.', '12. The prison had two rooms fitted with two and three phones, respectively. From March 2007 the phones were fitted with booths in order to preserve the confidentiality of the phone conversations. The prison wardens charged with the surveillance of the prisoners’ phone conversations had a duty to record the numbers dialled by the prisoners in a report and then to visually supervise the prisoners during the phone conversations.', '13. From 2009 the Arad Prison was fitted with an electronic phone system and twenty-one phones were installed in all the detention areas. The prisoners were granted the right to use the phones on a daily basis under visual supervision.', '14. On an unspecified date in 2004 the applicant brought proceedings against Arad Prison seeking a court order to force the prison authorities to provide him with copies of his prison file.', '15. By a final judgment of 18 November 2004 the Arad County Court allowed the applicant’s action in part and ordered the prison authorities to provide him with copies of the covering notes of his prison file, on the ground that these contained notes made by the authorities concerning the applicant, including how much of a danger he was considered to be. The court held, with regard to the other documents contained in the file, that according to the applicant’s own statements he had already been allowed access to them and had been provided with copies. Finally, the court dismissed his request for copies of the photographs contained in the file, stating that they were photographs taken on his arrival at the prison and that he had insufficient justification for being given them.', '16. On 10 April 2006, the applicant brought proceedings against the Arad Prison authorities seeking a court order to force them to stop the illtreatment he alleged he was being subjected to. He argued that, among other things, the food was insufficient and of poor quality and that he had been repeatedly taken before the domestic courts in restrictive handcuffs and chains. He also asked to be taken to a specialist for a medical examination and argued that the confidentiality of his phone conversations was not being respected in so far as his conversations could be overheard by other prisoners and the wardens and the fact that he had been compelled to inform the prison authorities of the phone numbers he wished to call prior to dialling the numbers.', '17. On 19 September 2006 the applicant brought proceedings against the Arad Prison authorities seeking a court order to force them to take him for an ophthalmological examination. He argued that as a result of the poor living conditions, in particular the thick metal grille obstructing natural light from entering the “metal cage” he was living in, he had partially lost his eye sight.', '18. By a final judgment of 9 November 2006 the Arad County Court allowed in part the action brought by the applicant against the Arad Prison authorities on 10 April 2006 and ordered them to ensure the confidentiality of the applicant’s phone conversations. The domestic court held that according to Article 9 § 1 of Emergency Ordinance no. 56/2003, phone conversations were to be treated as confidential. However, according to witness statements, the applicant’s conversations had taken place in a room fitted with three phones and no phone booths, in the presence of two prison wardens and other prisoners. Consequently, the prison wardens and the other prisoners present in the room might have been able to overhear the applicant’s conversations.', '19. The court dismissed the remainder of the applicant’s complaints. It held that, although this was a complaint not regulated by Ordinance no. 56/2003, according to the information submitted by the Arad Prison authorities the daily diet provided to the applicant had contained 2,855 calories and had been of good quality. The applicant had not substantiated his claim that he had asked the prison medical staff to take him to be examined by a specialist. The witnesses heard by the court in respect of the applicant’s claim of being tightly handcuffed and chained were unable to report on the applicant’s individual situation and, in any event, the prison authorities reported that his restraint was prescribed by paragraph 12 (4) of Ministry of Justice Order no. 2964/C/1999, which was applicable in his case. Finally, the fact that the prison authorities had limited the duration and number of the applicant’s phone conversations did not breach any of the applicant’s rights - a practice that was allowed by Ordinance no. 56/2003.', '20. By a final judgment of 14 December 2006 the Arad County Court dismissed the action brought by the applicant against the Arad Prison authorities on 19 September 2006 on the ground that his claims were unsubstantiated. The applicant’s prison medical file did not contain any record that he was suffering from eye problems or that he had requested to see a specialist physician. Moreover, the metal grille fitted to the window was closed only during the night, between 7.30 p.m. and 7.30 a.m., and the room was fitted with a 120 cm neon light which was kept on even during the day when the grille was open.', '21. On 8 November 2006 the applicant brought proceedings against the prison authorities, seeking to obtain a court order to stop the prison wardens from recording the phone numbers he called and from limiting the number of his phone calls. Moreover, he demanded that the metal grill (fitted one metre from the door and window of his cell) be removed on the ground that this prevented natural light from entering the room, made it impossible for him to open the window, and caused him to live in a metal cage.', '22. On 23 November 2006 the applicant brought proceedings against the Arad Prison authorities seeking to be declassified from the “maximum security” regime under which he was detained.', '23. By a final judgment of 15 January 2007 the Arad District Court dismissed the applicant’s action of 23 November 2006 on the grounds that the seriousness of his crime and his conduct did not justify his declassification from the “maximum security” regime.', '24. By a final judgment of 26 February 2007 the Arad District Court dismissed the applicant’s action of 8 November 2006 on the ground that the requirement to pre-register the phone numbers the applicant was calling and the limitation on the number of phone calls he could make pursued a legitimate aim and did not interfere with the requirement of confidentiality of private phone conversations. This measure was put in force in order to deter the applicant from committing new crimes and the authorities were able to keep a record of the number of calls made by each prisoner and the individuals he had telephone contact with. Further, this was the only way each prisoner could be allowed access to phone calls given the limited number of available phones. The court also dismissed the applicant’s action seeking the removal of the metal grille fitted in his cell, on the ground that the grille served as a deterrent against escape. However, the court ordered the Arad Prison authorities to enforce a schedule for the opening of a door fitted in this grille facing the window so that the applicant could air the room. The court held that the door of the grille should be open at least between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. during the winter and between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. during the summer.', '25. On 31 July 2007 the applicant brought proceedings against the Arad Prison authorities, seeking a court order to force them to provide him with full copies of Ministry of Justice Orders nos. 144/C/2002 and 1852/C/2006.', '26. By a final judgment of 31 January 2008 the Arad District Court dismissed the applicant’s action of 31 July 2007 on the ground that the orders requested by the applicant were not mentioned in Article 43 § 1 of Law no. 275/2006 as being among those documents which were required to be made available to prisoners, and that they did not concern the applicant directly. The orders regulated the functioning of the special security measures in maximum security prisons and the applicant had not provided a reason why he needed full copies of such documents, particularly since he had already been provided with copies of the excerpts from the said orders which did concern him directly.', '27. On 23 May and 23 June 2006 the applicant complained to the National Prison Administration that although he had not been classified as a highly dangerous inmate, he had been restrained each time he was taken before the domestic courts. He claimed that the prison guards intentionally tightened the restraints in order to cause him physical suffering. Moreover, he argued that his living conditions, in so far as the metal grille fitted to his room was concerned, did not comply with the acknowledged European standards for prisoners.', '28. In two letters, nos. B21113 and B21128, the National Prison Administration informed the applicant that his living conditions and the methods used by the prison wardens to restrain him complied with the provisions of the Romanian Ministry of Justice Order no. 2964/C/1999, which set out the rules for prisoners serving life sentences, and provided him with the relevant excerpts from the said order. Moreover, the applicant was informed that, as of 6 March 2006, he was no longer classified as a “highly dangerous” prisoner.', '29. On 11 October and 1 November 2006, relying on the provisions of the Criminal Code of Romania (the Criminal Code), the applicant brought proceedings against three employees of Arad Prison, namely P.L., M.N. and A.P., for unlawful interference with his correspondence.', '30. On an unspecified date in 2006, again relying on the provisions of the Criminal Code, the applicant brought proceedings against E.S.P. and S.T., prison wardens at Arad Prison, for unlawful censorship and interception of his phone conversations. The applicant complained that the serial number of the phone card he had used and the numbers he had dialled had been registered in a phone record book and that the confidentiality of his conversations had been breached in so far as his phone conversations had been conducted on at the same time as other prisoners who were using the other two phones available in the room.', '31. On 8 January 2007 the applicant brought proceedings against the head of Arad Prison for abuse of power. He argued that on 7 January 2007 the head of the prison had not allowed him to phone his family and he had stated that the applicant could phone his family only on certain dates. Lastly, the prison authorities had breached the confidentiality of his phone calls because he had been forced to disclose the phone numbers he was calling.', '32. By a final judgment of 21 May 2007 the Arad County Court dismissed the applicant’s action against E.S.P. and S.T. on the ground that no unlawful act had been committed by the prison wardens The court held that E.S.P. and S.T. had performed their lawful duty and ensured that all prisoners had access to the phones at least once a week, in compliance with the applicable legal provisions. The fact that the applicant had been compelled to register, in a phone record book, the serial number of the phone card he was using and the numbers he wished to dial did not amount to censorship of his phone conversations.', '33. By a final judgment of 25 July 2007 the Arad County Court dismissed the proceedings brought by the applicant on 11 October and 1 November 2006 against P.L., M.N. and A.P. on the ground that no unlawful act had been committed. The court held that P.L. had mistakenly cut an opening of 2 cm in envelope no. 11216 before he realised that it was addressed to the applicant. However, the envelope had not been further opened and no one had been able to see or copy its contents. Moreover, the applicant had not raised any objections or complaints in respect of this damage at the time he was handed the envelope by M.N. and A.P.', '34. By a final judgment of 18 October 2007 the Arad County Court dismissed the applicant’s action of 8 January 2007 on the ground that no unlawful act had been committed by the governor of Arad Prison. It held that the Arad District Court had already examined the applicant’s complaints concerning the restriction of his phone rights to certain dates and his duty to disclose the numbers he wished to dial and had found it lawful. Moreover, the applicant had not indicated any emergency that would have justified his demand for access to the phone on a particular date.', '35.

Section 12 of the Ministry of Justice Order no. 2964/C/1999 provides that restraints must be used in respect of prisoners serving a life sentence when they are transferred from the prison, appear in public or attend hearings before domestic courts.', '37. Article 43 § 1 of Law no. 275/2006 provides that, immediately following their imprisonment, prisoners are to be provided with copies of Laws nos. 544/2001, 275/2006 and the rules governing the enforcement of the said laws, copies of the orders and the relevant sections of the Romanian Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure concerning the execution of prison sentences, and copies of the prison rules and guidelines.', '38. Section 6 of the Ministry of Justice’s Order no. 4622/2003 and the National Prison Administration’s decision no. 81800/2007 oblige the prison wardens to move away from the prisoner after they have witnessed him dialling the number he has registered in advance, in order to ensure the privacy of the phone conversation.']",[],[],[],[],[],[]
001-76505,ENG,LIE,CHAMBER,2006,CASE OF VON HOFFEN v. LIECHTENSTEIN,3,Violation of Art. 6-1 (length);Remainder inadmissible;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings,,"['4. The applicant was born in 1952 and currently lives in Schaanwald.', '5. On 17 December 1991 investigating judge L. at the Vaduz Regional Court (Landgericht) heard the applicant, who was named Eugen Heeb at that time, on suspicion of fraud (proceedings 8 Vr 17/91). He was questioned in particular about his activities as a member of the board of directors of MGS, a stock company considered to be the centre of a whole network of companies involved in large-scale investment fraud.', '6. On 4 May and 1 July 1994, respectively, two further sets of proceedings (8 Vr 211/94 and 8 Vr 305/94) concerning charges of investment fraud were opened against the applicant. One set of proceedings concerned investment fraud committed to the detriment of Allgemeine Vermögensverwaltung Frankurt and Ahorn Trust. The other concerned investment fraud committed to the detriment of investors of Merkantus AG and Allied Banking Corporation. On 6 June 1994 the applicant was questioned as a suspect.', '7. On 6 November 1996, the applicant changed his name to von Hoffen through adoption.', '8. On 23 January 1997 the Mannheim Public Prosecutor transmitted files concerning investigations on suspicion of investment fraud against the applicant and a number of accomplices, relating partly to the same facts as the investigations opened by the Liechtenstein authorities. On 15 June 1997 a search of the applicant’s premises was carried out at which a number of documents were seized. On 1 July 1997 the applicant was questioned as a suspect. It appears that, subsequently, witnesses were questioned by the police at the investigating judge’s request, and a further search warrant was issued.', '9. Investigating judge L. at the Vaduz Regional Court issued an arrest warrant against the applicant on 29 February 2000. On the same date a search warrant for the applicant’s private and business premises was issued for the purpose of seizing documents. The proceedings in files 8 Vr 211/94 and 8 Vr 305/94 were joined and extended to include further suspects. In the following two months numerous requests for legal assistance were addressed to the German, Austrian and Swiss authorities.', '10. In early 2000 proceedings for abuse of authority were opened against investigating judge L. He was accused of having remained inactive for years in several sets of proceedings, including the applicant’s. On 20 March 2000 L. declared himself biased on account of the criminal proceedings pending against him. On 23 March the President of the Vaduz Regional Court accepted judge L.’s withdrawal from the applicant’s case, which was taken over by investigating judge H. Judge L. resigned subsequently and the proceedings against him were discontinued.', '11. On 11 May 2000 the applicant was arrested in Switzerland and extradited to Liechtenstein on the next day.', '12. On 14 May 2000 the Vaduz Regional Court ordered his pre-trial detention inter alia on suspicion of aggravated fraud. Referring to the results of the investigations in all three sets of proceedings (8 Vr 17/91, 8 Vr 211/94 and 8 Vr 305/94), the Vaduz Regional Court found that the applicant was suspected of having organised a network of companies involved in large-scale investment fraud. Given that the applicant had been arrested in Switzerland and having regard to the severity of the sentence to be expected, the Regional Court found that there was a danger of the applicant’s absconding. Moreover, there was a danger that he might hide relevant documents or try to influence witnesses, in particular employees of his companies.', '13. On 23 May 2000 the two sets of proceedings opened in 1994 were joined to the proceedings which had been opened in 1991.', '14. On 23 June 2000 the applicant’s counsel complained that the window of his prison cell remained closed at all times. Subsequently, the investigating judge instructed the prison personnel to ensure that the applicant’s cell was properly aired.', '15. At the close of the preliminary investigation, the file consisted of 21 volumes plus 29 folders and annexes and, in addition, 18 volumes relating to proceedings conducted before German courts against the applicant’s accomplices. The total volume amounted to some 30,000 pages.', '16. On 8 January 2001 the Public Prosecutor’s Office filed the indictment. On 19 January 2001, the proceedings concerning facts not covered by the indictment, including those against the applicant which had been opened in 1991, were separated from the main proceedings.', '17. Subsequently, a number of judges of the Vaduz Regional Court withdrew from the case due to the fact that they had participated in the preliminary investigation.', '18. The Vaduz Regional Court held the trial on eighteen half-days between 29 May and 12 June 2001, in the presence of the applicant and his counsel. On the latter date the Regional Court convicted the applicant of two counts of aggravated fraud and sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment. The first count concerned investment fraud committed to the detriment of Allgemeine Vermögensverwaltung Frankfurt and Ahorn Trust. The second count concerned investment fraud committed to the detriment of over 4,000 investors of Mercantus AG and Allied Banking Corporation.', '19. In its judgment, running to 146 pages, the Regional Court dealt extensively with the assessment of the evidence before it, namely the statements of numerous witnesses and accomplices, expert opinions and voluminous documentary evidence, including the convictions of the applicant’s accomplices by German courts. It dismissed the applicant’s defence as not being credible noting that it was full of contradictions and gaps. It found that he had between 1989 and 1991, together with a number of accomplices, enticed thousands of potential investors to place their monies in his various companies, by pretending that they would receive high interest rates.', '20. In fixing the sentence, the court regarded as a mitigating circumstance the long lapse of time since the commission of the offences and the excessive length of the proceedings which it considered to be in violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.', '21. The applicant appealed on 13 September 2001. On 28 September 2001 the Regional Court granted the applicant’s request to extend the statutory time-limit for filing an appeal. The applicant supplemented his appeal on 10 October 2001.', '22. The decision relating to the extension of the time-limit was overturned by the Court of Appeal (Obergericht) but confirmed on 19 December 2001 by the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof) justified derogating from the statutory time-limit laid down in the Code of Criminal Procedure in order to comply with the requirements of Article 6 § 3 (b) of the European Convention of Human Rights.', '23. Between 3 May 2002 and 22 January 2003 the Court of Appeal held eleven days of appeal hearings at which it repeated the taking of evidence and heard a number of additional witnesses upon the applicant’s request. It refused the applicant’s request for a further expert opinion as the relevant facts had already been sufficiently clarified. It also refused to admit a number of questions the applicant wished to put to witness M., who was questioned by a German court under letters rogatory, finding that these questions did not concern any relevant facts.', '24. At the close of the hearings, on 22 January 2003, the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal. On the Public Prosecutor’s appeal, the Court of Appeal raised the applicant’s sentence to nine years’ imprisonment. It found that there were a number of aggravating circumstances and that the duration of the proceedings was not to be considered in favour of the applicant, as his intention had been to create a most complicated network of domestic and foreign companies to obscure his activities and to make investigations as difficult as possible.', '25. On 17 July 2003 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law but granted it as regards the sentence.', '26. The Supreme Court found that the appellate court had given detailed and convincing reasons for its findings, which were based on a whole range of evidence. The Supreme Court reduced the applicant’s sentence to eight years. It found no reason to consider the duration of the proceedings a mitigating circumstance. In any case, it held that the proceedings were extremely complex, involving a large number of victims and necessitating extensive taking of evidence abroad. However, the Court of Appeal had wrongly considered a previous conviction, which was already extinct in the criminal record, as an aggravating circumstance.', '27. The applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the Supreme Court’s judgment. He claimed in particular that the proceedings were unfair in that the courts had failed take evidence in his favour into account and had failed to give sufficient reasons for their assessment of evidence. He contended in general terms that the evidentiary proceedings were defective in that they violated the presumption of innocence. He also complained about the length of the proceedings and asserted that their excessive duration should have been taken into account when fixing his sentence.', '28. On 2 March 2004 the Constitutional Court (Staatsgerichtshof) dismissed the applicant’s complaint. It noted that it was not called upon to examine whether the courts had correctly established the facts and applied the law, but only to review whether they had violated constitutional rights. In the present case, the courts had given detailed and convincing reasons for their assessment of the evidence.', '29. Regarding the length of the proceedings, the Constitutional Court found that the criminal proceedings at issue started only on 29 February 2000 when the arrest warrant against the applicant was issued. They ended on 1 August 2003 when the Supreme Court’s judgment was served on him. Thus, they had lasted three years and five months. Given that the proceedings were complex and the facts particularly difficult to elucidate, the duration of the proceedings was not excessive.', '30. The Constitutional Court’s judgment was served on the applicant’s counsel on 5 March 2004.', '31. Article 239 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozeß-ordnung) reads as follows:', '“In the investigative proceedings, everyone believing to have been aggrieved by a delay caused by the examining magistrate or by an order issued with respect to the investigation or in the course thereof shall have the right to obtain a decision of the Court of Appeal in this regard; ...”']",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[]

The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Ferney-Voltaire, France.', '7. On an unspecified date he arrived in Poland. He married K.P., a Polish national, on 15 March 2001. They initially lived in Kraków, but on 3 July 2001 they moved to France. Their two children were born in September 2001 and October 2002 respectively. The applicant is an artist and runs a small business in France which provides the only support for the family.', ""8. On 21 March 2001 a certain B.M., an administrator of the building in which the applicant's wife had a flat, brought a private prosecution against the applicant for slander (zniewaga) under Article 216 § 1 of the Criminal Code. He alleged that the applicant had addressed him in obscene language in Polish. Subsequently, the private prosecution proceedings were commenced in the Kraków–Śródmieście District Court."", ""9. It appears that following the applicant's departure for France the court sent him summonses in connection with the private prosecution but received no response."", '10. On 15 July 2002 the District Court ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody for a period of three months. It further ordered that a wanted notice (list gończy) be issued with a view to locating and detaining him. It invoked, inter alia, Articles 258 § 1(1) and 259 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter “the CCP”).', 'The District Court held as follows:', '“The accused Franck Ladent has no permanent abode in Poland, [and] does not reside in any place known to the court, and is thus obstructing the proper conduct of the proceedings in the present case and the delivery of a proper judgment within a reasonable time. The need to issue a detention order in respect of the accused is required to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings.', 'Given that the accused Franck Ladent is evading justice he should be sought by means of a wanted notice.”', 'The court ordered the police to execute that decision and to serve a copy of it on the applicant immediately after his arrest and to inform him that he could appeal. The information that a wanted notice had been issued in respect of the applicant was subsequently entered in a central criminal register.', '11. On 8 October 2002 the District Court stayed the proceedings against the applicant on the ground that his whereabouts were unknown.', '12. At the end of 2002 the applicant and his family went on holiday to Kraków. At an unspecified time on the evening of 3 January 2003 they arrived at the Słubice border check-point on their journey back to France by car. During a routine passport check the applicant was asked to get out of his car by the border guard officers.', '13. The applicant was arrested at 8.15 p.m. on the basis of the detention order and the wanted notice issued on 15 July 2002. He was questioned by the officers but could not understand anything they said and refused to sign any documents. In his submissions to the European Court, he said that various requests he made through his wife, such as to be allowed to contact the French Embassy or his family and to be provided with an interpreter or a lawyer, were refused. After about two hours he was informed that he was being arrested but was not told why. He was detained at the Słubice Border Guard detention centre.', '14. While the applicant was being questioned his wife and their two children, the first aged 3 and the second 16 months at the time, had to stay in the car with the engine on as the temperature outside was -10oC.', ""15. On 6 January 2003 the applicant's wife engaged counsel to represent the applicant."", '16. On 7 January 2003 the Director of the Międzyrzecz Detention Centre notified the Kraków–Śródmieście District Court that the applicant had been transferred there and had been detained on the basis of the detention order of 15 July 2002.', ""17. On 9 January 2003 the applicant's counsel filed an application with the Kraków–Śródmieście District Court for the applicant's release and requested that his detention be replaced by other, less restrictive, preventive measures. She also appealed against the detention order issued on 15 July 2002."", ""18. She submitted that the applicant was a French national who permanently resided in France and that he and his wife had left Poland on 3 July 2001. Following the applicant's departure the District Court had sent summonses for the applicant to his wife's address and to another address where the applicant had never lived with the result that the applicant had not known about the criminal proceedings against him and had not been served with the private bill of indictment. Nor had he been informed of his rights and obligations as an accused."", ""19. Counsel further submitted that the District Court had erroneously found that there were reasonable grounds for suspicion that the applicant had slandered B.M. In any event, the alleged offence only carried a fine or a penalty of restriction of liberty (such as a community service order) but not a custodial sentence. Lastly, counsel referred to the very difficult situation of the applicant's family, who were entirely dependent on him."", '20. On 10 January 2003 the Kraków–Śródmieście District Court resumed the private prosecution proceedings against the applicant, noting that his abode had been established. On the same date it quashed the detention order of 15 July 2002 and replaced it with a ban on leaving the country and ordered the applicant to surrender his passport.', 'The District Court held as follows:', '“The accused Franck Ladent was detained on remand on the basis of a detention order issued by this court. Counsel for the accused requested the court to replace the preventive measure imposed on him with a non-custodial one. Counsel in her application argued that the evidence obtained in the case had not sufficiently justified the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed slander; in addition, she submitted that the applicant had not been evading justice and that his failure to appear before the court had not been intentional.', 'The court has found the arguments raised by counsel to be compelling.', ""In these circumstances, in the court's view the detention on remand should be replaced with other measures, namely a ban on leaving the country together with seizure of his passport. That measure will adequately secure the proper conduct of the proceedings...”."", ""21. The District Court further ordered that the private bill of indictment, the decision to release the applicant and the summons to appear before the court be translated into French and served on the applicant and that a copy of its decision be served on the Międzyrzecz Detention Centre's director together with an order to release the applicant."", '22. On 10 January 2003 (a Friday) the District Court clerk sent by facsimile the court order to release the applicant to the Międzyrzecz Detention Centre. However, the Detention Centre refused to accept the facsimile and informed the court registry that it required original documents before it could release the applicant. Consequently, on the same day the District Court ordered the dispatch of the relevant documents by courier service.', '23. The applicant was released from detention in the morning of 13 January 2003 (a Monday). Upon his release he received copies of the three documents translated into French. The applicant submitted that it was only then that he learnt for the first time that he had been accused of slandering B.M..', ""24. On an unspecified date the applicant's counsel requested the District Court to lift the preventive measures imposed on the applicant pursuant to the decision of 10 January 2003 and to replace them with a guarantee of the applicant's appearance given by the President of the Franco-Polish Friendship Society."", ""25. On 17 January 2003 the Kraków–Śródmieście District Court granted that application. It considered that it was appropriate to quash the preventive measures given that the applicant ran his own business in France and supported his family exclusively from the income he received from it. It further considered that the guarantee offered would secure the applicant's appearance and the proper conduct of the proceedings."", '26. It appears that the applicant and his family returned to France on 27 January 2003.', ""27. On 7 February 2003 a local MP from Kraków, Mr Z. Wassermann wrote a letter to the President of the Kraków Court of Appeal requesting explanations for the applicant's arrest and detention."", ""28. In a letter dated 28 February 2003, the President of the Court of Appeal informed the MP that the applicant's case had been thoroughly considered and had been placed under the Vice-President of the Kraków Regional Court's administrative supervision. The President stated that the principal error committed by the District Court in respect of the applicant's detention order was the unfounded assumption that the applicant had been evading justice and maliciously failing to comply with the court summons in a case in which he had not been previously heard and in which he had not been notified of his obligations as an accused pursuant to Article 75 of the CCP, or served with a private bill of indictment (Article 139 § 2 of the CCP). The President further noted that the orders to remand the applicant in custody and to issue a wanted notice had been based on that erroneous premise. Lastly, he stated that the lessons to be drawn from the applicant's case would be used for training purposes."", ""29. On 21 March 2003 the MP transmitted a copy of the President of the Court of Appeal's reply to the applicant's wife. He advised the applicant and his wife that they could seek to institute disciplinary proceedings against the judge who had issued the detention order and criminal proceedings for abuse of power. He further advised them that they could seek compensation in the civil courts."", '30. On 5 October 2004 the Kraków–Śródmieście District Court delivered judgment and acquitted the applicant. On 10 January 2005 the Kraków Regional Court upheld the first-instance judgment.', 'Article 244 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1997, which entered into force on 1 September 1998, stipulates that everyone who is arrested shall be immediately informed of the reasons for his arrest and of his rights.', 'Article 246 provides that everyone who is arrested shall be entitled to lodge an appeal with a court challenging the lawfulness of the arrest and the manner of its execution. Such appeals must be promptly transmitted to the competent District Court which is required to examine it speedily. In cases where the District Court has established that the arrest was unlawful or unwarranted, it must order the immediate release of the person concerned.', 'The Code of Criminal Procedure defines detention on remand as one of the so-called “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze). The other measures are bail (poręczenie majątkowe), police supervision (dozór policji), a guarantee by a responsible person (poręczenie osoby godnej zaufania), a guarantee by a social entity (poręczenie społeczne), a temporary ban on engaging in a given activity (zawieszenie oskarżonego w określonej działalności) and a ban on leaving the country (zakaz opuszczania kraju).', 'Article 249 § 1 sets out the general grounds for the imposition of preventive measures:', ""“1. Preventive measures may be imposed in order to ensure the proper conduct of proceedings and, exceptionally, to prevent an accused's committing another serious offence; they may be imposed only if the evidence shows a significant probability that the accused has committed an offence.”"", 'Article 258 lists the grounds for detention on remand.

If an accused has been charged with a serious offence or an offence for the commission of which he may be liable to a statutory maximum sentence of at least 8 years' imprisonment, or if a court of first instance has sentenced him to at least 3 years' imprisonment, the need to continue detention to ensure the proper conduct of proceedings may be established by the likelihood that a severe penalty will be imposed.”"", ""The Code sets out the extent of the courts' discretion to continue a specific preventive measure. Article 257 reads, in so far as relevant:"", '“1. Detention on remand shall not be imposed if another preventive measure is sufficient.”', 'Article 259 § 1 reads:', '“1. If there are no special reasons to the contrary, detention on remand shall be lifted, in particular, if depriving an accused of his liberty would:', '(1) seriously jeopardise his life or health; or', '(2) entail excessively harsh consequences for the accused or his family.”', 'Article 259 § 3 provides:', '“Detention on remand shall not be imposed if an offence attracts a penalty of imprisonment not exceeding one year.”', 'Article 259 § 4 specifies that the rule provided for in Article 259 § 3 is not applicable when the accused attempts to evade justice or persistently fails to comply with summonses or when his identity cannot be established.', 'As worded at the relevant time, Article 75 of the CCP provided that an accused who was not deprived of his liberty was required to appear whenever he received a summons in the course of criminal proceedings. He was also required to inform the authority conducting the proceedings of any change of his abode or of any absence lasting longer than 7 days. The accused was to be informed of these obligations when first questioned.', 'Chapter 58 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, entitled “Compensation for wrongful conviction, detention on remand or arrest”, stipulates that the State is liable for wrongful convictions or for unjustifiably depriving an individual of his liberty in the course of criminal proceedings against him.', 'Article 552 provides, in so far as relevant:', '“1.

The Authority found that the applicant had exceeded a speed limit of 50 km/h by more than 40 km/h.', 'On 3 January 1996 the applicant, represented by counsel, filed an objection (Vorstellung) to this decision, arguing that he had not appealed against the penal order because he had not known that exceeding the speed limit by more than 40 km/h automatically entailed the withdrawal of his licence.', 'On 17 January 1996 the Innsbruck Federal Police Authority, in ordinary administrative proceedings, ordered the withdrawal of the applicant’s driving licence for two weeks, referring to the reasons given in the summary order of 13 December 1995.', 'On 14 May 1996 the Tyrol Government Office (Amt der Landeseregierung), upon the applicant’s appeal, confirmed this decision. The Office found that, under the Motor Vehicles Act, a conviction for exceeding the speed limit by more than 40 km/h necessarily entailed the withdrawal of the driving licence for at least two weeks.', 'On 5 July 1996 the applicant filed a complaint against this decision with the Constitutional Court. He argued, inter alia, that the withdrawal of his driving licence amounted to a breach of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 since the', 'conviction in the administrative criminal proceedings and the decision to withdraw the driving licence both had the same factual basis (das gleiche Verhalten).', 'On 24 September 1996 the Constitutional Court refused to deal with the complaint and transferred it to the Administrative Court. On 28 November 1996 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint as being unfounded.', 'According to Section 66 § 2 (i) of the Motor Vehicles Act (Kraftfahrgesetz), a person is not to be regarded as reliable in traffic (verkehrszuverlässig) if he or she has exceeded a speed limit within an urban area (Ortsgebiet) by more than 40 km/h. Section 73 § 3 of the Motor Vehicles Act, inter alia, provides for the withdrawal of the driving licence for a period of two weeks if its owner has been finally convicted for having exceeded the speed limit in an urban area by more than 40 km/h, or longer if the traffic offence has been committed in particularly dangerous circumstances or the offender has shown a particular degree of recklessness vis-à-vis other road users.']",[],[],[],[],[],[]

001-57608,ENG,GBR,CHAMBER,1981,"CASE OF YOUNG, JAMES AND WEBSTER v. THE UNITED KINGDOM",2,Violation of Art. 11;No separate issue under Art. 9 and 10;No violation of Art. 13;Just satisfaction reserved,C. Russo,"['12. Mr. Young, Mr. James and Mr. Webster are former employees of the British Railways Board (""British Rail""). In 1975, a ""closed shop"" agreement was concluded between British Rail and three trade unions, providing that thenceforth membership of one of those unions was a condition of employment. The applicants failed to satisfy this condition and were dismissed in 1976. They alleged that the treatment to which they had been subjected gave rise to violations of Articles 9, 10, 11 and 13 (art. 9, art. 10, art. 11, art. 13) of the Convention.', 'In general', '13. In essence, a closed shop is an undertaking or workplace in which, as a result of an agreement or arrangement between one or more trade unions and one or more employers or employers’ associations, employees of a certain class are in practice required to be or become members of a specified union. The employer is not under any legal obligation to consult or obtain the consent of individual employees directly before such an agreement or arrangement is put into effect. Closed shop agreements and arrangements vary considerably in both their form and their content; one distinction that is often drawn is that between the ""pre-entry"" shop (the employee must join the union before engaged) and the ""post-entry"" shop (he must join within a reasonable time after being engaged), the latter being more common.', 'In the United Kingdom, the institution of the closed shop is of very long standing. In recent years, closed shop arrangements have become more formalised and the number of employees covered thereby has increased (3.75 million in the 1960’s and 5 million in 1980, approximately). Recent surveys suggest that in many cases the obligation to join a specified union does not extend to existing non-union employees.', 'The law in force until 1971', '14. There was no legislation explicitly directed to the practice of the closed shop until 1971. Nevertheless, the courts had since the 1920’s recognised the legitimacy of the trade union object of advancing the union’s interests even to the point of enforcing the dismissal, or a ban on the hiring, of non-union employees. However, it was an unlawful conspiracy at common law to pursue a closed shop against individuals beyond the point which the courts regarded as the defence of genuine trade union interests (Huntley v. Thornton [1957] 1 All England Law Reports 234; Morgan v. Fry [1967] 2 All England Law Reports 386).', 'The Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers’ Associations, which reported in 1968, whilst rejecting the possibility of prohibiting the closed shop, considered the question of safeguards for individuals in a closed shop situation. In particular, a majority of that Commission took the view that an existing employee who was dismissed for refusal to join a union following the introduction of a closed shop should be able to succeed against his employer in a complaint of unfair dismissal so long as he could show that he had reasonable grounds for that refusal.', '15. Prior to 1971, the rights and liabilities of the parties to a contract of employment were for the most part governed by common law. Leaving aside cases of justified summary dismissal, it was lawful to dismiss an employee, even without cause, provided that he was given due notice. The remedy open to an employee dismissed without due notice was merely to sue for the balance of wages he would have earned during the appropriate notice period; the courts would not order his employer to re-engage him. These principles applied, for example, to dismissals motivated by an employee’s joining, or refusing to join, a trade union.', 'The Industrial Relations Act 1971', '16. Since 1971, there has been increased Parliamentary intervention in the areas under consideration, and changes of Government have led to changes in the scope and content of the legislation in force. The first major enactment was the Industrial Relations Act 1971 which radically altered the common law position in two respects.', '17. In the first place, the 1971 Act conferred on employees (with certain exceptions) the right not to be unfairly dismissed. Dismissal of an employee without cause became unlawful, even if he had been given due notice. An individual who considered that he had been unfairly dismissed could present a complaint to an industrial tribunal; unless the dismissal had been motivated by one or more reasons specified in the Act (for example, qualifications, conduct, redundancy) or some other substantial reason and unless the employer was found to have acted reasonably in treating that or those reasons as a sufficient reason for dismissal, the tribunal could award compensation to the employee or recommend that he be re-engaged. The employee’s common law rights were unaffected by the Act, although after 1971 little reliance was placed on them in practice by those entitled to the new right.', '18. In the second place, the 1971 Act introduced specific provisions which were designed to make the operation of the majority of closed shops unlawful. In addition to stipulating that pre-entry closed shop agreements were void, the Act, subject to certain exceptions, gave every worker the right to be a member of no trade union or to refuse to be a member of any particular union. In the context of the rules on unfair dismissal and in contrast to the position at common law (see paragraph 15 in fine above), the Act laid down that dismissal motivated by the employee’s exercise of, or intention to exercise, that right was be to regarded as unfair.', '19. A Green Paper on Trade Union Immunities, published by the British Government in January 1981, states that the 1971 Act ""met considerable resistance from trade unions and in practice its closed shop provisions were circumvented by many employers and unions. The closed shop continued much as before"".', 'The law in force at the time of the events giving rise to the applicants’ complaints', '20. The industrial Relations Act 1971 was repealed by the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 (""TULRA""). The provisions of TULRA relevant to the present case came into force on 16 September 1974.', '21. The repeal of the Industrial Relations Act 1971 removed from the statute book both the prohibition on closed shops and the employee’s right not to belong to a union. However, the law did not fully return to its pre-1971 condition. This was because TULRA maintained the protection against unfair dismissal; since one result of a closed shop is that an individual who declines to join a specified union may have his employment terminated, it was necessary to spell out the precise conditions in which dismissal for this reason was to be regarded as fair. Accordingly, TULRA:', '(a) set out - by reference to the concept of ""union membership agreement"", which it defined - the circumstances in which a closed shop situation was to be regarded as existing;', '(b) laid down the basic rule that, if such a situation existed, the dismissal of an employee for refusal to join a specified union was to be regarded as fair for the purposes of the law on unfair dismissal;', '(c) provided that, by way of exceptions, such a dismissal was to be regarded as unfair if the employee genuinely objected', '(i) on grounds of religious belief to being a member of any union whatsoever; or', '(ii) on any reasonable grounds to being a member of a particular union.', '22. The powers of an industrial tribunal under the 1971 Act to award compensation to an unfairly dismissed employee were also re-enacted by TULRA. However, the power to recommend his re-engagement was later replaced, by the Employment Protection Act 1975, by a discretionary power to order reinstatement or re-engagement in certain circumstances (notably, where this was considered ""practicable""). It was provided that, if the order were not complied with, the employee should be awarded the normal compensation for unfair dismissal and, in specified cases, an additional sum.', '23. TULRA was modified in various respects by the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Amendment) Act 1976 (""the Amendment Act"") which came into force on 25 March 1976. In particular, the second of the exceptions mentioned in paragraph 21 (c) above was abolished, so that the action for unfair dismissal remained available only to genuine religious objectors. With the object of achieving greater flexibility, the Amendment Act also modified the concept of ""union membership agreement"".', 'Subsequent legislative developments', '24. The Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 repealed and re-enacted the then existing provisions concerning unfair dismissal.', 'The 1978 Act was in turn amended, without retroactive effect, by the Employment Act 1980. It remains the basic rule that the dismissal of an employee for refusal to join a specified union in a closed shop situation is to be regarded as fair for the purposes of the law on unfair dismissal. However, with effect from 15 August 1980, this rule became subject to three exceptions whereby such dismissal is to be regarded as unfair if:', '(a) the employee objects on grounds of conscience or other deeply-held personal conviction to being a member of any or a particular union; or', '(b) the employee belonged, before the closed shop agreement or arrangement came into effect, to the class of employees covered thereby and has not been a member of a union in accordance therewith; or', '(c) in the case of a closed shop agreement or arrangement taking effect after 15 August 1980, either it has not been approved by the vote in a ballot of not less than 80% of the employees affected or, although it is so approved, the employee has not since the balloting been a member of a union in accordance therewith.', 'A Code of Practice, issued with the authority of Parliament and coming into effect on 17 December 1980, recommended, inter alia, that closed shop agreements should protect basic individual rights and be applied flexibly and tolerantly and with due regard to the interests of individuals as well as unions and employers. The Code is admissible in evidence, but imposes no legal obligations.', '25. The green Paper on Trade Union Immunities (see paragraph 19 above) rehearsed arguments for and against various proposals and indicated that the Government would welcome views on whether further changes in legislation affecting the closed shop were desirable and would be likely to prove effective.', '26. Since 1971, there has been statutory protection of the right to belong to a trade union. The exact content of the provisions has varied over the years, but their essence is that an employee is entitled to compensation if he is dismissed or penalised for, or deterred or prevented from, being or seeking to become a member or taking part in the activities of a trade union (Industrial Relations Act 1971, section 5; TULRA, Schedule 1, paragraph 6 (4); Employment Protection Act 1975, section 53; Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978, sections 23 and 58).', '27. At the end of 1979, there were 477 trade unions in the United Kingdom, with 13.5 million members; in 1980, 108 unions with 12.1 million members, were affiliated to the Trades Union Congress.', 'The Congress adopted in 1939 a series of morally binding recommendations (""the Bridlington Principles"") designed to minimise, and laying down procedures for dealing with, disputes between affiliated unions over membership questions. The current version of the Principles states, inter alia, that dual membership is valid only if the two unions concerned have jointly agreed to it.', '28. The Trade Union Act 1913, as amended, attaches certain conditions to the application by a union of its funds for a number of political objects specified in section 3 (3), without prejudice to the furtherance of any other political objects. In particular, payments for the specified object must be made out of a separate ""political fund"" and any member of the union has the right to exemption from contributing thereto. A person so exempted may not be placed at any disadvantage as compared with other members, and contribution to the said fund may not be made a condition for admission to the union.', '29. In 1970, British Rail had concluded a closed shop agreement with the National Union of Railwaymen (""NUR""), the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association (""TSSA"") and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (""ASLEF""), but, with the enactment of the Industrial Relations Act 1971 (see paragraph 18 above), it was not put into effect.', 'The matter was, however, revived in July 1975 when British Rail concluded a further agreement with the same unions. It was provided that as from 1 August 1975 membership of one of those unions was to be a condition of employment for certain categories of staff - including the applicants - and that the terms of the agreement were ""incorporated in and form[ed] part of"" each contract of employment. Like other staff of British Rail, Mr. Young, Mr James and Mr. Webster had, it appears, been supplied when engaged with a written statement containing a provision to the effect that they were subject to such terms and conditions of employment as might from time to time be settled for employees of their category under the machinery of negotiation established between their employer and any trade union or other organisation.', 'The membership requirement did not apply to ""an existing employee who genuinely objects on grounds of religious belief to being a member of any Trade Union whatsoever or on any reasonable grounds to being a member of a particular Trade Union"". The agreement also set out the procedure for applying for exemption on these grounds and provided for applications to be heard by representatives of the employer and the unions.', '30. In July/August 1975, notices were posted at the premises of British Rail, including those where the applicants were then working, drawing the attention of staff to the agreement with the unions and the change in conditions of employment.', 'A further notice of September 1975 stated that it had been agreed that the exemption on religious grounds would be available only where a denomination specifically proscribed its members from joining unions. The notice added that ""confining exemption only to religious grounds depends upon the passing through Parliament of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Amendment) Bill"" and that staff would be advised further on this point. As recorded in paragraph 23 above, the Amendment Act came into force on 25 March 1976.', 'On the same date, a further agreement between British Rail and the railway unions came into effect. It was in identical terms to the July 1975 agreement, except that the words ""or on any reasonable grounds to being a member of a particular Trade Union"" (see paragraph 29 above) were omitted.', '31. The applicants and the representative of the Trades Union Congress informed the Court that NUR, TSSA and ASLEF were the only unions actually operating in 1975 in those sectors of the railway industry in which Mr. Young, Mr. James and Mr. Webster worked. According to the Government, other unions did have members in, although they were not recruiting amongst, the relevant grades.', 'It appears that, prior to the conclusion of the 1975 closed shop agreement, between 6,000 and 8,000 British Rail employees, out of a total staff of 250,000, were not already members of one of the specified unions. In the final event, 54 individuals were dismissed for refusal to comply with the membership requirement.', '32. The applicants were not eligible for membership of ASLEF. As regards NUR and TSSA, intending members were required to sign an application form which, at the relevant time, embodied an undertaking to abide by the Rules of the union and ""loyally to promote"" its objects (NUR), or to use their ""best endeavours to promote its objects and interests"" (TSSA).', 'The stated objects of NUR included the following:', '""... to secure the complete organisation of all workers employed by any Board, Company or Authority in connection with railways and other transport and ancillary undertakings thereto in the United Kingdom; to improve the conditions and protect the interests of its members; ... To further, if and when and so far as the same shall be or become a lawful object of a Trade Union, the interests of members by representation in Parliament and on local governing bodies, and to employ the Political Fund of the Union procuring such representation. To work for the suppression of the capitalist system by a Socialistic order of society. ... To make grants to and share in the management and control of any college or institution having for its object to educate and train Trade Unionists in social science in, and to take part in, the political and industrial life of the Labour Movement. ...""', 'The stated objects of TSSA included the following:', '""(a) To organise the whole of the Clerical, Supervisory, Administrative, Professional and Technical employees in all Departments of any British or Irish Railway undertaking, or of any Railway Carting Agency, associated or other undertaking as defined in Rule 2.', '(b) To improve the conditions and protect the interests of its members.', '...', '(g) To establish a Fund, or Funds, including the Political Fund referred to in Rules 45 and 46.', '...', '(i) To secure or assist in securing legislation and the more effective administration of the existing laws which may affect the general and material welfare of its members and of any other workmen.', '(j) To provide financial assistance and to lend money, with or without interest or other equivalent, to any such organisation (incorporated or not incorporated) as the Executive Committee may deem advisable in the interests of or for carrying out the objects of the Association, and so far as the law for the time being in force may permit.', '...""', 'The objects of both unions also included the furtherance of the political objects specified in section 3 of the Trade Union Act 1913 and their Rules contained provisions reflecting that Act’s requirements in the matter of a political fund (see paragraph 28 above). In the case of TSSA, payments from its political fund could not be made unless the beneficiary was an individual member of the Labour Party or the purpose of the payment was in support of Labour Party policy; its general funds could be used for providing financial assistance for political purposes other than the ""political objects"" listed in the 1913 Act.', '33. Mr. Young, who was born in 1953, commenced employment with British Rail in 1972.', '34. In September 1975, he had a meeting with his supervisor and a representative of TSSA who informed him about the closed shop agreement - the effect of which in his case was that, as a clerical officer, he was required to join either TSSA or NUR - and of the grounds of exemption applicable at that time (see paragraph 29 above).', 'The applicant objected, though not on grounds of religious belief, to being a member of any trade union and in particular of TSSA or NUR. He believed that union membership should be a matter of personal choice based on conscience and political conviction. His reasons for not wanting to join TSSA, which he said also applied to NUR, may be summarised as follows:', '(a) he did not subscribe to the political views of TSSA;', '(b) money from the main union fund was used to produce a monthly newspaper biased in favour of the Labour Party and he had not received sufficient assurances that that fund was not utilised for other political purposes;', '(c) he disapproved of TSSA’s support for nationalisation of industry and its forcing of inflationary pay awards; he also objected to being obliged to participate in strikes, this being action which in the case of a key service industry he saw as collective blackmail of the country as a whole;', '(d) TSSA showed itself intolerant of the expression of individual freedom by seeking to enforce a closed shop and it acquired by that means an unacceptably extensive control over the hiring and firing of employees.', '35. On 17 October 1975, Mr. Young submitted a written claim for exemption. On 30 April 1976, that is after the entry into force on 25 March 1976 of the Amendment Act (see paragraph 23 above), he was informed by letter that his claim would be heard on 5 May. On that day, he appeared before an appeal body composed of three persons representing, respectively, British Rail, TSSA and NUR.', 'By letter of 27 May, British Rail advised the applicant that the claim had been disallowed and gave him notice of dismissal - of one month, in accordance with his contract - expiring on 26 June 1976.', '36. Mr. James, who was born in 1928, was engaged by British Rail on 27 March 1974 as a leading railwayman. He had previously been employed by British Rail for two periods of some years.', '37. In 16 October 1975, he had a meeting with his immediate superior and a representative of NUR who informed him that, as a result of the closed shop agreement, he was required to join NUR and that, as a shunter, he was not eligible for membership of any other union. Mr. James was willing to join - in fact, he had previously been a member of NUR - but he was not convinced that membership was advantageous and he believed in freedom of choice. He deferred his final decision pending clarification of a question, submitted by one of his colleagues to NUR, regarding an apparent difference between his salary and that of his colleague who was working the same hours. Before applying for membership, Mr. James wished to see NUR’s reply in order to assess how members’ problems were dealt with. In the event, he formed the view that the union’s examination of the matter and explanation of its conclusions were unsatisfactory and that it had not looked after its member’s interests properly; therefore he did not wish to join the union.', '38. By letter of 18 December 1975, the applicant indicated that he refused to join the union since it had not replied to his own query about his hours of work.', 'On 23 February 1976, he received a dismissal notice stating that, by reason of his non-compliance with the July 1975 agreement, his services would no longer be required as from 5 April 1976.', '39. On 8 April 1976, Mr. James presented a complaint of unfair dismissal to an industrial tribunal, before which he appeared on 18, June. On 6 July, he received a copy of its decision rejecting his complaint. The grounds were, firstly, that the applicant had never sought exemption from union membership in accordance with the procedure laid down in the closed shop agreement and, secondly, that as he had at no time based his refusal to join NUR on religious grounds, the tribunal was bound under paragraph 6 (5) of Schedule 1 to TULRA (as modified by the Amendment Act) to find that the dismissal was fair.', '40. Mr. Webster, who was born in 1914, commenced employment with British Rail on 18 March 1958.', '41. At the time of the conclusion of the 1970 closed shop agreement (see paragraph 29 above), the applicant had objected to joining a union on grounds which he set out in a letter to the Administrative Services Officer. However, as that agreement was not put into effect, he was not called upon to appear before the appeal body to which he had agreed to submit his claim.', '42. In or around September 1975, the applicant had a meeting with his immediate supervisor and the local representative of TSSA who informed him about the closed shop agreement - the effect of which in his case was that, as a clerical officer, he was required to join either TSSA or NUR - and of the grounds of exemption applicable at that time (see paragraph 29 above).', '43. Mr. Webster was opposed to joining a union for reasons - in his eyes equally valid for TSSA and NUR - which included the following:', '(a) he was opposed to the trade union movement as it currently operated since it was unrepresentative, had detrimental effects - particularly through unjustified collective wage demands - in the economic, industrial and social spheres, and did not act in the best interests of workers or of the country in general; he also found it utterly repugnant to be obliged to participate in any strike which caused loss to the general public or workers elsewhere;', '(b) he believed that the individual should enjoy freedom of choice as regards union membership and should be able to express and abide by his opinions and convictions without being threatened with the loss of his livelihood as a result of the closed shop practice, which practice would not remedy the disabilities inherent in the trade union system.', '44. On 29 October 1975, Mr. Webster wrote to his supervisor explaining some doubts which he had as to the courses open to him to claim exemption and seeking guidance on certain aspects. He said that he wished to apply for exemption on conscientious grounds (other than specifically religious grounds) and he asked that, if this was still possible, his 1970 submissions be accepted as his case, though he also indicated that he would again wish to present a full and closely argued case. He added that he was an opponent of the trade union movement ""as it operates today"". On 2 April 1976, that is after the entry into force on 25 March 1976 of the Amendment Act (see paragraph 23 above), he was advised by letter that his application would be examined four days later by representatives of British Rail and the unions in accordance with the procedure prescribed in the 1975 agreement. The applicant requested two weeks’ postponement to enable him to prepare written submissions. On 28 April, by which time he had received replies, through his solicitors, to only some of the questions posed in his October letter, he was instructed to attend a hearing on 6 May. On that day, he appeared before an appeal body composed of three persons representing, respectively, British Rail, TSSA and NUR.', 'On 3 June 1976, Mr. Webster received a dismissal notice stating that his application had been disallowed and that his contract of employment would terminate on 28 August 1976.']",['11'],[],[],['13'],[],[]

The applicant was born in 1942 and lives in Lahti, Finland.', '7. On 18 June 1999 the Krasnoselskiy District Court of St Petersburg (“the District Court”) found that unlawful actions of police officers in 1993 had resulted in harm to the applicant’s health manifesting itself in partial loss of ability to work. This judgment and a supplementary judgment of 11 October 1999 recovered from the State treasury in the applicant’s favour lost earnings up to 1 February 2000 in the amount of 109,751 Russian roubles (RUB) and compensation of non-pecuniary damage in the amount of RUB 10,000. It appears from the applicant’s own submissions that the award was paid to him in 1999.', '8. On an unspecified date the applicant brought a new action seeking recovery of lost earnings for the period from 1 February 2000 to 1 March 2005 and further monthly payments to be re-calculated in accordance with the minimum wage, reimbursement of expert fees and compensation for sanatorium treatment.', '9. By a judgment of 3 March 2005 the District Court granted his claims in part, however the judgment was reversed on appeal on 18 April 2005, and the case was remitted to the first instance for fresh examination.', '10.

The applicant was born in 1960.', '6. Between 1989 and 1994 the applicant worked on fixed-term contracts as a nurse in the polyclinic for eye diseases in a public hospital. From 1987 she paid regular visits to the polyclinic for infectious diseases of the same hospital, having been diagnosed as HIV-positive.', '7. Early in 1992 the applicant began to suspect that her colleagues were aware of her illness. At that time hospital staff had free access to the patient register which contained information on patients’ diagnoses and treating doctors. Having confided her suspicions to her doctor in summer 1992, the hospital’s register was amended so that henceforth only the treating clinic’s personnel had access to its patients’ records. The applicant was registered in the patient register under a false name. Apparently later her identity was changed once again and she was given a new social security number.', '8. In 1995 the applicant changed her job as her temporary contract was not renewed.', '9. On 25 November 1996, the applicant complained to the County Administrative Board (lääninhallitus, länsstyrelsen), requesting it to examine who had accessed her confidential patient record. Upon request, the director in charge of the hospital’s archives filed a statement with the County Administrative Board, according to which it was not possible to find out who, if anyone, had accessed the applicant’s patient record as the data system revealed only the five most recent consultations (by working unit and not by person) and even this information was deleted once the file was returned to the archives.', '10. In its decision of 20 October 1997 the County Administrative Board held that:', '“Section 12 of the Patient’s Status and Rights Act (laki potilaan asemasta ja oikeuksista, lag om patientens ställning och rättigheter) provides that the health authorities and staff have to comply with the regulations issued by the Ministry for Social Affairs and Health (sosiaali- ja terveysministeriö, social- och hälsovårdsministeriet, “the Ministry”) when preparing and processing patient records. Pursuant to this section the Ministry has issued, on 25 February 1993, Regulation no. 16/02/93.', 'In the said Regulation it is noted that patients records must be prepared having due regard to the secrecy regulations and the protection obligation and the duty to take care pursuant to the Personal Files Act (henkilörekisterilaki, personregisterlagen; Act no. 471/1987). According to the duty to take care, precaution and good registering practices must be observed when gathering, depositing, using and delivering data and these must be done in a manner so as not to infringe unnecessarily the right to privacy of the registered person or his or her benefits and rights. The protection obligation means that data in patient records must be duly protected against unauthorised processing, use, destruction, amendment and theft (sections 3 and 26 of the Personal Files Act).', 'In the said Regulation it is also noted that the patient records must form an entity to ensure that outsiders cannot gain unauthorised access to them and that, in addition to the said obligations, in accordance with the Personal Files Act, the purpose of use of the said data can be taken into account. This way it can be made sure that requisite patient data are only given to the personnel participating in the treatment of the patient.', '[The applicant] has in her representations alleged that [X], who is working for [the hospital] has ordered up the case history of [the applicant’s ex-husband] and that someone else has ordered up her file or visited the archives and read her file and/or that of [her son] and that the data have been transmitted to [Y] and other staff mentioned in [the applicant’s] representations.', '[X] has contested having proceeded erroneously. The other persons mentioned in [the applicant’s] representations have contested having had knowledge of the data mentioned therein concerning [the applicant] and her family.', 'According to the director in charge of [the hospital’s] archives it is not possible to retroactively clarify the use of patient records. The data system reveals only the five most recent consultations (by working unit and not by person) but this information is deleted once the file has been returned to the archives.', 'Therefore, the County Administrative Board cannot further rule on whether information contained in the patient records has been used by or given to an outsider.', 'Having regard to the foregoing, the County Administrative Board however finds that the system should record any consultation of patient files as a safeguard of privacy in order to ensure that the responsibility for a possible leak of information can be individualised. For the future, the County Administrative Board draws the hospital’s attention to the protection obligation and the duty to take care provided by the Personal Files Act, and further, to the need to ensure that privacy protection is not put at risk when processing medical data within the hospital. ...”', '11. Subsequently, in March 1998, the hospital’s register was amended in that it became possible retrospectively to identify any person who had accessed a patient record.', '12. On 15 May 2000, the applicant instituted civil proceedings against the District Health Authority (sairaanhoitopiirin kuntayhtymä, samkommunen för sjukvårdsdistriktet), which was responsible for the hospital’s patient register, claiming non-pecuniary and pecuniary damage for the alleged failure to keep her patient record confidential.', '13. On 10 April 2001, the District Court (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten), having held an oral hearing, rejected the action. Having assessed the evidence before it, including five witness statements, the decision of the County Administrative Board and a statement of the Data Protection Ombudsman (tietosuojavaltuutettu, dataombudsmannen), the court did not find firm evidence that the applicant’s patient record had been unlawfully consulted.', '14. The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal (hovioikeus, hovrätten), maintaining her claim that the hospital had not complied with the domestic law, in breach of her right to respect for her private life.', '15. On 7 March 2002, the Court of Appeal, having held an oral hearing, considered that the applicant’s testimony about the events, such as her colleagues’ hints and remarks about her HIV infection, was reliable and credible. Like the District Court it did not, however, find firm evidence that her patient record had been unlawfully consulted. It ordered the applicant to reimburse the respondent’s legal expenses before the District Court and the Court of Appeal, amounting to 2,000 euros (EUR) and EUR 3,271.80 plus interest, respectively.', '16. In her application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court (korkein oikeus), the applicant claimed inter alia that there had been a violation of her right to respect for her private life.', '17. On 23 December 2002 the Supreme Court refused leave to appeal.', '18. The Finnish Constitution Act (Suomen hallitusmuoto, Regeringsform för Finland; Act no. 94/1919, as amended by Act no. 969/1995) was in force until 1 March 2000. Its section 8 corresponded to Article 10 of the current Finnish Constitution (Suomen perustuslaki, Finlands grundlag; Act no. 731/1999), which provides that everyone’s right to private life is guaranteed.', '19. Until 1 June 1999, the rules governing the use and confidentiality of personal data were laid down in the Personal Files Act of 1987. Sections 6 and 7 of the Act prohibited the processing of sensitive personal data, including information on a person’s health and medical treatment, except within the health authorities. Unauthorised disclosure of personal data was prohibited under section 18 and illegal use of disclosed data was prohibited under section 21. Pursuant to section 26 the data controller had to ensure that personal data and information contained therein were appropriately secured against any unlawful processing, use, destruction, amendment and theft. In this regard, the explanatory report of the Government Bill (no. 49/1986) for the enactment of the Personal Files Act stated that the mere existence of legal provisions did not suffice to guarantee the protection of privacy. In addition, the data controller had to make sure that data were protected de facto. When planning the physical protection of the data system regard must be had to, inter alia, whether the system was manual or automated. The delicate nature of the information naturally affected the scope of the protection obligation. Under section 42, the data controller was liable to compensate pecuniary damage suffered as a result of the use or disclosure of incorrect personal data or of unlawful use or disclosure of personal data.', '20. On 1 June 1999, a new Personal Data Act (henkilötietolaki, personuppgiftslag; Act no. 523/1999) entered into force. Section 11 of the Act prohibits processing of sensitive personal data. However, under section 12, health care professionals may process data relating to a person’s state of health, illness, handicap or treatment if they are indispensable in his/her treatment. Section 32 provides that the data controller shall carry out the technical and organisational measures necessary for securing personal data against unauthorised access, accidental or unlawful destruction, manipulation, disclosure and transfer as well as against other unlawful processing. Section 33 lays down a secrecy obligation for those who have gained knowledge of someone’s personal circumstances. Under section 47, the data controller is liable to compensate pecuniary and other damage suffered by the data subject or another person as a result of the processing of personal data in violation of the provisions of the Act.', '21. The Patient’s Status and Rights Act entered into force on 1 March 1993. Section 12, as in force until 1 August 2000, provided that the health authorities had to comply with the regulations issued by the Ministry for Social Affairs and Health (“the Ministry”) when creating and processing patients’ personal and medical data.', '22. According to the Ministry’s Regulation no. 16/02/93, issued on 25 February 1993, a patient’s privacy had to be secured when creating and processing his/her patient record. The data controller had to make sure that outsiders could not gain unauthorised access to sensitive personal data and that only the personnel treating a patient had access to his/her patient register.', '23. Section 13 of the Patient’s Status and Rights Act provided that health care professionals or other persons working in a health care unit were not allowed to reveal to an outsider (that is a person not participating in the treatment of the patient) information contained in the patient documents without the written consent of the patient. The said section has been amended as of 1 August 2000 (Act no. 653/2000) to the effect that it must be recorded in the data file if patient records have been revealed as well as the grounds for the disclosure.', '24. Further, the Health Care Professionals Act (laki terveydenhuollon ammattihenkilöistä, lag om yrkesutbildade personer inom hälso- och sjukvården; Act no. 559/1994) contains provisions on the retention of patient documents and their confidentiality (section 16) and on the obligation of secrecy (section 17).', '25. Finally, the new Electronic Processing of Client Information Act (laki sosiaali- ja terveydenhuollon asiakastietojen sähköisestä käsittelystä, lag om elektronisk behandling av klientuppgifter inom social- och hälsovården; Act no. 159/2007) entered into force on 1 July 2007.

Her ownership of the properties is attested by certificates of registration issued by the Cypriot Lands and Surveys Department at the moment of acquisition.', 'She states that she has been prevented in the past, and is still prevented, by Turkish forces from returning to Kyrenia and ""peacefully enjoying"" her property.', '13. On 19 March 1989 the applicant participated in a march organised by a women’s group (""Women Walk Home"" movement) in the village of Lymbia near the Turkish village of Akincilar in the occupied area of northern Cyprus. The aim of the march was to assert the right of Greek Cypriot refugees to return to their homes.', 'Leading a group of fifty marchers she advanced up a hill towards the Church of the Holy Cross in the Turkish-occupied part of Cyprus passing the United Nations’ guard post on the way. When they reached the churchyard they were surrounded by Turkish soldiers and prevented from moving any further.', '14. She was eventually detained by members of the Turkish Cypriot police force and brought by ambulance to Nicosia. She was released around midnight, having been detained for more than ten hours.', '15. In his report of 31 May 1989 (Security Council document S/20663) on the United Nations Operation in Cyprus (for the period 1 December 1988 - 31 May 1989) the Secretary-General of the United Nations described the demonstration of 19 March 1989 as follows (at paragraph 11):', '""In March 1989, considerable tension occurred over the well-publicized plans of a Greek Cypriot women’s group to organize a large demonstration with the announced intention of crossing the Turkish forces cease-fire line. In this connection it is relevant to recall that, following violent demonstrations in the United Nations buffer-zone in November 1988, the Government of Cyprus had given assurances that it would in future do whatever was necessary to ensure respect for the buffer-zone ... Accordingly, UNFICYP asked the Government to take effective action to prevent any demonstrators from entering the buffer-zone, bearing in mind that such entry would lead to a situation that might be difficult to control. The demonstration took place on 19 March 1989. An estimated 2,000 women crossed the buffer-zone at Lymbia and some managed to cross the Turkish forces’ line. A smaller group crossed that line at Akhna. At Lymbia, a large number of Turkish Cypriot women arrived shortly after the Greek Cypriots and mounted a counter demonstration, remaining however on their side of the line. Unarmed Turkish soldiers opposed the demonstrators and, thanks largely to the manner in which they and the Turkish Cypriot police dealt with the situation, the demonstration passed without serious incident. Altogether, 54 demonstrators were arrested by Turkish Cypriot police in the two locations; they were released to UNFICYP later the same day.""', '16. Turkish armed forces of more than 30,000 personnel are stationed throughout the whole of the occupied area of northern Cyprus, which is constantly patrolled and has checkpoints on all main lines of communication. The army’s headquarters are in Kyrenia. The 28th Infantry Division is based in Asha (Assia) with its sector covering Famagusta to the Mia Milia suburb of Nicosia and with about 14,500 personnel. The 39th Infantry Division, with about 15,500 personnel, is based at Myrtou village, and its sector ranges from Yerolakkos village to Lefka. TOURDYK (Turkish Forces in Cyprus under the Treaty of Guarantee) is stationed at Orta Keuy village near Nicosia, with a sector running from Nicosia International Airport to the Pedhieos River. A Turkish naval command and outpost are based at Famagusta and Kyrenia respectively. Turkish airforce personnel are based at Lefkoniko, Krini and other airfields. The Turkish airforce is stationed on the Turkish mainland at Adana.', '17. The Turkish forces and all civilians entering military areas are subject to Turkish military courts, as stipulated so far as concerns ""TRNC citizens"" by the Prohibited Military Areas Decree of 1979 (section 9) and Article 156 of the Constitution of the ""TRNC"".', '18. Article 159 (1) (b) of the 7 May 1985 Constitution of the ""Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus"" (the ""TRNC"") provides, where relevant, as follows:', '""All immovable properties, buildings and installations which were found abandoned on 13 February 1975 when the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus was proclaimed or which were considered by law as abandoned or ownerless after the above-mentioned date, or which should have been in the possession or control of the public even though their ownership had not yet been determined ... and ... situated within the boundaries of the TRNC on 15 November 1983, shall be the property of the TRNC notwithstanding the fact that they are not so registered in the books of the Land Registry Office; and the Land Registry Office shall be amended accordingly.""', '19.

The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in the town of Blagoveshchensk, Amur Region.', '5. On 30 November 1998 the Amur regional police stopped a car. During an inspection of the car, the police discovered a large quantity of aviation fuel. As the driver was unable to produce a certificate for the fuel he was transporting, the police (officer S) seized 22,622 litres of fuel. The police entrusted it for safe keeping to a Belogorsk technical college and later to military unit no. 62266.', '6. As the fuel allegedly belonged to a private company OPIUMIK (the “company”), officer S required the company director, Mr P, to produce a document confirming that the fuel had been acquired lawfully. Mr P submitted an invoice dated 1 August 1998. Criminal proceedings were, however, instituted against Mr P on suspicion of forgery of this invoice. The Belogorsk town prosecutor subsequently discontinued the proceedings on the ground that only the forgery of official documents was punishable under the Criminal Code. No decision was taken regarding the fate of the fuel.', '7. As can be seen from the domestic courts’ findings (see paragraph 15 below), in the meantime, officer S decided not to institute any criminal proceedings in relation to the seized fuel. However, on 2 February 1999 the Belogorsk deputy prosecutor set aside this decision and ordered an additional inquiry. There is no indication that this inquiry led to any prosecution or that any decision was taken in relation to the seized fuel.', '8. The company thus attempted to regain possession of its fuel. By a letter of 17 May 1999 the Belogorsk deputy prosecutor informed the company that the fuel had not been attached to the criminal case file against Mr P as evidence and thus no decision had to be taken. He invited Mr P to collect the fuel through the police department. On an unspecified date, however, the company learnt from the Amur police department that the fuel had been stolen when it had been stored in the military unit.', '9. Meanwhile, the national authorities endeavoured to identify the officials responsible for the loss of the fuel. Criminal proceedings were instituted against officer S for abuse of power, as well as against the commander of the military unit and officer St, who had allegedly misappropriated the fuel in the military unit. On 18 December 1999 the Belogorsk town military prosecutor discontinued the proceedings against officer St and the head of the military unit because there was no indication of a criminal offence. On 8 April 2000 the proceedings against officer S were discontinued because his participation in the disappearance of the fuel had not been proven.', '10. It does not appear that any criminal or other investigation continued thereafter in relation to the seized but missing fuel. No further claim was lodged in respect of it by the company or any other person or legal entity. Nor does it appear that the company made any attempts to obtain compensation after 17 May 1999 (cf. paragraph 8 above). Instead, the company chose to assign the related claims to the applicant (see below).', '11. On 26 October 2001 the company transferred title to the seized fuel to the applicant. On 25 November 2001 the parties amended the assignment agreement, indicating that the assignment included a claim in respect of any damage or loss caused by the authorities on account of the seizure of the fuel, as well as a claim for compensation in respect of unjustified enrichment on the same account and a claim for return of the fuel. The amended agreement also stated that the signing of that agreement “annulled the company’s debt of 50,000 Russian roubles under a contract dated 20 October 2000”.', '12. The company informed the regional police department of the transfer of title. Since 27 October 2001 the applicant has unsuccessfully requested the police department to return the fuel.', '13. In November 2001 the applicant sued the Amur Regional Treasury, claiming compensation for the damage incurred as a result of the seizure and loss of the fuel. The Commercial Court of the Amur Region designated the Ministry of the Interior as the proper respondent, with the applicant’s consent. The court also gave the regional police department, the military unit and the company leave to intervene as third parties in the proceedings.', '14. By judgment of 14 March 2002 the Commercial Court of the Amur Region dismissed the applicant’s action. The court held as follows:', '“Under an assignment agreement of 26 October 2001 the OPIUMIK company transferred all its rights to the fuel to [the applicant]...The assignment did not contravene Articles 158, 388 and 389 of the Civil Code... The fuel had been seized in relation to the accusation of forgery against Mr P...', '[T]he criminal prosecution against officer S was discontinued ...The fuel was misappropriated by officer St, against whom proceedings were discontinued on 18 December 1999...', '[T]he responsibility of an officer of the Ministry of the Interior for unlawful seizure of the company’s fuel must be established by a final judgment in a criminal case. The commercial court, under Article 22 of the Code of Arbitration Procedure, does not have the right to assess the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the actions (failure to act) of the investigating authorities and the prosecutor’s office.', 'The plaintiff did not submit any evidence showing that the seizure of the fuel by the officer of the Amur regional police department had been declared unlawful by a court and that [the officer] was responsible for the loss of the fuel.', 'The action must be dismissed because there was no fault on the part of the person who allegedly caused the damage.”', '15. The applicant appealed contending that the absence of a criminal conviction in respect of the officer had been irrelevant and that the respondent and the military unit had entered into a contract for storage of the fuel seized from the company. On 15 April 2002 the Appellate Division of the Commercial Court of the Amur Region upheld the judgment of 14 March 2002. The court stated inter alia as follows:', '“Officer S acted lawfully when he inspected and seized the fuel...Having verified whether the fuel had been lawfully acquired, officer S decided not to bring criminal proceedings; on 2 February 1999 the Belogorsk deputy prosecutor set aside this decision and ordered an additional inquiry...', 'Officer S’s failure to observe the procedure for inspection and transfer of the fuel for safe-keeping purposes has no direct causal link with the loss of the fuel...”', 'Lastly, the appeal court made the following observations in relation to the military unit:', '“Military unit no. 62266 received the seized fuel for storage ... in accordance with Article 84 § 2 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure. Under Article 906 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation the military unit became civilly liable vis-à-vis the plaintiff for the safe keeping of the fuel. Under Article 902 § 1 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, in the event of the loss of the fuel [the military unit] had to compensate the plaintiff for the resulting damage, unless otherwise provided by the law.”', 'The appeal judgment became final on the same date.', '16. On 11 June 2002 the Commercial Court of the Far Eastern Circuit, sitting as a cassation-instance court, upheld the judgments of 14 March and 15 April 2002. The court noted that the seizure of the fuel had been due to the absence, at the time, of any document confirming the company’s title to it. The court held that the plaintiff had not proved that the investigator had been responsible for the damage caused.', '17. In the meantime, on 29 April 2002 the applicant brought proceedings in the Blagoveshchensk Town Court of the Amur Region against, inter alia, the military unit. He claimed that the authorities’ failure to return the fuel or to pay compensation be declared unlawful.', '18. By a judgment of 12 November 2003 the Town Court rejected the applicant’s claim. The court held that the fuel seizure had been carried out by officer S before any criminal proceedings had been initiated because of the need to conduct urgent investigative measures, namely a crime-scene inspection, in compliance with the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 26 below). The Town Court also held as follows:', '“As established in the judgment of the commercial court, during the seizure of the fuel the OPIUMIK company had not supplied any document to confirm the lawfulness of its acquisition. Later Mr P submitted a forged invoice, which gave rise to criminal proceedings against him. An agreement dated 2 November 1998 between the OPIUMIK company and a Mr G for the purchase of 22,622 litres of fuel was produced before this court. It cannot be accepted as a proof of the lawfulness of the fuel acquisition because the content of that agreement does not correspond to the materials in the criminal case which had been discontinued. Nor does it correspond to Mr P’s deposition in the criminal proceedings, to the invoice or the expert report no. 141-k of 17 February 1999 which stated that the handwritten inscriptions in invoice no. 983 of 1 August 1998 had been done by Mr P. The Court rejects as unfounded Mr P’s allegation that the documents in the criminal file and his deposition had been obtained under duress. Besides, the Court considers that Mr P’s and [the applicant’s] arguments are intended to challenge the circumstances already determined by the final judgment of the commercial court, in particular as regards the lawfulness of the fuel acquisition by the company...The Court concludes that no evidence has been adduced to confirm [it]. The Court does not accept [the applicant’s] argument that the commercial court had confirmed the lawfulness of the fuel acquisition; such matter had not been contested before the commercial court...', 'The grounds for compensation in respect of damage caused by the investigating authorities, including a claim for restitution of the fuel, are regulated by Articles 1069 and 1070 of the Civil Code. Those grounds were also examined by the commercial courts and cannot be subject to a re-examination in the present case. No legal relationship (обязательственные отношения) was established between [the applicant] on the one hand and the military unit, the Ministry of Defence or the Ministry of the Interior on the other. Hence, his claims ... should be rejected.”', 'Lastly, the court found that the applicant had missed the statutory time-limit under Article 256 of the Code of Civil Procedure for bringing the matter before the courts of general jurisdiction.', '19. On 9 January 2004 the Amur Regional Court upheld the judgment. The court considered that the commercial court’s judgment of 14 March 2002 had dismissed the applicant’s claims, inter alia, due to his failure to produce evidence confirming the lawfulness of the fuel acquisition. Neither was the civil court provided with any proof that the company had had title to the fuel.', '20. A commercial court issued a private company with an enforcement order for a sum of money against a State-owned enterprise. The company did not submit the writ within the statutory time-limit and bailiffs refused to enforce the judgment. The company assigned the claim to the applicant, who then requested the commercial court to designate him as creditor in respect of the above judicial award and to restore the time-limit for lodging the enforcement order. In 2002 the commercial court rejected both requests. The applicant did not appeal.', '21. The applicant also requested a court of general jurisdiction to designate him as creditor in respect of the assigned award and to award him compensation for the damage sustained. On 26 February 2003 the Primorye Regional Court, at final instance, disallowed the first claim because it had already been determined on 24 October 2002 by the final decision of the commercial court. On 12 March 2003 the Regional Court, at final instance, dismissed the claim for damages on the ground that the applicant’s title had never been confirmed by a court.', '22. The Civil Code of the Russian Federation, in force from 1 January 1995, provided as follows:', '“Damage caused to an individual or a legal entity as a result of the unlawful actions (failure to act) of State agencies, agencies of local self-government or officials of these agencies, including as a result of the issuance of an act of a State agency or agency of local self-government which is contrary to a law or any other legal act, shall be subject to compensation. The damage shall be compensated for at the expense, respectively, of the Treasury of the Russian Federation, the treasury of the region of the Russian Federation, or the treasury of the municipal authority.”', '“1. Damage caused to an individual as a result of his or her wrongful conviction or unlawful criminal prosecution, or the unlawful application, as a preventive measure, of remand in custody or of a written undertaking not to leave a specified place, or the unlawful imposition of an administrative penalty in the form of arrest or corrective labour, shall be compensated for in full at the expense of the Treasury of the Russian Federation and in certain cases, stipulated by law, at the expense of the treasury of the subject of the Russian Federation or of the municipal authority, irrespective of any fault by the officials of the agencies of inquiry or preliminary investigation, prosecutor’s offices or courts, in accordance with the procedure established by law.', '2. Damage caused to an individual or a legal entity as a result of the unlawful activity of agencies of inquiry or preliminary investigation or prosecutor’s offices, which has not entailed the consequences specified in paragraph 1 of this Article, shall be compensated for on the grounds and according to the procedure provided for by Article 1069 of this Code...”', '23. Article 385 of the Code required the person or entity making an assignment to supply the new creditor with the documents certifying the assignor’s claims. On 30 October 2007 the Supreme Commercial Court of Russia issued an information note summarising the existing case-law on various aspects of the interpretation and application of the provisions of the Civil Code on the assignment of claims and liabilities. In particular, it noted that the invalidity or invalidation of the claim assigned did not imply the invalidity of the assignment agreement. At the same time, it noted that the former gave the assignee the right to sue the assignor under Article 390 of the Civil Code. Nor did the Civil Code prevent the assignment of a future claim or one that was still non-existent when an assignment agreement was signed. The Supreme Court also noted that the assignor’s failure to provide the assignee with documents certifying the former’s entitlement or claim did not mean that the entitlement or claim had not been conferred on the assignee.', '24. Under the Civil Code, an obligation to keep or store items arises under a contract (Article 886) or if provided for by law (Article 906).', '25. The RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure of 1961, in force at the material time, provided as follows:', '“... Material exhibits must be stored in a criminal case. If items of evidence, owing to their size or for any other reason, cannot be stored in the criminal case file, their picture must be taken; if possible, [they] must be sealed and stored in a place specified by the investigator, prosecutor, court...”', '“Material exhibits shall be stored until the trial judgment becomes final or until expiry of the time-limit for lodging an appeal against a decision by which proceedings are discontinued...', 'Material exhibits which can be damaged easily and whose return to their owner is impossible should be given to appropriate entities for use in accordance with [the exhibits’] purpose. If necessary, items of the same type and quality shall be returned to the owner as compensation, or the owner shall be paid a sum equivalent to their value.”', '26. Article 178 of the Code provides that an investigator may inspect the crime scene or other locations, premises or items for the purpose of detecting physical evidence of the crime or clarifying the circumstances. In urgent situations, the inspection may be carried out before criminal proceedings are instituted. In such situations, the proceedings should be instituted immediately after the inspection.']",[],[],[],[],[],[]

The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Lviv.', '6. On 17 August 2010 the applicant notified the Lviv City Mayor on behalf of a local human-rights NGO, “Vartovi zakonu”, of its intention to hold a demonstration every Tuesday from 10.30 a.m. to 1 p.m. near the building of the Lviv Regional Prosecutor’s Office during the period between 17 August 2010 and 1 January 2011. The aim of the demonstration was to draw attention to the issue of corruption in the prosecution service. The number of possible participants was declared as up to fifty persons. There is no information as to whether any such demonstration was held prior to 12 October 2010 (see below).', '7. On 5 October 2010 the Executive Committee of the Lviv City Council lodged a claim with the Lviv Administrative Court seeking to restrict the demonstration announced by the applicant. On 6 October 2010 the court left the above claim without consideration as being submitted too late. The Executive Committee resubmitted its claim on 11 October with a request for renewal of the time-limit for lodging the claim. The same day the court allowed the request and accepted the claim for examination.', '8. On Tuesday 12 October 2010, further to his previous announcement of 17 August 2010, the applicant informed the City Council about the demonstration to be held on that particular day. He thus organised a peaceful demonstration near the Lviv Regional Prosecutor’s Office later that day between 11.30 a.m. and 12.40 a.m. About twenty-five persons took part. They were standing on the pavement in front of the building of the Prosecutor’s Office when the police told them that they should remain at a distance of five metres from the building. That would have forced the demonstrators to stand in the road and obstruct the traffic. After some discussion with the police, they crossed the road and stood on a lawn on the opposite side. The police, however, told the demonstrators that they could not stand on the lawn and should move away, which meant standing in the road again and obstructing the traffic, causing temporary traffic-jams.', '9. Immediately afterwards, the applicant was called aside by two police officers. They grabbed his arms and took him in the direction of the nearby police station. Some of the demonstrators requested the officers to show them their identification and started filming the incident; the officers then let the applicant go.', '10. On 13 October 2010 the Lviv Regional Administrative Court granted a request by the Executive Committee of the Lviv City Council to prohibit the holding of the pre-announced demonstrations by the applicant’s NGO as from 19 October 2010. The decision was appealed against.', '11. According to the applicant, on the same day he was invited to the police station on the pretext that he had failed to appear at a court hearing to which he had been summoned. Upon his arrival at the Galytskyy District Police Station at about 5 p.m., the police accused the applicant of having committed the administrative offences of malicious disobedience to a lawful order by the police and of breaching the procedure for organising and holding a demonstration on 12 October. Between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. the police drew up reports on those administrative offences. The applicant telephoned his lawyer, but the latter was not allowed onto the premises of the police station. At 11 p.m. the applicant was placed in a cell, where he remained without food until 3 p.m. on the next day, 14 October 2010.', '12. On 14 October 2010, before taking him to the court, the police drew up anew the reports on the administrative offences of malicious disobedience to a lawful order by the police and of breaching the procedure for organising and holding a demonstration. In their reports they referred to provisions of the Code on Administrative Offences and to the procedure for organising and holding meetings, rallies, street marches and demonstrations in the city of Lviv (see paragraphs 21 and 28 to 30 below). The reports were signed by the applicant.', '13. At 3 p.m. the applicant was taken to the Galytskyy District Court. He had no opportunity to study the case-file materials before the court hearing. During the hearing, the court rejected the applicant’s request to be represented by the lawyer of his choosing on the ground that the applicant was a human-rights defender and could defend himself. The applicant’s request to summon and question witnesses and examine a video made during the events of 12 October 2010 was also rejected by the court.', '14. By a decision of the same day, the court found the applicant guilty of committing the administrative offences of malicious disobedience to a lawful order by the police, and of breaching the procedure for organising and holding a demonstration. The court noted that the applicant had held a street march without the permission of the Lviv City Council and had ignored the lawful demands of the police to stop breaching the peace. He also refused to follow the police to their station but instead called the participants in the demonstration, who shouted and threatened the officers. The applicant denied all accusations. Having heard the applicant and examined the case-file materials, the court concluded that the applicant’s testimony was refuted by the written reports of the police officers and the traffic police officers. The court noted that the said reports had been drawn up correctly and therefore had to be taken into account. It sentenced the applicant to three days of administrative detention starting from 6 p.m. on 14 October 2010 with reference to the relevant provisions of the Code on Administrative Offences.', '15. At around 6 p.m. on 17 October 2010 the applicant was released.', '16. On 18 October 2010 the applicant appealed against the court’s decision of 14 October 2010. In his appeal, he complained that he had been found guilty even though he had not committed the alleged offences. He noted that under Article 39 of the Constitution a demonstration could be held subject to notifying the authorities and any restrictions on holding one could be imposed only by a court; no permission had therefore been required. He also noted that he had notified the City Council twice about the gathering in question and at the time it was held there had been no court decision prohibiting it. Therefore, he considered that he had organised the gathering of 12 October 2010 lawfully and the conclusions of the first-instance court that he had “held a meeting without permission of the City Council” had not been based on law as no such permission was required by domestic law. He further challenged the conclusion of the police that he had notified the authorities about the event only a few hours in advance, claiming that he had already done so on 17 August 2010. Furthermore, in his opinion, even the requirement of notification two days in advance, which had been established by the procedure for organising and holding meetings, rallies, street marches and demonstrations in the city of Lviv and to which the police referred in their reports on administrative offences, was not based on law, as the Constitutional Court in its decision of 19 April 2001 had decided that the procedure for such notification had to be a matter for legislative regulation.', '17. The applicant further maintained in his appeal that, in the absence of any lawful restrictions on holding a demonstration, demands by the police to stop such an event could not be considered lawful and the law did not provide for liability for disobeying unlawful demands of police officers. He finally complained that the first-instance court had violated his right to defend himself as it had refused to allow his lawyer to appear in the case on the ground that the applicant was a human-rights defender and therefore able to defend his rights himself.', '18. In a supplement to his appeal of 27 October 2010, the applicant complained that his punishment violated Article 11 of the Convention. Referring to provisions of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (b-d) of the Convention, he further complained that his right to defend himself had been violated, and that the first-instance court had refused to question the witnesses and to examine a video record of the peaceful demonstration.', '19. On 27 October 2010 the Lviv Regional Court of Appeal examined the applicant’s appeal in the presence of the applicant and his lawyer and rejected it. It summarised the findings of the first-instance court and the arguments of the applicant’s appeal. The court noted that the findings of the first-instance court as to the applicant’’s opinion, were confirmed by the police reports and other explanations and evidence. In reply to the applicant’s arguments to the effect that there had been no corpus delicti in his actions, the Court of Appeal noted that they should be disregarded, because they were refuted by the body of evidence in the case, without elaborating further on that point. The court referred in its decision to the relevant provisions of the Code on Administrative Offences.', '20. The relevant provisions of the Constitution read, in so far as relevant, as follows:', '“Human and citizens’ rights and freedoms affirmed by this Constitution are not exhaustive.', 'Constitutional rights and freedoms are guaranteed and shall not be abolished.', 'The content and scope of existing rights and freedoms shall not be diminished by the enactment of new laws or the amendment of laws that are in force.”', '“Citizens have the right to assemble peacefully without arms and to hold meetings, rallies, marches and demonstrations, after notifying the executive authorities and bodies of local self-government beforehand.', 'Restrictions on the exercise of this right may be established by a court in accordance with the law − in the interests of national security and public order only − for the purpose of preventing disturbances or crimes, protecting the health of the population, or protecting the rights and freedoms of other persons.', '“The following are determined exclusively by the laws of Ukraine:', '(1) human and citizens’ rights and freedoms; the guarantees of these rights and freedoms; the main duties of the citizen ...”', '“1. Laws and other normative acts enacted prior to the entry into force of this Constitution shall apply in so far as they do not conflict with the Constitution of Ukraine...”', '21. The relevant provisions of the Code read, in so far as relevant, as follows:', '“Malicious disobedience to a lawful order or demand by a police officer who is carrying out his official duties ... shall be punishable by a fine of between eight and fifteen times the minimum monthly wage, or by correctional labour of between one and ’s character these measures are found to be insufficient, by administrative detention of up to fifteen days.”', '“A breach of the procedure for organising and holding meetings, rallies, street marches and demonstrations shall be punishable by a reprimand or by a fine of between ten and twenty-five times the minimum monthly wage.', 'The same actions committed within a year of the application of administrative penalties or by the organiser of the meeting, rally, street procession or demonstration shall be punishable by a fine of between twenty and one hundred times the minimum monthly wage, or by correctional labour of one to two months, with a deduction of 20% of earnings; or by administrative detention of up to fifteen days.”', '“The provision by officials of premises, transport, or technical means, or the creating of other conditions for the organisation and holding of meetings, rallies, street marches and demonstrations, in violation of the established procedure, shall be punishable by a fine of between twenty and one hundred times the minimum monthly wage.”', '22. Paragraph 1 of Article 268 of the Code provides, inter alia, for the following rights in respect of a person whose administrative liability is engaged:', '“A person whose administrative liability is engaged shall be entitled to study the case materials, to give explanations, to present evidence, to make requests, and to have the assistance of a lawyer ... during the examination of the case ...”', '23. The right to a lawyer in administrative offence proceedings is further guaranteed by Article 271 of the Code.', '24. According to Article 294 of the Code, a court resolution concerning an administrative offence could be appealed against. The relevant part of the Article provides as to the appellate court’s competence as follows:', '“A court of appeal shall review the case within the scope of the appeal. The court of appeal is not limited to arguments of the appeal if incorrect application of substantive law or violation of procedural norms has been established during the hearing. The court of appeal can examine new pieces of evidence which have not been examined before, if it finds that the failure to present them to the local court was justified or that the local court rejected them without good reason.”', '25. The Decree lays down the procedure for seeking and granting permission to organise and hold meetings, rallies, street marches and demonstrations. The Decree provides inter alia as follows:', '“The Constitution of the USSR, according to the interests of the people and for the strengthening and development of the socialist system, guarantees to the citizens of the USSR the freedom to hold meetings, rallies, street marches and demonstrations. Exercise of these political freedoms shall be ensured to the working people and their organisations by providing them with public buildings, streets, squares and other places ...', '1. An application to hold a meeting, rally, street procession or demonstration shall be submitted to the executive committee of the appropriate local Soviet of people’s deputies...', '2. An application to hold a meeting, rally, street procession or demonstration shall be submitted in writing no later than ten days before the planned date of the event in question...', '3. The executive committee of the Soviet of people’s deputies shall examine the application and notify the representatives (organisers) of its decision no later than five days prior to the date of the event mentioned in the application...', '...', '6. The executive committee of the Soviet of people’s deputies shall ban a meeting, rally, street procession or demonstration if the goal of the event in question is contrary to the Constitution of the USSR, the Constitutions of the Republics of the Union or of the autonomous republics or poses a threat to the public order and safety of citizens.”', '26. By enacting this Law, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR approved a number of Decrees of the Presidium, including the above-mentioned Decree of 28 July 1988.', '27. The Resolution provides in particular:', '“ ... before the relevant legislation of Ukraine is enacted, the legislation of the USSR shall be applicable within the territory of the republic in respect of issues that have not been regulated by the legislation of Ukraine and in so far as they do not contravene the Constitution and legislation of Ukraine.”', '28. This decision introduced the procedure for organising peaceful gatherings in the city of Lviv. According to that decision, the freedom of assembly was guaranteed, but could be restricted by a court for considerations of public health, prevention of crime and disorder and protection of the rights of others. To restrict such a gathering, the Executive Council could apply to a court. Item 7 of the procedure provided that notification about a planned gathering had to be given at least two working days prior to the date on which it was to be held.', '29. Item 14 of the procedure specified that gatherings could not be held in the road (except street marches and demonstrations), on lawns and flower beds, or in front of the central entrance (not closer than seven metres) and other entrances of administrative buildings. Nor could they be held in case of non-compliance with sanitary norms. Item 16 of the procedure specified that holding a gathering in breach of any of the restrictions imposed by item 14 should be considered a breach of the peace and should engage liability under the law. Item 15 further provided that the organisers should be responsible for ensuring public order during a gathering. Item 20 further provided that the authorities could apply to a court for the purpose of establishing the liability of persons responsible for breaching the procedure.', '30. On 1 June 2011 the Lviv City Council annulled the decision of 16 April 2004 of its Executive Committee and ordered a new procedure on the holding of such gatherings to be drawn up.', '31. In its decision the Constitutional Court held inter alia:', '“1. ... the Ministry of the Interior of Ukraine applied to the Constitutional Court of Ukraine for an official interpretation of the provisions of Article 39 of the Constitution of Ukraine regarding timely notification to executive authorities or bodies of local self-government of planned meetings, rallies, marches or demonstrations.', 'In this constitutional application it is noted that, under Article 39 of the Constitution of Ukraine, citizens have the right to assemble peacefully without arms and to hold meetings, rallies, marches or demonstrations following prior notification to the executive authorities or bodies of local self-government. However, it is stressed that the current legislation of Ukraine does not provide for a specific time-limit within which the executive authorities or bodies of local self-government are to be notified about such actions...', '... the Constitutional Court holds as follows:', '1. The provisions of the first part of Article 39 of the Constitution of Ukraine on the timely notification to the executive authorities or bodies of local self-government about planned meetings, rallies, marches or demonstrations relevant to this constitutional application shall be understood to mean that where the organisers of such peaceful gatherings are planning to hold such an event they must inform the above-mentioned authorities in advance, that is, within a reasonable time prior to the date of the planned event. These time-limits should not restrict the right of citizens under Article 39 of the Constitution of Ukraine, but should serve as a guarantee of this right and at the same time should provide the relevant executive authorities or bodies of local self-government with an opportunity to take measures to ensure that citizens may freely hold meetings, rallies, marches and demonstrations and to protect public order and the rights and freedoms of others.', 'Specifying the exact deadlines for timely notification with regard to the particularities of [different] forms of peaceful assembly, the number of participants, the venue, at what time the event is to be held, and so on, is a matter for legislative regulation ...”', '32. In its review the Supreme Court noted inter alia as follows:', '“... No legislation has been enacted in Ukraine establishing a mechanism for fulfilling the right to freedom of peaceful assembly. According to the Resolution of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine of 12 September 1991 no. 1545-XII on temporary application of certain legislative acts of the Soviet Union, the normative acts of the USSR remain in force, applying in order of legal rank, for example, the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of 28 July 1988 on the procedure for organising and holding meetings, rallies, street marches and demonstrations in the USSR ...”', '33. The note mentioned, inter alia, as follows:', '“...The legislation of Ukraine does not currently have a special law regulating public relations in the sphere of peaceful assembly. One of the urgent problems to be settled by such a law is the time-limits for notifying the authorities of a planned peaceful gathering in order to ensure that it is held in safe conditions. Article 39 of the Constitution of Ukraine, while providing that the executive authorities or bodies of local self-government must be notified in a timely manner that a peaceful gathering is to be held, does not establish specific deadlines for such notification. The uncertainty of this matter results in the relevant constitutional norm being applied inconsistently and thus requires legal regulation ...', '... The judicial practice contains instances of cases restricting the right to peaceful assembly being decided on the basis of the procedure for organising and holding meetings, rallies, street marches and demonstrations laid down by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of 28 July 1988 No. 9306-XI on the procedure for organisation and holding of meetings, rallies, street marches and demonstrations in the USSR. This approach is incorrect.', 'Since the norms of this Decree establish the procedure for authorising (registering) peaceful assembly and empower the authorities and bodies of local self-governments to ban such events, whereas the norms of the Constitution of Ukraine provide for a procedure whereby the authorities are notified that a gathering is to be held and provides that only the courts have power to ban a peaceful gathering, the above-mentioned legal act should not be applied by courts when deciding such cases ...”', '34. In the judgment of the Babushkinsky District Court of Dnipropetrovsk of 30 March 2007 in the case of S. v. the Executive Committee of the Dnipropetrovsk City Council concerning the adoption of regulations on holding mass events in the city of Dnipropetrovsk, the court held, inter alia, that the procedures for exercising the right to freedom of assembly and the procedures and grounds for restricting the right were not regulated by Ukrainian legislation and therefore the Council had no grounds for adopting the impugned regulation, which would interfere with the rights of citizens.', '35. In another case the Kyiv Administrative Court, in a judgment of 29 November 2011, restricted the right of several NGOs and private persons to hold a demonstration on account, in particular, of their failure to notify the Kyiv City State Administration of their intention ten days in advance. The court referred to the 1988 Decree. The participants appealed against that judgment. On 16 May 2012 the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal quashed the judgment of the first-instance court. In its decision the Court of Appeal noted that the 1988 Decree conflicted with the Constitution as it required the organisers to seek permission to hold a demonstration and authorised the executive authorities to ban such an event, whereas Article 39 of the Constitution provided that the authorities should be notified that a demonstration was being planned, and empowered only the judicial authorities to place restrictions on the organisation thereof. It also noted that in its decision of 19 April 2001 (see paragraph 31 above) the Constitutional Court had not referred to the 1988 Decree as a normative act which should apply in Ukraine to the legal relations under consideration. The court also noted that the file contained no documents proving that notification about the demonstration less than 10 days in advance had not allowed the police to ensure public order during the demonstration and that the holding of such an event could create a real risk of riots or crimes or endanger the health of the population and imperil the rights and freedoms of others. It concluded that the judgment of the first-instance court was incompatible with Article 39 of the Constitution and Article 11 of the Convention.', '36. In another case the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal, in a decision of 11 October 2012, quashed the judgment of the Kyiv Administrative Court, which had restricted the freedom of peaceful assembly in respect of a number of political and non-governmental organisations upon an application by the Kyiv City State Administration. In its decision the Administrative Court of Appeal noted that, in deciding the case, the first-instance court had had regard to the provisions of the 1988 Decree, whereas since 1996 the question of holding peaceful gatherings had been regulated by the Constitution. The court further stated that the 1988 Decree conflicted with the Constitution as it provided for a procedure for seeking permission to hold a demonstration and that the Decree concerned the holding of such events in a non-existent country (“the USSR”), regulated relations between the citizens of the USSR and the executive committees of the Soviets of People’s Deputies, and considered demonstrations on the basis of their compatibility with the Constitution of the USSR, the constitutions of the union and the autonomous republics, that is, non-existent constitutions of non-existent subjects. The court also noted that under the Ukrainian Constitution human rights and freedoms, and the relevant safeguards, could be defined only by the laws of Ukraine.', '37. According to the Ukrainian Helsinki Human Rights Union in 2012 the Ukrainian authorities sought to restrict peaceful gatherings in 358 cases and in 90% of the cases they succeeded.', '38. At the request of a Ukrainian MP, the Ministry of Justice sent an information letter to an NGO in Kyiv. The text of this letter can be found on the official website of the Ukrainian Parliament.', '39. The relevant parts of the letter read as follows:', '“... It should be noted that the current legislation on the organisation and holding of peaceful demonstrations is not perfect. For example, today the organisation and conduct of peaceful demonstrations is regulated by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of 28 July 1988 N 9306 on the organisation and holding of meetings, rallies, street marches and demonstrations in the USSR (hereinafter – “the Decree”) which, in accordance with paragraph 1 of Chapter XV - Transitional Provisions of the Constitution of Ukraine − is effective in so far as it does not contradict the Constitution of Ukraine. The above Decree defined, in particular, which persons were authorised to contact the executive bodies of village, settlement and town councils to notify them of proposed peaceful demonstrations; requirements for the content of such notifications; requirements for the executive bodies of village, settlement and town councils in ensuring conditions for the holding of a peaceful demonstration; etc.', 'Thus, the requirements as to the organisation and holding of peaceful demonstrations, the time-limit for notification to be given to executive or local government bodies, the documents to be attached to the application for holding the event, etc. are currently not regulated by law ...', '... Given the inadequacy of the current state of the legal regulation of the procedure for the organisation and conduct of peaceful demonstrations, which results in problems in the application of law, since the legal norms are not formulated with sufficient clarity and are subject to ambiguous interpretation by those wishing to have recourse to them (including bodies of local government), only legislative regulation of the procedure for organising and holding such demonstrations will eliminate the negative practices that have arisen.', 'Because of the need for legislative support for the practical application of the aforesaid right defined by Article 39 of the Constitution of Ukraine - to assemble peacefully without arms and to hold meetings, rallies, demonstrations, pickets and marches - the Ministry of Justice has drafted the Law of Ukraine on the organisation and conduct of peaceful demonstrations, which was submitted by the Government of Ukraine to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine (registration N 2450 from 6 May 2008) and was approved by the Parliament on its first reading on 3 June 2009 ...”', '40. The draft law mentioned in the letter is currently awaiting its second reading in Parliament.', '41. The Guidelines provide in so far as relevant as follows:', '“1. Advance notice. The legal provisions concerning advance notice should require a notice of intent rather than a request for permission. The notification process should not be onerous or bureaucratic. The period of notice should not be unnecessarily lengthy, but should still allow adequate time prior to the notified date of the assembly for the relevant state authorities to plan and prepare for the event, and for the completion of an expeditious appeal to a tribunal or court should the legality of any restrictions imposed be challenged. If the authorities do not promptly present any objections to a notification, the organizers of a public assembly should be able to proceed with the planned activity in accordance with the terms notified and without restriction.”', '“ ...', 'The legal framework', '7. Regulating freedom of assembly in domestic law. Freedom of peaceful assembly should be accorded constitutional protection that ought to contain, at a minimum, a positive statement of both the right and the obligation to safeguard it. There should also be a constitutional provision that guarantees fair procedures in the determination of the rights contained therein. Constitutional provisions, however, cannot provide for specific details or procedures. As such, general constitutional provisions can be abused and, of themselves, afford unduly wide discretion to the authorities.', '...', '9. Domestic laws regulating freedom of assembly must be consistent with the international instruments ratified by that state, and the legitimacy of domestic laws will be judged accordingly. Domestic laws must also be interpreted and implemented in conformity with the relevant international and regional jurisprudence.', '“ ...', 'Legality', '30. Any restrictions imposed must have a formal basis in primary law. The law itself must be sufficiently precise to enable an individual to assess whether or not his or her conduct would be in breach of the law, and to foresee what the consequences of such breaches would likely be. The incorporation of clear definitions in domestic legislation is vital to ensuring that the law remains easy to understand and to apply, and that regulation does not encroach upon activities that ought not to be regulated. Definitions should therefore be neither too elaborate nor too broad.”', '“ ...', 'Advance notification', '91. It is common for the regulatory authority to require advance written notice of public assemblies. Such a requirement is justified by the state’s positive duty to put in place any necessary arrangements to facilitate freedom of assembly and protect public order, public safety, and the rights and freedom of others. The UN Human Rights Committee has held that a requirement to give notice, while a de facto restriction on freedom of assembly, is compatible with the permitted limitations laid down in Article 21 of the ICCPR. Similarly, the European Commission on Human Rights, in Rassemblement Jurassien (1979), stated that: “Such a procedure is in keeping with the requirements of Article 11(1), if only in order that the authorities may be in a position to ensure the peaceful nature of the meeting, and accordingly does not as such constitute interference with the exercise of the right.”', '92. The notification process should not be onerous or bureaucratic, as this would undermine the freedom of assembly by discouraging those who might wish to hold an assembly. Furthermore, individual demonstrators should not be required to provide advance notification to the authorities of their intention to demonstrate. Where a lone demonstrator is joined by another or others, then the event should be treated as a spontaneous assembly...', '93. The period of notice should not be unnecessarily lengthy (normally no more than a few days), but should still allow adequate time prior to the notified date of the assembly for the relevant state authorities to plan and prepare for the event (deploy police officers, equipment, etc.), for the regulatory body to give a prompt official response to the initial notification, and for the completion of an expeditious appeal to a tribunal or court should the legality of any restrictions imposed be challenged.', '94. The official receiving the notice should issue a receipt explicitly confirming that the organizers of the assembly are in compliance with the applicable notice requirements. The notice should also be communicated immediately to all state organs involved in the regulatory process, including the relevant police authorities.', 'Notification, not authorization', '95. Legal provisions concerning advance notice should require a notice of intent rather than a request for permission. Although lawful in several jurisdictions, a permit requirement accords insufficient value to both the fundamental freedom to assemble and to the corresponding principle that everything not regulated by law should be presumed to be lawful. Those countries where a permit is required are encouraged to amend domestic legislation so as to require notification only. It is significant that, in a number of jurisdictions, permit procedures have been declared unconstitutional. Any permit system must clearly prescribe in law the criteria for issuance of a permit. In addition, the criteria should be confined to considerations of time, place, and manner, and should not provide a basis for content-based regulation.', '96. If the authorities do not respond promptly to a notification, the organizers of a public assembly may proceed with the activities according to the terms notified without restriction. Even in countries where authorization rather than notification is still required, authorization should be presumed granted if a response is not given within a reasonable time.”', '42. At its 64th plenary session (21-22 October 2005) the European Commission for Democracy through Law (the Venice Commission) adopted an opinion interpreting the OSCE/ODIHR guidelines on drafting laws on freedom of assembly with regard to the regulation of public meetings, including the requirement of advance notice of demonstrations in public places:', '“29. Establishing a regime of prior notification of peaceful assemblies does not necessarily extend to an infringement of the right. In fact, in several European countries such regimes do exist. The need for advance notice generally arises in respect of certain meetings or assemblies – for instance, when a procession is planned to take place on the highway, or a static assembly is planned to take place on a public square – which require the police and other authorities to enable it to occur and not to use powers that they may validly have (for instance, of regulating traffic) to obstruct the event.”', '43. The Venice Commission also emphasised that the regime of prior notification must not be such as to frustrate the intention of the organisers to hold a peaceful demonstration, and thus indirectly restrict their rights.']","['11', '6', '7']","['11-1', '6-1', '6-3', '7-1']","['6-3-b', '6-3-c', '6-3-d']",[],[],[]
001-23549,ENG,SVK,ADMISSIBILITY,2003,SANDOR and OTHERS v. SLOVAKIA,4,Inadmissible,Matti Pellonpää,"['The applicants, whose particulars appear in the appendix, are represented before the Court by Mr M. Kaščák, a lawyer practising in Vranov nad Topľou and by Mr P. Korvín, a lawyer practising in Bratislava. The respondent Government were represented by their Agent, Mr P. Vršanský to whom Mr P. Kresák succeeded on 1 April 2003.', 'The application of Mr M. Šándor was lodged on 2 November 1999. The remaining applicants introduced their applications on 10 February 2000.', 'The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', 'On 18 August 1995 private limited companies ILaS Vranov, s.r.o. and Slovenka Vranov, s.r.o. concluded a contract under which the former undertook to sell real property to the latter.', 'The circumstances under which the contract was concluded are contested between the parties.', 'The Government submit that the applicants had personal links to the above companies and that they had pecuniary interests in them. In particular, both companies were subsidiaries of the company Topex and were controlled by Mr I. Ilčišin. The Government express the view that the contract was actually drafted at a later date than indicated in it.', 'The applicants refute the Government’s allegation that the date of the contract had been forged.', 'On 16 October 1995 the tax administration authority issued a pledge in respect of the above real property with a view to securing a tax debt which the company ILaS Vranov, s.r.o. possibly had. The representatives of the company attempted to have the decision lifted arguing that the company owed no taxes. On 9 May 1996 the tax authority quashed its decision of 16 October 1995. On the same day, it issued an interim measure preventing the company from alienating the property on the ground that tax control was being carried out in the company. Subsequently the competent authorities found that the company had no tax debt.', 'As a result of the interference of the tax authority, the company ILaS Vranov, s.r.o. was not in a position to comply with the above contract and owed a considerable contractual penalty to its partner. Its representatives filed a claim for damages, under the State Liability Act of 1969, against the State, represented by the Ministry of Finance.', 'On 13 January 1997 the Vranov nad Topľou District Court granted the claim and ordered the defendant to pay 57.687.455 Slovakian korunas (SKK) to the plaintiff. The court established that the tax authority had proceeded erroneously and had thus caused damage to the plaintiff.', 'On 25 September 1997 the Prešov Regional Court upheld the District Court’s conclusion considering that the tax authority had proceeded contrary to the law. The appellate court reduced the sum granted to the plaintiff to SKK 43.265.591 plus default interest. The decision became final on 20 November 1997 and enforceable on 14 November 1997. The defendant filed an appeal on points of law. The Supreme Court rejected it as being inadmissible on 4 March 1998.', 'As the Ministry of Finance failed to comply with the judgment, ILaS Vranov, s.r.o. sought its enforcement.', 'On 28 November 1997 a judge of the Vranov nad Topľou District Court authorised an execution officer to enforce the sum in question.', 'On 1 December 1997 the enforcement officer notified the Ministry of Finance of the enforcement and invited it to pay the debt within fourteen days. The Ministry of Finance filed objections to the enforcement. They were dismissed by the Vranov nad Topľou District Court on 15 June 1998.', 'On 13 June 1998 ILaS spol.s.r.o transferred the title to the above sum to the company C.S.I.-C.D., a.s. The Vranov nad Topľou District Court approved of this transfer by a decision of 3 August 1998.', 'On 24 September 1998 the Vranov nad Topľou District Court granted the execution officer’s request and authorised her to avail herself of securities in possession of the State with a view to enforcing the sum in question. Reference was made to Sections 132 and 133 of the Execution Order of 1995. The decision stated, with reference to the relevant provisions of the Securities Act, that the execution officer enjoyed all rights relating to the securities.', 'The General Prosecutor filed an extraordinary appeal on points of law against this decision. The Supreme Court dismissed it on 28 February 2001. In the Supreme Court’s view, the execution officer had been authorised to enforce the sum due by having the securities sold. The decision further stated that even if the decision challenged by the General Prosecutor was quashed, it would not affect the execution procedure as such. The Supreme Court did not, therefore, examine in detail the arguments adduced by the General Prosecutor.', 'In the meantime, the execution officer concluded a contract with a private company specialised in trading in securities with a view to having the securities specified in the execution order sold. On the basis of this contract and the judicial authorisation to carry out the enforcement, a representative of the company commissioned by the execution officer arranged, at the Securities Centre (Stredisko cenných papierov SR Bratislava, a.s.), for the sale to the applicants of shares of Transpetrol, a.s., a joint stock company in which the sole shareholder was the Ministry of Economy. The operation was carried out on 9 October 1998.', 'On 9 October 1998 company C.S.I.-C.D., a.s. concluded contracts of pledge in respect of the securities with Brilant, a.s., C.D., a.s., C.S.I.-Fest, a.s., Tradeunion, s.r.o., Mr M. Kozubaľ and Mr T. Kolesár.', 'On 29 October 1998 the execution officer returned the authorisation to carry out the execution to the Vranov nad Topľou District Court with the explanation that the sum due had been enforced.', 'The representatives of Transpetrol, a.s. and of the Ministry of Economy challenged the transfer of the shares on the ground that it had been carried out without the approval of the issuer of the securities. On 21 October 1998 the Securities Centre therefore ordered that trading with the securities of Transpetrol, a.s. be suspended. On 10 November 1998, after the relevant documents had been checked, the Securities Centre lifted the order.', 'On 9 December 1998 the Ministry of Finance ordered the Securities Centre, with reference to Section 82 of the Securities Act of 1992, to transfer the shares which the applicants had acquired back to the Ministry of Economy within three days. The decision stated that the Securities Centre had acted erroneously. In particular, the Securities Centre had transferred the securities without prior consent of the owner, and there was a contradiction between the operative part of the court’s decision authorising the execution officer to carry out the enforcement and the reasons for that decision. Furthermore, the relevant documents indicated that the enforcement should have concerned the Ministry of Finance and not the Ministry of Economy, and that under the relevant law the securities in question could only be owned by the State. Lastly, the decision stated that it could be challenged by means of a remedy (rozklad) to be lodged with the Ministry of Finance within fifteen days after its service. It was not served on the applicants and became final on 28 December 1998.', 'On 10 December 1998 the Securities Centre informed the applicants that it had complied with the order of the Ministry of Finance and that, as a result, they no longer owned the shares of Transpetrol, a.s.', 'On 10 December 1998 Transpetrol, a.s. modified the form of its securities. As a result, the shares ceased to be registered at the Securities Centre.', 'The Ministry of Finance refused to give an explanation to the applicants on the ground that they were not parties to the administrative proceedings leading to the decision of 9 December 1998.', 'On 8 March 1999 the General Prosecutor’s Office informed the applicants that public prosecutors had no power to review the way in which the Ministry of Finance had proceeded.', 'The applicants, with the exception of Tradeunion, s.r.o., requested the Supreme Court to review the lawfulness of the decision of the Ministry of Finance of 9 December 1998. By two decisions delivered on 17 and 27 September 1999 respectively the Supreme Court discontinued the proceedings in respect of the claims lodged by C.S.I. - Fest, a.s., Brilant, a.s., Mr M. Šándor and C.D., a.s. as the plaintiffs had not challenged the administrative decision complained of by means of a remedy (rozklad) before the Ministry of Finance. The Supreme Court considered irrelevant that the decision of 9 December 1998 had not been served on the plaintiffs as it was obvious from their submissions that they had been aware of it. Furthermore, the plaintiffs could have requested the administrative authority concerned to grant them the status of parties to the proceedings. Under the relevant provisions of the Administrative Proceedings Act, the administrative authority was obliged to decide on such a request and its decision could be challenged. The Supreme Court decided in camera without having summoned the plaintiffs.', 'By a decision delivered on 28 September 1999 a different chamber of the Supreme Court discontinued the proceedings in respect of the claim lodged by Mr M. Kozubaľ. The decision stated that the court lacked jurisdiction to deal with the case. The Supreme Court further held that the decision delivered by the Ministry of Finance on 9 December 1998 had not directly determined the plaintiff’s rights and that the latter had not been a party to the proceedings in the context of which the decision had been delivered. The Supreme Court therefore found no reason for proceeding pursuant to Secton 250b(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure.', 'On 16 April 1999 a different chamber of the Supreme Court discontinued the proceedings in respect of the claim lodged by Mr T. Kolesár on the ground that he had failed to pay the court fees before 29 March 1999 as requested by the court. The decision was served on 6 July 1999. In the meantime, on 27 April 1999, the plaintiff had paid the fees. He therefore requested the Supreme Court, on 16 July 1999, that the proceedings be resumed. The Supreme Court did not proceed with the case.', 'In September 1999 the applicants filed both an ordinary and an extraordinary remedy against the decision delivered by the Ministry of Finance on 9 December 1998. They claimed, in particular, that administrative authorities lacked jurisdiction to determine ownership rights in respect of securities. The applicants also requested that they should be granted the standing of parties to the proceedings in which the contested decision had been delivered.', 'By decisions of 19 and 24 November 1999 respectively the Minister of Finance rejected the applicants’ submissions. The decisions stated that the ordinary remedy was inadmissible as the applicants lacked standing in the administrative proceedings complained of. Furthermore, the contested decision of 9 December 1998 neither concerned the rights or legally protected interests of the applicants, nor did it directly affect them as the shares had been transferred back to the Ministry of Economy by the Securities Centre. As to the applicants’ request that they should be allowed to act as a party to the proceedings, the Minister’s decisions stated that the applicants should have filed it before the contested decision had become final on 28 December 1998.', 'In the meantime, on 31 August 1999, company C.S.I.-C.D., a.s. sued its above contractual partners, the Ministry of Economy, Transpetrol, a.s. and the Securities Centre for the securities pledged. The plaintiff submitted that Transpetrol, a.s. had modified the form of the securities without the creditor’s knowledge and that it was not known who possessed the securities pledged. On 27 September 2000 the Prešov Regional Court rejected the action to the extent that it concerned the Securities Centre. The proceedings on the claim of company C.S.I.-C.D., a.s. of 31 August 1999 in respect of the other defendants are pending.', 'On 4 December 2001 Tradeunion, s.r.o. filed an action with the Supreme Court seeking a judicial review of the above decision delivered by the Ministry of Finance on 9 December 1998. The plaintiff argued that the contested decision had not been served on its representatives and that the Ministry should have considered it as a party to the proceedings. The plaintiff further argued that decisions concerning the ownership of securities fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of ordinary courts.', 'On 28 May 2002 the Supreme Court quashed the decision of the Ministry of Finance of 9 December 1998 and sent the case back to the administrative authority for further proceedings. The decision stated that, despite several requests, the defendant Ministry had failed to comply with its statutory obligation to submit the administrative file concerning the case to the Supreme Court. Without having the file before it, the Supreme Court was not in a position to review the lawfulness of the decision complained of.', 'The Supreme Court noted that it was contested between the parties whether or not the plaintiff was a party to the administrative proceedings in question. It recalled that administrative authorities were obliged to examine, of their own initiative and throughout the administrative proceedings, whether a person has standing in the proceedings. When such was not the case, the administrative authority had to issue a formal decision to that effect. The Supreme Court concluded that the Ministry of Finance should have delivered a formal decision in case that it considered that the plaintiff was not a party to the proceedings in question. The delivery of such a decision would have allowed the plaintiff company to avail itself of its procedural rights with a view to protecting its interests.', 'On 22 May 2002 the General Prosecutor filed an extra-ordinary appeal on points of law against the Supreme Court’s judgment of 28 May 2002 on the ground that Tradeunion, s.r.o. lacked standing in the administrative proceedings complained of and that the Supreme Court had committed errors of law. On 11 June 2003 the Supreme Court asked the representative of Tradeunion, s.r.o. to submit comments on the submissions of the General Prosecutor’s Office.', 'On 11 June 2002 the applicants requested the Financial Market Office (Úrad pre finančný trh), which had taken over the role of supervisor of the financial market operations in the meantime, to order the Securities Centre to restore the securities in question to their accounts in accordance with the situation existing prior to 9 December 1998.', 'On 11 June 2002 the applicants also requested the Securities Centre to restore the securities to their accounts with reference to the Supreme Court’s decision of 28 May 2002. They were informed that the Securities Centre could not to take any action without a prior decision of the Financial Market Office.', 'On 11 June 2003 the applicants filed an action with the Supreme Court, under Article 250t(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, claiming that the Financial Market Office had failed to decide on their request of 11 June 2002.', 'On 30 November 2001 a public prosecutor indicted the representative of Tradeunion a.s., two representatives of Brilant a.s., the Vranov nad Topľou District Court judge and the execution officer involved in the above execution as well as an employee of the Securities Centre and a broker for several offences before the Prešov Regional Court.', 'On 17 January 2002 the Supreme Court decided that the case was to be dealt with by the Žilina Regional Court.', 'On 14 February 2003 the Žilina Regional Court discontinued the proceedings against the Vranov nad Topľou District Court judge as there was no indication that she had committed an offence. According to the Government, the proceedings against the other accused are pending.', 'Pursuant to Article 126(1), owners have the right to protection against unjustified interference with their ownership rights by others. In particular, they are entitled to claim the restoration of the property from those who hold it without any valid legal ground.', 'In accordance with the established practice, a plaintiff claiming protection of ownership rights can only be successful, when it is proved that he or she is the owner of the property in question and that the defendant has held the property without any valid legal ground.', 'Article 80(c) provides that judicial proceedings can be brought with a view to having the existence of a right or of a legal relation determined provided that it is justified by a pressing legal interest.', 'Article 244 provides that in administrative judiciary courts review the lawfulness of administrative decisions which determine rights and obligations of individuals or legal persons. As from 1 January 2002, this provision has been amended in that courts are also entitled to review the way in which administrative authorities proceed including their failure to act.', 'Pursuant to Article 247(2), courts are entitled to decide on actions against decisions delivered by administrative authorities where such decisions have become final after the exhaustion of all ordinary remedies.', 'Article 250(2) provides that plaintiffs in proceedings concerning the review of an administrative decision can be individuals or legal persons who allege, as parties to the administrative proceedings, that their rights were infringed as a result of the administrative authority’s decision. Action for a judicial review of an administrative decision can also be lodged by individuals or legal persons whom the administrative authority did not consider to be parties to administrative proceedings where such persons should have been considered as parties.', 'Article 250b(2) provides that, where the action is lodged by a person alleging that the administrative decision has not been served on him or her despite the fact that he or she should have been considered as a party to administrative proceedings, the court shall verify such an allegation and, where justified, order the administrative authority to serve the decision on the person concerned. According to the circumstances, the court shall also order that the enforceability of such a decision be delayed. The decision of the court is binding on the administrative authority. After the service of the decision in question the administrative authority shall transmit the case file to the court which shall decide on the action.', 'Article 250b (3), enacted with effect from 1 January 2003, provides that courts shall not proceed in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 250b(2) where more than three years elapsed from the delivery of the administrative decision which was not served on a party.', 'Article 250t(1) and (3), as in force since 1 January 2003, provides that natural and legal persons who consider that an administrative authority failed to proceed with a case without any valid reason can request a court to order the administrative authority to proceed with the case and to deliver a decision. Where such a request is granted, the court shall set a time-limit, which should not exceed three months, within which the administrative authority is obliged to decide.', 'Under Article 250u, the court can repeatedly impose a fine up to SKK 100,000, at the request of a party to the proceedings, in case that the administrative authority remains inactive despite an earlier judicial order under Article 250t.', 'Section 14(1) of the Administrative Proceedings Act of 1967 (Zákon o správnom konaní) admits as parties to administrative proceedings persons whose rights, legally protected interests or obligations are either to be determined or may directly be affected as a result of the proceedings. Any person alleging that the decision may directly affect his or her rights, legally protected interests or obligations shall also be considered a party to administrative proceedings until the opposite is proved.', 'Section 19(1) provides that submissions in the context of administrative proceedings can be made either in writing or orally.

On 3 December 2001 the dead body of a Mr L. was found, with a blood-stained axe lying next to it. A criminal investigation was initiated in respect of a suspected premeditated murder.', '8. From 14 January to 13 March 2002 the applicant underwent medical treatment for an unspecified psychiatric condition in the medical centre V.', '9. On 19 July 2002 he was arrested in the framework of an unrelated murder investigation.', '10. In March 2006 the applicant, who was at the time serving a fixed-term prison sentence for several counts of premeditated murder, made a confession, first to the prison administration and later to the investigation authorities, that on 3 December 2001 he had twice hit Mr L. on the head with the back of an axe without having the intention of killing him.', '11. Free legal counsel was appointed for, and represented, the applicant during the pre-trial investigation and the proceedings before the first-instance court.', '12.

On 7 November 2006 the Kyiv Regional Court of Appeal (“the Kyiv Court”), sitting as a court of first instance, found the applicant guilty of premeditated murder committed repeatedly and sentenced him to life imprisonment. It noted that although the applicant had alleged that he had had no intention to kill, the fact that he had hit the victim with an axe on a vital part of his body twice and with considerable force, indicated the opposite. While taking into account the applicant’s voluntary confession, the Kyiv Court noted that it was the fourth murder he had committed and considered life imprisonment to be the appropriate penalty. At the applicant’s request, the proceedings before the Kyiv Court were held in Russian.', '14.

His expected release date was in October 1998."", 'On 1 September 1997 the Sex Offenders Act 1997 entered into force. As a result of the Act, the applicant will be required to register with the police for an indefinite period following his release from prison. The applicant considers that this requirement is “depersonalising”, robbing him of his “ability to reinvent [him]self and start a new life” and, in addition, he fears that it may put him and his family at risk. In this connection he refers to newspaper reports of vigilante attacks on paedophiles following their identification by the press and television.', 'Relevant domestic law', 'According to its preamble, the Sex Offenders Act 1997 (“the Act”) is “an Act to require the notification of information to the police by persons who have committed sexual offences ...”.

The applicants were born in 1953 and 1943 respectively and live in Vienna.', '6. In 1997 the biological mother of F., then two years old and born out of wedlock, set her apartment on fire after having consumed drugs. The mother and her child were rescued and, on 19 December 1997, the Vienna Youth Welfare Office (Amt für Jugend und Familie) handed F. over to the applicants as foster parents.', '7. The applicants subsequently tried to obtain custody of F. and wanted to adopt him. F.’s mother recovered and was at first allowed access to visit her son. She then tried to obtain custody of F., which led to arguments between her and the applicants. Since these disputes were to the detriment of F., he was given to a “crisis foster family” (Krisenpflegefamilie) on 25 October 2001 for approximately eight weeks. After that period F. was handed over to his biological mother, who obtained provisional custody of him following a decision of the Vienna Juvenile Court (Jugendgerichtshof) on 19 December 2001. This decision entered into force on 18 December 2002, when the Supreme Court rejected an appeal by the applicants (Revisionsrekurs).', '8. In the meantime on 20 December 2001 the applicants requested the right to visit F. Thereupon the Juvenile Court asked the Vienna Youth Welfare Office for their observations on the applicants’ request.', '9. The Vienna Youth Welfare Office submitted observations on 31 December 2001, stating that because of the long-lasting relationship between F. and the applicants it would be inappropriate not to allow access to the foster parents.', '10. On 31 January 2002 the Juvenile Court heard the biological mother, who opposed the granting of visiting rights to the applicants because F. was in the process of getting used to her again.', '11. On 8 February 2002 the applicants requested the acceleration of the proceedings (Fristsetzungantrag) under Section 91 of the Austrian Court Act.', '12. On 28 March 2002 the Vienna Juvenile Court Assistance Office (Wiener Jugendgerichtshilfe) submitted their observations to the Juvenile Court. In the following months both parties repeatedly filed written observations on that report. The applicants also requested that an expert for child psychology be appointed.', '13. On 2 December 2002 the applicants complained about the length of the proceedings and requested the opinion of an expert on child psychology. The biological mother objected to this request.', '14. On 4 December 2002 the Juvenile Court asked the applicants whether they were maintaining their request for the appointment of an expert, given that meanwhile a report by the doctor with whom F. had had therapy had been obtained. On 10 December 2002 the applicants informed the court that they insisted on the appointment of an expert and proposed further questions to be put to the expert appointed.', '15. On 17 February 2003 the Juvenile Court designated Dr. Sp. as the expert. The biological mother filed objections against Dr. Sp.', '16. In July 2003 the court file was transferred to the Vienna Regional Court for Civil Matters, which was dealing with an appeal lodged by the applicants in the custody proceedings concerning F. lodged on 23 May 2003. On an unspecified date the Vienna Regional Court transferred the file to the Wiener Neustadt Regional Court as it considered that that court was competent to decide on the appeal. The Wiener Neustadt Regional Court did so on 19 and 29 January 2004; the file was then forwarded to the Mödling District Court, which had meanwhile become competent to deal with custody and visiting-rights proceedings.', '17. On 16 December 2003 Dr Sp asked the District Court for leave to be discharged from the duty to prepare an expert report. He submitted that a report was not feasible because he had not been given the opportunity to examine F. thoroughly by F.’s mother.', '18. The Mödling District Court held a hearing with the parties on 1 April 2004 in order to discuss how to proceed further with the case. The judge informed the applicants and the biological mother that he would ask the Youth Office of the Mödling District Administrative Authority (Jugendamt der Bezirkshauptmannschaft) for a final report on the issue of visiting rights.', '19. P., who was the officer in charge at the Youth Office of the Mödling District Administrative Authority, submitted the report on 29 July 2004. She recommended refusing visiting rights to the applicants, because the reestablishment of contact with F. after it had been interrupted for more than two years might harm the psychological stability of the child. On 17 August and 16 September 2004 the parties submitted their comments on that report.', '20. On 3 August 2004 Dr. Z. of the Niederösterreich Child and Youth Psychological Consulting Office (Kinder- und jugendpsychologischer Beratungsdienst) also suggested that the applicants should not be granted access to F., explaining that F. was aware of the difficulties between his mother and the applicants and therefore, as a protective measure, had said that he did not want to see the applicants. Dr. Z. further stated that not seeing the applicants was not to the detriment of the child. The applicants submitted observations regarding these recommendations.', '21. On 9 November 2004 the Mödling District Court rejected the applicants’ request to visit F. and found that failure to provide for personal contact (Unterbleiben des persönlichen Verkehrs) between the applicants and F. did not endanger his well-being.', '22. It found that under Article 148 (4) of the Civil Code a court, upon the request of a parent, the child, a youth welfare body or of its own motion had to take the necessary measures if failure to provide for personal contact between the child and the third person would endanger his or her well-being. Third persons, in contrast to parents or grandparents, had no legal right to be granted contact rights and consequently no legal standing in related court proceedings. They could merely suggest to the court (anregen) that it examine the matter of its own motion, and a court could only grant contact rights if failure to do so would endanger the child’s well-being.', '23. Taking the applicants’ request as such a suggestion, visiting rights could not be granted. From all the material in the possession of the District Court it was evident that F. was vehemently opposed to meeting the applicants, while at the same time he had developed a close and positive relationship with his mother. The District Court acknowledged that the applicants had a genuine concern for F.’s well-being; however, in the present situation the interests of the applicants did not coincide with the child’s best interests. Given that F. had not been in contact with his foster parents for more than three years, the District Court would follow the conclusions in the reports of P., from the Youth Office of the Mödling District Administrative Authority, and Dr. Z., from the Niederösterreich Child and Youth Psychological Consulting Office. It was quite possible that immediately after F. had been placed with the “crisis foster family” in October 2001 the granting of visiting rights to the applicants might have been useful. However, this was no longer the case and it now served the best interests of the child, who was living with his biological mother, not to put him back in a situation of divided loyalties (Loyalitätskonflikt) between her and his “former family”, the applicants.', '24. On 6 December 2004 the applicants appealed against the District Court’s decision. They argued that the refusal of visiting rights breached their rights under Article 8 of the Convention.', '25. The Regional Court dismissed the applicants’ appeal on 17 February 2005. It found that foster parents could file requests in proceedings concerning the foster child and also had the right to appeal against decisions. The status of a foster parent was, however, a matter which depended rather on whether the person actually cared for the child and whether a lasting emotional link similar to the one between parents and children had developed. Even though the applicants had lived with F. for approximately forty-six months in the same household with the intent to develop such emotional ties, it was actually more than forty months since they had had care of him and they could now no longer be considered his foster parents. Nevertheless, their appeal had to be considered on its merits, and, for the reasons given by the District Court, granting visiting rights to them was not in the best interests of F. The appeal was therefore unfounded.', '26. On 25 May 2005 the Supreme Court dismissed an extraordinary appeal by the applicant (außerordentlicher Revisionsrekurs). That decision was served on the applicants’ counsel on 7 July 2005.', '27. Article 148 of the Civil Code (Allgemeines Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) reads as follows:', '“(1) If one parent does not live in a common household with a minor child, then the child and this parent have the right to be in personal contact with each other. The exercise of this right shall be regulated by mutual consent between the child and the parents. Whenever such an agreement cannot be reached, the court shall regulate the exercise of this right in a manner appropriate for the welfare of the child, upon an application by the child or a parent, giving due consideration to the needs and wishes of the child.', '(2) If necessary, the court shall restrict or not permit the exercise of the right to personal contact, especially if the authorised parent does not comply with his/her obligation under Section 145b.', '(3) Paragraphs (1) and (2) shall apply by analogy to the relationship between grandchildren and their grandparents. However, the exercise of the right of grandparents shall also be restricted or not permitted to such an extent that this would otherwise disturb the family life of the parents (a parent) or their relationship to the child.', '(4) Where the absence of personal contact between the minor child and a third party that is ready to engage in such contact may jeopardise the child’s welfare, the court shall issue the disposition necessary to regulate the personal contact upon an application by the child, a parent, the youth welfare agency, or of its own motion.”']",['8'],['8-1'],[],[],[],[]

On 17 September 1992 the applicant arrived at Manchester Airport on a flight from Pakistan. On the same flight was his cousin, N. Both men were stopped and searched by customs officials. N. was found to be in possession of heroin with a street value of almost 100,000 pounds sterling. He was interviewed and then arrested and charged. No drugs were found on the applicant. He too was interviewed, but made no admissions. He was released without charge. On 26 January 1993 the applicant visited a friend, B., in Sheffield. B. was under investigation for dealing in heroin. On 12 January 1993 the installation of a listening device on B.'s premises had been authorised by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire on the grounds that the conventional methods of surveillance were unlikely to provide proof that he was dealing in drugs. It was not expected or foreseen that the applicant would visit the premises. Neither B. nor the applicant was aware of the aural surveillance equipment which had been installed by the police."", '10. By means of that device the police obtained a tape recording of a conversation, in the course of which the applicant admitted that he had been a party to the importation of drugs by N. on 17 September 1992. The applicant was arrested on 11 February 1993. Again he made no admissions when interviewed, but subsequently he and N. were jointly charged with offences under the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 and the Misuse of Drugs Act 1991 and committed for trial.', '11. The trial took place in December 1993. The applicant pleaded “not guilty”. The applicant admitted that he had been present at the Sheffield address and that his voice was one of those recorded on the tape. It was admitted on behalf of the Crown that the attachment of the listening device had involved a civil trespass and had occasioned some damage to the property. Thereupon, the trial judge conducted a hearing on the voir dire (submissions on a point of law in the absence of the jury) as to the admissibility in evidence of the conversation recorded on the tape. The Crown accepted that without it there was no case against the applicant.', ""12. The trial judge ruled that the evidence was admissible. Following an amendment to the indictment, the applicant was re-arraigned and pleaded guilty to being knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of the prohibition on the importation of heroin. On 14 March 1994 the applicant was sentenced to three years' imprisonment."", ""13. The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal on the ground that the evidence ought to have been held to be inadmissible. On 27 May 1994 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's appeal against conviction but also certified, as a point of law of general public importance, the question whether evidence of tape-recorded conversations, obtained by a listening device attached by the police to a private house without the knowledge of the owners or occupiers, was admissible in a criminal trial against the defendant."", ""14. On 4 October 1994 the Appeal Committee of the House of Lords granted the applicant leave to appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeal dismissing his appeal against conviction. On 2 July 1996 the House of Lords dismissed the applicant's appeal. The House of Lords noted that the question before it gave rise to two separate issues, the first being whether evidence of the taped conversations was admissible at all and the second whether, if admissible, it should nonetheless have been excluded by the trial judge in the exercise of his discretion at common law or under the powers conferred by section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (“PACE”). As to the former issue, the House of Lords held that there was no right to privacy in English law and that, even if there were such a right, the common-law rule that relevant evidence which was obtained improperly or even unlawfully remained admissible applied to evidence obtained by the use of surveillance devices which invaded a person's privacy. As to the latter issue, it was held that the fact that evidence had been obtained in circumstances which amounted to a breach of the provisions of Article 8 of the Convention was relevant to, but not determinative of, the judge's discretion to admit or exclude such evidence under section 78 of PACE. The judge's discretion had to be exercised according to whether the admission of the evidence would render the trial unfair, and the use at a criminal trial of material obtained in breach of the right to privacy enshrined in Article 8 did not mean that the trial would be unfair. On the facts, the trial judge had been entitled to hold that the circumstances in which the relevant evidence was obtained, even if they constituted a breach of Article 8, were not such as to require the exclusion of the evidence. Lord Nolan, giving the opinion of the majority of the House, added:"", ""“The sole cause of this case coming to your Lordship's House is the lack of a statutory system regulating the use of surveillance devices by the police. The absence of such a system seems astonishing, the more so in view of the statutory framework which has governed the use of such devices by the Security Service since 1989, and the interception of communications by the police as well as by other agencies since 1985. I would refrain from other comment because counsel for the respondent was able to inform us, on instructions, that the government proposes to introduce legislation covering the matter in the next session of Parliament.”"", '15. The applicant was discharged from prison on 11 August 1994. His release was on licence until 12 May 1995.', '16. Guidelines on the use of equipment in police surveillance operations (the Home Office Guidelines of 1984) provide that only chief constables or assistant chief constables are entitled to give authority for the use of such devices. The Guidelines are available in the library of the House of Commons and are disclosed by the Home Office on application.', '17. In each case, the authorising officer should satisfy himself that the following criteria are met: (a) the investigation concerns serious crime; (b) normal methods of investigation must have been tried and failed, or must from the nature of things, be unlikely to succeed if tried; (c) there must be good reason to think that the use of the equipment would be likely to lead to an arrest and a conviction, or where appropriate, to the prevention of acts of terrorism; (d) the use of equipment must be operationally feasible. The authorising officer should also satisfy himself that the degree of intrusion into the privacy of those affected by the surveillance is commensurate with the seriousness of the offence.', '18. The Guidelines also state that there may be circumstances in which material so obtained could appropriately be used in evidence at subsequent court proceedings.', '19. The Police Complaints Authority was created by section 89 of PACE. It is an independent body empowered to receive complaints as to the conduct of police officers. It has powers to refer charges of criminal offences to the Director of Public Prosecutions and itself to bring disciplinary charges.', '20. Section 78(1) of PACE provides as follows:', '“In any proceedings the court may refuse to allow evidence on which the prosecution proposes to rely to be given if it appears to the court that, having regard to all the circumstances, including the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained, the admission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it.”', '21. The 1997 Act provides a statutory basis for the authorisation of police surveillance operations involving interference with property or wireless telegraphy. The relevant sections relating to the authorisation of surveillance operations, including the procedures to be adopted in the authorisation process, entered into force on 22 February 1999.']","['13', '8']",[],[],['6'],['6-1'],[]

The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Novi Sad.', '6. On 24 March 2003 the competent authorities opened a criminal investigation against the applicant on suspicion of abuse of power (“zloupotreba službenog položaja”) and forging of official documents (“falsifikovanje službenih isprava”). On the same day, the applicant was examined by the investigating judge, at which time he submitted a temporary address.', ""7. On 5 May 2003 the police searched the flat owned by the applicant situated at the address of his permanent residence (prebivalište). The applicant's mother, who was present at the search, stated that the applicant had not lived in that flat for over two years. According to the official police report, the police then contacted the applicant by telephone and he informed them that he was looking for a new flat."", ""8. Subsequently, following a request by the Novi Sad District Public Prosecutor's Office (Okružno javno tužilaštvo Novi Sad), on 2 June 2003 the Novi Sad District Court (Okružni sud u Novom Sadu) ordered that the applicant be detained on remand under section 142(2)(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (risk of flight) and that an arrest warrant be issued against him. The applicant appealed against that decision. On 4 June 2003 his lawyer submitted the applicant's new address to the Novi Sad District Court, alleging that he had already done so on 8 May 2003. However, on 23 June 2003 the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal against the detention order."", ""9. On 17 October 2003 the Public Prosecutor's Office indicted the applicant and shortly thereafter, on 11 December 2003, the District Court quashed the detention order against the applicant and set bail at EUR 40,000. The applicant appeared at the court hearing in person. However, the Supreme Court quashed the bail decision and remitted the case. Thereafter, the District Court again ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody because his behaviour thus far had indicated a high risk of flight; the Supreme Court upheld that decision."", ""10. Meanwhile, on 6 February 2004 the applicant was brought before the District Court (investigating) judge (“istražni sudija”), and was remanded in custody. The applicant claimed that he had gone to the police station of his own accord, but the Government disagreed. There appears to have been no official police report on the applicant's arrest. The only document relating to the event of that date – a note made by the investigating judge of the Novi Sad District Court – states as follows:"", '“It is established that the [police] officers... at 10.30 a.m. brought [the applicant] before the... investigating judge of this court... The accused states that at 9 a.m. this morning he voluntarily reported to the Novi Sad police department, because he heard that they were looking for him...”', '11. The applicant requested to be released on bail and offered EUR 50,000. His request was dismissed as insufficient, since “the amount [he had] obtained by unlawful actions was several times higher than the amount offered” and thus provided no guarantee that he would not abscond. His detention was thereafter regularly extended because of such a risk.', ""12. On 9 November 2004 the Novi Sad District Court sentenced the applicant to four and a half years' imprisonment. On 15 June 2005 the Supreme Court quashed that judgment and remitted the case, extending at the same time the applicant's pre-trial detention to prevent his absconding."", '13. The applicant filed several applications for release on bail, but his requests were dismissed.', ""14. In the resumed proceedings, on 18 May 2006 the District Court again found the applicant guilty and sentenced him to three years' imprisonment. However, that judgment was .quashed by the Supreme Court on 6 December 2006 and the applicant's detention was extended."", '15. In early 2007 the applicant requested release from detention on account of inadequate medical care, but his request was dismissed in April 2007.', ""16. In the remitted proceedings, on 14 May 2007 the applicant's counsel objected to an expert opinion submitted to the court. She explained the applicant's health condition in detail, complained about the inadequacy of his medical treatment in detention and stressed that his health had deteriorated to a large extent owing to the duration of his detention."", ""17. In a fresh judgment in the applicant's case delivered on 7 June 2007, the court sentenced the applicant to four years' imprisonment, but decided to release him. However, the applicant was ordered not to leave his habitual place of residence and to report to the District Court each month, failing which he might be returned to custody."", '18. The applicant was examined for the first time on 9 February 2004, shortly after being taken into custody. The medical report concluded that he had been in good health.', '19. During 2004 he was diagnosed with psychiatric problems and was hospitalised on several occasions. In 2005 he suffered from severe back pain and was hospitalised as a result of a hunger strike. In 2006 he was diagnosed with benign breast augmentation. In addition to the public medical care provided, since January 2006 the domestic court had allowed the applicant to have regular consultations with his private doctor.', '20. At the end of 2006 the applicant was diagnosed with Hepatitis C. The testing was organised within the framework of voluntary confidential counselling and testing for HIV and Hepatitis (“Dobrovoljno povjerljivo savjetovalište i testiranje”), which at the material time appears to have been available in prison.', ""21. The applicant claimed that he had been diagnosed already in November 2006, whereas the Government submitted that his diagnosis had been made on 6 December 2006. In his examination of 1 December 2006 the applicant's private doctor made no mention of a Hepatitis C infection."", '22. On 25 January 2007 the applicant went on a hunger strike.', '23. On 8 February 2007 the applicant was examined by his private doctor, who recommended that he be examined by an infectious diseases specialist. That consultation took place on 13 February 2007, when the applicant underwent further blood tests.', ""24. As a result of his hunger strike, on 1 March 2007 the applicant was transferred to the Belgrade Prison Hospital because of a rise in his liver enzymes. However, he refused to be examined by the hospital staff, claiming that he had contracted Hepatitis during his last stay there. On 19 March 2007 the applicant's lawyer requested the court that he be returned to the Novi Sad District Prison, and on 28 March 2007 the authorities acted accordingly. On his release from the Belgrade Prison Hospital, the doctors concluded that there were no traces of starvation and that the applicant suffered from drug abuse."", '25. On his return, he was again examined by the infectious diseases specialist, who on the basis of further blood tests concluded that his liver enzymes had improved and that he should undergo a liver biopsy, which was performed on 23 April 2007. The biopsy established that the applicant suffered from chronic Hepatitis C with minimal activity and minimal fibrosis. In May 2007 samples were sent for additional tests to determine his genotype in order to start anti-viral treatment.', '26. The applicant was released from detention on 7 June 2007, before the genotyping tests were concluded and before he had started receiving treatment for his condition.', '27. Pursuant to a medical report dated January 2008, after the applicant had undergone the appropriate anti-viral treatment, his infection was in remission.', '28.

The applicant was born in 1971. He is currently detained in Moscow, and held in Town Hospital no. 60.', '7. The applicant is a former practicing member of the Moscow Bar. He represented Mr Khodorkovskiy and Mr Lebedev, as one of their lawyers, in criminal proceedings which are now the subject of complaints before the Court (applications nos. 5829/04, 4493/04, 13772/05, 11082/06). He also provided legal services to the oil company Yukos (“the company”) in matters related to that company’s application before this Court (application no. 14902/04). Until 2003 the applicant worked as the head of the legal department of Yukos.', '8. In 2003-2004 the General Prosecutor’s Office opened an investigation into the activities of several of the company’s senior executives, including Mr Khodorkovskiy, Mr Lebedev, Mr L. N., Ms S.B., Mr D.G., Mr B. and others. Some of them were arrested in 2003-2004 on suspicion of having committed large-scale fraud and embezzlement of the shares of several Siberian oil refineries, including Tomskneft PLC. In particular, Ms S.B., one of the company’s lawyers, was arrested. According to the Government, in her statement of 8 December 2004, confirmed in March-April 2006, she testified that the applicant, as her manager, had instructed her in relation to the illegal operations with the Tomskneft PLC shares, qualified by the prosecution authorities as embezzlement.', '9. At the same time the tax authorities sued the company, seeking to recover unpaid corporate taxes. In 2004-2006 the courts delivered several judgments ordering the company to pay considerable tax arrears and considerable penalties. Enforcement proceedings commenced; as a result, a large-scale corporate conflict broke out, opposing the company’s shareholders on one side, and the State, the company’s largest creditor, on the other.', '10. On 8 January 2004 the prosecution opened an investigation into the alleged misappropriation of the shares of several Siberian oil companies by several former senior managers of Yukos. Charges were brought against Mr L.N., who, by that time, had fled Russia, and, sometime afterwards, against several other people. The investigation was pursued in 2005 and 2006.', '11. According to the applicant, in early 2006 investigators from the General Prosecutor’s Office (“the GPO”) started questioning staff members of Yukos and affiliated companies. The questioning sessions were accompanied by threats of criminal prosecution if the staff members cooperated with the senior executives appointed by the then major shareholders of the company. Those threats were also made to the applicant.', '12. On 20 March 2006 the shareholders of Yukos appointed the applicant as executive vicepresident of the company. That appointment was supposed to take effect on 1 April 2006. On 22 March 2006 the applicant was summoned by a GPO investigator and questioned. According to the applicant, during the questioning the investigator warned the applicant to “stay far away” from the company’s business. When he replied that he had no intention of leaving his post at the company, the investigator responded: “This is the first time I have seen a person volunteer to go to prison”.', '13. In the meantime bankruptcy proceedings against the company commenced. On 28 March 2006 the Commercial Court of Moscow imposed a supervision order on the company and appointed an interim receiver. Several days later the applicant, as a vice-president of the company, initiated a reorganisation of its management structure. It appears that the reorganisation was regarded by the receiver and the State authorities as an attempt to hinder the bankruptcy proceedings.', '14. By a judgment of the Commercial Court of Moscow dated 4 August 2006 Yukos was declared bankrupt, and the court replaced the company’s previous management with a bankruptcy trustee. The trustee was appointed with the consent of the State-owned “Rosneft” company – one of the major creditors of Yukos at that time. The judgment was upheld on appeal by decision of the 9th Commercial Court of Appeal of 26 September 2006 and became final. On 12 November 2007 the bankruptcy proceedings were terminated and the company ceased to exist.', '15. On 29 March 2006 the Deputy Prosecutor General requested the Simonovskiy District Court of Moscow to authorise criminal prosecution of the applicant in connection with his alleged participation in the embezzlement of the property and shares of several oil companies and refineries in 1998-1999 (Tomskneft, Achinsk refinery, Eastern Oil Company, etc). The GPO claimed that in 1998-1999, when the applicant had been the head of the legal department of Yukos, he had advised the company’s executives and thus participated in their criminal activities. The shares in these companies had subsequently been “legalised” through a chain of financial operations. In their request the GPO referred to the materials from the criminal case, without, however, identifying them.', '16. On 3 and 5 April 2006 the Simonovskiy District Court in an open hearing, examined the request by the GPO. The applicant was present at both hearings. On 5 April 2006 the case was adjourned. According to the applicant, the court informed the parties that on the next day it would deliver its decision on the prosecution’s request.', '17. On 4 and 5 April 2006 the Simonovskiy District Court, at the GPO’s request, authorised searches in the applicant’s home and country house. In its decision the court summarised the charges against the applicant as forwarded by the prosecution, noted that the applicant was a lawyer and a member of the Moscow Bar, and indicated his de facto and de jure addresses. The court identified the items or information sought as “documents in paper or electronic format, correspondence, drafts and handwritten notes, other documents and objects important for the investigation”. The court gave no reasons for its decision.', '18. On 5 April 2006 the applicant’s premises were searched by the GPO investigators and certain documents were seized. In particular, the GPO searched a flat situated at 7, Bakinskikh Komissarov street, Moscow, and a house situated at 5, Gorki-2 village, in the Moscow Region.', '19. On 6 April 2006 the court declared that the applicant’s involvement with the company’s activities in 1998-1999 contained “elements of a criminal offence”. As follows from the court’s decision, it reached this decision “after having heard the participants of the proceedings, and having examined the material [материал] submitted by the GPO”. Consequently, the court authorised criminal prosecution of the applicant. Unlike his lawyer, the applicant was not present at that hearing.', '20. On the day the applicant was at the flat of an acquaintance, Mr S., a member of Parliament. At about 2 p.m. the police arrived at the flat and rang the doorbell. According to the applicant, he heard the doorbell ringing but did not open the door, since the owner of the flat was absent and he did not have the keys. Having received no reply, the police forced the door, broke into the apartment and arrested the applicant. A few hours later the GPO lodged a request with the Basmanniy District Court of Moscow seeking the applicant’s further detention pending investigation. The prosecution submitted a police report on the applicant’s arrest, attesting that the applicant was arrested not at his permanent place of residence but in another flat, that he had failed to appear before the Simonovskiy District Court and that, according to some unidentified “operative information”, he had intended to leave Russia in order to evade arrest.', '21. On 7 April 2006 the Basmanniy District Court examined the detention request. The applicant and his lawyer were present at the detention hearing. They pleaded that the applicant should not be remanded in custody. The applicant’s arguments may be summarised as follows. The prosecution case against the applicant was very weak and was based on inadmissible evidence. The Simonovskiy District Court had not done its job adequately and had not provided reasons for its conclusions. The applicant had always cooperated with the GPO in the course of the investigation; the investigation had already lasted over two years and the applicant had always gone to the GPO offices when investigators needed to question him. The applicant had not made any attempt to flee from justice or otherwise obstruct the course of the investigation. The applicant was the single parent of a minor child and the only source of support for his elderly parents. Finally, the applicant maintained that his poor health was incompatible with detention.', '22. The prosecution maintained their detention request. They produced to the court a number of procedural documents issued by the prosecution authorities in the course of the investigation, witness statements, copies of electronic documents, financial documents concerning the business activities of several oil companies, etc.', '23. Having examined the parties’ arguments, the court held that the applicant should be remanded in custody. The court held that the request for the applicant’s detention had been lodged by a duly authorised prosecution official and that all the necessary formalities had been complied with. The court also held that if the applicant was dissatisfied with the decision of the Simonovskiy District Court, it was still possible to appeal against it. The court further held as follows:', '“The court takes into account that [the applicant] is charged with having committed criminal offences which are qualified as serious or especially serious and which are punishable by imprisonment of more than two years. The circumstances in which those crimes were committed, information about the applicant’s personality and his occupation [all] give the court enough reasons to conclude that, if he remained at liberty, [the applicant] might abscond from the investigative or judicial bodies, adversely influence the victims, witnesses and other participants in the criminal proceedings, take measures to destroy evidence and objects and documents which are important for the investigation but which have not yet been found by the investigative bodies, might contact his accomplices who are hiding from justice and [thus] obstruct the course of the proceedings, which is confirmed by the results of the search (case file no. 2, pages 127-130) and by the report of the [Ministry of Internal Affairs] to [the GPO] as to information concerning [the applicant’s] plans to leave Russia. The court also takes into account the applicant’s age, family situation and medical condition and the fact that he has a minor child and lives permanently in Moscow.”', '24. As to the applicant’s allegation that the case against him was very weak and based on inadmissible evidence, the court held as follows:', '“... As to the argument of [the applicant and his lawyer] that materials produced [by the prosecution to the court] contain no evidence of [the applicant’s] involvement in the crimes imputed to him, the court cannot take [this argument] into account, since the questions of guilt or innocence, [and] proof ... of [the applicant’s] participation in the crimes are to be decided at the trial on the merits, and [therefore] should not be examined at the present hearing”.', '25. On 10 April 2006 the GPO searched in a house situated at 7, Matveykovo village, in the Moscow Region.', '26. The applicant lodged several appeals: against the decisions of 4 and 5 April (authorising searches), 6 April (authorising criminal prosecution of the applicant) and 7 April 2006 (ordering his detention).', '27. On 17 May 2006 the Moscow City Court dismissed the first appeal and confirmed the decisions of 4 and 5 April 2006. The City Court held that the decisions of the Simonovskiy District Court were sufficiently reasoned and lawful.', '28. On 22 May 2006 the Moscow City Court dismissed the defence’s second appeal and upheld the decision of 6 April 2006. The City Court held, inter alia, that at that stage it was not its task to examine the specific acts with which the applicant was charged or the evidence produced by the parties. Otherwise its work would amount to an examination of the case on its merits. The defence could not therefore rely on alleged violations of domestic or international law.', '29. On 31 May 2006 the Moscow City Court dismissed the appeal against the decision of the Basmanniy City Court of 7 April 2006.', '30. On an unspecified date, in addition to the previous charges, the applicant was charged with personal income tax evasion allegedly committed in 2000 – 2002.', '31. On 2 June 2006 the Basmanniy District Court, at the request of the prosecution, extended the applicant’s detention until 2 September 2006.', '32. At the hearing the GPO claimed that they needed to perform a number of additional investigative actions, namely, to obtain expert reports, to obtain replies to the court’s rogatory letters and to obtain decisions on the extradition of Mr L. N. and Mr D. G. to Russia. Further, the GPO had to “question witnesses, seize documents in ... organisations, banks, tax inspectorates and, based on the evidence thus collected, bring new charges against [the applicant] and perform other investigative actions aimed at completing the preliminary investigation”.', '33. The parties’ arguments before the court were broadly similar to their previous position. The prosecution emphasised that the applicant’s accomplices had fled from justice. The applicant, in turn, provided the court with more detailed information on his state of health. Further, he claimed that while in detention he had never been questioned in connection with his case.', '34. The court concluded that the applicant’s situation had not changed, and that therefore there was no reason to apply a measure of restraint milder than detention. As to the applicant’s state of health, the court noted that despite information about the applicant’s diseases, there was no evidence that his medical condition was incompatible with detention. The court also held that it was not competent to examine evidence against the applicant and the legal qualification given by the prosecution to the facts of the case.', '35. The applicant’s lawyers appealed against that decision. They submitted to the court of appeal additional documents concerning the applicant’s state of health. They also complained that the District Court had not examined the possibility of applying a milder measure of restraint. On 19 July 2006 the Moscow City Court dismissed their arguments and upheld the decision of 2 June 2006.', '36. On 23 August 2006 the GPO requested an extension of the applicant’s detention on remand. The prosecution referred to a document seized in 2004 in the office of Mr D. G., one of the former legal advisers of Yukos, from which it followed that the Yukos management planned to put pressure on the law-enforcement bodies through political channels. They also referred to information received as a result of the operational and search activities, which showed that the applicant had tried to contact other co-defendants who were hiding abroad.', '37. At the hearing the applicant opposed that request, repeating his earlier arguments. Thus, the applicant claimed that the GPO’s allegations that he would abscond or interfere with the course of justice were not based on any facts. Finally, the applicant alleged that he should not be detained because of his poor health.', '38. The applicant’s defence also claimed that his initial arrest had been unlawful. The decision of the Simonovskiy District Court of 6 April 2006, authorising criminal prosecution of the applicant, became final only on 22 May 2006. Before that date the GPO had no power to perform any investigative actions in his respect, let alone to arrest him.', '39. The court noted that the case under investigation was quite complex and that the applicant’s detention on remand should therefore be extended. The court also repeated the wording of the first two detention orders justifying detention. To the previous reasoning the court added that there was a risk that the applicant might continue his criminal activities. It also referred to the information received by the prosecution as a result of the operational and search activities. As to the lawfulness of the initial detention order, the court noted that, since the decision of 7 April 2006 had been confirmed by the court of appeal, the applicant’s detention was lawful. The court held that the argument of the defence about the lack of evidence of crime should not be examined within the detention proceedings. As a result, the applicant’s detention was extended anew, until 2 December 2006.', '40. The defence appealed, claiming, inter alia, that the continued detention of the applicant amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment. On 9 October 2006 the Moscow City Court dismissed the appeal.', '41. On 23 November 2006 the court extended the applicant’s detention until 2 March 2007. The court again examined the arguments of the parties, “materials” produced by the prosecution and the applicant’s arguments in favour of his release. In addition to the previously stated reasons the court referred to the risk of collusion with Mr L. N., Mr D.G., Mr B., all of whom had left Russia. The court also referred to the fact that on 6 April 2006 the applicant had not attended the hearing at which the court had read out its decision authorising criminal prosecution against him. The court also referred to the fact that the applicant had not been arrested in his usual place of residence and that he did not open the door when the police officers arrived to arrest him. In addition, the court referred to an electronic document seized in 2004 in the office of Mr D. G., entitled “Summary analysis of the criminal-law aspects of the activities of senior managers and shareholders of the Menatep-Rosprom-Yukos group”. That document, according to the court, described various measures which the shareholders and senior managers of Yukos were preparing to undertake in order to apply pressure, through their connections in the political milieu, on law-enforcement officials, by bribing them, through fictitious claims and complaints, by organising a denigration campaign in the mass-media, etc. The court finally referred to the “operational information” provided by the prosecution authorities which showed the applicant’s intent to establish contact with other suspects who had fled Russia.', '42. On 12 December 2006 the investigation was completed. On 20 December 2006 the applicant obtained a copy of the investigation file, which contained 113 volumes.', '43. On 21 February 2007 the applicant’s detention on remand was extended at the request of the prosecution. The prosecution noted that due to the applicant’s poor eyesight the examination of the materials of the case was taking a long time. They claimed that the applicant had connections in Russia and abroad, that he could flee from justice, put pressure on witnesses and otherwise obstruct the investigation. The court decided to keep the applicant in remand, referring to the applicant’s character, the danger of absconding, the risk of collusion with other former senior executives of Yukos, and to the factual circumstances referred to in the prosecutor’s request. As to the applicant’s state of health, the court decided, on the basis of the applicant’s medical file, that it was not incompatible with his participation in the criminal proceedings.', '44. On 8 August 2007 the applicant’s detention on remand was extended until 2 December 2007, up to 19 months and 27 days in aggregate. The reasons given for that extension repeated the reasons relied on in the previous detention orders. The defence asked the court to summon and question the applicant’s doctors from the Moscow AIDS Centre. However, that motion by the defence was refused by the court, which referred to the certificates from the prison hospital by which the applicant was declared fit to support criminal proceedings and to stand trial.', '45. On 15 November 2007 the applicant’s detention was extended until 2 March 2008. The court analysed, inter alia, the applicant’s medical situation. It established that the applicant had refused to take prescribed treatment in the conditions of the remand prison hospital. However, the applicant did not show that the HAART treatment could not be administered within the remand prison hospital.', '46. On 19 December 2007 the Basmanniy District Court of Moscow ruled that the defence should finish the reading of the case file by 15 January 2008. In the ruling the court noted that due to the applicant’s poor eyesight he had been unable to read the documents himself, and that the investigator in charge of his case had been reading the case file aloud to the applicant.', '47. Upon his arrest on 6 April 2006 the applicant was examined by prison doctors at remand prison 99/1 of Moscow. They established, inter alia, that the applicant had serious sight problems; he had floaters in the right eye (which he himself describes as “effective blindness”) and overall impairment of visual acuity.', '48. According to the Government, the applicant was given an opportunity to have a blood test in the laboratory but he refused for religious reasons.', '49. The applicant claims that after several months spent in the remand prison his eyesight had deteriorated to the extent that the investigator in charge of his case had to read to him the materials of the case file. The applicant also developed photophobia.', '50. On 15 September 2006 the applicant was found for the first time to be HIV-positive. The applicant’s illness was qualified as being of the “third degree” of gravity. Later it was re-qualified to “fourth degree”. The doctors concluded that the applicant could be held in the remand prison without unfavourable development of the HIV infection provided he received regular check-ups in a specialist [Aids] institution, including medical monitoring of his health and timely application of specialised therapy.', '51. Over the following months medical examinations showed a further deterioration in his medical condition as a result of the HIV infection. From the applicant’s medical record it follows that he received medicine from his relatives and had consulted with the prison doctor.', '52. In November 2006, at the investigator’s request, the applicant’s medical file was examined by a group of specialist doctors. In a report completed on 22 November 2006 the doctors concluded that the applicant was fit to be detained and to participate in the investigative activities. At the same time the doctors noted that the applicant’s condition was worsening, and recommended HAART (Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy) treatment and regular monitoring of his health in a specialised medical institution (every 12 weeks, or more often if necessary). The doctors also concluded that the applicant’s right eye was completely blind and that the eyesight of his left eye was seriously impaired (high-level myopia and complex astigmatism). However, the doctors declared themselves incompetent to decide whether the applicant’s illnesses could be treated in the conditions of the remand prison (point 4 of the report).', '53. According to the Government, the prison hospital had all the necessary medication. In addition, in 2007–2008 the applicant received eight parcels with medicine from his relatives. As to the HAART medication, it could have been obtained by the applicant’s relatives in a specialised pharmacy in Moscow, on the presentation of a prescription issued by the Moscow AIDS Centre. In support of their submissions, the Government referred to letters signed by Mr Tagiev, the head of the remand prison, and sent to the Court in 2008.', '54. The Government produced further written depositions by two former cell-mates of the applicant. They were addressed to the remand prison administration. The first deposition, dated 30 January 2008, was signed by Mr Semin, the second, dated 31 January 2008, was signed by Mr Remidov. Mr Semin was detained with the applicant in April 2007. He testified that the conditions of detention were satisfactory, and that “the applicant had received medical assistance in full, both from the remand prison hospital and his relatives”. Mr Remidov was detained with the applicant from the end of September until November 2007. He repeated the account given by Mr Semin. He added that on several occasions the applicant was taken for examination to external medical institutions.', '55. The Government produced a copy of the applicant’s medical file. From that file it follows that the applicant received medicines from his relatives and from the prison pharmacy. The medicines mentioned in the medical file included aspirin, antibacterial and antiviral drugs (“Biceptol” and “Cyclovir”), locally acting anti-inflammatory drugs (“Tantum Verde”), anti-allergic drugs (“Suprastin”), activated charcoal, immunostimulating drugs (“Imudon”), nootropic substances, etc. Most of them were received from the applicant’s relatives.', '56. As follows from the medical file, in the first half of 2007 the applicant did not refuse treatment or examination by the prison doctors. On 15 March 2007 the applicant was taken to the Moscow AIDS Centre for examination. The entry of 15 June 2007 attests that the applicant refused to accept an injection before having consulted his lawyer.', '57. In July 2007 the applicant developed severe headaches and pharyngalgia. On 2 and 3 July 2007 he asked the investigator for referral to the Moscow AIDS Centre for examination and treatment. He also complained that medical checks had been carried out only sporadically and that he had not received the previously prescribed treatment. In his reply of 3 July 2007 the investigator informed the applicant that medical aid to detainees was within the competence of the prison authorities, and that his request had been transmitted to them.', '58. On 10 July 2007 the applicant was placed in the Moscow AIDS Centre for a new medical examination. The applicant was informed of the possible side effects of the HAART treatment; he signed a paper in which he expressly accepted the treatment. That paper informed the applicant, inter alia, that the treatment was not capable of curing his disease completely and that it could have side-effects, of which the applicant had been informed. That written waiver also contained the names of the medicines prescribed to the applicant: the entry of 10 July 2007 in the applicant’s medical file attests that the applicant had agreed to undergo anti-retroviral therapy.', '59. According to the Government, after 10 July 2007, when the applicant signed an information notice and accepted HAART treatment in writing, he refused that treatment, insisting that it should be administered in the specialised hospital itself and not in the remand prison hospital. The Government referred to a report signed by the deputy head of the prison hospital, a doctor from that hospital and a paramedic, in which they certified that the applicant had refused HAART treatment.', '60. The applicant’s medical file, produced by the Government, contains three entries related to July and August 2007, attesting that the applicant refused to undergo treatment or examination by prison medical staff (the first entry was dated 15 July 2007).', '61. The applicant maintained that the medication prescribed within the HAART treatment had not been made available to him, despite his requests. In support he referred to the letter from the investigator, dated 26 July 2007, in which the investigator had mentioned that the applicant had asked him to start the HAART treatment. The applicant maintained that on 8 August 2007 a paramedic from the prison hospital, while conducting his evening rounds, had offered him boxes which apparently contained some medicine. The paramedic did not tell the applicant what was in those boxes. The applicant, who was almost completely blind, refused to take them, because he did not know about any new treatment being prescribed.', '62. In September the applicant complained to the investigator that he did not receive medical examination and treatment. On 12 September 2007 the investigator forwarded his letter to the prison authorities, requesting that the applicant be transferred to the Moscow AIDS Centre for medical examinations. In his letter the investigator asked the prison authorities “to secure timely medical examination of the applicant and his treatment, including the HAART treatment recommended by the forensic report”.', '63. From September 2007 the applicant suffered from a swinging fever of between 36 and 39o C, lost over 10 per cent of his body weight and was anaemic. In addition, he developed a number of opportunistic diseases. Thus, he contracted shingles and developed stomatitis, with evidence of oral candidiasis and associated dysphagia. There was evidence of marked neurological problems, with encephalopathy, poly-neuropathy, optic atrophy and corneal dystrophy. His eyeballs were sunken and he had chronic blepharitis. Further investigation apparently indicated persistent liver lesions with evidence of chronic cholecystitis, and other diseases.', '64. On 18 September 2007 the applicant was taken to the Moscow AIDS Centre for consultation. On 16 October 2007 the applicant underwent yet another medical examination, which revealed a dramatic deterioration in his condition as a result of the HIV infection. On 23 October 2007 he was examined in the Moscow AIDS Centre anew. A report by Dr Galina and Dr Oskina concluded that the applicant was suffering from Aids (3rd (4th) stage “B”). The applicant’s condition was described as “moderately severe (unsatisfactory)”. The report also recommended that the applicant undergo in-patient examination and treatment in the Moscow AIDS Centre.', '65. The defence contacted Dr David A. Hawkins, a British expert on Aids and Consultant Physician at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London. Having examined the applicant’s medical record, Dr Hawkins concluded as follows:', '“It is my opinion that [the applicant’s] medical condition is such that there is imminent threat to his life should he remain untreated both in respect of the opportunistic infections, and the HIV infection itself. There is also a major imminent risk of irreparable damage to his health should these treatments not be initiated straight away.', 'Were [the applicant] to be imprisoned in the UK, he would undoubtedly be released on compassionate grounds or at least transferred to a specialist hospital until his condition ha[d] been diagnosed, treated and stabilised. It is of great concern that his numerous serious and indeed life- (and sight-) threatening problems have not been urgently addressed.”', '66. On 24 September 2007 the prison authorities informed the applicant’s lawyers that they had obtained the necessary prescriptions from the doctors of the Moscow AIDS Centre, and that the applicant’s relatives could purchase the necessary medicines for him. According to the prison authorities, however, the applicant was able to take these drugs in the remand prison and did not require transfer to an outside hospital for in-patient treatment.', '67. On 26 October 2007 the applicant was transferred from remand prison 99/1 to the hospital of remand prison 77/1.', '68. Following the results of the medical examination the defence submitted an application for release to the GPO investigator.', '69. On 29 October 2007 the investigator decided that, due to the critical state of the applicant’s health, he should be released on bail. However, the applicant was not released; instead, on 31 October 2007 the investigator brought a motion before the Basmanniy District Court, seeking to obtain the authorisation of the applicant’s release on bail. The amount of bail requested by the prosecution was 2,500,000 Russian Roubles. In the application for release the investigator stated, inter alia, that the applicant’s diseases could not be treated in the conditions of the remand prison.', '70. On 2 November 2007 the Basmanniy District Court of Moscow examined the investigator’s request. According to the applicant, at the hearing a GPO representative opposed the applicant’s release.', '71. The court decided that it was not competent to deal with the matter. The court also noted that, under the Code of Criminal Procedure, it was the investigator in charge of the case who was competent to order a suspect’s release on bail.', '72. On 9 November 2007 the investigator took a new decision, this time dismissing the application for release. The investigator noted that it was for the detention centre’s administration to decide whether the applicant should be treated in a civil hospital. The investigator further stated that, according to information received from the detention centre’s medical facility, the applicant had refused the treatment proposed by the doctors working there. The investigator also took into account the decision of the Basmanniy District Court of 2 November 2007, dismissing the application for release. The investigator concluded that he was not competent to decide whether the applicant should be transferred to a specialised medical institution. The defence appealed, but to no avail.', '73. On 15 November 2007 the court extended the applicant’s detention on remand. With regard to the applicant’s state of health, it referred to the certificate delivered by the prison hospital, which attested that the applicant had been fit for detention and could participate in the criminal proceedings. It also attested that the applicant had refused to be examined by the doctors of the prison hospital and had refused to take the HAART treatment prescribed to him. The court also referred to the conclusions of the “complex forensic medical examination of the applicant”. It appears that the court was referring to the examination carried out in 2006 (see paragraph 52 above).', '74. The entries of October-December 2007 in the applicant’s medical file attest that on several occasions the applicant refused to undergo medical examination in the prison hospital. However, there is no information about the treatment the applicant received, or was offered. As follows from the entry of 28 November 2007, the applicant refused to undergo examination and treatment “in the conditions of the infectious diseases department of the prison hospital”. The entry of 19 December 2007 attests that the applicant insisted on treatment in the Moscow AIDS Centre. The above entries were certified by the signatures of the medical personnel on duty.', '75. On 26 November 2007 the applicant’s lawyer requested the Court to apply interim measures under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court. He complained that, although the applicant had been recognised as unfit for detention, the court and then the investigator had refused to examine his application for release and to grant bail.', '76. On 27 November 2007 the President of the Section to which the case has been allocated decided to indicate to the Government of Russia, under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, interim measures which consisted of the following. The Government was invited to secure immediately, by appropriate means, the in-patient treatment of the applicant in a hospital specialised in the treatment of Aids and concomitant diseases. The Government were further requested to submit a copy of the applicant’s medical file by 5 December 2007.', '77. According to the applicant, on the same day (that is, on 27 November 2007) the GPO investigator Ms R., in the presence of the applicant’s lawyer, put pressure on him to make a false confession and give false testimony against other persons, in exchange for release for medical treatment.', '78. On 4 December 2007 the Government informed the Court that the interim measure had not been yet implemented since “it required additional time”.', '79. On 20 December 2007 the applicant underwent yet another examination in the Moscow AIDS Centre, with participation of the doctors from the remand prison hospital. Their report stated that the applicant “continued to refuse anti-retroviral medicine”. One of the recommendations made by the doctors was “to commence HAART treatment on receipt of the results of the blood tests conducted on 20 December 2007”.', '80. On 21 December 2007 the Court indicated to the Government an additional interim measure, confirming, at the same time, the validity of the previous one (the transfer of the applicant to a specialised institution). The Government were invited to form a medical commission, to be composed on a bipartisan basis, to diagnose the applicant’s health problems and suggest treatment. The commission was also to be charged with deciding whether the applicant’s medical conditions could be adequately treated in the medical facility of the detention centre. The Government was invited to report on the implementation of this additional measure by 27 December 2007.', '81. On 25 December 2007 the applicant’s representative contacted the Russian Government. He submitted a list of doctors who should be included in the medical commission on behalf of the applicant.', '82. On 27 December 2007 the Government replied that the applicant could receive adequate medical treatment in the medical facility of the detention centre, and that his examination by a mixed medical commission was against Russian law.', '83. The letter of 23 January 2008, signed by Mr Plyusov, the deputy head of the medical service of the penitentiary system, attested that on 21 December 2007 the applicant consulted with a number of doctors, gave saliva samples for TB-analysis, underwent a blood test and an X-ray test, and underwent a biopsy of the lymph nodes.', '84. The Government produced several reports by prison doctors in which they attested that the applicant refused to be seen by a doctor and to undergo tests. These include two reports dated 8 and 9 August 2007, in which several prison officials attested that the applicant “refused to take medicine that forms part of the treatment prescribed by the Moscow AIDS Centre”.', '85. On 21 January 2008 a group of doctors from the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital examined the applicant’s medical records at the request of his lawyers. The doctors concluded as follows:', '“[The applicant] can only be properly managed within an Aids specialist hospital and, whatever the reasons for his incarceration, this should be made available to him on compassionate grounds. He remains desperately ill and at imminent risk of dying”.', '86. On 22 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the most recent extension of his detention. During the hearing the applicant remained in the prison hospital; however, he was able to communicate with the judges through a video-conference system. At that hearing he stated that on 28 December 2006 he had been taken to the building of the Prosecutor General’s Office, where he had met Mr Karimov, the investigator in charge of the cases of Mr Khodorkovskiy and Mr Lebedev. Mr Karimov had offered him a deal: if he testified against Mr Khodorkovskiy and Mr Lebedev he would be released. Mr Karimov had allegedly told the applicant that the General Prosecutor’s Office had been aware of his health situation, and that it would be advisable for the applicant to receive appropriate treatment, perhaps in a foreign hospital. In April 2007 Mr Khatypov, investigator in the applicant’s case, told his defense attorney, Ms Lvova, that if the applicant admitted his guilt and agreed to cooperate, then he would be released. The applicant maintained that he received the same offer on 27 November 2008 from Ms Rusanova, another investigator working with Mr Karimov.', '87. On 30 January 2008 preliminary hearings in the applicant’s trial commenced.', '88. On 31 January 2008 doctors diagnosed the applicant with Aids-related lymphoma.', '89. On 4 February 2008 the applicant underwent yet another medical examination by a team of doctors consisting of Ms Ivanova, the head of the Moscow City Haematological Centre, and two doctors - Mr Markaryan and Ms Lazareva. They concluded that, in addition to Aids, the applicant suffered from T-cell lymphoma. They recommended that the applicant should undergo in-patient treatment (polychemotherapy combined with anti-retroviral therapy) in a haematologic hospital.', '90. On the same day the applicant was examined by Dr Yurin and Dr Frolova. They recommended that he undergo anti-TB treatment and that the applicant’s tolerance to certain components of the anti-retroviral therapy be examined, in order to develop a plan of anti-retroviral treatment. Their report did not contain any recommendations on the applicant’s further detention.', '91. On 6 February 2008 the Simonovskiy District Court suspended the trial in the applicant’s case. The court concluded that the applicant’s poor health prevented him from participating in the proceedings.', '92. The court also examined an application for release lodged by the defence. The prosecution maintained that, if released, the applicant might interfere with the normal course of the proceedings. The court accepted this argument by the prosecution. It ruled as follows:', '“At present [the applicant] is charged with serious crimes; if released, he may thwart the establishment of truth in the case [and] influence other participants in the proceedings. Therefore, the grounds on which the measure of restraint was applied [have] not changed.”', '93. The court further held that the applicant had been receiving adequate medical treatment in the remand prison hospital. The court referred to the fact that the applicant had been examined by several leading specialist doctors, including Ms Ivanova, the head of the haematological clinic, Mr Yurin, deputy director of the Federal Centre for Aids prevention, and Ms Frolova, director of the Federal Anti-Tuberculosis Centre. The court concluded that:', '“The applicant will receive full treatment in accordance with the recommendations of the doctors, which does not require changing the measure of restraint”', '94. On 8 February 2008 the applicant was placed in Town Hospital no. 60, in pursuance of the recommendations of 4 February 2008. In the hospital the applicant was guarded round-the-clock by policemen; the windows of his room were covered with an iron grill.', '95. On 9 February 2008 the applicant was again examined by the specialists of the Moscow AIDS Centre. He received medicine to commence the HAART treatment. However, the day after taking that medication his condition deteriorated, he was placed on an intravenous drip and the therapy was discontinued. On 11 February 2008 the doctors amended their recommendations and a new HAART regimen was prescribed and administered.', '96. On 12 February 2008 the applicant was further diagnosed with an ulcer in his oesophagus.', '97. According to the applicant, while in hospital, he was almost always handcuffed to his bed, and was released only to use the toilet or take a shower. The applicant was able to meet with his lawyer for the first time on 16 February 2008. According to Mr Tagiev’s letter of 26 May 2008, handcuffs were applied to the applicant between 8 and 18 February 2008, on the ground that the applicant was likely to abscond. The handcuffs were removed every two hours in order to restore normal blood circulation.', '98. On 2 March 2008 the term of the applicant’s detention expired. He lodged an application for release.', '99. The applicant produced a report by Dr Vorobyev, Director of the Haematological Centre in Moscow, dated 3 March 2008. Dr Vorobyev, after examining the applicant’s medical file, concluded that the applicant’s lymphoma belonged to the category of cancerous neoplasm of lymphatic tissues, and that the applicant needed to undergo 4 months of polychemotherapy with subsequent adjustment of the regimen. He stressed that chemotherapy should be conducted in a sterile environment.', '100. On 22 May 2008 the applicant’s representative informed the Court that the applicant was suffering from severe allergic reactions to the HAART treatment and that his condition was not sufficiently stable to commence the necessary polychemotherapy for his Aids-related lymphoma.', '101. At the moment the applicant remains in Town Hospital no. 60, where he is undergoing medical treatment. His detention on remand has been extended until January 2009.', '102. Under Article 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (“the Code” or “CCrP”), the police may arrest a person suspected of having committed an offence punishable by imprisonment if the person is caught in the act or immediately after committing the offence. No judicial authorisation of the arrest is required.', '103. “Preventive measures” or “measures of restraint” (меры пресечения) include an undertaking not to leave a town or region, personal surety, bail and detention on remand (Article 98). If necessary, the suspect or accused may be asked to give an undertaking to appear (обязательство о явке) (Article 112). Pursuant to Article 94, within forty-eight hours of the time of arrest a suspect must be released if a measure of restraint in the form of custody has not been imposed on him or her, or if a final decision has not been deferred by a court under Article 108 (paragraph 6, subparagraph 3) of the Code. When imposition of custody as a measure of restraint is deemed to be necessary, an application must be lodged to that effect with a district court by a prosecutor or by an investigator or inquiry officer with the consent of a prosecutor.', '104. Pursuant to Article 108, taking into custody as a measure of restraint is to be imposed by a court decision on a person accused or suspected of having committed an offence punishable under criminal law by imprisonment for a term exceeding two years, if it is impossible to use a different, milder measure of restraint.', '105. If a judge’s ruling to take the suspect into custody as a measure of restraint or to extend the custody period does not arrive within forty-eight hours from the moment of the arrest, the suspect must be released immediately, and the head of the custody facility in which the suspect is held must notify the inquiry agency or the investigator in charge of the proceedings in the criminal case and the prosecutor about such release. If a court finding or ruling exists that denies an investigator’s application to order a measure of restraint in the form of custody, a copy of that ruling must be provided to the suspect when he is released.', '106. Under Article 97, a court is empowered to impose a measure of restraint (that is, custody) on a suspect, provided that there are sufficient reasons to believe that the suspect (1) might abscond during the inquiry, pre-trial investigation or trial; (2) might continue to engage in criminal activities; or (3) might threaten a witness or other participants in the criminal proceedings, destroy evidence or otherwise obstruct the preliminary investigation or trial of the criminal case.', '107. Under Article 98, the circumstances to be taken into account when imposing a measure of restraint include, apart from those specified in Article 97 of the Code, the seriousness of the charges brought and the defendant’s personality, age, health, family status, occupation and other circumstances. The judge’s ruling is to be forwarded to the person who has lodged the application, the prosecutor, and the defendant (suspect), for immediate execution. Under Article 108, a second application for a person to be taken into custody in the same criminal case after one such application has been denied by a judge’s ruling may be lodged with a court only if new circumstances emerge which justify the need to take the person into custody. A judge’s ruling on whether to take a person into custody may be appealed against to a higher court within three days from the date on which the ruling was given. A judge of the appellate court (кассационная инстанция) must give a decision on such complaint or representation within three days from the date of its receipt.', '108. Pursuant to Article 447 of the Criminal Procedure Code, a special procedure is to be applied in criminal cases with respect to MPs, judges, prosecutors, lawyers (адвокат), etc. Under Article 448, a prosecutor takes the decision to initiate criminal proceedings against a lawyer. Such a decision is subject to approval by a judge. Article 449 prohibits the arrest of MPs, judges, prosecutors and certain other categories of State officials, unless they have been caught at the scene of the crime. However, lawyers are not immune from “arrest”.', '109. Under Article 450 § 5, if there was no court decision authorising the criminal prosecution of a lawyer, the court should give its authorisation for investigative measures to be taken in respect of the lawyer.', '110. On 14 December 2004 the Constitutional Court of Russia gave a constitutional interpretation of Article 448 (Ruling no. 384-O) of the CCrP insofar as it concerned MPs. It held, inter alia, that before authorising criminal prosecution of an MP the courts are supposed to “check the sufficiency of information produced by the prosecution indicating that a crime has been committed” (point 1 of the operative part of the Ruling).', '111. On 16 August 1994 the Ministry of Health adopted Decree no. 170 establishing a country-wide network of Aids control centres, and giving the doctors practical recommendations and information on the diagnosis and treatment of Aids. It also proposed a classification of different stages of Aids: (1) incubation stage; (2) stage of primary manifestations; (3) stage of secondary manifestations; and (4) terminal stage. Each stage is divided into sub-groups (A, B, etc.). Point 2.4 of the Decree stipulates that in the event of deterioration in the state of health of an HIV-positive patient, in particular, where secondary and opportunistic diseases appear, he or she should be placed in a hospital. The Decree stipulates that HIV-positive patients should be treated in specialised hospitals or specialised departments of general hospitals; however, “when no specialised hospitals are available, it is advisable to use infectious diseases hospitals”.', '112. On 6 February 2004 the Government of the Russian Federation adopted Decree no. 54 establishing a list of diseases incompatible with serving a prison sentence. That list included malignant tumours (cancer) of lymph- and hematopoietic tissues, myeloproliferative tumours (point 7 of the decree), a manifest decrease in eye acuity as a result of permanent pathological changes (the eye acuity in the better eye should be inferior to 0.05 and not amenable to correction with lenses), diseases caused by HIV at the deuteropathy stage (secondary diseases), in the form of generalised infection, cancer or affliction of the central nervous system.', '113. The European Prison Rules stipulate that prisoners should be transferred to specialist hospitals where treatment is not available in prison (Rule 46.1, Recommendation Rec. (2006)2 of the Committee of Ministers to member states). Recommendation no. R (93) 6 of the Committee of Ministers to member States concerning prison and criminological aspects of the control of transmissible diseases, including Aids and related health problems in prison provides, inter alia, that prisoners with terminal HIV disease should be granted early release, in so far as possible, and given proper treatment outside the prison.', '114. The UN International Guidelines on HIV/Aids and Human Rights, under the heading “Freedom from Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment” state that denial to prisoners of access to HIV-related health care can constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, whereas prisoners suffering from Aids (as opposed to “mere” infection with HIV) should be considered for early release and given proper treatment outside prison.', '115. The relevant extracts from the 3rd General Report [CPT/Inf (93) 12] by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“the CPT”) read as follows:', '38. A prison health care service should be able to provide medical treatment and nursing care, as well as appropriate diets, physiotherapy, rehabilitation or any other necessary special facility, in conditions comparable to those enjoyed by patients in the outside community. Provision in terms of medical, nursing and technical staff, as well as premises, installations and equipment, should be geared accordingly.', 'There should be appropriate supervision of the pharmacy and of the distribution of medicines. Further, the preparation of medicines should always be entrusted to qualified staff (pharmacist/nurse, etc.).', '39. A medical file should be compiled for each patient, containing diagnostic information as well as an ongoing record of the patient’s evolution and of any special examinations he has undergone. In the event of a transfer, the file should be forwarded to the doctors in the receiving establishment.', 'Further, daily registers should be kept by health care teams, in which particular incidents relating to the patients should be mentioned. Such registers are useful in that they provide an overall view of the health care situation in the prison, at the same time as highlighting specific problems which may arise.', '40. The smooth operation of a health care service presupposes that doctors and nursing staff are able to meet regularly and to form a working team under the authority of a senior doctor in charge of the service.”']","['34', '5', '8']",['5-3'],[],['3'],[],[]

The applicant was born in 1959 and, at the time of the latest information from him, lived in Burgas.', '6. In 1993 the applicant became the chairman of the board of a credit and savings cooperative (popular bank) – Popular BankPekov – having its registered office in Burgas.', '7. In 1994 the applicant became the chairman of the board of the Union of the Popular Banks, having its registered office in Burgas.', '8. On an unspecified date in mid-1995 criminal proceedings were opened against the applicant in relation with his duties as chairman of the board of Popular BankPekov.', '9. On 15 August 1995 the investigation authorities requested the Nesebar District Court to attach certain assets belonging to the applicant and to Popular BankPekov, with a view to securing their forfeiture in the event the applicant was convicted. In a decision of 21 August 1995 the Nesebar District Court allowed that request.', '10. On 25 August 1995 an investigator at the Burgas Regional Investigation Service attached further property belonging to Popular Bank-Pekov.', '11. On 29 August 1995 the applicant was charged with having engaged in banking business without the requisite licence, contrary to Article 252 § 2 of the Criminal Code (“the CC”).', '12. On 3 January 1996 new charges were preferred against the applicant. It was alleged that he had misappropriated 65,000,000 old Bulgarian levs (BGL) from the deposits made in Popular BankPekov, contrary to Article 203 § 1 of the CC.', '13. It seems that witnesses were questioned on 4 January, 30 and 31 July, 17 and 23 September, 17 and 22 October, 4 November, and 6, 9, 10 and 15 December 1996, 14 and 18 January, 20 and 28 February, 20 March, and 4 and 7 August 1997. On an unspecified date an accounting expert report was drawn up.', '14. On 4 February 1998 the applicant was charged anew under Articles 202 § 2, 219 § 1, 252 § 2 and 282 § 2 of the CC.', '15. On 7 July 1998 the Burgas Regional Prosecutor’s Office decided to drop the charges under Articles 203 § 1 and 219 § 1 of the CC. On 15 December 1998 its decision was quashed by the Burgas Appellate Prosecutor’s Office insofar as it concerned the charges under Article 219 § 1 of the CC, and upheld, insofar as it concerned the charges under Article 203 § 1 of the CC.', '16. On 10 July 2001 the applicant was charged anew under Articles 201, 202 §§ 1 and 2, 219 § 1, 252 §§ 1 and 2, and 282 § 2 of the CC.', '17. On 18 December 2001 the charges against the applicant were amended once again to include counts under Articles 201, 202 §§ 1 and 2, 219 § 1, 252 §§ 1 and 2, and 282 § 2 of the CC.', '18. On 3 July 2003 the applicant was charged anew under Articles 202 § 2, 219 § 4, 252 § 2 and 282 § 2 of the CC.', '19. On 8 July 2003 the Burgas Regional Prosecutor’s Office submitted an indictment against the applicant to the Burgas Regional Court.', '20. The first hearing, listed for 27 October 2003, was adjourned at the request of the applicant, who presented a doctor’s note to the effect that he was ill and could not attend, and argued that the copy of the indictment which had been sent to him had pages missing. Another reason for the adjournment was that most of the prosecution’s witnesses did not show up.', '21. A hearing scheduled for 12 January 2004 was adjourned by reason of the failure of a number of witnesses to show up. The court ordered a new accounting expert report to be drawn up by three experts.', '22. A hearing planned for 5 April 2004 could not take place because the accounting expert report had not yet been drawn up and a number of witnesses were absent. The court fined some of the missing witnesses and ordered that they be brought by force to the next hearing.', '23. At the next hearing, which took place on 12, 13 and 14 July 2004, the applicant requested that the case be remitted for the correction of alleged procedural mistakes made during the preliminary investigation. His request was denied. The court heard the applicant and approximately fifteen witnesses. However, as a number of other witnesses were absent, the court adjourned the case. It gave leave to the parties to ask the experts additional questions.', '24. A hearing took place on 15 November 2004. The court heard several witnesses, but as a number of others were absent, it adjourned the case.', '25. A hearing listed for 7 February 2005 was adjourned at the request of the applicant, who presented a doctor’s note to the effect that he was ill and could not attend.', '26. A hearing took place on 25 April 2005. The court heard several witnesses. The prosecution stated that certain amounts allegedly misappropriated and squandered by the applicant had been wrongly noted down in the indictment by reason of an error in the calculations. In reply the applicant submitted that the correction of the mistakes in the indictment constituted an amendment of the charges against him and requested an adjournment in order to prepare his defence. The court agreed and adjourned the case to 27 April 2005.', '27. On 27 April 2005 the court heard one witness and adjourned the case at the request of the applicant, holding that in view of the large volume of written evidence, he should be given more time to prepare his defence after the amendment of the charges, even though this amendment consisted only in the correction of an error in the amounts noted down in the indictment.', '28. At the time of the latest information from the parties (10 May 2005) the criminal proceedings against the applicant were still pending before the Burgas Regional Court; a hearing had been listed for 20 June 2005.', '29. On 29 August 1995, when the applicant was first charged, the investigator dealing with his case ordered him to pay bail in the amount of BGL 500,000. The applicant appealed to the Burgas District Prosecutor’s Office, stating that this sum was too high and he could not pay it. In a decision of 11 September 1995 the Burgas District Prosecutor’s Office dismissed his appeal, reasoning that he owned sufficient assets and that the amount was justified in view of the gravity of the offence alleged against him. On the appeals of the applicant that decision was upheld by the Burgas Regional Prosecutor’s Office, but later, on 28 November 1995, varied by the Chief Prosecutor’s Office, which reduced the bail amount to BGL 250,000.', '30. On 3 January 1996, when preferring new charges of misappropriation of funds against the applicant, the investigator of the Burgas Regional Investigation Service in charge of the case ordered his pretrial detention. She noted, without providing further detail, that the offence alleged against him was particularly serious, and that there was a risk that he could imperil the investigation. The investigator’s decision was confirmed by a prosecutor of the Burgas Regional Prosecutor’s Office the same day.', '31. On the appeal of the applicant, on 5 January 1996 the Burgas Regional Prosecutor’s Office decided to release him on bail, citing his bad health requiring special medical treatment. It seems that the applicant paid the bail amount – BGL 250,000 – the same day and was released.', '32. On 6 May 1996 the investigator in charge of the applicant’s case once again ordered his pretrial detention. She reasoned that he had failed to show up for questioning despite having been duly summoned on 26 March 1996. Moreover, on 2, 3 and 4 April 1996 it had proved impossible to find him at the address indicated by him in Sofia. The applicant had also failed to report to the Burgas Regional Investigation Service every second Thursday of the month, as ordered by the investigator. It could thus be inferred that he had failed to show up without good cause and that it was therefore necessary to take him into custody. That decision was confirmed by a prosecutor of the Burgas Regional Prosecutor’s Office on 16 May 1996.', '33. In May and June 1996 the police conducted initially a local and afterwards a nationwide search for the applicant.', '34. On 5 July 1996 the applicant was arrested. It was found that on 16 May 1996 he had changed his address without notifying the investigation authorities.', '35. The applicant appealed against his pretrial detention to the Burgas Regional Prosecutor’s Office. In her observations in reply to the appeal the investigator in charge of his case stated that the his pre-trial detention was mandatory, as he had been charged with a “serious intentional offence” and there were no reasons to apply the exception provided for by paragraph of 2 of Article 152 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (“the CCP”).', '36. On 6 August 1996 the Burgas Regional Prosecutor’s Office upheld the decision to keep the applicant in custody. It found that he had failed to notify the investigator in charge of his case of his change of address and to report to the Burgas Regional Investigation Service on several dates despite the instructions to that effect. On the other hand, the applicant’s state of health did not require his release. In consideration of this and of the fact that the applicant had been charged with an offence under Article 203 § 1 of the CC, i.e. a serious intentional offence, it was justified to maintain him in detention.', '37. On the appeal of the applicant, the Chief Prosecutor’s Office upheld this decision on 13 September 1996.', '38. During the following months the applicant underwent treatment in the prison hospital and was examined several times by medical doctors.', '39. On 2 October 1996 the Burgas Regional Prosecutor’s Office decided to release the applicant from pretrial detention and place him under house arrest. It found that his remaining in custody could have an irreversible negative impact on his health. The attempts to treat him in the prison hospital had proved futile, whereas his state of health required immediate specialised hospital treatment.', '40. On 10 October 1996 the applicant informed the investigator in charge of his case that he had to be admitted to a hospital in Sofia. He advised the investigator of his address in Sofia and obliged to report to the Burgas Regional Investigation Service every second and fourth Thursday of the month.', '41. On 4 February 1998 and 10 July and 18 December 2001 the investigator in charge of the applicant’s case confirmed his house arrest of her own motion, without giving reasons.', '42. During the period when the applicant was under house arrest, he changed his address several times for health reasons and because of difficulties in finding employment, each time notifying the investigator in charge of his case by mail.', '43. The applicant was released from house arrest on 3 July 2003.', '44. Article 201 of the CC makes it an offence for an official or a manager to misappropriate public or private funds which are in his or her possession in his or her professional capacity or which he or she has been entrusted with to keep secure or administer. By Article 202 § 2 (1) of the CC, as in force at the relevant time, if the misappropriated funds were in large amounts, between three and fifteen years’ imprisonment could be imposed. If the misappropriated funds were in particularly large amounts and the case was particularly aggravated, the punishment ranged between ten and thirty years’ imprisonment (Article 203 § 1 of the CC, as in force at the relevant time).', '45. Article 219 § 1 of the CC makes it an offence for an official or a manager to fail to take due care in managing or keeping secure the assets entrusted to him or her, provided this failure results in substantial losses, destruction or dissipation of these assets, or other substantial damage to the undertaking or the economy. At the relevant time the punishment could be up to three years’ imprisonment.', '46. Article 252 § 1 of the CC makes it an offence to engage in, inter alia, banking business without the requisite licence. By paragraph 2 of that Article, as in force at the relevant time, if the perpetrator had obtained substantial illegal gains therefrom, between one and six years’ imprisonment could be imposed.', '47. Article 282 § 1 of the CC makes it an offence for an official or a manager to, inter alia, abuse his powers or rights in order to provide a financial benefit to himself or another, provided that this leads to nonnegligible harmful consequences. By paragraph 2 of that Article, as in force at the material time, if the harmful consequences were substantial, the punishment ranged between one and eight years’ imprisonment.', '48. At the relevant time and until the reform of the CCP of 1 January 2000 an arrested person was brought before an investigator who decided whether or not he or she should be remanded in custody. The investigator’s decision was subject to approval by a prosecutor.

Bulgaria ([GC], no. 31195/96, ECHR 1999II).', '49.

On 21 March 1997 the Assembly of the Criminal Divisions of the Supreme Court of Cassation decided to request the Constitutional Court to rule on the compatibility of Article 152 of the CCP, governing pretrial detention, with, inter alia, Article 5 of the Convention. It reasoned that by virtue of Article 5 § 4 of the Constitution the Convention was incorporated into Bulgarian law and that all statutory provisions should therefore be in compliance with it. It also stated that when deciding cases before them the Bulgarian courts should take into account the caselaw of the European Court of Human Rights (опред. № 1 от 21 март 1997 г. по н.д. № 1/ 1997 г. на ОСНК на ВКС).']","['5', '6']","['5-3', '5-4', '6-1']",[],['5'],['5-4'],[]

In 1967 the applicant came to Latvia for the first time, when her husband was appointed to a military post in Liepājā. She stayed there until 1968, when the family moved to the far north of Russia, where the husband continued his military service. The applicant remained in Russia until 1985, when she came back to Liepājā separately from her spouse. Ever since she has been living in Latvia alone.

In 1974 the first and the second applicants bought from the Sofia municipality an apartment of 95 square metres, which had become State property by virtue of the nationalisations carried out by the communist regime in Bulgaria in 1947 and the following years.', '9. In the beginning of 1993 the heirs of the former pre-nationalisation owner of the property brought proceedings against the first and the second applicants under section 7 of the Restitution Law.', '10. The proceedings ended by a final judgment of the Supreme Court of Cassation of 8 January 2001. The courts restored the former owners’ title, finding that the first and the second applicants’ title had been null and void ab initio on three grounds: 1) the sale contract had not been signed by the mayor, as required by law, but by another official of the municipality. Although the mayor had been authorised to delegate the power to sign contracts, he had not made a valid delegation in the case at hand; 2) the initial decision to sell the property had not been signed by the mayor of the region, as required by law, but by another official; and 3) the disputed apartment had been a part of a bigger apartment, which had on an unspecified date before 1974 been divided into two smaller ones; this division had not been carried out in accordance with the respective construction rules.', '11. The first and the second applicants could apply, within two months following the judgment of the Supreme Court of Cassation of 8 January 2001, for compensation bonds from the State. Those bonds could be used in privatisation tenders or sold to brokers. The first and second applicants did not avail themselves of this opportunity.', '12. By 2001 the three applicants were living in the apartment. In May 2001 they vacated the property.', '13. In June 2001 the heirs of the former owner brought an action for damages against them for having used the apartment unlawfully, as they had not been its owners. The claim concerned the period from 1996 to 2001 as for the preceding years it was barred by the general five-year statutory limitation.', '14. In a judgment of 31 May 2004 the Sofia District Court allowed the claim accepting that as the first and second applicants’ title had never been valid, the former owners’ title had been restored as of the date of entry into force of the Restitution Law in 1992. After that date, the applicants had had no right to use the apartment.', '15. On 7 March 2006 the Sofia City Court upheld that judgment. The applicants did not submit a cassation appeal considering that it would stand no chances of success.', '16. In June 2007 the first and second applicants paid to the former owners of the apartment 31,265 Bulgarian levs (BGN), the equivalent of approximately EUR 16,000, and the third applicant paid BGN 15,632, the equivalent of EUR 8,000.', '17.

The Supreme Court of Cassation rejected an objection by the defendants that prior to the final judgment under section 7 they had lawfully possessed the apartment at issue pointing out that their title had been null and void ab initio. It held that', '“[a]s a legal category, the nullity of a legal action results in its complete incapability of producing the legal consequences sought. This incapability exists from the beginning, in other words, the contract, which has been subject to the action under section 7 [of the Restitution Law], was null and void, irrespective of when this nullity was declared by the courts.”', 'The Supreme Court of Cassation went on to conclude:', '“... as from the date of entry of the [Restitution Law] into force, [the defendants] possessed the property on no valid legal ground and that is why this date has rightly been accepted as a starting date of [their] liability for damages.”']",[],[],[],[],[],[]

The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) on 12 October 1990, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 § 1 and Article 47 of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 12718/87) against the Kingdom of Belgium lodged with the Commission under Article 25 by a Belgian national, Mr Serge Clooth, on 12 February 1987.', '2. The facts of the case are to be found in the principal judgment delivered on 12 December 1991 (Series A no. 225, pp. 7–12, §§ 7–31). In that judgment the Court held that the length of the applicant’s detention on remand had exceeded the reasonable time referred to in Article 5 § 3 of the Convention.', '3', '4. The Court accordingly reserved the whole of the question and invited the Government and the applicant to submit, within three months, their written observations on the matter and, in particular, to notify the Court of any agreement they might reach (ibid., p. 17, §§ 50–52, and point 2 of the operative provisions).', '5.

After the failure of an attempt to reach a friendly settlement, the applicant and the Government brought Mr Clooth’s claim before the Brussels tribunal de première instance by means of an application to appear voluntarily that was filed on 8 April 1992. The applicant sought 1,758,000 Belgian francs (BEF) in respect of non-pecuniary damage, BEF 698,150 in respect of pecuniary damage and BEF 1,283,698 for the costs of his defence, plus compensatory interest. The Belgian State requested the court to declare that its offer to pay the applicant the sum of BEF 300,000, covering all heads of compensation, was “sufficient”.', 'On 20 January 1995 the tribunal de première instance ordered the Belgian State to pay the applicant BEF 100,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage and BEF 500,000 for the costs of his defence.', '7. On 13 February 1995 Mr Clooth asked the Court to rule on the application of Article 50. On 24 March 1995 he lodged an appeal with the Brussels Court of Appeal against the judgment of 20 January 1995. On 31 March and 4 April 1995 respectively the Government and the Delegate of the Commission submitted observations. On 3 May 1995 the Court decided that as the case was still before the Belgian courts and that there was no reason to suppose that their final decision would be long in coming, it did not have to rule for the time being on the application of Article 50.', '8.

On the night of 22 August 2007, whilst the boat was berthed in M. harbour, the applicant called the police, telling them that she had been raped by D.Š. in the boat’s lounge area.', '7. A police officer soon arrived and found the applicant, D.Š., A.R. (the owner of the boat), and some other people on the boat. The applicant told him that she had been raped, while the others said that she had been disturbing public order. The police interviewed witnesses M.B., I.R. and A.R., and the suspect D.Š.', '8. The relevant part of a police report drawn up by officer I.Z. indicates as follows:', '“Since D. was in a state of shock I could not conduct a detailed interview with her ...', 'The waiter D.Š. said that it was true that he had put his fingers in D.’s private parts, but that he had not taken off her underwear ...”', '9. The police drove the applicant and D.Š. in the same vehicle to the B. Police Station. At 6 a.m. on 23 August 2007 the applicant was taken to the S. Medical Centre, where she remained until 12.30 p.m. on the same day. She was seen by a gynaecologist, who established that she did not have injuries on her genitals but had a few lacerations on her body, without noting any further details.', '10. On the same day the B. Police Station lodged a criminal complaint with the S. County State Attorney against D.Š. on the basis of the applicant’s allegations of rape. The State Attorney’s Office lodged a request with the S. County Court for an investigation in respect of D.Š. on the basis of the allegations of rape. D.Š. was arrested and brought before S.G, an investigating judge at the S. County Court.', '11. Also on the same day, Judge S.G. heard evidence from D.Š., who denied raping the applicant. He explained that the applicant had become very drunk and he had taken her to her cabin on the boat. The judge then issued a decision expressing his disagreement with the request for an investigation. The relevant part of his decision reads:', '“...', 'After the investigating judge had heard evidence from the suspect and consulted the case file, he established with certainty, on the basis of the documents enclosed with the criminal complaint, that before the event at issue the injured party had been in the company of several persons, including the suspect, in bar “F.” in M., where she had consumed a large quantity of alcohol, which was recorded by the breathalyser, and then they had all gone to the ship E. berthed in the close vicinity, on which the suspect, the injured party and other persons were employed and where the guests were asleep in their cabins.', 'After arriving on the ship, and while still in the bar, the injured party had disturbed public peace and order, saying that she was drunk, that somebody had drugged her, and [asking] that the police be called. She said all this to a minor [child], I.R., ... but did not say that anyone had raped her or had committed any acts equal to sexual intercourse. Moreover, in her statement to the police I.R. stated that she had refused to call the police when she had seen that the injured party was drunk, and that the injured party had then slapped her in the face.', 'After arriving on the ship, and this was confirmed by the statement of the ship owner, A.R., the injured party had shouted, entered the guests’ cabins and woken them up, to which A.R. had responded by asking her to stop shouting and disturbing the guests and she had then punched him in the stomach. After that, according to his statement, he had asked the captain of a ship berthed next to his to take D. off the ship, which they had done. The injured party had acted even more aggressively, shouting hysterically, especially when the owner of the ship, A.R., told her not to come back to his ship and that she had lost her employment. They had carried her away from the ship and made her sit on the seafront next to the ship until the police had come.', 'All of the above was confirmed by M.B., the owner of the bar “F.”, but the injured party did not mention the word ‘rape’ or any other indecent act; she only said that somebody had made her drunk and drugged her, all of which transpires from the police report on page six of the case-file. Her allegations are confirmed by the statement [given to the police] by A.R., as well as other eyewitnesses. The injured party asked for the police to be called, saying that she had been drugged while in the bar. She asked the same of all the eyewitnesses, and repeated her request while she was on the ship and when she was physically thrown off the ship, but during all that time she never mentioned any criminal acts.', 'The criminal complaint and the enclosures in the case-file show with certainty that the injured party was not, at any moment, alone with the suspect, nor did she mention to anyone after the alleged event that there had been any acts which could qualify as the criminal offence of rape.', '...', 'A medical report drawn up at the S. Hospital, enclosed with the criminal complaint, does not mention any injuries on the genitals of the injured party but only lacerations on her body which were obviously caused when she refused to leave the ship but was dragged and carried from it before the police arrived, when she sustained these injuries.', 'In view of the statements given by the eyewitnesses, which were enclosed with the criminal complaint, the eyewitnesses all having been present throughout the events, the investigating judge is convinced that there was no reason for arresting D.Š., and after his questioning ... I have not established that there is a reasonable suspicion [on account of which] to open an investigation, ... and I do not agree with the request for opening an investigation ...”', '12. The case file was then forwarded to a three-judge panel of the S. County Court, which on 24 August 2007 ordered an investigation in respect of D.Š. on the basis of the applicant’s allegations of rape. The investigation was conducted by Judge S.G.', '13. A medical report drawn up by a doctor at the C. Hospital on 25 August 2007 records that the applicant had bruises on her genitals, a rash on the back of her upper legs and two smaller bruises on her buttocks.', '14. A medical report drawn up by a doctor at the Rijeka Hospital on 30 August 2007 noted that the applicant was suffering from an acute reaction to stress.', '15. On 30 August 2007 the applicant, on her own initiative, gave the skirt she had been wearing on the night in question to the police in C. as a piece of evidence. It was not given for forensic examination.', '16. On 14 and 15 September 2007 the police interviewed M.V., I.R. T.Š., Ve.M. and F.B. Ve.M. said that M.V. had told him that she had found the applicant’s underwear on the boat and thrown it in the garbage. He further stated that D.Š. had commented that he would like to have sex with the applicant. F.B. also said that D.Š. had commented that he would like to have sex with the applicant.', '17. At the request of the B. Police Station the applicant was interviewed at the C. Police Station, which was closer to her place of residence, on 19 September 2007.', '18. On the same day the S. State Attorney’s Office asked that witnesses M.V., Z.B., T.Š., I.R., Ve.M. and F.B. be heard. They also asked for the forensic examination of possible biological traces on the clothes the applicant had been wearing during the critical event.', '19. On 19 September 2007 the same Office asked that an examination of the applicant’s clothes be carried out in order to establish whether they had any traces of biological material on them.', '20. On the same day Judge S.G. heard evidence from witnesses A.R., M.V. and M.B., and on 21 September 2007 from F.B.', '21. On 2 October 2007 he heard evidence from the applicant. She said that D.Š. had raped her in the lounge of the boat where they had both been employed. She also said that the police officer who had arrived after her call had asked the men why they hadn’t thrown her into the sea. She alleged that her skirt had been torn and had had traces of blood on it, and she had told the officer that she had not being wearing any underwear because D.Š. had torn it and thrown it away in the boat’s lounge and told her that she had been drunk and not raped. The applicant had asked the officer to secure the evidence at the scene, such as her clothes, including her underwear, but he had replied that there was no need for that because she had been drunk and had not been raped. She had also heard the officer telling D.Š. not to worry and that “everything would be taken care of”. When the police had arrived D.Š. had already taken a shower.', 'She also said that some time after the incident Ve.M., had telephoned her to tell her that her underwear had been found and that one of the boat’s employees, M.V., had thrown it in the garbage. She had telephoned the police to inform them about this but they had hung up on her.', '22. On 28 November 2007 the applicant’s lawyer asked the S. County State Attorney’s Office to lodge a request for the withdrawal of Judge S.G. on account of his bias against the applicant. She received no reply.', '23. On 3 December 2007 Judge S.G. heard evidence from Z.B., the gynaecologist who had seen the applicant on 23 August 2007, after the incident. He said that he had not noticed any injuries on the applicant’s genitals but that she had had few scratches elsewhere on her body, which he had not recorded because they did not fall into the gynaecological sphere.', '24. On 5 December 2007 the S. County State Attorney’s Office asked Judge S.G. to ask for the results of all the forensic examinations of biological traces available in respect of the applicant, as well as those concerning her injuries, and to hear evidence from a further witness, Ve.M.', '25. On 7 January 2008 Judge S.G. commissioned a psychiatric report on the applicant in order to establish her ability to correctly interpret events. He also ordered that the applicant’s previous psychiatric records be provided. The psychiatric report of 25 January 2008 relied on the applicant’s previous records concerning the period between 29 September and 26 October 2001 and a telephone conversation with the applicant, without having met her.', '26. On 8 January 2008, at the request of the B. Police Station, officers at the M.L. Police Station interviewed the applicant’s father about the applicant’s relationship with her family.', '27. On 19 February 2008 Judge S.G. received the forensic report on the biological traces, which did not establish any connection between the biological traces taken from the applicant and D.Š. The skirt the applicant had worn on the critical event was not examined.', '28. On 29 February 2008 Judge S.G. obtained the forensic report concerning the applicant’s injuries, which established that the medical report concerning the applicant drawn up on 23 August 2008 by the gynaecologist at the S. Hospital had mentioned a few scratch marks on her body but no injuries on her genitals. The medical report drawn up on 25 August 2007 by a physician at the C. Hospital established that she had three scratch marks on her genitals, a rash on the back of her thighs and three haematomas. Judge S.G. concluded that the injuries established by the physician at the C. Hospital had been recorded two days after the alleged rape and had not been established by the gynaecologist who had seen the applicant on the morning after the alleged rape; they could not therefore be connected with certainty with the event.', '29. On 10 March 2008 Judge S.G. commissioned a medical report on the injuries sustained by the applicant. On 11 March 2008 a medical report drawn up by an expert in forensic medicine established that the applicant’s injuries had first been recorded on 25 August 2007 by a doctor at the C. hospital, while the gynaecologist who had seen the applicant on 23 August 2007 had not recorded any injuries. Therefore, the doctor concluded that the injuries recorded on 25 August 2007 could not be directly connected with the event of 23 August 2007.', '30. On 11 March 2008 Judge S.G. issued a decision expressing his disagreement with the request by the S. County State Attorney’s Office of 19 September 2007 to hear evidence from witness Ve.M. on the ground that he was not available since he had not answered the summons of the investigating judge to appear and the police could not find him. The S. County State Attorney’s Office lodged an appeal. On 20 March 2008 a three-judge panel of the S. County Court upheld the decision of the investigating judge on the ground that the information in the case file showed that witness Ve.M. had no direct knowledge of the criminal offence allegedly committed against the applicant.', '31. The applicant alleges that the police interviewed her father about her relationship with her family.', '32. On 31 March 2008 the S. County State Attorney’s Office ceased to pursue the criminal prosecution of D.Š. for lack of evidence.', '33.

County Court scheduled a hearing for 14 April 2011, stating that it was expected that by that time a legal aid lawyer would have been allocated to the applicant.', '37. On the same day the M.L. City Administration refused the applicant’s request for legal aid on the grounds that the purpose of legal aid was not to institute criminal proceedings and that the proceedings in question were not of essential importance for the applicant since she had not lodged a compensation claim in connection with them. This decision was upheld on 12 April 2011 by the Ministry of Justice and the applicant was instructed that she could institute proceedings in the Administrative Court within thirty days in order to challenge the administrative bodies’ decisions.

The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Oradea.', '5. On 14 May 1999, the applicant lodged with the Oradea District Court an action for recovery of possession (acţiune în revendicare) of a plot of land that, although recorded in the land register (cartea funciară) as belonging to the Oradea Local Council, she claimed she had inherited it from E.S. who had received it from the State in exchange for another plot of land.', 'The three courts that dealt with the case found in favour of the applicant. The District Court gave its decision on 4 July 2000. Upon appeals by the Local Council, the Bihor County Court upheld it on 16 February 2001 and the Oradea Court of Appeal on 21 May 2001, the latter by means of a final and irrevocable decision.', '6. Before all the courts that dealt with the case, the Local Council argued that certificate no. 10524 of 14 May 1955, used by the applicant in order to prove her ownership title, was false as it contained a series of irregularities.', '7. The first-instance court and the appeal court rejected the argument on the ground that the defendant had not brought evidence to prove the allegations. Moreover, the courts noted that, according to the information in their possession, no criminal proceedings had been started on the matter.', '8. The court of last resort rejected the Local Council’s request that the proceedings be stayed until the courts had ruled on the nullity of the certificate (procedure described at paragraphs 10 to 12 below). On the merits, it noted as follows:', '“The [defendant’s] allegations about the existence of irregularities in certificate no. 10524 of 14 May 1955 ... seem well-founded. However, this certificate established a prima facie case [început de probă scrisă] which entitled the firstinstance court to examine additional evidence; witness testimonies confirmed that the property title in dispute had been transferred from the State to E.S., who exercised public and peaceful possession without causing any nuisance ... This situation is also confirmed by the evidence on the consolidations of land that had taken place. The fact that the exchange of land occurred is undoubtedly proved by letter no. 28182 of 18 October 1949, issued by the Ministry of Agriculture ..., which cannot be contested...”', 'It also noted that the criminal investigation into the alleged forgery of the 1955 certificate had been terminated on 17 March 2001 as the time-limits for criminal responsibility had expired. However, the Court of Appeal considered that the evidence adduced, in particular the letter of 18 October 1949, rendered that investigation devoid of relevance in any case.', '9. On an unspecified date the applicant’s ownership title was recorded in the land register.', '10. On 19 April 2001 the Oradea Local Council lodged with the Oradea District Court an action against the applicant, seeking that the 14 May 1955 certificate above be set aside because it contained irregularities. The applicant argued that the issue was res judicata in so far as the courts ruling on the action for recovery of possession had already dealt with the matter.', '11. The case was transferred to the Arad District Court which, on 28 March 2002, allowed the action, established that the document was false and set it aside.', '12. Appeals by the applicant were rejected successively by the Arad County Court, on 10 July 2002, and by the Timişoara Court of Appeal, in a final decision of 3 December 2002.', '13. Following the ruling of the Timişoara Court of Appeal, the Oradea Local Council sought the revision of the final decision of 21 May 2001 (cerere de revizuire). It also asked the Procurator General to lodge an application with the Supreme Court of Justice to have that decision set aside (recurs în anulare).', '14. In a final decision of 19 February 2003, the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the Procurator General’s request, noted that the 1955 certificate had been declared false, quashed all the decisions rendered in the action for recovery of possession and, ruling on the merits, rejected the initial action on the ground that the applicant had failed to prove her ownership title.', 'The Supreme Court considered as follows:', '“Although according to Article 129 (5) of the Civil Procedure Code the judges have an obligation to use all legal means in order to prevent any error in establishing the truth, by a correct determination of facts and application of law, the court of last resort rejected as ill-founded the request for a stay in the proceedings, although the ruling in the [parallel] action for nullity was essential for adopting a lawful decision.”', '15. On 20 March 2003, at the Local Council’s request, the Oradea District Court took note of the Supreme Court’s decision and struck off the request for revision.', '16. The relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure read as follows:', '“A final decision ... shall be revised in the following cases:', '...', '4. ... if the decision was adopted based on an act which was declared false either during or after the proceedings.”', '“The Procurator General may, of his own motion or on an application by the Minister of Justice, apply to the Supreme Court of Justice for a final decision to be quashed on any of the following grounds: ...', '2. when the decision in question has seriously infringed the law by giving a wrong solution on the merits of the case, or when the decision is manifestly illfounded; ...”', '17.
