The applicant was born in 1992 and lives in Novosibirsk.', '10. At some point before September 2004, the applicant’s parents were deprived of their parental responsibility and the applicant was placed in a local orphanage until his grandfather was assigned as his guardian in October 2004 and the applicant was placed with him. On 28 February 2005 the grandfather’s guardianship was revoked but he was reinstated as guardian at the beginning of 2006.', '11. From 2002 to 2005, the applicant allegedly committed offences prohibited by the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, including disorderly acts, aggravated robbery and extortion, alone or in a group of minors. Since he was under the age of criminal responsibility, no criminal proceedings were instituted against him but he was the subject of five pre-investigation inquiries and placed under the supervision of the Juveniles Inspectorate within the Department of the Interior of the Sovetskiy District of Novosibirsk (hereafter “the Juveniles Inspectorate”). Moreover, following the fourth inquiry, he was placed in a temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders on 21 September 2004 for thirty days.', '12. According to the applicant’s medical records, he suffered from an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (a mental and neurobehavioural disorder characterised by either substantial attention difficulties, or hyperactivity and impulsiveness, or a combination of the two; hereafter “ADHD”) and a neurogenic bladder causing enuresis (a disorder involving urinary incontinence).', '13. On 27 December 2004 and 19 January 2005 he was examined by a neurologist and a psychiatrist. He was prescribed medication, regular supervision by a neurologist and a psychiatrist and regular psychological counselling.', '14. On 3 January 2005 the applicant, who at that time was twelve years old, was at the home of his nine-year old neighbour S. when his mother, Ms S., called the police, who came and took the applicant to the police station of the Sovetskiy District of Novosibirsk. He was not informed of the reasons for his arrest.', '15. According to the applicant, he was put in a cell that had no windows and the lights in the cell were turned off. After he had spent about an hour in the dark, he was questioned by a police officer. The police officer told him that S. had accused him of extortion. He urged the applicant to confess, saying that if he did so he would be immediately released, whereas if he refused he would be placed in custody. The applicant signed a confession statement. The police officer then immediately telephoned the applicant’s grandfather to tell him that the applicant was at the police station and could be taken home. When his grandfather arrived at the police station, the applicant retracted his confession and protested his innocence.', '16. The Government disputed the applicant’s account of the events at the police station. They submitted that the applicant had been asked to give an “explanation” rather than being formally questioned, that he had been interviewed by a police officer who had pedagogical training, and that he had been apprised of his right to remain silent. He had not been subjected to any pressure or intimidation. His grandfather had been present during the interview.', '17. On the same day the applicant’s grandfather signed a written statement describing the applicant’s character and way of life. He stated that two days earlier he had seen the applicant in possession of some money. When asked where the money had come from, the applicant had said that he had got it from his father.', '18. S. and his mother were also heard by the police about the incident and they claimed that on two occasions, on 27 December 2004 and 3 January 2005, the applicant had extorted 1,000 roubles (RUB) from S., threatening him with violence if he did not hand over the money.', '19. On 12 January 2005 the Juveniles Inspectorate refused to institute criminal proceedings against the applicant. Relying on the applicant’s confession and the statements of S. and S.’s mother, it found it to be established that on 27 December 2004 and 3 January 2005 the applicant had extorted money from S. His actions therefore contained elements of the criminal offence of extortion, punishable under Article 163 of the Criminal Code. However, given that the applicant was below the statutory age of criminal responsibility he could not be prosecuted for his actions.', '20. On 3 February 2005 the applicant’s grandfather complained to the Prosecutor’s Office of the Sovetskiy District of Novosibirsk that the applicant, a minor suffering from a psychological disorder, had been intimidated and then questioned in the absence of his guardian and that his confession had been obtained under duress. The grandfather requested that the confession statement be declared inadmissible as evidence and that the pre-investigation inquiry be closed on account of lack of evidence of an offence, rather than the applicant’s age.', '21. On 8 June 2005 the Prosecutor’s Office of the Sovetskiy District of Novosibirsk quashed the decision of 12 January 2005, finding that the preinvestigation inquiry had been incomplete. It ordered a further pre-investigation inquiry.', '22. On 6 July 2005 the Juveniles Inspectorate again refused to institute criminal proceedings against the applicant, for the same reasons as before.', '23. During the following months the applicant’s grandfather lodged several complaints with prosecutors’ offices of various levels, asking for a fresh examination of the case against the applicant. He complained that the applicant’s confession had been obtained as a result of intimidation by the police; in particular, he had been placed in a dark cell for an hour and he had then been questioned by a police officer in the absence of a guardian, psychologist or teacher. The police officer had coerced the applicant into signing the confession statement without the benefit of legal advice. He had then issued a decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings on the ground that the applicant had not reached the statutory age of criminal responsibility, while stating at the same time that the applicant’s involvement in extortion had been established.', '24. By letters of 4 August, 9 November and 16 December 2005 the Prosecutor’s Office of the Sovetskiy District of Novosibirsk and the Prosecutor’s Office of the Novosibirsk Region replied that no criminal proceedings had been instituted against the applicant on grounds of his age. He therefore did not have the status of a suspect or a defendant. On 3 January 2005 he had been asked to give an “explanation” rather than questioned by the police. In those circumstances the participation of a lawyer, psychologist or teacher had not been mandatory. There was no evidence that the applicant had been held in a dark cell before the interview and he had had to wait no more than ten minutes for an officer from the Juveniles Inspectorate to arrive and interview him. That the applicant had committed extortion had been established on the basis of the statements of S. and S.’s mother and the applicant’s admission of guilt during the interview of 3 January 2005.', '25. On 10 February 2005 the Head of the Sovetskiy District Police Department of Novosibirsk asked the Sovetskiy District Court of Novosibirsk to order the applicant’s placement in a temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders.', '26. On 21 February 2005 the Sovetskiy District Court held a hearing at which the applicant and his grandfather attended and submitted medical certificates confirming that the applicant suffered from a psychological disorder and enuresis.', '27. On the same day the court delivered its judgment in which it ordered the applicant’s placement in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders for thirty days. It held as follows:', '“The Head of the Sovetskiy District Police Department of Novosibirsk has applied to the court with a request to place [the applicant], who has been registered with the [Juveniles] Inspectorate as a delinquent minor since 4 January 2002, in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders for thirty days.', 'On 14 May 2003 [the applicant] committed an offence proscribed by Article 161 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. A criminal case was not opened because he had not reached the age of criminal responsibility.', 'On 24 July 2003 [the applicant] again committed an offence proscribed by Article 213 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. A criminal case was not opened because he had not reached the age of criminal responsibility.', 'On 27 August 2004 [the applicant] again committed a criminal offence under Article 161 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. A criminal case was not opened because he had not reached the age of criminal responsibility. [The applicant] was placed in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders for thirty days.', 'The minor lives in unfavourable family conditions in which his grandfather is responsible for his upbringing in so far as possible; [the applicant’s] parents are alcoholics and have a negative influence on their son. Before [the grandfather] was given guardianship status, [the applicant] had lived in an orphanage and studied in school no. 61. At the material time he studied in school no. 163, often played truant from school, and stopped attending school entirely from December onwards. Given that the requisite control over him is absent, the minor spends the major part of his day on the streets, committing socially dangerous offences.', 'On 27 December 2004 [the applicant] committed another offence proscribed by Article 163 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation; a criminal case was not opened because he had not reached the age of criminal responsibility.', 'Taking the above-mentioned circumstances into account, [the Head of the Police Department] considers it necessary to place [the applicant] in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders for a period of thirty days to prevent his further unlawful actions.', 'The representative of the Juveniles Inspectorate supported the request made by the Head of the Police Department and explained that [the applicant’s] guardian had requested in writing that his guardianship rights be lifted and the [Inspectorate] had accepted that request.', '[The applicant] refused to provide any explanations.', 'The [applicant’s] representative [the grandfather] objected to [the applicant’s] placement in the temporary detention centre, having noted that [the applicant] had not committed a criminal offence on 27 December 2004 as he had been with [the grandfather] at a doctor’s surgery for an examination at that time.', 'The lawyer, Ms [R.], asked the court to dismiss the request of the Head of the Police Department.', 'The prosecutor asked the court to accept the request and to place [the applicant] in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders, taking into account that the documents presented by [the applicant’s] guardian did not confirm that [the applicant] had been at a doctor’s surgery on 27 December 2004 at 1 p.m. or that he had been unable to commit the criminal offence, particularly taking into account the [applicant’s] personality and the fact that he had already committed a number of offences.', 'Having heard the parties to the proceedings and having examined the materials submitted by them, the court considers that the request must be allowed for the following reasons: [the applicant] is registered in the database of [the Juvenile Department of the police]; he was previously placed in the [temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders] for behaviour correction but did not draw the proper conclusions and committed further delinquent acts; the preventive measures put in place by the [Juveniles] Inspectorate and by the guardian have not produced results, which shows that [the applicant] has not learnt his lesson. [The applicant] must be placed in the [temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders] for thirty days for behaviour correction.', 'The case-file materials examined by the court confirm that [the applicant] committed a socially dangerous offence: a complaint by Ms [S.] shows that on 27 December 2004, at approximately 1 p.m., [the applicant] extorted 1,000 roubles from her son [S.] in a yard; he accompanied those actions with threats of violence. On 3 January 2005 [the applicant] again came to their house and again extorted 1,000 roubles from her son, having again threatened the son with violence. Explanations by [S.] indicate that on 27 December 2004, at approximately 1 p.m., [the applicant] told [S.] to give him 1,000 roubles in a yard; he accompanied those actions with threats of violence and [S.] gave him the money. On 3 January 2005 [the applicant] again came to their house and requested 1,000 roubles from [S.], having again threatened him with violence. [S.] complained to his mother, who called the police.', 'The court takes into account that those circumstances are corroborated by the statement made by [the applicant], who did not deny that he had received money from [S.] on 27 December 2004 as the latter had been afraid of the applicant. [The applicant] also did not deny that he had come to [S.’s] house on 3 January 2005. A criminal case in respect of the events on 27 December 2004 and 3 January 2005 was not opened as the applicant had not reached the age of criminal responsibility.', 'Having taken these circumstances into account, the court finds unsubstantiated and far-fetched the explanations by the applicant’s guardian that [the applicant] did not commit the offences on 27 December 2004 and 3 January 2005.', 'Having regard to the above-mentioned facts and ruling under section 22(2)(4) of the Minors Act, the court grants the request of the Head of the Police Department and decides to place the applicant in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders for thirty days.”', '28. On 21 February 2005 the applicant was placed in the Novosibirsk temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders, where he remained until 23 March 2005.', '29. According to the applicant, he had shared his bedroom in the centre with seven other inmates. The lights were kept on all night.', '30. During the day inmates were forbidden to lie on their beds or to enter the bedroom. They had to spend the whole day in a large empty room which had no furniture or sports equipment. On a few occasions they were given a chess set and other board games. They were allowed to go out into the yard only twice during the applicant’s thirty-day stay in the centre.', '31. Inmates had classes twice a week for about three hours. They had mathematics and Russian grammar classes only. They were not taught any other courses from the officially approved secondary school curriculum. About twenty children of different ages and school levels were taught together in one class.', '32. The supervisors applied collective punishment to the inmates. If one of them committed a breach of the centre’s strict regime, all inmates were forced to stand in line against the wall without moving, talking or being allowed to sit down. Given that many inmates were psychologically unstable and unruly, because of their socially disadvantaged background, such punishment was applied every day and often lasted for hours.', '33. Inmates were not allowed to leave the room where they were assembled. They had to ask for the supervisor’s permission to go to the toilet and were accompanied there in groups of three. They therefore had to wait until such a group was formed before being able to go to the toilet. Given that the applicant suffered from enuresis, the fact that he could not go to the toilet as often as he needed caused him bladder pain and psychological suffering. If his requests for permission to go to the toilet became too frequent, the supervisors punished him by making him do particularly arduous cleaning work.', '34. Although the applicant’s grandfather had informed the staff of the centre about the applicant’s enuresis and his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, the applicant did not receive any treatment.', '35. According to the Government, each bedroom in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders measured seventeen square metres and was equipped with four beds. Access to the bathrooms and toilets situated on each floor was not limited.', '36. The centre had a dining room where meals were served five times a day. There was also a games room and a sports room. Audio and video equipment, educational games and fictional works were available.', '37. The supervisors carried out “preventive work” with each inmate of the centre and could apply incentive measures or punitive measures in the form of oral reprimands. Corporal punishment was not used; nor were juvenile inmates ever required to do hard or dirty work.', '38. The centre’s medical unit had all the necessary equipment and medicine. It could be seen from the staff list of the centre submitted by the Government that the medical unit was staffed by a paediatrician, two nurses and a psychologist. According to the Government, each child was examined by the paediatrician on his admission and every day thereafter. Treatment was prescribed when necessary. It could be seen from the temporary detention centre’s “accounting and statistical record” concerning the applicant that he had not informed the doctor about his enuresis.', '39. The applicant’s personal file, containing, in particular, the information about his medical condition on admission, the preventive work carried out and the punishment applied to him, had been destroyed on 17 January 2008 after the expiry of the statutory time-limit on storage, in accordance with Order no. 215 of the Ministry of the Interior of 2 April 2004 (see paragraph 73 below). However, the Government stated that the applicant’s “accounting and statistical record”, referred to above, had been retained since its storage period was unlimited in accordance with Order no. 215 (see paragraph 74 below).', '40. According to the Government, the applicant’s other medical records and logbooks at the temporary detention centre had been destroyed as soon as they had become unnecessary, without any records being compiled in this respect. This had been possible because there had been no regulations on storing such documents until Order no. 340 of the Ministry of the Interior had entered into force on 12 May 2006 (which provided that medical records were to be stored for three years).', '41. However, the Government submitted a written statement by a supervisor at the detention centre dated 23 December 2010. She confirmed the Government’s description of the conditions of detention in the centre. She also stated that one of the supervisors was always present in the room where the inmates were gathered, which ensured continuity of the educational process. Teachers from the neighbouring school regularly came to the centre so that the inmates could follow the secondary-school curriculum. After their release from the centre, they received an education progress record. She stated that she did not remember the applicant but asserted that she had not received any requests or complaints from him or from any other inmate.', '42. The Government also submitted a copy of an agreement of 1 September 2004 between the detention centre and secondary school no. 15 according to which the school undertook to organise secondary-school courses in the centre in accordance with a curriculum developed by the centre. A copy of an undated two-week curriculum was produced by the Government. It included four classes per day on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.', '43. On 23 March 2005 the applicant was released from the detention centre. On the following day he was taken to hospital, where he received treatment for neurosis and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He remained at the hospital until at least 21 April 2005.', '44. On 31 August 2005 the applicant was placed in an orphanage and, according to an extract from the applicant’s medical record drawn up at the orphanage, he was on the run between 14 September and 11 October 2005 and again between 13 and 23 October 2005.', '45. On 1 November 2005 he was transferred to a children’s psychiatric hospital, where he remained until 27 December 2005. At some point after this, he was returned to his grandfather who had been reinstated as his guardian.', '46. On 4 October 2005 the applicant’s grandfather complained to the Prosecutor General’s Office that the applicant, who suffered from a mental disorder, had not received any medical treatment in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders, which had caused a deterioration in his condition; nor had he been provided with any educational courses. He reiterated his complaints to the prosecution authorities in a letter dated 30 November 2005. While the Prosecutor’s Office of the Sovetskiy District of Novosibirsk sent a reply to the applicant’s grandfather on 9 November 2005 and the Prosecutor’s Office of the Novosibirsk Region sent a reply on 16 December 2005, both of these dealt exclusively with the procedural issues related to the applicant’s case (see paragraph 24 above) and did not contain any answer to the grandfather’s complaints in so far as they related to the applicant’s health and the conditions of detention.', '47. Meanwhile, on 2 March 2005, the applicant’s grandfather appealed against the detention order of 21 February 2005. He submitted, firstly, that the detention was unlawful because the Minors Act did not permit detention for “behaviour correction”. Secondly, he complained that he had not been informed of the decision of 12 January 2005 refusing to institute criminal proceedings against the applicant and had therefore been deprived of an opportunity to appeal against it. He further submitted that the court’s finding that the applicant had committed an offence had been based on the statements of S. and his mother and the applicant’s confession statement. However, the applicant had made his confession statement in the absence of his guardian. Nor had a teacher been present. No teacher had been present during the questioning of S. either. Their statements were therefore inadmissible as evidence. Moreover, S. and his mother had not attended the court hearing and had not been heard by the court. Nor had the court verified the applicant’s alibi. Lastly, the applicant’s grandfather complained that the court had not taken into account the applicant’s frail health and had not verified whether his medical condition was compatible with detention.', '48. On 21 March 2005 the Novosibirsk Regional Court quashed the detention order of 21 February 2005 on appeal. It found that behaviour correction was not among the grounds listed in section 22(2)(4) of the Minors Act for placing a minor in a temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders. Detention for behaviour correction therefore had no basis in domestic law. Moreover, the District Court had not stated reasons why it considered it necessary to detain the applicant. The mere fact that the applicant had committed an offence for which he was not liable to prosecution because of his age could not justify his detention. Such detention would be permissible only if one of the additional conditions listed in section 22(2)(4) of the Minors Act (see paragraph 66 below) was met. The Regional Court remitted the case to the District Court for fresh examination.', '49. On 11 April 2005 the Sovetskiy District Court discontinued the proceedings because the Head of the Sovetskiy District Police Department of Novosibirsk had withdrawn his request for the placement of the applicant in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders. The applicant and his grandfather were not informed of the date of the hearing.', '50. On 22 March 2006 the applicant’s grandfather lodged an application for supervisory review of the decision of 11 April 2005. He complained that as a result of the discontinuation of the proceedings the applicant had been deprived of an opportunity to prove his innocence in respect of the offence for which he had already unlawfully served a term of detention in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders.', '51. On 3 April 2006 the President of the Novosibirsk Regional Court quashed the decision of 11 April 2005. He found, firstly, that, in accordance with section 31.2(3) of the Minors Act, a judge examining a request for the placement of a minor in a temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders had the power either to grant or to reject the request. He had no power to discontinue the proceedings. Secondly, the applicant and his guardian had not been informed of the date of the hearing and had therefore been deprived of an opportunity to make submissions on the issue of the discontinuation of the proceedings.', '52. On 17 April 2006 the Prosecutor of the Novosibirsk Region lodged an application for supervisory review of the Regional Court’s decision of 21 March 2005.', '53. On 12 May 2006 the Presidium of the Novosibirsk Regional Court quashed the decision of 21 March 2005, finding that it had been adopted by an unlawful composition of judges. It remitted the case for a fresh examination on appeal.', '54. On 29 May 2006 the President of the Novosibirsk Regional Court held a fresh appeal hearing and upheld the decision of 21 February 2005 ordering the applicant’s placement in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders. He found that the applicant had committed a delinquent act punishable under Article 163 of the Criminal Code but that no criminal proceedings had been instituted against him because he had not reached the statutory age of criminal responsibility. He belonged to a “problem family”; his parents had been deprived of parental responsibility and he was cared for by his grandfather. He played truant from school and spent most of the time on the streets or in a computer club. In those circumstances, it had been necessary, in accordance with section 22(2)(4) of the Minors Act, to place him in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders for thirty days to prevent him from committing further delinquent acts. The fact that the District Court had referred to “behaviour correction” as a ground for detention had not made the detention order of 21 February 2005 unlawful. The applicant’s detention had been justified by other grounds. Nor could the detention order of 21 February 2005 be quashed on account of the applicant’s frail health, given that it had already been enforced in March 2005.']","['3', '5', '6']","['5-1', '6-1', '6-3']","['5-1-d', '6-3-c', '6-3-d']",[],[],[]

On 21 April 2008 the President of the Kranj District Court dismissed the applicant’s request to have the presiding judge excluded.', '18. In the meantime, on 5 April 2008, the Kranj District Court imposed a fine of 500 euros (EUR) on the applicant for abuse of her procedural rights by having lodged the requests concerning the exclusion of the presiding judge. The applicant appealed.', '19. On 5 November 2008 the Ljubljana Higher Court upheld the applicant’s appeal and annulled the order to fine the applicant. The court held that the district court failed to establish that by lodging the requests the applicant had abused her procedural rights.', '20. On 16 September 2009 the applicant lodged a supervisory appeal. On 6 October 2009 the President of the Kranj District Court replied that a hearing would be scheduled for 22 October 2009.', '21. A further hearing was held on 22 February 2010.', '22. On 9 March 2011 the Kranj District Court issued a judgment in which it upheld the applicant’s claim in part. Both parties appealed.', '23. On 18 January 2012 the Ljubljana Higher Court upheld the appeals, quashed the judgment of the lower court and modified it by dismissing the claim in respect of the confinement in December 1999 as time-barred and decided that the claim for non-pecuniary damages in respect of the confinement between July and September 2000 was well-founded but that the first instance court needed to decide on the amount of compensation in a new set of proceedings.', '24. The applicant lodged a motion for leave to file an appeal on points of law in respect of the question whether her claim for damages due to the December 1999 confinement was time-barred.', '25. On 19 July 2012 the Supreme Court allowed the applicant’s appeal on points of law.', '26. On 31 January 2013 the Supreme Court granted the applicant’s appeal on points of law and quashed the respective part of the decision of the higher court.', '27. On 13 March 2013 the Ljubljana Higher Court quashed the decision of the district court in respect of the 1999 confinement and remitted the case back to the district court.', '28. On 30 January 2014 the applicant lodged a further supervisory appeal which was dismissed on 14 February 2014.', '29. On 10 February 2014 the Kranj District Court held the first main hearing after the remittal and postponed the hearing for an indefinite period in order to obtain an expert opinion on the applicant’s mental health at the time of the confinement.', '30. On 14 March 2014 the applicant lodged a motion for a deadline with the Ljubljana Higher Court.', '31. On 25 March 2014 the Ljubljana Higher Court granted the applicant’s motion for a deadline and ordered the district court to deal with the case with priority.', '32. The proceedings are still pending before the Kranj District Court which still needs to decide on the applicant’s claim in respect of the confinement in 1999 and on the amount of compensation in respect of the 2000 confinement.', '33. On 24 March 2006 the applicant amended her claim in the above proceedings by claiming further non-pecuniary damages due to the length of proceedings. This part of the claim was separated from the main claim and referred to the Ljubljana District Court.', '34. On 18 March 2009 the applicant raised the claim to EUR 5,000.', '35. On 21 May 2009 the Ljubljana District Court dismissed the applicant’s claim as premature since the main proceedings were still pending. The applicant appealed.', '36. On 20 January 2010 the Ljubljana Higher Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. The applicant lodged a motion to file an appeal on points of law.', '37. On 30 September 2010 the Supreme Court allowed the applicant’s appeal on points of law in respect of the question whether it was possible to claim compensation for a violation of one’s right to a trial without undue delay before the termination of the main proceedings.', '38. On 27 September 2012 the Supreme Court held that even though the proceedings had been instituted before 1 January 2007 when the Act on the Protection of the Right to a Trial without Undue Delay (“the 2006 Act”) became operational, the latter was applicable to the applicant’s case and therefore it was not possible to claim compensation before the termination of the main proceedings. It further held that since the appeal on points of law was explicitly excluded as a legal remedy in the proceeding under the 2006 Act, the applicant’s appeal on points of law should be rejected on procedural grounds as not allowed. The applicant lodged a constitutional complaint.', '39.

Prior to that assembly, on 15 October 2012, the organisers gave notice to the relevant authority, the Baku City Executive Authority (“the BCEA”). The BCEA refused to authorise the holding of the demonstration at the place indicated by the organisers and proposed a different location on the outskirts of Baku – the grounds of a driving school situated in the 20th residential area of the Sabail District. Nevertheless, the organisers decided to hold the demonstration as planned.', '7. The second applicant also participated in demonstrations held on 12 January and 26 January 2013.

The applicant, a former police officer, was born in 1962 and lives in Zaporizhzhya. He is also acting on behalf of his son, V., who was born in 1991.', '6. On 13 September 2003 four people, including the applicant, were apprehended by officers of the Zaporizhzhya office of the Security Service of Ukraine (Служба Безпеки України – “the SBU”) in Novokateshchino village while attempting to transport opiate drugs with a view to selling them on. They were taken to the SBU’s premises for questioning. After being informed of his privilege against self-incrimination, the applicant made a written statement to the effect that he had appeared at the crime scene by chance, at the request of a friend with whom he and his son had been looking for a place to fish.', '7. Later the same day criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant and two other people on suspicion of illegal production, storage and sale of drugs.', '8. On 14 September 2003 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant and the two others on suspicion of membership of an organised crime group.', '9. On the same date the applicant was arrested. Having been informed of his procedural rights as a suspect, he refused to give evidence without a lawyer present.', '10. On 15 September 2003 the applicant’s wife hired a lawyer, G., to represent the applicant.', '11. On 16 September 2003 the applicant’s pre-trial detention was ordered by a court.', '12. On 19 September 2003 the applicant requested that G. be admitted to the proceedings as his lawyer.', '13. On the same date, in the presence of his lawyer, the applicant denied his involvement in the crime.', '14. On 23 September 2003, in the presence of his lawyer, the applicant was charged with drug-related crimes and questioned. He did not want to be informed of his rights and stated that he would not give any evidence during the pre-trial investigation.', '15. On 2 October 2003 the applicant was questioned in the presence of his lawyer. He provided some biographical details as well as information on his family status, state of health and place of residence.', '16. On 18 November 2003 the applicant was again questioned in the presence of his lawyer.', '17. On 15 December 2003 all the criminal proceedings against the applicant were joined.', '18. On 18 December 2003 the applicant was questioned in the presence of his lawyer. He did not confess to the crimes.', '19. On 22 and 23 December 2003 confrontations between the applicant and his co-accused were conducted with his lawyer present.', '20. On 24 December 2003 amended charges were brought against the applicant in his lawyer’s presence. The applicant pleaded not guilty.', '21. On 6 February 2004 the applicant’s wife was admitted to the proceedings as the applicant’s lay representative.', '22. On 10 February 2004, upon his written consent, the applicant was questioned without a lawyer.', '23. On 9 March 2004 the criminal case against the applicant and his coaccused was sent to the Leninsky District Court of Zaporizhzhya (“the District Court”). During the trial the applicant pleaded not guilty. He maintained that the case had been fabricated by his enemies and that all the evidence had been falsified and was inadmissible. In fact, he, a retired police officer, had been arrested in the company of drug addicts with whom he had been in contact as an advisor to the local police. They might have been producing drugs for their own use. He further claimed that his case should benefit from being examined in camera by a judge who had security clearance, to protect State secrets concerning the functioning of his network of informants.', '24. In May 2004 F., a lawyer hired by the applicant’s wife, was admitted to the proceedings to represent the applicant.', '25. On 25 October 2005, after having heard the case in public hearings, the District Court convicted the applicant and his co-defendants of drugrelated offences. The applicant was sentenced to eight-and-a-half years’ imprisonment and the confiscation of his personal property was ordered.', '26. The applicant, represented by his lawyer and his wife, appealed. He repeated his arguments advanced at trial and complained that he had been unable to defend himself properly during the trial as he had been reticent in order to safeguard confidential information concerning the network of informants. He also complained of various procedural breaches in the collection of evidence. He alleged, with no further details, that he had had no access to a lawyer from the first questioning and, even after his lawyer had been allowed access, the authorities had tried to carry out a number of investigative steps without the lawyer present.', '27. On 26 April 2006 the Zaporizhya Regional Court of Appeal allowed the defence’s request to have the proceedings held in camera to prevent public disclosure of information concerning the network of informants and required all the defence lawyers and representatives to undergo security clearance to continue taking part in the proceedings. The applicant’s wife did not receive security clearance in time for the appeal hearing and did not attend it.', '28. On 22 June 2006 the Court of Appeal upheld the trial court’s judgment.', '29. On 18 December 2007, following a prior appeal by the applicant, the Supreme Court of Ukraine quashed this decision and remitted the case for fresh consideration. It noted, in particular, that the applicant’s right to defence had been breached since the applicant’s wife had been unable to take part in the appeal hearing. It further found that the Court of Appeal had addressed the parties’ arguments in a summary way only, while it should have given detailed explanations in response to those arguments.', '30. On 22 December 2008 the Court of Appeal reviewed the case in the presence of the applicant’s wife. It upheld the applicant’s conviction, reduced his sentence to eight years’ imprisonment and ordered the confiscation of his personal property. The conviction was mainly based on the records of the crime-scene inspection and the testimonies of the applicant’s co-defendants, which the trial court found to be corroborated by witness statements, and other evidence in the case.', '31. On 2 July 2009 the Supreme Court of Ukraine rejected the applicant’s request for leave to appeal on points of law.', '32. The applicant’s twelve-year-old son was with him when he was apprehended on 13 September 2003. He was taken with him to the SBU and remained in the same room with the applicant for most of the time. No other family members were informed of the boy’s whereabouts.', '33. On the morning of 14 September 2014, after the applicant had been formally arrested, his son was returned to his mother.', '34. On 3 January 2004 the applicant’s wife lodged a criminal complaint with the Zaporizhzhya regional prosecutor’s office (“the prosecutor’s office”) in which she alleged, inter alia, that her son had been unlawfully detained at the SBU’s premises between 13 and 14 September 2003.', '35. On 9 February 2004, having questioned the applicant and the SBU officers, the prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings as it had been established that no pressure had been applied to the applicant’s son and that he had been able to move freely and had not been deprived of his liberty. It was further noted that the applicant had not complained of the SBU staff’s attitude towards his son.', '36. On 20 April 2004 the applicant’s son challenged the above decision before the Prosecutor General.', '37. In April 2004 the applicant and his wife lodged another complaint concerning the alleged unlawful detention of their son with the prosecutor’s office.', '38. On 7 May 2004 the prosecutor’s office, having questioned the applicant, his wife and son, as well as the SBU officers and some witnesses, refused to institute criminal proceedings in respect of the above complaint, having found no corpus delicti in the officers’ actions. It was established during the relevant investigation that the applicant’s son had been taken to the SBU’s premises at the applicant’s request and had not been arrested or detained and had been returned to his relatives as soon as the decision to arrest the applicant had been taken; and that the applicant had raised no complaints during his son’s stay at the SBU. It was also noted in the relevant resolution that the applicant’s wife had refused to provide her son’s medical file to prove her allegations concerning the worsening of his state of health and that there had been a contradiction in the applicant’s statements and between his and his son’s account of events. The prosecutor thus concluded that the allegations of unlawful deprivation of liberty or of other violations of the applicant’s son’s rights appeared to be ill-founded. He noted that no intention on the part of the officers to interfere with the applicant’s son’s personal security, specifically his freedom of movement, had been established. Likewise, there had been no evidence that the applicant’s son had been subject to any form of pressure or ill-treatment.', '39. On 11 May 2004 the applicant’s wife and son instituted civil proceedings against the SBU before the Zhovtnevy District Court of Zaporizhzhya claiming damages for the unlawful detention of her son. Following a request of the applicant’s wife of 15 October 2004, her civil claim was joined to the criminal proceedings against the applicant.', '40. On 23 July 2004 the deputy prosecutor of Zaporizhzhya Region quashed the resolution of 7 May 2004 as being premature, given that no evidence regarding the applicant’s son’s state of health had been obtained.', '41. On 31 July 2004, having questioned the applicant’s son’s doctors who had observed him in the course of his care previously, the prosecutor again refused to institute criminal proceedings for the same reasons as before. It was noted, inter alia, that none of the doctors had observed any worsening of the applicant’s son’s state of health and that no worsening of his health had been evident from his medical file either.', '42. On 14 October 2004 the prosecutor’s office instituted disciplinary proceedings against two officers of the SBU for their negligence towards the applicant’s son. It noted, inter alia, that the applicant’s son had not been formally arrested (затриманий) but had been kept at the SBU’s premises for no reason and no measures had been taken to return him to his relatives. The prosecutor further observed that the applicant’s son had not been subject to any form of ill-treatment. He also stressed the fact that the applicant’s arrest report had been drafted only the next day after the applicant’s initial arrest, in breach of the requirements of the domestic law. This resolution had been sent to the SBU for relevant measures to be taken.', '43. On 27 October 2004 the SBU informed the prosecutor’s office that the respective officers could no longer be disciplined as the one-year statutory time-limit had expired. It was also observed in that letter that no violations of domestic law by the SBU officers had been established by a number of investigations into the events complained of and that the applicant’s son had stayed with the applicant at the SBU’s premises from 13 to 14 September 2003 at the applicant’s own request.', '44. On 5 November 2004 the applicant’s wife complained to the Prosecutor General about the prosecutor’s decision of 31 July 2004.', '45. On 25 October 2005, when convicting the applicant, the District Court delivered a separate ruling, in which it listed the procedural violations committed by the investigating authorities in the criminal proceedings against the applicant. The fact that the applicant’s son had remained in the SBU’s premises for about twenty-four hours after the applicant’s initial arrest, without his relatives having been informed of his whereabouts and with no medical assistance provided in view of the stress he had been under, was listed among the violations referred to by the court. The Chief of the SBU in Zaporizhzhya was invited by the court to take appropriate measures in view of the above mentioned violations.', '46. On 25 January 2006 the applicant appealed to the Ordzhonikidzevsky District Court of Zaporizhzhya against the prosecutor’s refusal of 31 July 2004 to institute criminal proceedings against the SBU officers.', '47. On 3 April 2006 the applicant’s complaint was left without consideration on the merits. The court noted in this connection that the relevant investigation files had been joined to the criminal case against the applicant and that therefore the prosecutor’s decision was not subject to appeal outside of those criminal proceedings.', '48. During the proceedings in his criminal case before the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court the applicant and his wife repeatedly requested, referring to the separate ruling of 25 October 2005 by the District Court (see paragraph 45 above), that measures be taken to bring the respective officers to trial for the unlawful detention of their son. The case file does not suggest that in their appeals the applicant or his wife claimed damages in this connection.', '49. On 22 December 2008, in its judgment upholding the applicant’s conviction, the Court of Appeal observed that the complaint related to the unlawful detention of the applicant’s son had been considered by the prosecutor’s office and no corpus delicti under criminal law had been found on the part of the SBU officers. The court made no separate ruling in this connection. The Supreme Court did not address this issue in its decision of 2 July 2009.']",['3'],[],[],"['3', '6']","['6-1', '6-3']",['6-3-c']

Serghides;Helen Keller;Helena Jäderblom;Luis López Guerra;Pere Pastor Vilanova,"['6. The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Dublin, Ireland.', '7. In 2004 he married a Slovak national and the couple settled in Ireland. Their two children, born in 2006 and 2008, are both Irish nationals.', '8. On 6 January 2011 the mother travelled to Slovakia with the two children and they have not returned to Ireland since.', '9. On 31 January 2011 the applicant commenced proceedings in the Slovakian courts for the return of his children to Ireland under the Brussels II bis Regulation and the Hague Convention.', '10. On 1 July and 26 October 2011 respectively, the Bratislava I District Court and, following an appeal by the mother, the Bratislava Regional Court, ordered the return of the children to Ireland as their country of habitual residence and issued several ancillary orders.', '11. The return order became enforceable on 8 July 2011.', '12. On 6 February 2012 the applicant applied for judicial enforcement of the return order since the mother had not complied with it.', '13. On 9 February 2012 the Michalovce District Court attempted to have the mother comply voluntarily with the order. In response, she informed the District Court that she had lodged a request with the Prosecutor General for him to exercise his discretionary power to challenge the return order by way of an extraordinary appeal on points of law (mimoriadne dovolanie).', '14. On 26 March 2012 the District Court stayed the enforcement proceedings on the return order pending the outcome of the mother’s request to the Prosecutor General.', '15. On 14 August 2012 the District Court resumed the enforcement proceedings after the Prosecutor General had found that there were no reasons to lodge an extraordinary appeal on points of law.', '16. On 18 October 2012 and 26 June 2013 respectively, the District Court and, following an appeal by the applicant, the Košice Regional Court, found that the return order was not enforceable. They based their conclusions on the following two grounds.', 'Firstly, they concluded that there already existed a previous decision on provisional measures, which had been delivered by the Michalovce District Court on 16 May 2011. That decision had temporarily entrusted the children to the care of the mother and required the applicant to pay child maintenance in the meantime. Those interim custody rights were to be determined later by the competent courts in Ireland.', 'Secondly, the return order had failed to specify that it was directed at the mother or to give a precise time frame for its implementation.', 'Given the fact that the mother had not been identified as the recipient and that the applicant had not been provisionally entrusted with the care of the children, the order could not be enforced.', '17. Following the unsuccessful enforcement proceedings, the applicant applied to the same court which had delivered the return order, the Bratislava I District Court. He referred to the shortcomings in the order as identified by the enforcement courts and asked the court to specify to whom the order had been directed and to provide a time frame for the return of the children. The District Court concluded that the applicant’s action was res iudicata and dismissed it on 6 November 2014.', '18. In the meantime, on 22 October 2013, the applicant challenged the enforcement courts’ decisions of 18 October 2012 and 26 June 2013 by way of a complaint under Article 127 of the Constitution (Constitutional Law no. 460/1992 Coll., as amended).', '19. On 9 July 2014 the Constitutional Court declared the complaint admissible and on 27 May 2015 it found on the merits that the Košice Regional Court had violated the applicant’s rights, as specified below (“the first constitutional judgment”).', '20. In particular, it found a violation of the applicant’s rights under Articles 19 § 1 (family life), 41 §§ 1 and 4 (protection of parenthood and children, right to child care), and 46 § 1 (judicial protection) of the Constitution, and under Article 6 § 1 (fairness) and Article 8 (family life) of the Convention.', '21. The Constitutional Court found that the Regional Court’s decision had been taken on purely formal grounds and had been arbitrary and in contravention of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Brussels II bis regulation, the Hague Convention and the Constitution. That arbitrary decision had meant that the positive obligations guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention and the applicant’s parental rights had been breached as well.', '22. Consequently, the Constitutional Court quashed the contested decision, remitted the applicant’s appeal against the District Court’s decision of 18 October 2012 to the Regional Court for reexamination and awarded him 3,000 euros (EUR) in compensation for nonpecuniary damage. In addition, the Constitutional Court awarded the applicant everything he had claimed in legal costs (EUR 276.94). It noted that he had made no claim for costs in respect of his observations in reply to those of the enforcement courts concerned by his complaint and concluded that no award was therefore possible in that regard.', '23. The judgment was final and not amenable to appeal.', '24. Following the first constitutional judgment, the enforcement proceedings resumed before the Regional Court, which heard the case on 3 August 2015. It acknowledged that it was bound by the Constitutional Court’s judgment. However, having regard to the considerable length of time that had elapsed, it deemed it necessary to assess afresh all the circumstances decisive for the enforcement of the return order, such as the children’s whereabouts, their health and the possibility of their returning to Ireland. It therefore quashed the District Court’s decision under appeal and remitted the matter to it for re-examination.', '25. On 15 April 2016 the District Court again declared enforcement of the order impermissible on the basis of newly obtained evidence. It relied on medical reports concerning the children’s health, a psychological report referring to negative consequences for them if they were separated from the mother and an opinion from the court-appointed guardian (the Michalovce office of employment, social affairs and family) about the stable family environment they had while living with their mother. It also took into account the children’s wish to stay with their mother and her new husband, their social ties in Slovakia, where they had been residing since January 2011, and the applicant’s lack of contact with them while in Slovakia. Relying on the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Court’s Grand Chamber judgment in the case of Neulinger and Shuruk v. Switzerland (no. 41615/07, ECHR 2010), it concluded that their return to Ireland would go against their best interests.', '26. Following an appeal by the applicant, the Regional Court upheld the lower court’s decision on 3 August 2016 and it became final and binding on 22 August 2016.', '27. In the meantime, the applicant on 22 February 2016 lodged another constitutional complaint aimed at the enforcement proceedings held before the District Court (see paragraph 25 above). He alleged a violation of Articles 6 (length) and 8 (family life) of the Convention and their constitutional equivalents.', '28. On 14 December 2016 the Constitutional Court found a violation of the applicant’s rights under both of those Convention provisions (“the second constitutional judgment”). When dealing with the applicant’s length of proceedings complaint, the Constitutional Court took into account that it was the first time the applicant had raised such a grievance. There had accordingly been no previous constitutional assessment of that matter to prevent it from assessing the impugned enforcement proceedings in their entirety, from when they had been initiated. Having regard to the sensitive nature of the matter and its importance for the applicant’s enjoyment of his parental rights, the Constitutional Court found that the District Court had proceeded with the matter over a long time (for more than four years) and inefficiently (it had stayed the proceedings, delivered an arbitrary enforcement decision on the first occasion, and had taken lengthy procedural steps). Notably, the Constitutional Court emphasised that it was precisely the passage of time which had led the District Court to dismiss enforcement of the return order. It also reproached the District Court for the inadequate way it had dealt with the mother’s procedural requests. It further stressed the particular nature of the enforcement of such return orders and pointed out that they required prompt and efficient decisionmaking that was in accordance with international standards.', 'Moreover, the Constitutional Court found that there had been a violation of the applicant’s right to respect for his family life as a consequence of the fact that throughout the enforcement proceedings, whose length had been in breach of his right to a hearing within a reasonable time, he had been unable to assert his parental rights before the competent courts.', '29.

De Gaetano,"['5. The applicant was born in 1982 and lives in Koper.', '6. After going missing on 4 November 2007, X was found dead near the local Komen-Branik road, close to the town of Komen, on the morning of 5 November 2007. He had been repeatedly stabbed and cut with a knife and then run over by a car. The police were called to the scene, as were the district state prosecutor and the duty investigating judge.', '7. On examining the crime scene, X’s mobile telephone was found in his car. The incoming and outgoing calls and the text messages sent to and from X’s telephone number were checked by police officers at the scene. It appeared from the telephone records that on 4 November 2007 X had communicated only with a person using a certain telephone number, from which a message of an explicitly sexual nature had also been sent to X. After the telephone directory was checked it was established, presumably by the police, that the telephone in question belonged to a woman who happened to be the applicant’s grandmother, with whom, as established on the basis of the official records, the applicant lived. Furthermore, having been informed that X’s mobile telephone had been found, the district state prosecutor requested the duty investigating judge to order the S company – the mobile network operator in question – to produce records of telephone calls made and text messages sent from the telephone.', '8. On the same day (5 November 2007) the investigating judge of the Koper District Court issued an order for a search of X’s home and ordered the S company to provide data concerning communication undertaken via X’s mobile telephone. The S company on the same day submitted to the Koper District Court a disk containing X’s telephone records.', '9. On the morning of 6 November 2007 the police stopped the applicant’s car and subjected him to a so-called “security check” (varnostni pregled), finding a knife (allegedly bearing traces of what could be blood) and a mobile telephone in the applicant’s pocket. After examining his telephone they established that he had used the aforementioned telephone number from which the aforementioned calls had been made and the aforementioned message sent to X. They seized these objects and arrested the applicant.', '10. On the same day (6 November 2007), relying mostly on information found in X’s and the applicant’s telephones pointing to a link between X and the applicant, the investigating judge issued a search order in respect of the applicant’s home and the cars he was using. The state prosecutor furthermore requested that a court order for the obtaining of the applicant’s comprehensive telephone records be issued.', '11. On 7 November 2007 the investigating judge issued an order that the M company – a mobile network operator – provide data concerning the applicant’s mobile telephone record. The M company provided a disk containing the requested data on the same day.', '12. In the course of the preliminary inquiry, the investigating judge ordered a post-mortem examination of X, a DNA analysis and a comparison of biological traces found on the applicant’s clothes and other objects seized during the home search with those found on X’s body. She also ordered a medical examination of the applicant with a view to establishing any injuries.', '13. The applicant, represented by counsel, was heard on 8 November 2017 and was subsequently detained on remand.', '14. On 16 November 2007 the investigating judge opened a judicial criminal investigation against the applicant in respect of the criminal offence of aggravated murder. She, inter alia: ordered that a reconstruction be carried out at the crime scene; appointed a psychiatrist and a psychologist to examine the applicant and prepare opinions; ordered forensic experts in vehicle science and car crash investigations to prepare reports on specific aspects of the case; and again ordered that the M company and the S company provide traffic data relating to X’s and the applicant’s telephones. She also examined a number of witnesses.', '15. On 29 November 2007 the applicant was, at his request, heard by the investigating judge, to whom he admitted to running over X, but submitted that this had merely been an accident.', '16. On 24 December 2007 the state prosecutor filed an indictment for aggravated murder against the applicant, alleging that he had killed X by stabbing him thirteen times and cutting him at least nine times on his head, neck, chest and other parts of the body and running over him in his car.', '17. Following his unsuccessful objection to the indictment, the applicant was put on trial for aggravated murder. A number of hearings were held at which witnesses, experts and evidentiary material were examined and various expert reports ordered and subsequently read out.', '18. On 10 June 2008 the Koper District Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to thirteen years in prison.', '19. On 12 December 2008 the Koper Higher Court, after an appeal by the applicant, quashed the first-instance judgment, finding that the lower court had failed to clarify the facts surrounding a possible shoe imprint on the victim’s back, which could have indicated the presence of a third person at the scene of the crime. The case was remitted to the Koper District Court for fresh examination.', '20. In the retrial proceedings, several hearings were held and the applicant lodged an application for the exclusion of all evidence from (i) the records of the crime-scene investigation until (ii) the records of the last hearing in the first set of proceedings, on the grounds that that evidence had allegedly been tainted by the unlawful examinations of his and X’s telephones. He argued that the examinations of his and X’s telephones had violated his and X’s rights under Article 37 of the Constitution (see paragraph 32 above) and that the relevant court orders had been issued a week too late. He also requested that the police officers who had subjected him to a security check (see paragraph 9 above) and arrested him be examined in this connection. Both requests were refused by the court.', '21. On 4 September 2009 the Koper District Court convicted the applicant for the aggravated murder of X and sentenced him to twelve years’ imprisonment. In view of (i) the expert opinions regarding the shoe traces on X’s back which had led to the conclusion that the presence of another person at the crime scene prior to X’s death could not be excluded, and (ii) the fact that the knife with which X had been stabbed and cut had not been found, the Koper District Court held that there was insufficient proof that the applicant had stabbed and cut X. However, the court found on the basis of the forensic medical evidence that X had still been alive before he had been run over by the car and that the injuries to X’s chest, spine and aorta, which had been the direct cause of his death, had been caused by the applicant having intentionally run him over with his car. It further found it proven on the basis of the evidence at the scene – such as (i) a piece of rubber tube belonging to the applicant’s car, (ii) the applicant’s biological traces found on X’s body, (iii) X’s biological traces found on, inter alia, the applicant’s clothing (which was blood-stained) and on the outside of the applicant’s car – that the applicant had been beyond doubt at the crime scene and had had contact with X. Referring, in particular, to the findings of the experts in vehicle science, who had performed reconstructions at the scene testing the applicant’s versions of events, the court discounted the possibility that the applicant had run over X by accident. The court furthermore found that the applicant and X had known each other, which was confirmed by the applicant’s statements as well as by telephone records and witness testimony. Lastly, the court referred to the telephone records, together with other evidence such as medical evidence and X’s petrol bill, when elaborating on the time of death, finding that it had undoubtedly occurred on 4 November 2007 – probably sometime after 6.24 p.m., when the last (missed) call from X’s telephone had been recorded on the applicant’s telephone.', '22. As regards the procedural decisions taken during the proceedings the court gave the following explanation:', '- It refused a request lodged by the applicant for access to the police notes on the examination of his telephone because it would have been unlawful to include in the file evidence obtained without a court order.', '- In view of the foregoing conclusion that the examination of the applicant’s telephone could have not been admitted to the file, the court refused as unnecessary a request by the applicant for the examination of the officers who had seized the applicant’s telephone (see paragraph 20 above).', '- As regards the exclusion of evidence (see paragraph 20 above) the court explained that the applicant had become a subject of investigation following the examination of the data in X’s telephone, which had not interfered with the applicant’s rights under Article 37 of the Constitution (see paragraph 32 below). It further noted that the examination of the applicant’s telephone had amounted to a violation of the said provision but carried no evidentiary weight, as at that point the police had already obtained the necessary information from X’s telephone. In addition, the court noted that the results of this examination had not been included in the file and had not been relied on by the court.', '23. On 9 November 2009 the applicant appealed, complaining, inter alia, that the judgment had violated his defence rights. In particular, he alleged that the district court should have excluded all evidence from the file because it had been based on the police’s examinations of X’s and his own mobile telephone without the necessary court order. He further stated as follows:', '“It is irrelevant that the police, by [their] unlawful interference with [X]’s mobile telephone, did not directly violate the appellant’s right under Article 37 of the Constitution [“Privacy of correspondence and other means of communication”], because the fact remains that the police obtained that evidence (data from [X]’s mobile telephone) without a court order – that is to say unlawfully.”', '24. The applicant moreover argued that the examination of X’s telephone alone had not adduced enough evidence to arrest the applicant and that that had been possible only after the applicant’s telephone had been examined. Thus, in his view, the impugned judgment should not have concluded that the examination of his telephone had had insignificant evidentiary value.', '25. On 27 January 2010 the Koper Higher Court allowed the applicant’s appeal in part and reduced his sentence to nine years in prison. The court agreed with the applicant that the act of which he had been convicted – that is to say running over X with his car – did not in itself constitute murder with aggravating factors (that is to say aggravated murder), as the firstinstance court had not proved that X had sustained severe physical pain or psychological suffering. However, all the other applicant’s complaints, including the one regarding the unlawful examinations of his and X’s mobile telephones, were dismissed.', '26. As regards the examination of X’s telephone the higher court found that, regardless of whether the police officers had examined X’s telephone before the issuance of the court order, what was crucial was that they had received the court order for the telephone records to be produced before they had identified and located the applicant. Therefore, the examination of X’s mobile telephone, which had constituted an urgent step in the police inquiry, had not been conducted in violation of his constitutionally guaranteed right to protection of the privacy of communication. As regards the examination of the applicant’s mobile telephone, the higher court agreed with the lower court that “the examination of the applicant’s telephone [had been] ... unconstitutional, but this violation had not been important in the evidentiary sense”. The higher court also upheld the lower court’s decision not to obtain from the police their notes on the examination of the applicant’s telephone.', '27. On 8 April 2010 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law, complaining of, inter alia, the allegedly unlawful examinations of X’s and the applicant’s telephones and reiterating the arguments he had put forward in his appeal (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above). In particular, he argued that the police had obtained crucial evidence – that is to say the message with explicitly sexual content – when examining X’s telephone without having a court order to do so, and that his arrest had been based on a subsequent unlawful examination of his telephone.', '28. On 22 December 2011 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law. Firstly, as regards the police examination of X’s mobile telephone, the Supreme Court pointed out that the applicant had not even argued that the examination of X’s telephone had directly violated his own right to privacy. While not excluding the possibility that the examination of a deceased’s person’s telephone might impinge upon the most intimate spheres of his or her dignity, it considered that in the case at hand it had not interfered with X’s right to privacy, as personality rights ceased at death. Neither had, in the Supreme Court’s view, the applicant’s own constitutionally guaranteed privacy rights been interfered with, as the examination had not revealed his identity. Moreover, the district state prosecutor and the duty investigating judge had been present at the scene of the crime when the police had discovered the telephone in X’s car, and the applicant had been arrested only after the court order for the examination of X’s telephone had been issued. The Supreme Court concluded that the police’s examination of X’s mobile telephone had not interfered with the applicant’s right to privacy and that the impugned examination had not been causally related to the incriminating evidence.', '29. Secondly, with regard to the police’s examination of the applicant’s mobile telephone, the Supreme Court noted that it had been undertaken without a court order and referred to the Koper Higher Court’s finding that the examination had been unconstitutional. However, in the Supreme Court’s view, the information on whether the text message with sexual content had been sent from the applicant’s telephone would have inevitably been discovered, either (i) by means of a simple call to the number from which the message had been sent, (ii) by checking the applicant’s telephone’s SIM card (for which, in the Supreme Court’s view, no court order would have been necessary), or (iii) on the basis of a court order, which had in point of fact later been issued. In view of this conclusion, the Supreme Court considered that, regardless of the fact that the police had examined the applicant’s telephone without a court order, the identification of the applicant’s mobile telephone number as the one from which the text message in question had been sent did not constitute inadmissible evidence that should have been excluded from the case file.', '30. The applicant lodged a constitutional complaint, reiterating the allegations made in his previous appeals. Relying on Article 37 (see paragraph 32 below) the applicant argued that the examinations of his and X’s telephone had been unlawful and that the examination of his telephone had violated the aforementioned provision, as well as Article 8 of the Convention. Relying on Article 15 of the Constitution (again, see paragraph 32 below), the applicant argued that the lower courts should have excluded the evidence obtained unlawfully. In particular, as regards the examination of X’s telephone, the applicant argued that he “had not sought redress for the violation of X’s right to privacy (mental integrity) and freedom of communication as he had not been entitled to do so [... but rather] had exclusively pointed out that the violation had occurred and the [trial] court had based its decision [to convict the applicant] on the consequences of that violation ...” In this connection he, referring to X’s “right to piety” (pravica do pietete), disputed the Supreme Court’s view that X’s right to privacy had ceased with his death and pointed out that a court order had been nevertheless subsequently issued. With regard to the Supreme Court’s finding that the evidence in question would have been inevitably discovered, the applicant argued that the domestic law contained a strict rule requiring the exclusion of all evidence obtained by means violating human rights (“the domestic exclusionary rule”). He furthermore argued that there had been a violation of Article 29 (see paragraph 32 below) of the Constitution because the first-instance court refused to obtain from the police their notes on the examination of his telephone.', '31. On 28 January 2013 the Constitutional Court decided not to accept the applicant’s constitutional complaint for consideration, pursuant to section 55b(2) of the Constitutional Court Act (see paragraph 37 below).']",[],[],[],['6'],['6-1'],[]

The applicants were born in 1973 and 1975 respectively and live in P.', '7. The applicants lived with their parents in A, Croatia. In August 1991 the first applicant joined the Croatian Army and left his home, and in November 1991 the second applicant went to live in Germany.', '8. In the second half of November 1991 the Yugoslav People’s Army, together with Serbian paramilitary forces, gained control of A, which thus became a part of the “Serbian Autonomous Region of Krajina” (hereinafter “the Krajina”).', '9. On 6 January 1992 two unknown men took the applicants’ parents, S.C. and P.C., from their home in A. On 7 January 1992 the bodies of the applicants’ parents were driven by municipal employees in a truck to the front of their house. The applicants’ uncle was called and he gave the municipal employees clothes for the burial of the applicants’ parents.', '10. On 7 January 1992 the A police carried out a search of a flat occupied by X in A and found an automatic gun, a hand gun and some bullets.', '11. On 7 January 1992 the A police interviewed police officers R.B., M.S., D.J., V.K., M.T., D.K. and M.M. The police officers, apart from R.B., had been on duty at a checkpoint in R. Street in A between 7 p.m. on 6 January 1992 and 7 a.m. on 7 January 1992.', '12. R.B. said that on 6 January 1992 at about 7 p.m. police officer X had asked him, R.B., as his hierarchical superior, for permission to take a short leave of absence. He, R.B., had granted the request. R.B. did not know when X had returned to duty at the police station, but thought that he had seen him between 11 p.m. and midnight that same evening.', '13. M.S. said that at about 8 p.m. on 6 January 1992 a vehicle had approached the checkpoint and D.J. had stopped it. At that time he, M.S., had been in the barracks. D.J. and D.K. had entered and asked him if he knew a police officer with a birthmark on his face or a Volkswagen vehicle with the number 44 as the last digits on its registration plates, which he did not. At about 10 p.m. the same day, however, he stopped a Volkswagen vehicle which had 44 as the last two digits on its registration plates. The vehicle was driven by police officer X, who was known personally to M.S., D.J. and D.K. confirmed that it was the same vehicle which had passed from the opposite direction at about 8 p.m.', '14. D.J. said that at about 8.10 p.m. on 6 January 1992 a vehicle of Volkswagen make had approached the checkpoint and that he had stopped it. The driver had been dressed in the uniform of the civil police. D.J.’s attention had been diverted by a vehicle which had come from the opposite direction and he had stopped it. At that moment the Volkswagen had suddenly started up and left in the direction of K. D.K. told him that he had not had the time to fully examine the vehicle but that he had seen that the driver and the person in the front passenger seat were dressed in the uniforms of the civil police. He had also seen two civilians in the back seat, a man and a woman. D.K. noted down the registration number of that vehicle. At about 11 p.m. the same day police officer M.S. stopped a vehicle which had arrived from the direction of K and asked the other police officers on duty whether it was the same vehicle they had stopped at about 8 p.m., which D.J. confirmed. The only occupants were the driver and the person in the front passenger seat. D.J. asked them who the other passengers had been and where they had taken them. The driver said that the passengers had been S.C. and P.C. and that they had left them in a village.', '15. M.T. and D.K. confirmed the above events.', '16. On 8 January 1992 the A police interviewed X and Y, two police officers. They both admitted that on 6 January 1992 they had taken S.C. and P.C. in X’s vehicle. On the outskirts of A the police had stopped them. However, the attention of the police had been diverted by another vehicle and X and Y had quickly driven away. They had taken S.C. and P.C. to the village of J. X said that there they had taken S.C. and P.C. out of the vehicle and started walking. He had been carrying an automatic gun and at one point S.C. had attempted to take it from him, resulting in a commotion in which the weapon had fired and killed S.C. After that Y had shot and killed P.C. Y said that X had killed S.C. when they had arrived in J and then forced him, Y, to kill P.C.', '17. On 9 January 1992 the A police lodged a criminal complaint with the B public prosecutor against X and Y, alleging that on 6 January 1992 at 10.30 p.m. in J, a village near the town of A, they had killed S.C. and P.C. They had first driven the victims in X’s vehicle to J and taken them out of the vehicle. X had then killed S.C. with an automatic gun and Y had killed P.C. with a hand gun.', '18. On 28 January 1992 the B County Court opened an investigation in respect of X and Y on suspicion of killing S.C. and P.C.', '19. On 13 April 1992 an investigating judge of the B County Court commissioned a ballistics report.', '20. In August 1995 the Croatian authorities regained control of the town of A. In 1996 the United Nations Security Council established the United Nations Transitional Administration in Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (“UNTAES”). On 15 January 1998 the UNTAES mandate came to an end and the transfer of power to the Croatian authorities began.', '21. On 16 April 1996 the A police interviewed M.C., the brother of the late S.C., who told them that his brother and his brother’s wife had been killed on 6 January 1992. Their bodies had been given to him by the police of the “Serbian Autonomous Region of Krajina” and he had been allowed to bury them.', '22. On 19 September 2000 the C police interviewed M.M., who said that on 6 January 1992 he had been on duty, together with M.B., at the entrance to village J. At about 9 p.m. he and M.M. had been walking towards a ramp by the barracks where all patrols had their meeting point and had heard a vehicle being driven, followed by several gun shots and then a vehicle starting up again. When they arrived at the meeting point they found Lj.Č., D.J. and M.P. there, who told them that “two fools [had] just brought two people in a car and killed them by the road.” None of the officers on patrol dared go to the crime scene. Soon they all went home. In the morning of 7 January 1992 the police from A came to M.M.’s house and took him to A police station, where they interviewed him and told him that X and his friend had killed S.C. and his wife. He had heard that X had moved to Bosnia and Herzegovina.', '23. On 21 September 2000 the C police interviewed the applicants, who had learned from B.Ž., who lived with their parents during the relevant period, that X and Y had been charged with the killing of the applicants’ parents.', '24. On 4 January 2001 an investigating judge of the C County Court (Županijski sud u C) ordered an investigation concerning X and Y, who were not available to the Croatian authorities, on suspicion of killing S.C. and P.C. An international arrest warrant was also issued against the suspects, who had absconded.', '25. On 8 February 2002 the Ministry of the Interior asked the Ministry of Justice whether extradition proceedings would be instituted against the suspects.', '26. On 14 January 2005 Interpol in Washington informed the Croatian authorities that the Department of Homeland Security in Cleveland, Ohio, had a valid location for Y. On 19 January 2005 the Ministry of the Interior informed the Ministry of Justice, asking the latter to institute proceedings for Y’s extradition. On 20 January 2004 the Ministry of Justice asked the C County Court for the relevant documents with a view to seeking Y’s extradition from the United States authorities. All the evidence from the case file was translated into English and on 11 January 2006 the Ministry of Justice sent a “request for [Y’s] temporary arrest” to the US Department of Justice through diplomatic channels.', '27. On 10 January 2007 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the Ministry of Justice that the US Department of Justice had requested some additional documents. On 10 May 2007 the C County Court sent the requested information and documents to the Ministry of Justice.', '28. It appears that on 12 and 13 February 2008 the Croatian and US authorities held consultations in Zagreb in connection with the extradition of Y.', '29. On 8 April 2008 the C County State Attorney’s Office again asked the Ministry of Justice to seek Y’s extradition. On 17 June 2008 the Ministry of Justice sent additional documents to the US Department of Justice in connection with Y’s extradition.', '30. In April 2009 the US Department of Homeland Security asked the Croatian Ministry of Justice for legal assistance in connection with the criminal investigation pending against Y in the United States on charges of attempted procurement of United States citizenship by fraud, and fraud and misuse of visas, permits and other official documents. They asked for all documents related to any criminal offences Y might have committed. This request was forwarded to the State Attorney’s Office on 7 January 2013.', '31. On 26 March 2014 the State Attorney’s Office forwarded the requested documents, translated into English, to the US Department of Homeland Security.', '32. In 2002 the Ministry of Justice agreed that an international arrest warrant should be issued in respect of X.', '33. On 2 January 2008 an investigating judge of the C County Court asked the competent court in Serbia to hear evidence from X in connection with the killing of S.C. and P.C. On 28 July 2008 the Serbian authorities asked for a certified translation of that request and all relevant documents into the Serbian language.', '34. On 13 August 2008 the Croatian Ministry of Justice sent a note to the Serbian Ministry of Justice to the effect that, according to an agreement between the two States, each State party had the right to communicate in its own language and to submit documents in that language without the need for translations.', '35. On 18 February 2009 the Serbian authorities heard evidence from X. He said that the criminal proceedings against him and Y for the murder of S.C. and P.C. had been instituted in 1992 in the B Municipal Court and that they had been acquitted. He also denied any involvement in the killing of S.C. and P.C. On 3 March 2009 his statement was forwarded to the Croatian authorities.', '36. On 16 March 2006 the applicants brought a civil action against the State in the C Municipal Court (Općinski sud u C), seeking non-pecuniary damages in the amount of 500,000 Croatian kuna (HRK) each (about 65,500 euros (EUR)), in connection with the killing of their parents. They relied on sections 1 and 2 of the 2003 Liability Act.', '37. On 9 March 2007 the C Municipal Court granted the applicants’ claim and awarded them each HRK 300,000 (about EUR 40,000), finding that the killing of the applicants’ parents had been an act of terror. This judgment was reversed by the C County Court on 3 December 2009. The applicants were also ordered to pay the State HRK 52,500 (about EUR 6,800) in costs, comprising the fees chargeable for the State’s representation by the State Attorney’s Office. The relevant part of that judgment reads as follows:', '“The plaintiffs in the first-instance proceedings based their claim for damages on the provisions of the 2003 Liability Act .... It is necessary to point to the content of section 3 of that Act, which provides that the obligation to compensate for damage exists irrespective of whether the person responsible has been identified, criminally prosecuted or found guilty. However, having regard to the correct establishment of the facts by the first-instance court, which found that the events at issue had occurred on 7 January 1992 in the village of J, in the then occupied territory of the Republic of Croatia which at that time was under the control of illegal formations of the “Serbian Republic of Krajina” and outside the control of the Republic of Croatia and its lawful bodies, the appellant’s submission that [the killing of the plaintiffs’ parents] ... amounted to war-related damage is well-founded.', 'Section 2 of the Act on the Assessment of War-related Damage ... provides that war-related damage is damage caused by enemy or illegal groups, or legal bodies of the Republic of Croatia, as well as accomplices of these groups and bodies, where that damage occurred directly or indirectly at the time specified in section 1 of that Act (from 15 August 1990 until the end of hostilities and war operations conducted against the Republic of Croatia). Therefore, given the nature, place and time of the events at issue (the killing of innocent civilians in the occupied territory of the Republic of Croatia during the Homeland war), it is to be concluded that the events at issue are to be legally classified as war-related damage and that the appellant is not responsible for them or for the damage thus caused.', '...”', '38. This judgment was upheld by the Supreme Court on 19 June 2012. The court endorsed the County Court’s finding that the killing of the applicants’ parents amounted to war-related damage and added, in so far as relevant, the following:', '“Even though the act giving rise to the plaintiffs’ claim for damages presents certain similarities with a terrorist act since [both] imply [an act of] violence, the act of damage [in the present case] differs significantly from terrorist acts in its features since it contains additional elements and amounts to war-related damage for which the defendant is not liable. This is because the damage did not occur in the territory under the de facto sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia but in the then occupied territory, where there was no possibility for lawful action by the bodies of the Republic of Croatia; this circumstance excludes the otherwise objective liability of the defendant. Furthermore, the act of damage in the present case was not carried out with the sole aim of seriously disturbing public order (this being the aim characteristic of an act of terror) but also involved the use of force, killing and expulsion of the civilian population on that territory with the aim of destroying the internal security and stability of the Republic of Croatia and preventing its lawful bodies from functioning.', '...”', '39. On 1 February 2013 the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint. They argued, inter alia, that in a number of its previous judgments the Supreme Court had recognised the plaintiffs’ right to compensation for damage caused by death during the Homeland War in Croatia, and cited seven judgments of that court adopted between 2006 and 2010 (see paragraph 52 below). The constitutional complaint was dismissed on 9 May 2013.']","['6', 'P1']","['6-1', 'P1-1']",['P1-1-1'],['2'],['2-1'],[]

The first and second applicants were born in 1981 and 2002 respectively, and live in Sofia.', '6. The first applicant married A.I. in 2001 and their son, the second applicant, was born in 2002. According to the first applicant, her husband started abusing her psychologically after the marriage, which grew worse after the child was born.', '7. The first applicant filed for divorce in 2004. She applied for interim measures in the same proceedings, seeking custody of the child while the proceedings were ongoing. The Sofia District Court granted her application for interim measures on 11 May 2005, giving her custody of the child.', '8. In the meantime, in January 2005, the second applicant visited his father for two days. A.I. then took the child back to the first applicant and insisted that they both return to live with him. When the first applicant refused, he put the child back in the car and drove away, saying that she could only see her son at his apartment.', '9. A.I. has kept the second applicant with him ever since.', '10. On 23 June 2006 the first-instance court granted the couple a divorce, finding that the husband was responsible for the marriage’s failure. It granted custody of the child to the first applicant and limited A.I.’s contact rights to two hours twice a month in the presence of the first applicant and another adult designated by her. The decision was upheld in ordinary appeal on 14 June 2007 and in cassation appeal on 1 October 2008.', '11. On 13 May 2005 the first applicant obtained a writ of enforcement on the basis of the decision on interim measures. She brought enforcement proceedings later the same month.', '12. The bailiff scheduled handovers of the child to the first applicant on the following dates: 14 June 2005, 15 July 2005, 25 August 2005, 30 September 2005, 21 October 2005, 18 November 2005, 22 November 2005, 26 January 2006, 5 March 2008, 14 July 2008, 5 August 2008 and 20 August 2008. A.I. did not come to any of those appointments or cooperate with the bailiff.', '13. On 19 September 2005 the bailiff fined A.I. about 25 euros (EUR) for failing to comply with a judicial decision.', '14. Subsequently, A.I. went to the bailiff’s office and challenged her for having fined him. As a police officer, he threatened to fine her for wrongfully crossing the street as soon as she left her office. A.I. was dismissed from the police on 17 January 2007 as a result of that conduct. The order for his dismissal referred to his systematic obstruction of the enforcement of a final judicial decision and to conduct damaging to the image of the police.', '15. On 22 November 2006 the Sofia District Court ordered that the child be removed from A.I.’s home and handed over to the first applicant on the basis of Article 71 § 1 of the Family Code of 1985. On 4 January 2007 the first applicant, accompanied by a lawyer and several police officers, went to the village where A.I. was living with the child and spoke to both A.I. and A.I.’s father. A.I. categorically refused to hand the child over, thus failing to comply either with the court order of 22 November 2006 or the decision on interim measures of May 2005.', '16. The first applicant obtained a writ of enforcement in October 2008 in respect of the final judgment on the divorce and on granting custody to her.', '17. On 11 December 2008, 5 March 2009, 2 September 2009 and 22 December 2009 the bailiff unsuccessfully attempted to hand the child over to the first applicant. On those occasions A.I. either failed to arrive for the appointments or did not take the child to them. When the bailiff and the first applicant visited his house on 11 December 2008, A.I. had left a note on his front door addressed to the first applicant and all accompanying individuals. The note stated that he was firmly opposed to handing the child over to her.', '18. The bailiff fined A.I. in July 2008 and in September 2009 for failure to cooperate in the enforcement proceedings. In 2009 the first applicant did not attend two of the scheduled meetings for handing over of the child, indicating in a letter to the bailiff that prior work commitments prevented her from attending one of those meetings. It would appear that those meetings had been scheduled by the bailiff without prior consultation with the applicant as to her availability.', '19. On 30 December 2009 the Pazardzhik District Court suspended the enforcement proceedings brought by the first applicant in relation to the final judgment of 1 October 2008. It acted in response to an application from A.I. for interim measures (обезпечителни мерки) in the context of proceedings which he had brought to seek the limitation of the first applicant’s parental rights and the granting of custody to him.', '20. The first applicant asked the Pazardzhik Regional Court to quash the suspension order. The court rejected her application in a final decision of 15 June 2010.', '21. Following a change of jurisdiction, the case was sent to the Sofia District Court. The proceedings for a change of custody were terminated by the Sofia City Court in a final decision of 19 June 2013 after A.I. withdrew his application.', '22. In the meantime, between April 2008 and July 2010, representatives of the social services, accompanied by the police, the mayor and the first applicant, repeatedly visited the house where A.I. lived with the second applicant. They met the child’s teachers and his paternal grandparents. On 20 April 2010 the social services sent a report to the police in which they concluded that while A.I. was caring for the second applicant appropriately, the child needed to have contact with his mother to ensure his healthy development.', '23. The social services renewed their involvement in the case in 2012. After A.I. had expressed an intention to cooperate, the social services met him and the second applicant a number of times between September 2012 and April 2014. During the meetings the second applicant consistently expressed the wish to continue to live with his father.', '24. The first applicant brought criminal proceedings against A.I. for obstructing the enforcement of the 2005 and 2008 decisions on the exercise of parental rights.', '25. On 13 July 2009 the first-instance court found A.I. guilty of obstructing the implementation of final judicial decisions. The court observed that A.I. had demonstrated a belief that he was beyond the reach of the justice system and could act with impunity. The court also held that the particularly long period in which A.I. had kept the child, namely between his third and seventh birthday, was an aggravating circumstance. The court nevertheless absolved A.I. of criminal responsibility and, instead, imposed on him a fine of EUR 2,400 as an administrative punishment under Article 78a § 1 of the Criminal Code. The decision was upheld on appeal by the Pazardzhik Regional Court on 8 October 2009 in a final judgment.', '26. On 17 December 2009 the Supreme Administrative Court quashed an earlier decision by the police to refuse to provide assistance for the transfer of the second applicant and ordered it to determine the best way to arrange it. The social services cooperated with the police towards organising such a transfer, which was due to take place on 14 January 2010. That procedure was not carried out because the child refused to go with the first applicant.', '27. The third applicant was born on 29 August 1972 and lives in Sofia.', '28. The third applicant gave birth to a child, P.P., in July 2005 while she was living with the child’s father, Kh.P. The parents split up in March 2009 and the third applicant moved out with the child and his two elder siblings, who were not Kh.P.’s children.', '29. On 1 July 2010, during judicial proceedings on custody, the Sofia District Court determined interim measures, giving custody to the third applicant. She started living with her child alone thereafter.', '30. An expert report of 19 December 2010 drawn up in the context of the proceedings concluded that the child was strongly attached to both parents and had expressed a wish to live with his mother while continuing to see his father.', '31. In a final decision of 29 October 2013 the Supreme Court of Cassation gave custody of the child to the third applicant.', '32. On 5 September 2011, after one of his scheduled meetings with the child, Kh.P. did not return the latter to the third applicant’s home. Since that day the third applicant has only seen the child a few times and the meetings have always been in an institutional setting.', '33. On 13 September 2011 the third applicant visited Kh.P.’s home in order to agree on the child’s return, but Kh.P. prevented the child from leaving with her. Instead, according to the third applicant, he assaulted her in the presence of the child by hitting her on the head, pushing her against the lift, and knocking her to the ground. The third applicant submitted that thereafter she had repeatedly attempted to reach an agreement with the child’s father on the child’s return to live with her, as well as that she had contacted two private bailiffs over the following months but neither of them had taken any action because they considered that the case was too difficult.', '34. On 17 October 2012 the Sofia District Court issued a writ of enforcement to the third applicant on the basis of the court’s decision on interim measures of July 2010.', '35. A first attempt by the bailiff to get the child handed over to the third applicant took place on 11 December 2012 but it failed as Kh.P. did not take the child to the meeting. The bailiff voiced his intention to seek police assistance to summon Kh.P. to the following meeting.', '36. The third applicant met the child on 11 January 2013 for the first time since he had been taken away by his other parent on 5 September 2011. The meeting took place in the presence of Kh.P. and a social worker. The child was reserved at the beginning but gradually warmed up to his mother, told her about his school and other activities, and allowed her to hug and kiss him.', '37. A second meeting between the third applicant and her child took place on 18 January 2013. The child arrived in a negative frame of mind and acted coldly towards the third applicant, refused to take the presents she had brought for him and asked to leave with his father.', '38. In two reports issued on 25 January 2013 and 1 February 2013 the social services found that, while the child had developed a solid emotional connection with the father, he had not lost his bond to his mother. The father had to show approval and encouragement for the relationship between the child and the mother for it to develop healthily.', '39. The bailiff attempted to have the third applicant meet with the child on five more occasions – 28 January 2013, 19 April 2013, 26 April 2013, 31 May 2013 and 28 June 2013. Kh.P. did not attend the first four meetings nor send the child, despite having been summoned to some of them by the police. On 26 April and 31 May 2013 the bailiff fined him for his failure to take the child to the appointments scheduled on those two days. One of those fines was subsequently quashed in court.', '40. When Kh.P. took the child to meet with the third applicant on 28 June 2013, the child became visibly upset and tearful at the sight of her. He refused to hug her or otherwise engage with her. A psychologist present at the meeting concluded that it was impossible to hand the child over at that point in time as he was in a state of psychological stress and had a clearly negative attitude to his mother. As a result the bailiff postponed the handover of the child and urged both parents to actively cooperate so that the child could gradually accept his mother. The bailiff noted that the other parent played a key role in that process and that his constructive attitude was crucial for restoring the mother-child relationship.', '41. In June 2013 the social services recommended that the third applicant, Kh.P. and the child have six months of counselling. Kh.P. disapproved of psychologists working with his son, insisted that such sessions were a form of child exploitation and said that the mere mention of the child’s mother gave his son headaches, which in turn impeded his ability to play football. Kh.P. did not allow the child to see his mother. He informed the psychologists that he and the child slept in the same bed at night and avoided their attempts to discuss the child’s psychological development. Kh.P. instead emphasised his own financial resources and stability.', '42. A psychologist met the child once during the six-month counselling period. The child refused to speak about the third applicant and only referred to her as “M”. The psychologist concluded that the child’s speech was full of inconsistent statements which showed that his attitude to her was being manipulated. The father was categorically opposed to contact between the child and the mother, which meant the child was afraid to express his need and wish to maintain a relationship with her. The child missed having contact with his mother, but could not express that openly for fear of his father’s disapproval. The child suffered from parental alienation syndrome and there was a risk to his emotional and psychological development. On 28 August 2013 the social centre put an end to the counselling because of Kh.P.’s lack of cooperation, in not taking the child to the appointments.', '43. A psychological assessment of the child and the situation with his parents was drawn up in September 2013. It concluded that the child was experiencing a chronic emotional crisis. His categorical rejection of the third applicant was at the origin of parental alienation syndrome.', '44. A new attempt to voluntarily hand the child over to the third applicant took place on 10 June 2014 but failed because the other parent did not take the child to the meeting. The bailiff postponed any further enforcement measures. The following day, 11 June 2014, the child, Kh.P. and the third applicant met at the social centre. Kh.P. stated that he would not allow any meetings in the future and the third applicant has not met her child since.', '45. An expert report drawn up on 17 June 2014 found that Kh.P. exhibited a tendency to verbal aggression, that he continuously demeaned the mother and criticised her personality and that this had turned the child into “a child at risk”. The obsessive and controlling love demonstrated by him towards the child risked making him rebel in the future; the permanent pitching of the child against the third applicant had led to psychosomatic disorders, as evidenced by the child’s frequent headaches.', '46. On 11 July 2014 the third applicant asked the bailiff to schedule a new date for implementing the court’s decision and to not suspend enforcement. She also asked the bailiff to direct the child to attend mandatory sessions with a psychologist and psychiatrist before his actual handing over to her, given that he needed specialist assistance to overcome his feelings of alienation towards her.', '47. On 22 July 2014 the third applicant asked the social services to provide her child with psychological counselling and support. On 8 August 2014 she complained to the Minister of Justice about the bailiff’s inability to enforce the court decision granting custody to her. The Ministry replied on 21 April 2015 that the bailiff had done nothing wrong in the exercise of her functions.', '48. On 3 September 2014 she asked the bailiff to order weekly meetings between her and the child on the premises of the social services, emphasising that that was something to which Kh.P. had agreed but with which he had not complied. The third applicant also stressed that the child’s health and well-being were the most important aspects of the process and asked the bailiff to coordinate all the actions related to the child’s attendance at counselling sessions. On 5 September 2014 the third applicant sent documents to the bailiff issued by the social services directing the child to attend psychological counselling and support with a view to reestablishing contact with his mother. On 7 November 2014 the social services reported to the bailiff that the support work which was to be carried out with the child had not started as the father had repeatedly failed to take the child to the social centre.', '49. On 22 October 2014 the third applicant again asked the social services to provide counselling for her child. The social services replied on 29 October 2014 that they had organised new sessions for the child and had apprised the other parent accordingly. They also informed the third applicant that the bailiff had ordered the child to report to the social centre every Thursday at 4 p.m. in order to meet with the third applicant. The first meeting was set for 30 October 2014 but did not take place as Kh.P. did not take the child to it.', '50. The third applicant subsequently received a letter from the State Agency for Child Protection, which directed her to seek counselling from the social services. The report drawn up in that connection indicated that the negative attitude displayed by the father towards the mother had been adopted by the child, who refused to meet his mother. It was necessary to work with the child for him to overcome his negative attitude to his mother.', '51. On 28 November 2014 the third applicant wrote to the bailiff, copying in the social services, and expressed her concern about the child’s well-being. She asked for the judicial decision granting custody to her to be enforced, pointing out that the child’s well-being was of paramount importance and had to be considered in any related actions.', '52. A report, dated 25 March 2015 and drawn up by the municipal social services, stated that specialists had met with the third applicant on ten occasions. She was found to be cooperative and willing to do whatever was necessary in order to facilitate contact with her child. The report concluded that it was not in the child’s interests to continue to live with his father given that he manipulated him emotionally. The child did not dare to oppose the father as he was entirely dependent on him. The child’s alienation from the mother was damaging for him as he needed her close involvement in his life. It was necessary to impose mandatory psychological counselling on the father in order for him to cooperate, otherwise the child had to be taken out of his home and either entrusted to the third applicant or placed in a “neutral environment”. The placing of the child into a foster home had to be only considered as a last resort, if the father continued to obstruct contact with the mother.', '53. The bailiff scheduled another meeting, for 23 April 2015, to hand the child over to the third applicant but Kh.P. again failed to appear. The bailiff postponed further enforcement to an unspecified date. The third applicant signed the report drawn up by the bailiff, expressing her discontent at the bailiff’s inability to enforce the judicial decision.', '54. On 8 October 2012 the third applicant complained to the prosecutor under Article 182 § 2 of the Criminal Code about Kh.P.’s active obstruction of the enforcement of the judicial decision granting custody to her. The prosecutor opened criminal proceedings and informed the third applicant of his decision on 19 April 2013.', '55. A full psychological expert report on the child was drawn up on 2 February 2014 in the context of those proceedings. The report’s conclusion was that the child should not be forced to see his mother at that point in time. What was needed was systematic good-faith efforts by the father aimed at improving the child’s attitude to his mother. Pressure from public institutions for the child to see his mother was likely to have a negative impact on him and so developing a relationship with his mother had to happen gradually. The report emphasised that if the child were to receive his father’s support he would in all likelihood open up to his mother and develop a close relationship with her.', '56. Kh.P. was acquitted at the end of the proceedings in a final judgment of 7 July 2015 by the Sofia City Court.', '57. On 26 July 2013, the child, represented by Kh.P., brought court proceedings against the third applicant, alleging acts of domestic violence by her. The child alleged, through his father, that he had been put under constant psychological pressure by his mother, which had led to sleep disturbances and restlessness and a fear that she could appear at any time in the street and kidnap him. He claimed that he had developed a headache, felt sick and had even vomited during the latest attempt to reunite him with his mother on 28 June 2013. Experts questioned in the proceedings found that the child tended to identify himself with the father and his active denial of his mother was damaging for him. The experts concluded that it was imperative for the child’s well-being to provide him with urgent psychological therapy.', '58. On 20 December 2013 the first-instance court rejected an application for a restraining order on the third applicant. In particular, the court found the complaint about psychological violence ill-founded as it had been based on the mother’s repeated attempts to have the bailiff hand the child over to her in accordance with the court’s decision. The court held that the third applicant had been right to seek effective enforcement of the decision granting custody to her, just as Kh.P. had been obliged to comply with that decision. The court concluded that the child’s well-being was at risk as a result of the ongoing, open animosity between the parents and ruled that a copy of the judgment should be sent to the social services with a view to them taking appropriate measures. There is no information on file about whether that court’s decision was appealed against.', '59. Kh.P. brought proceedings in 2014 to be given custody of the child. The Sofia District Court rejected his application on 29 July 2015.', '60. The fourth applicant was born on 14 March 1973 and lives in Stara Zagora region.', '61. On 13 February 2012 the fourth applicant’s marriage to R.D. was dissolved by a court decision which also determined his contact rights with his child, who had been born in 2009. According to the decision, the fourth applicant was to see the child every first and third weekend of the month between 9 a.m. on Saturday and 6 p.m. on Sunday, and for one month during the summer holidays. Immediately after an argument between him and the child’s mother on 15 June 2012, the mother started preventing him from having contact with his child.', '62. The fourth applicant brought forced enforcement proceedings in February 2013, seeking the effective implementation of his contact rights. According to him, the bailiff informed him that as the meetings with the child were scheduled to take place at the weekend, when the bailiff was off work, the fourth applicant would be better being accompanied to the meetings by witnesses. Those individuals were to testify about what they saw by signing a declaration every time he encountered difficulties in seeing the child. The fourth applicant attempted to see the child on numerous occasions but his former wife continued to place obstacles in his way. He submitted seven declarations about such incidents, all drawn up in the course of 2013. The bailiff fined the mother once, setting the sum at about EUR 50.', '63. The fourth applicant turned to the Child Protection Agency a number of times and the agency urged the mother to allow contact between the child and the fourth applicant, as set out in the court decision of 13 February 2012.', '64. Notwithstanding those efforts, the fourth applicant submitted that he was still unable to see the child owing to the obstacles created by the mother.', '65. In July 2013 the fourth applicant complained to the prosecutor. In August 2013 the prosecutor refused to open criminal proceedings, finding in particular that the child’s mother had earlier been fined for impeding contact between the child and the fourth applicant, and that it would be unlawful to sanction her twice for the same offence. On appeal, the higher prosecutor returned the case for further examination. In September 2013 the district prosecutor opened criminal proceedings against the child’s mother for obstructing the implementation of a judicial decision. The prosecutor terminated those proceedings on the basis of the fact that the child systematically refused to spend time alone with her father, but the firstinstance court later quashed that decision and returned the case for further consideration.', '66. On 21 November 2014 a different district prosecutor again terminated the proceedings, a decision that was upheld by courts at two levels of jurisdiction, on 17 December 2014 and 4 May 2015 respectively. The highest court involved, the Stara Zagora Regional Court, found more specifically that instead of pursuing a constructive dialogue with the child’s mother with a view to seeing the child, the fourth applicant had resorted to forced enforcement proceedings, which had been unsuitable in the circumstances and had meant the child had been scared to go with him as he had always been accompanied by strangers.', '67. The fourth applicant applied for a divorce on 15 June 2011. The court granted it on 13 February 2012, granting custody to the mother, R.D., and giving contact rights to the applicant. R.D. did not participate in those proceedings; she was represented by a court-appointed lawyer as the fourth applicant had stated that he did not know where his wife could be contacted to be summoned. The fourth applicant continued to live with R.D. and the child at their family home until 15 June 2012.', '68. On the latter date an argument erupted between the fourth applicant and R.D., following which he left the family home. On 21 June 2012 R.D. instructed a lawyer to file for divorce on her behalf. The lawyer informed her that she was already divorced and had been so since 13 February 2012. Her former husband had also married another woman two weeks after that judgment had become final, in March 2012.', '69. On 15 July 2013 R.D. sought a change in the arrangements for contact between the fourth applicant and the child. She expressed serious concerns about the child’s well-being and, in particular, voiced a fear that the father, having acted deceitfully in the past, might emigrate to Canada with his new wife, taking the child without R.D.’s agreement or knowledge. She specified that the fourth applicant had proposed that she give up the child so that his new wife could adopt her. She also stated that he had not sought to have contact with the child since 15 June 2012 and had arrived at her dwelling on 20 April 2013 for the first time with several strangers; that had scared the child and she had refused to go with her father.', '70. The fourth applicant submitted during those proceedings that he had had a hernia operation in July 2012 and had been put on sick leave until 31 March 2013. As a result, he had been unwell and had not been in a position to collect the child, whom he had only seen at her kindergarten. He had been on bad terms with R.D. and that was the reason he had not called to enquire about the child’s well-being. In September 2012 he had attempted to meet his daughter but R.D. had kept the child away from him and had refused to let them have any contact with each other.', '71. The social services submitted a report concluding that as the fourth applicant had not seen the child for many months in a row the relationship between the two of them had broken down. They recommended that contact between him and the child take place, at least temporarily, in the presence of the mother.', '72. On 10 January 2014 the first-instance court granted R.D.’s application for limiting the father’s contact rights with the child to visits without sleepovers. It concluded on the basis of a number of reports by social services that the relationship between the fourth applicant and the child had broken down. That decision was upheld on appeal on 30 April 2014.', '73. On 27 July 2012 the fourth applicant complained to social services that R.D. had been preventing him from seeing his daughter since 15 June 2012 and that the mother was not caring for the child appropriately. He stated that it was the latter’s grandmother, who suffered from a psychiatric condition, who was the child’s main care-giver. The social services carried out an inquiry and established in a report of 3 September 2012 that the child was not being brought up by her grand-mother but enjoyed the daily care and support of her mother. They also found that R.D. had not been preventing contact between the child and the applicant, but that the fourth applicant himself had not been seeking contact with his child. They had informed him that he had to meet his daughter regularly and that she needed the support and care of both of her parents.', '74. On 22 February 2013 the fourth applicant asked the bailiff to start enforcement proceedings on the basis of a writ of enforcement obtained on 29 June 2012. On 27 February 2013 the bailiff asked R.D. to hand the child over to the fourth applicant in line with his contact rights. R.D. replied on 28 February 2013 that the father had not sought any contact with the child since 15 June 2012, when he had left the family home, and had not telephoned to ask about the child’s physical or emotional state. R.D. pointed out that she was aware of the arrangements for contact between him and the child, and had not opposed any meetings between them.', '75. The applicant complained to the bailiff on 1 and 16 March 2013 that R.D. had not taken the child to meet him in a café located about 30 metres from R.D.’s home. The bailiff replied that the fourth applicant was expected to collect the child from the house and not from cafés or other locations of his own choosing.', '76. The bailiff scheduled a handover of the child to the fourth applicant for 12 August 2013 and R.D. took the child to that appointment. However, the bailiff did not enforce it as the child refused to go with her father. The bailiff scheduled a new appointment, 19 August 2013, for a handover for a contact meeting and R.D. took the child along to it. In the meantime, on 16 August 2013 the fourth applicant withdrew his request to use his right to spend a month with the child during the holidays. Despite that withdrawal, the bailiff fined R.D. on 19 August 2013 for not complying with the contact arrangements in favour of the fourth applicant.', '77. The bailiff further fined R.D. respectively on 28 May 2013, 11 July 2013 and 9 October 2013, referring to her continued failure to hand the child over to the father, beginning from 22 February 2013. R.D. brought judicial review proceedings in respect of the last fine, submitting that she had systematically prepared the child for her two-day stays with her father, but that the child had regularly refused to go with him after he had arrived at meetings in the company of strangers. On 6 November 2013 the Stara Zagora Regional Court quashed the fine of 9 October 2013. The court held that the bailiff should have attempted different means for enforcing the judgment before resorting to repeated fines. It set out his prerogatives under the law and emphasised that the bailiff was expected to be present when the child was handed over and to draw up reports on the particular circumstances, instead of relying on declarations signed by the parties or by individuals selected by them.', '78. Subsequently, the fourth applicant requested that further fines be imposed on R.D. for not being at home when he had gone to take the child. The bailiff refused on two occasions, finding that the dates in question had not been part of the applicant’s visiting schedule. R.D. informed the bailiff that the fourth applicant had also arrived at her home in order to collect the child on days which had not been in the visiting schedule.', '79. The fourth applicant informed the bailiff on 28 October 2013 that he would not be in a position to meet his child for the foreseeable future owing to health problems. Thereafter, on 22 February 2014, without prior notice and on a day which was not part of the schedule for visits, he complained to the bailiff that R.D. and the child had not been at home when he had attempted to collect her. Subsequently, on 1 March 2014 and 25 April 2014 he failed to collect the child as scheduled. After being asked by the bailiff to state whether he wanted to resume contact with the child, the fourth applicant confirmed on 2 April 2014 that he did.', '80. The bailiff fined R.D. on 13 May 2014 because she had failed since 22 March 2013 to hand the child over to the fourth applicant. The Stara Zagora Regional Court quashed the fine on 20 June 2014 in a final decision, finding that R.D. had not impeded enforcement. R.D. informed the bailiff that the fourth applicant had failed to collect the child on 11 June 2014 as scheduled.', '81. In a final decision of 4 May 2015, the Stara Zagora Regional Court dismissed the complaint made by the fourth applicant in criminal proceedings he had brought against R.D. in July 2013. The court established that he had divorced R.D. without her knowledge in March 2012 and had continued living with her and the child until 15 June 2012. Immediately after learning later that month about the divorce and the contact regime, R.D. had sought to meet the fourth applicant in order to discuss and arrange his meetings with the child. He had not gone to a scheduled appointment at the end of June 2012 and had told R.D. over the telephone, something he had himself admitted to the prosecutor, that there was nothing to discuss with her. The court concluded that that demonstrated, on the one hand, R.D.’s willingness and readiness to comply with the contact regime and, on the other hand, the fourth applicant’s categorical refusal to have a dialogue with the child’s mother.', '82. It was likewise established that after he had left the family home in June 2012 the applicant had not sought contact with the child for a number of months. He had also not called to ask about her well-being although that would have been fully compatible with his state of health at the time. That had led to the breakdown of his relationship with the child. Further, he had thereafter only sought contact with the child via forced enforcement proceedings in which he had gone to collect the child in the company of strangers. He had also at times sought meetings on days that had not been part of his visiting schedule while omitting to seek contact on days that had been set as part of the schedule.']",['8'],['8-1'],[],['8'],['8-1'],[]

The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Prague.', '10. On the basis of a contract signed on 2 November 2004 and governed by the provisions of the Labour Code, the applicant became an employee of the Ministry of Defence.', '11. On 27 December 2004, the Ministry’s authorised representative requested the National Security Authority (Národní bezpečnostní úřad – “the Authority”) to issue the applicant with security clearance (osvědčení) giving him access to State classified information in the “secret” category (tajné) in accordance with the duties to be carried out by him.', '12. On 1 January 2005 the applicant took up his duties as director of the Department of administration of the Ministry’s property (Sekce správy majetku Ministerstva obrany).', '13. On 19 July 2005 the Authority issued the applicant with security clearance, valid until 18 July 2010, confirming that he had access to State classified information in the “secret” category.', '14. During the year 2006 the applicant was appointed deputy to the first Vice-Minister of Defence (zástupce Prvního náměstka ministra obrany), while continuing to carry out his duties as director of the Department of administration of the Ministry’s property.', '15. On 7 October 2005 the Authority received confidential information from the intelligence service, classified “restricted” (vyhrazené) and dated 5 October 2005. It started an investigation in order to verify the information received. In the course of that investigation the intelligence service provided the Authority with other information, dated 21 March 2006, classified “restricted” and annexed to the security file (bezpečnostní spis) under number 77. On the basis of that information the Authority revoked the security clearance on 5 September 2006. There were two unrelated reasons for that decision: firstly, the applicant had failed to indicate, as he should have done when applying for security clearance, that he held directorships in a number of companies and accounts in foreign banks; and secondly, the applicant was considered to pose a national security risk, within the meaning of section 14(3)(d) of Law no. 412/2005. With regard to that risk, the decision did not however indicate which confidential information it was based on, as this was classified “restricted” and could not therefore legally be disclosed to the applicant. The decision indicated that the facts established in respect of his conduct, as documented in the information received by the Authority on 7 October 2005, cast doubt on his suitability for security clearance and his ability not to be influenced and to keep sensitive information secret, and thus indicated that he was no longer trustworthy.', '16. On an administrative appeal (rozklad) by the applicant, the director of the Authority, after obtaining an opinion from the appeals board, confirmed on 18 December 2006 the Authority’s decision of 5 September 2006, but on partly different grounds. He dismissed as unfounded the complaint that the applicant had failed to disclose certain information prior to being issued with security clearance. However, he agreed with the Authority’s conclusions regarding the existence of a security risk, which had transpired from the investigation carried out by the Authority and from the classified documents.', '17. In the meantime, on 4 October 2006, the applicant had asked to be discharged, for health reasons, from his duties as deputy to the first Vice-Minister of Defence, and from those of director of the Department of administration of the Ministry’s property. He was removed from office on the same day under Article 65 § 2 of the Labour Code (see paragraph 26 below). On 20 October 2006 he signed an agreement, under Article 43 of the Labour Code, terminating his contract by mutual consent with effect from 31 January 2007.', '18. On 19 January 2007 the applicant lodged an application with the Prague Municipal Court (městský soud) for judicial review of the decision revoking his security clearance. He and his lawyer were permitted to consult the file, but the parts classified as confidential were excluded. However, the documents containing information about the existence of a risk, including the confidential documents, had been sent by the Authority to the court, which had access to them. At the public hearing the applicant was given the opportunity to make his submissions and to state what he thought were the reasons for revoking his security clearance. He stated that he believed the information in question had been provided by a military intelligence service which had sought to take revenge on him for his refusal to accept a proposal to co-operate in a manner exceeding his statutory obligations.', '19. In a judgment of 1 September 2009 the court dismissed the application for judicial review. It observed that in a procedure revoking security clearance the relevant authority could only disclose reasons for revoking clearance that were based on non-classified documents and that as regards grounds based on classified documents it had to confine itself to referring to the relevant documents and their level of confidentiality. It found that the approach taken by the Authority, which had not disclosed to the applicant the contents of the information on the basis of which the security clearance had been revoked, had not been illegal as disclosure of such information was prohibited by law. It added that the applicant’s rights had been sufficiently respected because the court had power to obtain knowledge of the classified information and assess whether it justified the decision taken by the Authority.', '20. In a judgment of 15 July 2010 the Supreme Administrative Court (Nejvyšší správní soud) dismissed an appeal on points of law (kasační stížnost) lodged by the applicant as unfounded. It considered that the classified documents in question had shown beyond any doubt that the applicant did not satisfy the statutory conditions to be entrusted with secret information. It observed that the risk in his regard concerned his conduct, which affected his credibility and his ability to keep information secret. The Supreme Administrative Court added that disclosure of the classified information could have entailed the disclosure of the intelligence service’s working methods, the revelation of its information sources or the risk of influencing possible witnesses. It explained that there was a statutory prohibition on indicating where exactly the security risk lay and on specifying the considerations underlying the conclusion that such a risk existed, the reasons and considerations underlying the Authority’s decision being based exclusively on classified information. Accordingly, the reasons for the decision had to be limited to a reference to the documents on which it was based and the level of confidentiality of the information used. It went on to observe that, owing to the special nature of proceedings where classified information was concerned, not all the applicant’s procedural rights could be guaranteed but that the non-disclosure of the exact reasons underlying the decision to revoke security clearance was counterbalanced by the guarantee that the administrative courts had unlimited access to the classified documents. The Supreme Administrative Court pointed out that the report on the result of the investigations carried out by the intelligence service, included in the file under no. 77, contained specific, comprehensive and detailed information concerning the conduct and lifestyle of the applicant on the basis of which the court was satisfied in the present case as to its relevance for determining whether the applicant posed a national security risk. It observed, further, that the information did not in any way concern the applicant’s refusal to co-operate with the military intelligence service.', '21. On 25 October 2010 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court (Ústavní soud), complaining of the unfairness of the proceedings. In a judgment of 18 November 2010 the court dismissed his complaint as manifestly ill-founded. Referring to its earlier case-law on the subject, it observed that given the special nature and the importance of decisions adopted in respect of classified information where national security interests were manifest, it was not always possible to apply all the guarantees relating to fairness of proceedings. It considered that in the present case the courts’ conduct had been duly justified and the reasoning in their decisions comprehensible and in conformity with the Constitution; that they had not departed from procedural standards and constitutional rules to an inordinate degree; and that the Constitutional Court was not therefore required to intervene in their decision-making procedure.', '22. On 16 March 2011 the prosecution service lodged a bill of indictment against the applicant and 51 other persons on charges of influencing the award of public contracts at the Ministry of Defence from 2005 to 2007. The applicant was indicted for participation in organised crime (účast na zločinném spolčení); aiding and abetting abuse of public power (pomoc k trestnému činu zneužívání pravomoci veřejného činitele); complicity in illegally influencing public tendering and public procurement procedures (pomoc k trestnému činu pletich při veřejné soutěži a veřejné dražbě); and aiding and abetting breaches of binding rules governing economic relations (pomoc k trestnému činu porušování závazných pravidel hospodářského styku).', 'In a judgment of 25 March 2014 the České Budějovice Regional Court (krajský soud) found the applicant guilty and sentenced him, inter alia, to three years’ imprisonment. In a judgment of 27 May 2016 the Prague High Court (Vrchní soud) upheld the first-instance judgment convicting the applicant, but suspended execution of his prison sentence for a two-year probationary period. That judgment became final.']",[],[],[],['6'],['6-1'],[]

After the regaining of independence, in 1991 property reform legislation came into force in Latvia and provided that former owners or their heirs could reclaim property nationalised in 1940.', '6. The second applicant and two other individuals were the heirs of A.S. In 1999 they asked the Riga Regional Court to recognise their title to 30 ha of forest in Jurmala (hereinafter “the contested property”) which had allegedly belonged to A.S. and was nationalised in 1940. They also asked the court to recognise their right to receive a plot of land of the same value in Jurmala, as it had not been possible to establish the precise boundaries of the inherited land.', '7. On 7 May 1999 the Riga Regional Court ruled in favour of the claimants. It recognised that there was no question over whether the claimants were the heirs of the late A.S., as that had been established by a court order in 1995. Referring to documents received from the State Archive and the State Land Authority (Valsts Zemes dienests), it also established that A.S. had purchased 30 ha of forest in Jurmala. Referring to section 12 of the Law on Land Reform in the Cities of the Republic of Latvia (Par zemes reformu Latvijas Republikas pilsētās), which provided that any requests after 1 June 1994 for the restoration of property rights should be decided by a court, the Riga Regional Court recognised that the second applicant owned a two-third share of the forest in Jurmala and that the other two claimants owned a sixth each. As there was no evidence of what the precise boundaries of the forest were, the court recognised the claimants’ right to receive a plot of land of the same value elsewhere.', '8. Jurmala City Council was a defendant in the above proceedings and a representative of Jurmala City Land Commission contested the claim, arguing that in 1940 the contested property had belonged to several individuals as undivided property, and the archive documents did not show what part of that property each claimant could be entitled to.', '9. The judgment was not appealed against and became final on 8 June 1999. In April 2000, at the claimants’ request, the Riga Regional Court adopted an additional decision specifying that the contested property had historically been part of the Bulduri estate forest.', '10. After adoption of the above judgment, the Jurmala City Land Commission informed the claimants, the Jurmala City Council and the State Land Authority several times of problems in enforcement of the judgment. The Jurmala City Land Commission maintained that the archive material, which had been obtained after the above judgment had been adopted, did not give information as to the location of the contested property. On those grounds, in October 2000 the State Land Authority asked the Prosecutor General’s Office to lodge an application for supervisory review (protests) asking for the judgment of 7 May 1999 to be quashed.', '11. In November 2000 the Prosecutor General’s Office dismissed the request, arguing that reassessment of evidence could not serve as grounds for triggering supervisory review proceedings.', '12. On several occasions the second applicant complained to the Jurmala City Council and the Jurmala City Land Commission about delays in the enforcement of the judgment.', '13. In order to comply with the judgment, on 6 December 2002 the Jurmala City Land Commission adopted decisions allocating four plots of land to the claimants.', '14. On 27 December 2002 the title to the four plots of land was entered in the land register, and on 8 and 9 January 2003 the second applicant and the other two claimants sold their respective plots to the fifth applicant, the limited liability company Bulduru Muiža, the owner and director of which at the material time was the second applicant.', 'Between January 2002 and October 2003 the first applicant was the president of the fifth applicant, and between October 2003 and August 2007 the first applicant was its chairman of the board.', '15. On 24 October 2003 the President of the Civil Division of the Senate of the Supreme Court lodged an application for supervisory review with regard to the judgment adopted on 7 May 1999 by the Riga Regional Court, arguing that there was a lack of evidence to corroborate that A.S. had owned the property before 1940. As information received from the State Archive had suggested, the contested property had consisted of undivided shares and therefore it could not be concluded that A.S. had been the sole purchaser of 30 ha of a forest.', '16. A copy of that application was sent to the second applicant and the other two parties to the initial proceedings, inviting them to submit comments within thirty days of receipt.', '17. At a hearing on 17 December 2003 attended by the representative of the claimants in the initial proceedings, the Senate of the Supreme Court quashed the judgment and remitted the case to the Riga Regional Court for fresh consideration. The Senate recognised that there was nothing in the case file to suggest that A.S. had owned the contested property.', '18. In January and March 2004 the Bureau for the Prevention and Combating of Corruption (“the KNAB”) asked the Prosecutor General’s Office to initiate proceedings to reclaim the contested property from the applicants.', '19. The fifth applicant entered into various transactions with the contested property.', '20. On 15 and 16 December 2003 part of the property was for a total amount of 7,000 Latvian lati (LVL) (about 10,000 euros (EUR)) sold to A.V. who on 26 and 29 March 2004 sold it for the same amount to the third applicant, the limited liability company Balt Invest Group, the coowner and representative of which at the material time and until February 2007 was A.V. himself.', 'On 23 April and 7 May 2004 the third applicant was registered as the owner of the property in the land register.', '21. On 12 and 19 February 2004 the fifth applicant sold two other parts of the contested property to the sixth and fourth applicants respectively for about EUR 45,000 per each transaction. The purchase contract of 19 February 2004 provided, inter alia, that the seller, namely the fifth applicant, guaranteed that the property was not subject to any dispute, and that seller would be liable for any third party claims made in respect of the transaction.', '22. On 27 February 2004 the fifth applicant sold another part of the property to K.K, who on 18 June 2004 sold it to the first applicant for about LVL 29,000 (about EUR 41,500). The purchase contract of 18 June 2004 provided, inter alia, that the seller guaranteed that the property was not anyhow encumbered.', '23. On 27 April 2004 and on 16 September 2004 (with regard to the first and the third applicants) the Prosecutor General’s Office, acting on behalf of the Ministry of Finance, lodged a claim against the Jurmala City Council, the applicants, A.V. and the two other claimants in the initial proceedings. The Prosecutor General’s Office relied on the Senate’s judgment (see paragraph 17 above) and the request received from the KNAB (see paragraph 18 above). The claim stated that the second applicant and the two other claimants in the initial proceedings had no legal right of ownership over the contested property. The Riga Regional Court was asked to quash the decisions of Jurmala City Land Commission allocating the four plots of land (see paragraph 13 above). The Prosecutor General’s Office also asked for the relevant Land Registry records to be deleted and the rights of the State to the contested property to be recognised.', '24. The claim was based on the section of the Civil Law regulating property claims, such as sections 1041, 1044 and 1063 (see paragraph 37 below).', '25. On 30 May 2004 the Riga Regional Court decided to join the claim lodged by the Prosecutor General’s Office and the claim about the restoration of property rights (see paragraph 17 above).', '26. On 9 September 2005 the Riga Regional Court dismissed the claim lodged by the Prosecutor General’s Office and upheld the decision recognising the second applicant and the two other claimants as owners of the contested property.', '27. Both the Prosecutor General’s Office and the Jurmala City Council appealed against that decision.', '28. On 22 June 2006 the Civil Division of the Supreme Court partly upheld the appeal lodged by the Prosecutor General’s Office. The court revoked the decisions of the Jurmala City Land Commission allocating the second applicant and the two other claimants the four plots of land, and ordered that the corresponding entries be deleted from the relevant Land Registry records. It established that the lower court had failed to address the fact that until 1937 the contested plots of land had been jointly owned by the former owner A.S. and seventy-six other individuals. Moreover, the joint ownership of the land had ceased after the passing of a decree in 1937, and after that date A.S. had not registered his title to the property with the Land Registry.', 'The appellate court also dismissed part of the claim of the Prosecutor General’s Office in which it claimed that the State (represented by the Ministry of Finance) had ownership rights over the property in question. The plots of land were returned to Jurmala Municipality in order for it to finalise the land reform.', '29. In relation to the applicants’ argument that they had all acted in good faith when acquiring their part of the contested property, the court at the outset noted that such criteria as the date of conclusion of a contested transaction and the nature of the infringed property rights have to be considered when assessing the protection of bona fide acquirers. The court also observed that after the second applicant had sold the contested property to the fifth applicant, the owner of which was the second applicant himself, all the transactions involving the contested property (see paragraphs 19-22 above) had been concluded after the Senate of the Supreme Court had revoked the final judgment in the initial proceedings. It also noted that K.K. had sold his respective parts of the property to the first applicant despite the fact that the civil proceedings initiated by the Prosecutor General’s Office had been pending. On those grounds and on the basis of section 1055 of the Civil Law (see paragraph 38 below), the applicants were not recognised as having acted in good faith.', '30. The first, second, fourth and fifth applicants lodged an appeal on points of law. Following an application dated 14 August 2006, the third applicant joined the cassation appeal lodged by the first applicant. The sixth applicant did not lodge an appeal on points of law.', '31. The five appellants complained, inter alia, that the State did not have sufficient interest in the property to justify the fact that the Prosecutor General’s Office had lodged a property claim on behalf of the State.', '32. By a final decision of 17 January 2007, the Senate of the Supreme Court upheld in essence the appellate court’s judgment. With respect to the property claim brought by the Prosecutor General’s Office, the Senate noted that even if the State’s property rights had not been infringed, that did not prevent the court from finding that the second applicant and the two other claimants in the first set of proceedings had had no rights to the contested property. The Senate also upheld the appellate court’s conclusions about the applicants acting in bad faith.', '33. After the above judgment took effect and at Jurmala Municipality’s request the applicants’ entries were deleted from the relevant Land Registry records.', '34. On 16 October 2012 the third applicant was declared insolvent and the Riga District Court appointed E.K. as its insolvency administrator who replaced the former board members of the third applicant. On 19 February 2013 the insolvency proceedings were terminated and on 14 May 2013 the third applicant was deleted from the company register.', '35. On 12 April 2013 A.V., who until June 2012 had been a board member of the third applicant, on its behalf designated a legal representative in the proceedings before the Court (see paragraph 2 above).']",[],[],[],['P1'],['P1-1'],['P1-1-1']

De Gaetano;Gabriele Kucsko-Stadlmayer,"['5. The applicant was born in 1992, and at the time of the introduction of the application was detained in Lyster Barracks Detention Centre, in Ħal Far.', '6. The applicant entered Malta in an irregular manner by boat on 6 May 2012. On arrival she was registered by the immigration police, given an identification number (12D-001) and presented with a Return Decision and a Removal Order. The applicant was immediately detained in Lyster Barracks; her detention was based on Article 14 (2) of the Immigration Act (see Relevant domestic law below).', '7. The Return Decision stated that she was a prohibited immigrant by virtue of Article 5 of the Immigration Act (Chapter 217 of the Laws of Malta) because she was in Malta “without means of subsistence and liable to become a charge on public funds”. The Return Decision also informed the applicant that her stay was being terminated and that she had the possibility to apply for a period of voluntary departure. The Removal Order was based on the consideration that the applicant’s request for a period of voluntary departure had been rejected. It informed the applicant that she would remain in custody until removal was effected, and that an entry ban would be issued against her. The two documents further informed the applicant of her right to appeal against the Decision and Order before the Immigration Appeals Board (“the IAB”) within three working days.', '8. On 9 May 2012 the applicant was assisted to submit a Preliminary Questionnaire (PQ), thereby registering her wish to apply for asylum under Article 8 of the Refugees Act, Chapter 420 of the Laws of Malta. On 21 May 2012 the applicant was called for an interview by the Office of the Refugee Commissioner (ORC).', '9. On 30 June 2012 the ORC rejected her application on the basis, inter alia, that she had failed to support her claim that she was from central/southern Somalia with convincing evidence (in particular, she had shown insufficient knowledge about Mogadishu and her speech displayed phonological, grammatical and lexical features not typical of those spoken in Mogadishu). Her appeal was also rejected by the Refugee Appeals Board (the “RAB”) on 18 December 2012. The appeal decision reads as follows:', '“The Refugee Appeals Board refers to a fill-in-the-blanks form received in its Office on 18 July 2012 and to a legal submission on your behalf received in its Office on 8 October 2012.', 'The Board notes that you travelled to Libya in December 2011, first via Kenya and then via Sudan. In none of these countries did you consider applying for refugee status. During the popular insurrection against the Gaddafi regime in Libya you disembarked on the island of Malta, illegally and undocumented on 6 May 2012, claiming that you were looking for peace, although seven of your siblings still live in Somalia. You also claim that your brother had been killed by a terrorist Islamic organization, Al Shabab, because they thought he worked for the Government. However, you also claim that if there was peace back home, you would be prepared to return. Since you left, as you may know, Al Shabab has been driven out of Mogadishu and Presidential elections have been successfully held and several Somalis are repatriating.', 'Your appeal for the grant of refugee status by Malta cannot be upheld according to law.”', '10. Up to the date of the lodging of her application with the Court on 19 August 2013 the applicant had heard no news about any steps being taken in connection with her removal. In practice Malta effected no removals to Somalia or Somaliland.', '11. Ever since her arrival in Malta the applicant suffered from several medical problems, such as headaches, earaches and fainting, and was frequently hospitalised (see paragraphs 16-19 below). She showed signs of severe anxiety and depression which got worse following the refusal of her asylum request. In consequence, on 1 October 2012, she was referred to the Agency for the Welfare of Asylum Seekers (AWAS) by the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS). This referral was made with a view to obtaining her release from detention in terms of government policy on the grounds of vulnerability due to physical and psychological ill-health. According to the referral form, filled in by an official of the JRS:', '“Sagal has been complaining of several medical problems ever since she arrived in Malta. She had several appointments in hospital was also taken to emergency by ambulance after collapsing in detention. Sagal was also rejected by the Office of the Refugee Commission, causing her to be very depressed. Every time we visit she is in her bed crying and showing signs of severe anxiety.”', '12. In December 2012 the applicant was interviewed (for a few minutes) by the Vulnerable Adults Assessment Team of AWAS, with a view to determine whether she should be released on the grounds of vulnerability. The interview was held in English and the applicant was assisted by another detainee who was not fluent in the language. Her impression is that she was verbally informed that she would be released. On 10 August 2013, that is just under one year after the referral, the interviewers verbally informed her that she would be released. The Government also confirmed that eventually the applicant’s request for release on the ground of vulnerability was acceded to by AWAS.', '13. Nevertheless, up to the date of the lodging of her application with the Court on 19 August 2013 the applicant was still in detention. She hoped to be released in November 2013 after the lapse of an eighteen month detention as per domestic practice at the time.', '14. The applicant submitted that the Vulnerable Adult Assessment Procedure operated by AWAS was developed by the said organisation in order to give effect to a government policy introduced in January 2005 which stated that vulnerable individuals should not be detained. The applicant submitted that although AWAS was not formally charged with the responsibility of this procedure by the law which set it up, in practice the agency had full responsibility for the procedure. However, in spite of the fact that this procedure can have a determining impact on the continued detention of individuals detained in terms of the Immigration Act, it was not adequately regulated by law or by publicly available rules or procedures. The determining authority does not give written reasons for its decision and there is no possibility of appeal, although it may be possible to request a review if more evidence is available or there is a degeneration of the individual’s condition.', '15. According to the Government the Vulnerable Adult Assessment Procedure, which was operated to assess vulnerability, was widely known within the migration sector and a policy document had been issued about it. Forms were distributed to individuals working in the sector such as NGOs. The Government submitted that the Vulnerable Adult Assessment Procedure was a quick process in straightforward cases (such as pregnant women and families with very young children) which were usually determined within two weeks. However, less straightforward cases such as assessments on the grounds of mental health, psychological problems or chronic illness, required a more complex assessment procedure which was therefore lengthier.', '16. A certificate issued by a doctor in May 2012 confirmed that the applicant had been hospitalised on 7 and 8 May 2012 (upon her arrival in Malta) for dehydration, she was seen again on 15 May and 15 June of the same year. She suffered “fits” and was waiting for an appointment.', '17. According to the documents provided by the applicant, after her initial hospitalisation, and apart from the two visits mentioned above, she was seen by a doctor at the state hospital around sixteen times between May and September 2012, and each time was prescribed medication. On these occasions she suffered from, inter alia, epigastric pain and nausea (repeatedly), bilateral conjunctivitis, inflammation, bleeding gums, insomnia, otalgia/earaches (also repeatedly) causing reduced hearing, as well as headaches and toothaches, and dizziness. In none of these occasions was she kept under observation overnight, or hospitalised. In June 2012 following claims by the applicant that she had been falling repeatedly, and that she was having episodes of jerking and tongue biting (which had left evident marks), the doctor requested her referral to a specified department to run the relevant tests to exclude epilepsy – the result of these tests, if undertaken, are unknown to the Court.', '18. A medical certificate issued in March 2013 states that at the time the applicant was suffering from “low mood and insomnia” and had been “complaining of somatic symptoms such as chest pain”. The doctor noted “evident deterioration of her mental state” and suggested she be considered as vulnerable.', '19. An attestation issued by a doctor in May 2013 states that according to available records “she has stayed unwell and been treated or referred to Mater Dei Hospital [the State hospital] more than usual” and that “her health has posed challenges in keeping her at the Ħal Far detention centre and any assistance will be appreciated”.', '20. The applicant was detained in Hermes Block in Lyster Barracks, in conditions which she considered prison-like and basic. She explained that the Block is divided into five zones alike in terms of layout and facilities. The applicant was detained in Zone C for the first seven to eight months and was afterwards transferred to Zone D for a number of months until she moved to Zone A.', '21. She noted that in Zone C there were over eighty (sic) single women and at one point the detention centre was so crowded that there were not enough beds and people had to sleep on metal tables in the television room. She noted that Zone D was less crowded but that it still lacked privacy and sanitation.', '22. She complained about the lack of constructive activities to occupy detainees, overcrowding (particularly during the summer months), lack of privacy, limited access to open air, difficulties in communication with staff, other detainees and with the outside world, lack of information about their own situations, and the lack of proper arrangements for heating and cooling, leading to extreme cold in winter and extreme heat in summer. The applicant highlighted the lack of female staff - in particular she noted that every morning male soldiers barged into her dormitory while the inmates were still asleep to make a head count, during which they removed the sheets to check for their presence. This meant that the applicant had to sleep fully dressed every night, including her headscarf, to avoid embarrassing moments.', '23. The applicant also complained of limited access to medical care, also because of a lack of interpreters to enable communication with medical staff.', '24. The applicant was informed of the AWAS decision to accede to her request and was released from detention on 12 September 2013.']","['3', '5']","['5-1', '5-4']",['5-1-f'],[],[],[]

The applicant was born in 1977 and lives in St Petersburg.', '8. The applicant is the editor-in-chief of a publishing company and of an aviation magazine. He is also the chairperson of the St Petersburg branch of the Glasnost Defence Foundation, an NGO monitoring the state of media freedom in the Russian regions, which promotes the independence of the regional mass media, freedom of speech and respect for journalists’ rights, and provides legal support, including through litigation, to journalists.', '9. He was subscribed to the services of several mobile network operators.', '10. On 23 December 2003 he brought judicial proceeding against three mobile network operators, claiming that there had been an interference with his right to the privacy of his telephone communications. He claimed that pursuant to Order no. 70 (see paragraphs 115 to 122 below) of the Ministry of Communications’ predecessor, the State Committee for Communications and Information Technologies, the mobile network operators had installed equipment which permitted the Federal Security Service (“the FSB”) to intercept all telephone communications without prior judicial authorisation. The applicant argued that Order no. 70, which had never been published, unduly restricted his right to privacy. He asked the court to issue an injunction ordering the removal of the equipment installed pursuant to Order no. 70, and to ensure that access to mobile telephone communications was given to authorised persons only. The Ministry of Communications and Information Technologies (hereafter “the Ministry of Communications”) and the St Petersburg and Leningrad Region Department of the FSB were joined as a third party to the proceedings.', '11. On 5 December 2005 the Vasileostrovskiy District Court of St Petersburg dismissed the applicant’s claims. It found that the applicant had not proved that the mobile network operators had transmitted any protected information to unauthorised persons or permitted the unrestricted or unauthorised interception of communications. The equipment to which he referred had been installed to enable law-enforcement agencies to conduct operational-search activities in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law. The installation of such equipment had not in itself interfered with the privacy of the applicant’s communications. The applicant had failed to demonstrate any facts which would warrant a finding that his right to the privacy of his telephone communications had been violated.', '12. The applicant appealed. He claimed, in particular, that the District Court had refused to accept several documents in evidence. Those documents had included two judicial orders authorising the interception of mobile telephone communications retrospectively and an addendum to the standard service provider agreement issued by one of the mobile network operators. One of the judicial orders in question, issued on 8 October 2002, authorised the interception of several people’s mobile telephone communications during the periods from 1 to 5 April, from 19 to 23 June, from 30 June to 4 July and from 16 to 20 October 2001. The other judicial order, issued on 18 July 2003, authorised the interception of a Mr E.’s mobile telephone communications during the period from 11 April to 11 October 2003. As to the addendum, it informed the subscriber that if his number were used to make terrorist threats, the mobile network operator might suspend the provision of the telephone service and transfer the collected data to the law-enforcement agencies. In the applicant’s opinion, the judicial orders and the addendum proved that the mobile network operators and law-enforcement agencies were technically capable of intercepting all telephone communications without obtaining prior judicial authorisation, and routinely resorted to unauthorised interception.', '13. On 26 April 2006 the St Petersburg City Court upheld the judgment on appeal. It confirmed the District Court’s finding that the applicant had failed to prove that his telephone communications had been intercepted. Nor had he shown that there was a danger that his right to the privacy of his telephone communications might be unlawfully infringed. To establish the existence of such a danger, the applicant would have had to prove that the respondents had acted unlawfully. However, mobile network operators were required by law to install equipment enabling law-enforcement agencies to perform operational-search activities and the existence of that equipment did not in itself interfere with the privacy of the applicant’s communications. The refusal to admit the judicial orders of 8 October 2002 and 18 July 2003 in evidence had been lawful, as the judicial orders had been issued in respect of third persons and were irrelevant to the applicant’s case. The City Court further decided to admit in evidence and examine the addendum to the service provider agreement, but found that it did not contain any information warranting reconsideration of the District Court’s judgment.', '14. It can be seen from a document submitted by the applicant that in January 2007 an NGO, “Civilian Control”, asked the Prosecutor General’s office to carry out an inspection of the Ministry of Communications’ Orders in the sphere of interception of communications in order to verify their compatibility with federal laws. In February 2007 an official from the Prosecutor General’s office telephoned “Civilian Control” and asked for copies of the unpublished attachments to Order No. 70, saying that the prosecutor’s office had been unable to obtain them from the Ministry of Communications. In April 2007 the Prosecutor General’s office refused to carry out the requested inspection.']",['8'],['8-1'],[],[],[],[]

The applicant was born on 30 August 1949 and lives in Nicosia.', '6. The applicant was employed at the Department of Lands and Surveys on 1 December 1971. On 1 January 1996 he was promoted to the position of assistant officer and on 2 February 1998 he was authorised by the director of the department to sign payment orders as authorising officer. On 13 May 2002 a complaint was made by the director following an irregularity in a compulsory acquisition case. It emerged from the investigation that a series of cheques had been issued as alleged compensation to owners of land that had been compulsorily acquired, but that the cheques had never reached the payees named on them.', '7. A number of criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant and an accomplice. It also appears that a third person was charged but those proceedings were terminated following the filing of a nolle prosequi by the AttorneyGeneral. The proceedings against the applicant involved a total of 223 criminal charges.', '8. On 18 January 2005 the applicant received concurrent sentences ranging from two to five years’ imprisonment from the Nicosia Assize Court (no. 18115/02) on a plea of guilty, following a plea bargain to twenty-', 'four charges concerning a number of offences. These included, inter alia, obtaining the amount of 225,643.67 Cyprus pounds (CYP) (approximately 390,000 euros) by false pretences, issuing false documents, forging cheques, abuse of office, and concealment. Part of the agreement reached between the parties was that the applicant would repay the sum of CYP 150,000 (approximately 255,000 euros), and a confiscation order for that sum was issued in respect of his property. In imposing the sentences the Assize Court also took into consideration another eight cases pending against the applicant before it as well as the District Court of Nicosia.', '9. The applicant lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court against his sentence (criminal appeal no. 22/05).', '10. Following the applicant’s conviction, and having received the Attorney-General’s advisory opinion that the offences committed involved dishonesty or moral turpitude, the PSC instituted disciplinary proceedings against the applicant. Similar proceedings were also instituted against his accomplice, on whom the PSC imposed compulsory retirement pursuant to section 79(1)(i) of the Public Service Law of 1990 (Law 1/1990; hereinafter “the Public Service Law”; see paragraph 43 below).', '11. By a letter dated 13 April 2005 the PSC informed the applicant of the Attorney-General’s opinion and invited him to appear before it on 17 May 2005 and to make representations before proceeding with the imposition of a disciplinary penalty.', '12. The PSC convened on 17 May 2005. The applicant’s lawyer requested a month to prepare his pleadings, as he had only recently been appointed and in view of the special nature of the case. The PSC granted the request.', '13. On 13 June 2005, the applicant, who was represented by a lawyer, was heard by the PSC. He put forward a number of mitigating factors, which included his dire financial situation following suspension from his duties, the fact that he had paid off most of the sum agreed upon with the authorities, the conviction and sentence he had received from the Assize Court, his significant years of service, and the less severe punishment imposed on his accomplice. He also submitted a socio-economic report by the Department of Social Welfare Services.', '14. On 13 June 2005 the PSC decided to dismiss the applicant. In its decision the PSC observed that this case had been one of the most serious cases it had been faced with. The conception and planning of the crimes committed showed a well-set-up fraud which had dealt a blow to the prestige and credibility of the procedures of the Department of Lands and Surveys and also to the image of the Public Service in general. The PSC noted that the offences of which the applicant had been convicted included some of the most serious offences against property, as well as abuse of office and concealment. The gravity of the offences was evident from the severity of the sentences applicable under the law, the substantial sum the applicant had secured through his unlawful actions, and the fact that eight more cases pending against him concerning similar offences had been taken into account by the Nicosia Assize Court when imposing sentence. The PSC also pointed out that the applicant had faced 223 charges in total, which was unprecedented for Cyprus and which disclosed the seriousness and the magnitude of the case.', '15. In reaching its decision the PSC observed that it had taken into account the circumstances and conditions under which the applicant had committed the offences. He had been authorised to sign payment orders and had been entrusted by the Republic with the important post of promoting cases concerning compulsory acquisition and serving citizens involved in these cases. The applicant, however, did not live up to his responsibilities, exploited his position, and developed his criminal activities with unprecedented effrontery and recklessness. He had been the mastermind, instigator and main executor of the criminal activities.', '16. The PSC also noted that it had taken into consideration what had been said by the applicant’s counsel in mitigation, in particular, the applicant’s personal and family circumstances, as well as the fact that he had undertaken to compensate for the damage and/or part of the damage suffered by the Republic as a consequence of his criminal acts. Further, the PSC pointed out that he had been the main protagonist and this had been stressed by the Assize Court when distinguishing the sentence passed on him from that passed on his co-accused.', '17. Pursuant to section 79(7) of the Public Service Law (see paragraph 43 below), the disciplinary penalty of dismissal resulted in the forfeiture of the entire applicant’s public service retirement benefits (hereinafter “retirement benefits”). This entailed the loss of a retirement lump sum and a monthly pension.', '18. Lastly, the PSC decided that the part of the applicant’s salary that had been withheld during the period of his suspension from service would not be returned to him.', '19. Up to the date of his dismissal the applicant had worked for thirty-three years in the public service.', '20. On 23 March 2006 the applicant withdrew his appeal.', '21. Pursuant to section 79(7) of the Public Service Law (see paragraph 43 below), his wife received a widow’s pension. This amounted to 15,600 euros (EUR) per year.', '22. On 26 August 2005 the applicant brought a recourse before the Supreme Court (revisional jurisdiction) under Article 146 of the Constitution, seeking the annulment of the PSC’s decision to dismiss him from the Public Service and of the consequent forfeiture of his pension rights (recourse no. 994/2005).', '23. The applicant claimed that the forfeiture of his retirement benefits had been in breach of Article 23 of the Constitution and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. In this respect the applicant argued that his pension rights constituted a “possession”, and that their automatic forfeiture consequent to his dismissal was disproportionate.', '24. On 2 April 2007 the Supreme Court, in an ex tempore decision, held that the recourse was admissible. The court observed that the case concerned the discretion of the PSC in deciding on the dismissal, taking into account all relevant parameters and, in particular, the consequences dismissal would have for the applicant. Therefore, the decision on the penalty and the consequences were very closely linked, bringing to the forefront the principle of proportionality as the main aspect of the PSC’s discretion. It was obvious from the PSC’s decision that in exercising its discretion when choosing the penalty to be imposed it had taken into account the automatic, as it considered, by law, loss of retirement benefits. As a result the court concluded that the extreme severity of the case justified, despite its grave repercussions on the applicant’s retirement rights, the penalty of dismissal. If in the end the court were to accept the applicant’s claims, the setting aside of the penalty of dismissal could not be excluded. The Supreme Court therefore concluded that it could continue to examine the merits of the recourse.', '25. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court dismissed the recourse, but did not award costs against the applicant in view of the nature of the legal issues raised.', '26. The Supreme Court, after having ruled that the retirement benefits of a public servant in Cyprus constituted a possession under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, went on to examine whether or not there had been a violation of the applicant’s rights under this provision. Drawing guidance from the Court’s case-law, and in particular the judgments in the case of Azinas v. Cyprus (no. 56679/00, 20 June 2002, and [GC], no. 56679/00, ECHR 2004III), and the decision in the case of Banfield v. the United Kingdom ((dec.), no. 6223/04, ECHR 2005XI), the Supreme Court first pointed to those factors which justified the deprivation of the right to property in this case. One such main factor in the court’s view was the gravity of the offences committed. It considered in this respect that the characterisation of the case by the PSC as one of the most serious in its history did not appear to be an exaggeration. The impression given by the offences was such that not only did they entail a well-organised fraud but they also, most importantly, as the PSC asserted, dealt a blow to the prestige and trustworthiness of the administration. The court considered that sentencing the applicant to five years’ imprisonment, as well as dismissing him, did not necessarily exhaust the limits of the discretion of the State to put things right. Besides, as in Azinas, the non-deprivation of pension benefits in the case of a pension plan to which the employee did not make contributions would amount to rewarding the applicant.', '27. At the same time, the serious consequences of the applicant’s punishment - a sentence of five years’ imprisonment and dismissal - had also to be considered, particularly the financial difficulties arising from the deprivation of the said rights as an additional “punishment” for the applicant and his family. The court observed that this was an important factor to be taken into account, according to the circumstances of each case. If the deprivation had not been automatic but discretionary within the framework of enacted procedures, as in England, it would have been possible to examine whether there should be a deprivation and to what extent. The court noted in this respect that it would indeed be good for the State to consider seriously the prospect of an amendment to the law so as to make the system more flexible and fairer in each case. Moreover, there was also the fact that the applicant had to a great extent returned the money he had embezzled, a fact which, although the PSC had said that it had taken it into account, did not appear to have affected its decision, since the punishment imposed on the applicant was, of the ten forms provided for, the extreme one of dismissal instead of choosing the second most serious form of punishment, that of compulsory retirement, which would not have entailed the loss of retirement rights.', '28. In the end, however, the Supreme Court considered that the fact that the case in question arose and was heard on the basis of a different statutory regime from that in Azinas as regards the consequences of dismissal entailing the loss of pension rights, tilted the scales, albeit slightly, in favour of the Republic. The proviso in section 79(7) that the applicant’s pension from the day of his dismissal would be paid to his wife and dependent children as if he had died on that date reduced for the family the hardship resulting from the dismissal. Despite this, the court observed that it was likely that there would be cases with even more dire consequences for the dismissed employee, such as when there was no wife or dependent children, or their relationship was such that the dismissed employee could not reasonably expect to benefit through them. Nothing, however, had been said to include the present case among those cases, except for the theoretical possibility that his wife could die before the applicant. The court stated that, if matters were otherwise, it was likely that it would have ruled differently.', '29. Finally, the Supreme Court stressed that the competent bodies should seriously study the possibility of amending the statutory framework on the basis of the law in force in England, so that deprivation of retirement rights was not automatic but could be looked at with the help of enacted procedures and with the exercise of discretion in order that the PSC might determine, by means of a reasoned decision, the extent to which it was just to forfeit, if at all, in any particular case, according to the individual’s special circumstances and needs. The Supreme Court considered that both the rule of law and the modern conception of individual justice demanded this.', '30. On 5 June 2007 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court (appellate revisional jurisdiction; appeal no. 78/2007). He first challenged the first-instance finding concerning section 79(7) of the Public Service Law. He submitted that this section was contrary to Article 23 of the Cyprus Constitution and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, as the forfeiture of his retirement benefits had been automatic, without the exercise of any discretionary power. In this respect he argued that the first-instance court had applied the proportionality principle incorrectly during the examination of the penalty imposed by the PSC, and therefore had been wrong when it decided that the measure was proportionate and in line with the Convention. Secondly, the applicant claimed that the finding of the first-instance court that the consequences of this decision were reduced because he was married and thus his wife and dependent children would receive a pension, was discriminatory on the ground of marital status and thus in violation of Article 28 of the Constitution.', '31. On 12 June 2007 the respondent Government also appealed (appeal no. 81/2007) challenging the first-instance findings (a) that in the present case the retirement benefits could be considered a “possession”; (b) that in the disciplinary dismissal of a public servant there was no enacted framework providing for the exercise of discretion as to whether the retirement benefits would be granted; and (c) that the payment of the pension to the applicant’s wife was the only essential factor which tilted the scales in favour of the Republic.', '32. On 18 May 2010 the Supreme Court dismissed both appeals without awarding costs, in view of the importance of the matter raised. It agreed with the first-instance court’s finding that the right to a pension and its conditions constituted a possession of the employee. This right was created by the appointment of the employee. The fact that a pension was given to the wife and dependent children suggested that pension benefits were considered as “property” which could be transferred. In this respect the court referred to its judgment in the case of Pavlou v. the Republic (revisional appeal no. 161/2006, (2009) 3 CLR 1402; see paragraph 46 below) and the Court’s judgment in the case of Apostolakis v. Greece (no. 39574/07, 22 October 2009).', '33. The court went on to find, however, that the deprivation of the applicant’s retirement benefits had been justified. In this respect, the court noted that the PSC had chosen the penalty of dismissal under section 79(7) of the Public Service Law, after exercising its discretion and after considering the consequences and the fact that such a penalty was in the public interest. The first-instance court had examined whether the imposition of the penalty of dismissal, which brought about the automatic forfeiture of retirement benefits, was disproportionate. It had examined whether the PSC, when exercising its discretion, had applied the principle of proportionality in deciding on the penalty of dismissal, which itself resulted in the automatic deprivation of retirement rights. In this respect it held that the PSC had exercised its discretion when deciding to impose the penalty of dismissal. The PSC had had a variety of available penalties at its disposal, such as compulsory retirement, which did not bring about the forfeiture of the pension. It decided, however, in view of the offences committed by the applicant, that such deprivation was justified.', '34. The Supreme Court pointed out that the European Court of Human Rights had acknowledged that the administration had wide discretion in deciding on such matters.', '35. It went on to agree with the first-instance court that the deprivation of the applicant’s retirement benefits had been justified in view of the seriousness of the offences, which had dealt a blow to the trustworthiness and credibility of the administration. The relevant domestic law provision was aimed at discouraging public servants from committing serious offences and at protecting the smooth running of the administration. Section 79(7) of the Public Service Law was not contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, since the deprivation of retirement benefits was not a punishment on its own, but a consequence of the imposition of the penalty of dismissal.', '36. The court went on to distinguish the applicant’s case from that of Apostolakis, in which the forfeiture had been automatic following a criminal conviction and had entailed deprivation of both pension and social security rights and therefore of all means of subsistence. In the present case, although the applicant had been deprived of his retirement benefits as a public servant, he had been entitled to receive benefits from the Social Insurance Fund, which were calculated on the basis of contributions made by the employer and the employee. Referring to the Court’s judgment in the case of Wieczorek v. Poland (no. 18176/05, 8 December 2009), it found that the applicant had not been deprived of all means of subsistence.', '37. As to the question of discrimination due to marital status, raised by the applicant, the Supreme Court held that the first-instance court’s comments on the matter did not support the applicant’s claim of discrimination. The comments in question had been made on a hypothetical basis and did not apply to the present case.', '38. Lastly, the Supreme Court dealt with the remaining grounds of appeal put forward by the Government. It observed that the first-instance decision was to the effect that in the event of dismissal the law did not provide for a procedure concerning the exercise of discretion for forfeiting retirement rights, but it did not say that it was not possible to exercise discretion on the matter, since it recognised that there was a choice between dismissal entailing forfeiture of rights and compulsory retirement, which did not. Finally, it pointed out that the first-instance court had set out in its decision all the facts which it had taken into account in deciding on the proportionality of the forfeiture, and had rightly concluded that the payment of the pension to the wife meant that the deprivation was not disproportionate. The court did not award costs in view of the important issues raised.', '39. The applicant has been receiving a social security pension from the Social Insurance Fund since 31 August 2012, when he reached the age of sixty-three. The pension therefore received by his wife pursuant to section 79(7) of the Public Service Law was then reduced by the complementary sum received by him from the Social Insurance Fund. According to a letter dated 28 November 2012 sent to her by State’s Treasury, her pension was reduced by EUR 854,94 per month.']",[],[],[],['P1'],['P1-1'],['P1-1-1']

Mr Kadirzhanov was born in 1970. He currently lives in Orel, Russia.', '8. In July 2010 the applicant arrived in the town. Before June 2012 he had not lodged any applications for refugee status or temporary asylum.', '9. On 3 October 2011 the Kyrgyz authorities charged the applicant in absentia with violent crimes committed in the course of the inter-ethnic violence of June 2010, when a group of individuals had barricaded a road near the village of Suzak, which had led to a number of deaths.', '10. On 11 November 2011 the Suzak District Court ordered the applicant’s detention for two months. The Kyrgyz authorities also added the applicant’s name to an international wanted list.', '11. On 14 May 2012 the applicant was arrested in Orel and placed in remand prison no. 1. It appears that he first learnt about the criminal prosecution and charges against him in Kyrgyzstan on that day. He denied his involvement in the June 2010 violence. On an unspecified date, the applicant was provided with the services of a State-appointed lawyer for the purposes of the extradition proceedings.', '12. On 15 May 2012 the Severnyy district prosecutor of Orel ordered the applicant’s custodial detention on the basis of the decision of 11 November 2011, referring to Article 61 of the 1993 CIS Convention on Legal Assistance and Legal Relations in Civil, Family and Criminal Matters (“the Minsk Convention”).', '13. The Kyrgyz authorities confirmed their intention to seek the applicant’s extradition.', '14. On 12 June 2012 the Kyrgyzstan Prosecutor General’s Office lodged a formal extradition request with its Russian counterpart.

On 10 July 2012 the Severnyy District Court of Orel examined the Severnyy district prosecutor’s request to extend the applicant’s detention for four months. Noting that the prosecutor had not substantiated the need for such a long period by reference to specific measures to be taken during the “extradition check” procedure (экстрадиционная проверка) and noting the need to take account of the upcoming decision on the application for refugee status (which could bar further extradition proceedings), the judge extended the applicant’s detention for one month only, until 14 August 2012. On 25 July 2012 the Orel Regional Court upheld the extension order.', '18. On 25 July 2012 the applicant’s lawyer made submissions to the Russian Prosecutor General’s Office in relation to, inter alia, the risk of illtreatment in the event of the applicant’s extradition to Kyrgyzstan.', '19. On 9 August 2012 the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote to the Russian Prosecutor General’s Office, indicating that it had no specific information disclosing any impediment to the applicant’s extradition.

The authority relied on a note dated 13 July 2012 by the Federal migration authority on the general political and human rights situation in Kyrgyzstan in 2010-11. The applicant’s allegation that he had received threats from ethnic Kyrgyz while in Kyrgyzstan was dismissed, because the reason behind the threats had been his wealth, not ethnic origin. The applicant appealed to the Federal migration authority. On 25 December 2012 his appeal was dismissed. The risk of ill-treatment remained unassessed.', '22. In the meantime, on 13 November 2012 the Severnyy District Court extended the term of the applicant’s detention until 14 February 2013, despite the lawyer’s request to release the applicant on bail. The Orel Regional Court upheld the decision on appeal on 28 November 2012 arguing, inter alia, that there was no reason to vary the preventive measure in accordance with Article 110 of the CCrP.', '23. On 11 February 2013 the Severnyy District Court extended the applicant’s detention until 14 May 2013. The applicant lodged an appeal with the court on the same day.

On 25 September 2013 the Orel regional deputy prosecutor ordered the applicant’s release from custody under, inter alia, Articles 103 and 110 of the CCrP. He reasoned that the examination of the case pending before the Court, which had indicated interim measures pursuant to Rule 39 of the Rules of Court in respect of the applicant, would last longer than the maximum period of detention permissible. The deputy prosecutor varied the preventive measure to release from custody, after a personal guarantee was given by N.

The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in the Ivanovo Region.', '6. According to the applicant, in 1991, at the age of fifteen, he moved to Russia from Georgia with his parents. In 1998 he settled in Shuya, Ivanovo Region, whereas his parents moved back to Georgia.', '7. On 18 November 1999 the Shuya Town Court of the Ivanovo Region found the applicant guilty of extortion and theft of a passport, and sentenced him to three years and one month’s imprisonment. According to the applicant, in order to spare his mother’s feelings, he told the prosecuting authorities that his name was Shermandin Goderziyevich Mazmishvili. On 4 June 2001 the applicant was released on parole. Upon release he was issued with an ID card in the name of Shermandin Goderziyevich Mazmishvili.', '8. On 26 April 2005 the Town Court found the applicant guilty of theft and sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment. Again he claimed that his name was Shermandin Goderziyevich Mazmishvili and presented the relevant ID card. On 1 June 2007 the applicant was released on parole.', '9. The applicant was in a relationship with Ms K. On 29 February 2008 Ms K. gave birth to a girl. On 21 September 2009 the applicant was recognised as the girl’s father. On 22 September 2009 the applicant and K. got married. On 20 December 2011 Ms K. gave birth to the couple’s second daughter. According to the Government, Ms K. and her two daughters are Russian nationals.', '10. According to the Government, on 19 June 2007 the applicant was found administratively liable for failing to have his residency in Russia duly authorised.', '11. On 26 June 2007 the applicant was registered as a migrant under the name of Mazmishvili. The registration remained valid until 26 October 2007.', '12. It appears that on an unspecified date the applicant asked the Russian migration authorities to issue him with a Russian passport indicating that his name was Shota Petrovich Adeishvili. Following their refusal, the applicant lodged a claim with the Digora District Court of the Northern Osetiya and Alaniya Republic, asking the court to confirm that he had been residing permanently in Russia since 1991.', '13. On 30 October 2007 the District Court granted the applicant’s request. The court based its findings on the applicant’s birth certificate in the name of Shota Petrovich Adeishvili submitted by him, a certificate issued by the Digora municipal authorities and the testimony of Ms G., stating that the applicant had been renting a flat from her since 1991.', '14. On 8 July 2008 the applicant received a Russian passport in the name of Shota Petrovich Adeishvili.', '15. On 10 February 2010 the regional migration service asked the District Court to quash the judgment of 30 October 2007 and remit the matter for new consideration.', '16. On 17 March 2010 the District Court quashed the judgment of 30 October 2007, noting that the certificate confirming the applicant’s residence in Digora had not in fact been issued by the town administration. The matter was remitted for fresh consideration.', '17. On 31 March 2010 the District Court noted that the applicant, who had been duly notified of the date and time of the court hearing, had failed to appear in court on two occasions. The Court left the matter without consideration on the merits and discontinued the proceedings. The applicant did not appeal.', '18.

On 8 July 2010 the applicant was arrested and taken to a police station where he spent the whole day. His passport was confiscated. On the same day an expert from the regional department of the interior confirmed that the applicant’s fingerprints corresponded to those belonging to Shermandin Goderziyevich Mazmishvili.', '20. In the evening of 8 July 2010 the applicant was taken to the Shuya Town Court, which started the hearing at 11 p.m. The applicant was represented by a State-appointed lawyer. The Town Court considered that the applicant was Shermandin Goderziyevich Mazmishvili. It found that, as a person without citizenship, he had failed to have his residency in Russia duly authorised. It therefore imposed a fine on him and ordered his expulsion from Russia to Georgia. The court also held that the applicant should be remanded in custody pending expulsion until 8 September 2010. In particular, the court noted as follows:', '“When deciding whether to expel Sh. G. Mazmishvili and taking into account that the defendant has a family and a minor child, the court sees no reason not to expel [him] in view of the offences he has committed in Russia, his unlawful acquisition of a Russian passport and his lack of employment.”', '21. The applicant appealed against the judgment of 8 July 2010 alleging, inter alia, that the State-appointed lawyer had not carried out his defence effectively, and that the court had failed to provide him with a copy of the decision of 17 March 2010 or a record of his own questioning of 14 September 1999.', '22. On 26 July 2010 the Ivanovo Regional Court upheld the judgment of 8 July 2010 on appeal. The applicant was represented by counsel of his own choosing.', '23. On 18 August 2010 the police sent the documents concerning the applicant’s expulsion to the Georgian authorities.', '24. On 30 August 2010 the President of the Regional Court upheld the judgments of 8 and 26 July 2010.', '25. It appears that the regional migration service could not prepare the documents necessary to expel the applicant to Georgia and asked the Town Court to extend the applicant’s detention pending expulsion.', '26. On 6 September 2010 the Town Court extended the applicant’s detention until 7 October 2010. The court noted that the Georgian authorities had not yet prepared the documents necessary for the applicant’s expulsion to Georgia. The court considered that the applicant, if released, might abscond or fail to comply with the expulsion order. The applicant’s detention was repeatedly extended by the Town Court.', '27. On 3 January 2011 the Georgian authorities informed the regional migration service that a real Shermandin Goderziyevich Mazmishvili was residing in Georgia and it was not possible to issue the requested documents in that name for the applicant’s expulsion to Georgia.', '28. On 7 February 2011 the Town Court ordered the applicant’s release. Referring to the information supplied by the Georgian authorities, the court considered that it was not possible to expel the applicant under the name of Mazmishvili.', '29. According to the Government, the applicant has not been expelled. He has no document confirming his ID, and the Russian authorities have not established his identity.', '30. According to the applicant, the Town Court, when deciding to detain him pending expulsion, took into account a certificate prepared by police captain P. on which it was noted that the applicant “had been involved in car thefts, belonged to the Shuya organised criminal group ... [and] was a drug dealer.”', '31. Despite a complaint lodged by the applicant that P. had knowingly disseminated false information about him, on 18 August 2010 the prosecutor’s office refused to institute criminal proceedings against P.', '32. From 9 July 2010 to 7 February 2011 the applicant was held in a special detention centre in Ivanovo.', '33. According to the Government, all the inmates detained with a view to expulsion were held in cells nos. 2, 3 and 4. During the period of the applicant’s detention, the cell population varied from three to sixteen persons in all three cells. On average, the number of persons detained in a cell was four to five.', '34. Each detainee was provided with a mattress, a pillow, sheets and a blanket. The sheets were changed on the days the applicant was allowed to take a shower. According to the relevant ledger, the applicant took showers on 9, 21 and 29 July, 4, 14, 24 and 30 August, 7, 13, 27 and 30 September, 1, 12, 15, 22 and 29 November, 6, 13, 20 and 27 December 2010, and on 13, 19 and 25 January and 1 February 2011.', '35. Each cell had a window opening onto a hallway. The window was covered with a metal grill. The light coming from the hallway was sufficient for reading. The window was periodically kept open to ensure proper ventilation of the cell. There was a table and a bench with seating for four persons in each cell. Both the table and the bench were fixed onto the floor.', '36. The cells where the applicant was detained from 9 July to 30 September 2010 were not equipped with a toilet. The detainees were taken out of the cell at least twice a day to use the toilet in the building. During the nighttime the inmates had to use buckets placed in the cells. The buckets were emptied and disinfected daily. In September 2010 toilets and wash sinks were installed in all cells of the special detention centre. They became operational in October 2010.', '37. Food was provided three times a day. Breakfast consisted of hot tea, sugar and a pastry; lunch comprised of soup, meat or fish with a side dish, and tea with sugar or a fruit drink. The applicant also received food parcels from his family and friends.', '38. According to the applicant’s file, he declared a hunger strike twice. Each time he was examined by a paramedic. On a number of occasions ambulance doctors attended to the applicant.', '39. The special detention centre had an exercise area measuring 4.66 m by 3.7 m covered with a metal grill. The detainees had one hour’s outdoor exercise daily.', '40. The applicant was allowed to telephone his family on several occasions. The internal regulations did not provide for the right to a family visit.', '41. The applicant provided the following information as regards his detention in the special detention centre:', '42. Prior to the refurbishment of the special detention centre, there had been no toilets or wash sinks in the cell. The inmates had had to use a bucket placed in the cell. It had been emptied twice a day. The inmates had been allowed to use toilets outside the cell twice a day. The toilets had offered no privacy. Six to eight inmates had been taken simultaneously to the lavatory and had had to use the toilet in front of the others waiting for their turn.', '43. The toilets installed in the cells offered no privacy either. Only cell no. 8 had a one-metre high partition separating the toilet from the living area of the cell.', '44. The applicant did not contest the Government’s submissions as regards the frequency of the showers he had been allowed to take. According to him, the hot water had run out after the first ten minutes. Each time the inmates had had from fifteen to twenty-five minutes to take a shower and to do their laundry. They could use only cold water for the laundry. The sheets, which were old and ragged, had been changed every two weeks.', '45. The windows in the cell were covered by two sets of metal bars on both sides. Access to daylight was insufficient. The table and the bench allowed for two persons to eat. The rest of the inmates had to eat sitting on their beds. In cell no. 3 the applicant was given a mattress that was infested with lice.', '46. Cell no. 9, which was unofficially called “a disciplinary cell”, had no windows. During the four days the applicant spent in that cell, he was not taken out for outdoor exercise.', '47. The daily outdoor exercise lasted thirty minutes and took place in a yard measuring 12 square metres.', '48. The applicant had nothing to do while detained at the special detention centre. There was no library, television or radio. He was not allowed to subscribe to a newspaper or a magazine.', '49. Breakfast was served at 7 a.m., lunch was served at 3 p.m. and dinner, if any, was served at 5 p.m. Breakfast consisted of a piece of white bread, a mug of hot water and a piece of sugar. No spoon was provided. For lunch inmates received soup with an unpleasant odour and taste, a minced meat cutlet and a piece of rye bread. For dinner they were given a burger and cabbage. The meals were the same every day. Because of the applicant’s condition, he could not eat any of the food served. Drinking water was not provided at all. The foodstuff sent by the applicant’s family quickly perished as no fridge was provided and the applicant had to store the food under his bed.']",['3'],[],[],['8'],[],[]

They were represented before the Court by Ms Bahar Argın, a lawyer practising in Istanbul.', '2. s, may be summarised as follows.', '3. A plot of land in Avcılar, in the Merkez District of Istanbul, was registered in the land register as plot no. 23, parcel no. 4354, in the name of Maksut Paksoy and Ömer Paksoy, the applicants’ predecessors.', '4. In 1978, the plot of land in question was designated as a primary school area in the local land development plan. The designation of the plot of land remained unchanged in subsequent plans drawn up between 1978 and 2007.', '5. On 26 March 2007 the applicants applied to the municipality to have the local land development plan altered. On 8 October 2007 the municipality rejected the applicants’ request.', '6. On 3 January 2008 the applicants instituted proceedings before the Istanbul Administrative Court seeking to have the local land development plan annulled. On 15 January 2008 the Istanbul Administrative Court dismissed the applicants’ case.', '7. On 11 March 2008 the applicants instituted another set of proceedings before the Küçükçekmece Civil Court of First Instance, claiming compensation for the decrease in the market value of the land and the long-term uncertainty about the fate of the land. On 16 July 2008 the court dismissed the case, holding that the authorities had not seized the land in question. An appeal and a request for rectification lodged by the applicants were subsequently rejected by the Court of Cassation, and the decision became final on 15 October 2009.', '8. According to section 3 of the Zoning Act (Law no. 3194), land cannot be used for any purpose other than that indicated in the local land development plans.', '9. Section 10(1) of the same Act provides that the municipalities should prepare their five-year zoning programmes within three months of the entry into force of local land development plans. Land which falls within those programmes and which is accordingly assigned to the relevant public administrative authorities should be expropriated during the period in question. A description of the relevant domestic law may be found in Hüseyin Kaplan v. Turkey (no. 24508/09, §§ 25 and 26, 1 October 2013).', '10. The object of Law no. 6384 was to provide for the settlement, by means of compensation, of applications lodged with the Court concerning length of judicial proceedings, and non-enforcement or delayed enforcement of judicial decisions. A Compensation Commission was set up for that purpose. A full description of the relevant domestic law may be found in Turgut and Others v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 4860/09, §§ 19-26, 26 March 2013).', '11. The competence ratione materiae of the Compensation Commission was subsequently extended by a decree which came into force on 16 March 2014. The decree extended the competence of the Compensation Commission to the examination of other complaints, such as alleged restriction of the right of detainees to correspondence in a language other than Turkish and the prison authorities’ refusal, on different grounds, to hand over periodicals. A full description of the relevant domestic law may be found in Yıldız and Yanak v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 44013/07, §§ 9-17, 27 May 2014).', '12. The Turkish Council of Ministers issued a decree which came into force on 9 March 2016. The decree extended anew the competence ratione materiae of the Compensation Commission.', '13.

The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Târgu Mureș.', '7. The Anti-Corruption Department of the Prosecutor’s Office (“the DNA”) started a criminal investigation against the applicant, his wife and three businessmen on suspicion of repeated corruption offences committed in his capacity as mayor of Cluj Napoca.', '8. The prosecutor sought authorisation for the interception of the applicant’s telephone calls. The transcripts of the intercepted telephone calls were admitted as evidence against the applicant.', '9. On 9 November 2011 police officers belonging to the DNA carried out a search at the applicant’s home. They carried out another search at the applicant’s office at Cluj Napoca Town Hall.', '10. The applicant was taken to the DNA’s Cluj headquarters on the basis of a summons to appear before the investigative body.', '11. Newspaper and television crews were present and the events were given widespread media coverage.', '12. At about 8.50 p.m. on the same day the prosecutor ordered the applicant’s remand in custody.', '13. The applicant’s pre-trial detention was ordered by an interlocutory judgment delivered the next day by the Cluj Court of Appeal. The court reasoned that it was necessary to stop the criminal activity of the applicant, who was allegedly preparing to commit a new corruption offence. The court also referred to the seriousness and the continuous nature of the offences. It stressed that the applicant had acted in his capacity as mayor when he had allegedly committed the offences. It concluded that the public would be shocked if the applicant were to be released. In assessing the concrete danger to public order if the applicant were released from detention, the court stressed that the offences had allegedly been committed over a long period of time (starting in 2009, when he had been appointed mayor, until the time of his arrest), that they were repetitive and that the perpetrator was a mayor in charge of protecting legal order. The court pointed out that as the applicant’s wife was under investigation, the applicant having used her law firm to cash the money received as bribes, his release from prison would allow him to influence her position. It concluded that his release from detention would intimidate other persons in possession of information relevant for the investigation.', '14. The applicant appealed. On 21 November 2011 the High Court of Cassation and Justice upheld the above judgment, holding that there were strong indications from the criminal investigation file that the accused had committed the crimes.', '15. The applicant’s pre-trial detention was regularly extended by interlocutory judgments of the Cluj Court of Appeal.', '16. The court reasoned that the extensions were justified on account of the nature and severity of the offences for which the applicant was under investigation, and the fact that he might obstruct the course of justice by intimidating possible witnesses and the persons who had lodged complaints against him.', '17. The applicant lodged appeals against the interlocutory judgments; all the appeals were dismissed by final decisions of the High Court of Cassation and Justice.', '18. The applicant lodged several applications for his release from prison under judicial supervision. He mainly emphasised that he had a stable family, two minor children and an unblemished reputation. He also pointed out that he had been accused of non-violent crimes and had no criminal record.', '19. The Cluj Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s requests on the grounds that the evidence in the file pointed to a strong likelihood that he had committed the corruption-related offences. It held that such offences might attract a prison sentence longer than four years. It also held that releasing the applicant would give rise to a real danger to public order, given the circumstances in which the acts had been committed, and their consequences and social impact.', '20. The applicant appealed, pointing out that his personal situation had changed, in that he was no longer the mayor of Cluj. The appeal court’s decisions were upheld by the High Court of Cassation and Justice.', '21. On 30 November 2011 the investigation against the applicant was extended in connection with other offences allegedly committed by him, namely trading in influence, complicity in and incitement to money laundering, and complicity in and incitement to forgery.', '22. On 22 December 2011 the prosecutor issued an indictment concerning five co-accused, including the applicant and his wife, and the case was registered with the Cluj Court of Appeal. The applicant was charged with passive corruption, and repeated complicity in and incitement to money laundering and forgery.', '23. Following a request lodged by the applicant, the High Court of Cassation and Justice decided on 20 February 2012 to transfer the file to the Târgu Mureș Court of Appeal in order to avoid any possible partiality on the part of the judges.', '24. According to the latest information, the criminal proceedings are still pending.', '25. Excerpts from conversations between the applicant and other defendants or third parties, which had been obtained through telephone tapping during a criminal surveillance operation conducted prior to the criminal prosecution, were subsequently published in several newspapers before the applicant and his co-accused had been committed for trial.', '26. Even the headlines of the articles published in the press during that period referred to the fact that they contained excerpts of the recorded conversations. Thus on 16 December 2011, the newspaper Evenimentul zilei published an article with the headline, “Exclusive: Shocking revelations in the Apostu file. The names of all the persons under investigation and new excerpts from the telephone conversations. Evidence that M. Apostu received clothes as a bribe” (Exclusiv: Dezvăluiri tari din Dosarul Apostu. Surprize mari: numele tuturor celor cercetați și interceptări noi. Dovada că M. Apostu lua șpagă în haine).', '27. On 16 November 2011 the newspaper Cancan published an article with the headline, “Excerpts of intercepted phone conversations: Sorin Apostu, the mayor of Cluj, acknowledged that he had at home three telephones with pre-paid cards, in order not to be intercepted” (Stenograme: Sorin Apostu, primarul Clujului, recunoaște că avea în casă trei telefoane cu cartele preplătite, ca să nu poată fi interceptate).', '28. On the same day another article containing excerpts of the applicant’s recorded telephone conversations was published on the website of the newspaper National. It started with the following statement: “Pure coincidence, the excerpts of the telephone conversations offered for publication in the investigation of mayor Sorin Apostu for corruptionrelated offences stops, with suspense, exactly when the Romanian Prime Minister enters the scene”.', '29. The publication of excerpts from the applicant’s recorded telephone conversations continued after the applicant had been committed for trial.', '30. Other pieces of evidence from the prosecution file were likewise published and commented on in the press. On 18 December 2011 the newspaper Ora de Cluj published an article with the headline, “Complete document. The reasoning of the interlocutory judgment ordering the pretrial detention of mayor Sorin Apostu and businessman C. S.” (Document integral. Motivarea sentinței de arestare a primarului Sorin Apostu și a omului de afaceri C. S.).', '31. Several press articles contained excerpts of telephone conversations between the applicant and persons not involved in the criminal proceedings. On 5 February 2012 Ora de Cluj published an article with the headline, “Interception. Three-way conversation: businessman S. D., mayor Sorin Apostu and driver J.”', '32. Many of the press articles referred to aspects of the applicant’s private life without any connection to the criminal proceedings instituted against him. They were based on information found in his criminal file. On 6 February 2012 the newspaper Cancan published an article with the headline, “Juicy details from the private life of mayor Sorin Apostu! The mayor of Cluj, romance with a subordinate”. Only a few days later, on 10 February 2012, the daily newspaper Evenimentul zilei published an article about a search carried out at the home of the mayor’s subordinate with the headline, “Bombshell in the ‘Apostu’ file: five-hour search at home of his supposed sweetheart”.', '33. The applicant was detained in the detention facility of Cluj police station between 9 November 2011 and 6 January 2012, except for two short periods (from 8 to 9 December and from 28 to 29 December 2011) when he was detained in the Bucharest central remand facility on account of his presence before the High Court of Cassation and Justice.', '34. The applicant claimed that he had been detained in a small cell measuring approximately five sq m with four tiers of bunk beds. Access to a toilet was very difficult as the toilets were in the corridor. The cell lacked natural light and ventilation and the smells from the sewage system were noxious.', '35. The applicant was held in cell no. 2, which measured 6.97 sq m, and in cell no. 3, which measured 11.31 sq m. The first cell had two metal beds, foam mattresses, bedrolls, two metallic nightstands, a table and two chairs. The second cell had three metal beds and was similarly furnished. The applicant was detained alone in both cells. Moreover, he was allowed to keep a television set in the cell.', '36. The cells had natural and artificial light, and the applicant was allowed to use an extra lamp to improve the lighting. The cells were ventilated through windows covered with wire netting.', '37. The sanitary facilities and the showers were in the corridor. The applicant had permanent access to the sanitary facilities and to the showers during daylight hours, whenever he requested it.', '38. The time spent outside the cells was one hour per day.', '39. On 6 January 2012 the applicant was transferred to Gherla Prison. He was detained there for the following periods:', 'between 6 and 12 January 2012;', 'between 17 and 30 January 2012;', 'between 16 February and 22 March 2012.', '40. The applicant complained of overcrowding. However, he did not mention the number of detainees in the cell or the size of the cell. He merely claimed that there were eighteen beds in the cell. He also claimed that the temperature had been very low and the conditions of hygiene poor. He had been allowed to take only two showers per week.', '41. On 9 January 2012 the applicant applied for protection as a vulnerable person under Article 7 § 5 of the Rules of Application of Law no. 275/2006. Subsequently, he carried out all activities separately from the other detainees.', '42. The applicant was detained in four different cells:', '- on 6 January 2012 he was detained in cell EG 5.3 in the hospital wing, which measured 15.26 sq m, contained three beds and which he shared with only one detainee;', '- between 6 and 10 January 2012 he was detained in cell EG 1.7 in the quarantine wing, which measured 43.25 sq m, contained twenty-one beds and which he shared with two other detainees;', '- between 10 and 12 January and 17 and 27 January 2012 he was detained in cell EG 1.4 in the quarantine wing, which measured 16.24 sq m, contained four beds and which he shared with two other detainees;', '- between 27 and 30 January and 15 February and 22 March 2012 he was detained in cell EG 3.20, which measured 16.24 sq m, contained nine beds and which he shared with three other detainees.', '43. The prison’s central heating system was in good working order and ensured an appropriate temperature inside the prison. There were no registered complaints by the detainees in this respect.', '44. The prisoners were entitled to two showers per week and the hygiene conditions were adequate.', '45. The applicant spent two hours per day outside the cell.', '46. On 12 January 2012 the applicant was transported to Rahova Prison in order to attend a hearing of the High Court of Cassation and Justice in the appeal on points of law lodged by him against an interlocutory judgment. He spent five days in that prison.', '47. The applicant complained of overcrowding and very low temperatures in the cell. He claimed that the cell had had no heating and that he had had nothing to eat for about three days because food had been thrown into the cell by other detainees, who had made death threats against him.', '48. On 12 January 2012 the applicant was detained in cell no. 538, reserved for vulnerable persons, which measured 19.58 sq m and which he shared with seven other detainees.', '49. Between 13 and 16 January 2012 the applicant was detained in cell no. 219, which measured 19.3 sq m and which he shared with only one other detainee.', '50. The cells and sanitary facilities were ventilated through double windows. The heating of the cells was ensured by radiators connected to the prison’s thermal station.', '51. Food was served in the cells as the prison had no dining hall designed for persons under pre-trial detention. Food distribution was supervised by the prison staff and coordinated by the section head. The Government underlined that by placing the applicant in a cell for vulnerable detainees (persons who had held official functions), the prison authorities had complied with their obligation to take proper measures to ensure the safety of those persons.', '52. All daily activities concerning the vulnerable detainees, as well as their transfer to the court, were carried out separately from other categories of detainee. Additional security measures were taken in respect of those persons.', '53. The Government contended that the applicant had not lodged any complaint with the delegated judge against the prison staff or in connection with conflicts with other detainees during his detention in Rahova Prison.', '54. Between 30 January and 16 February 2012 the applicant was admitted to the hospital wing of Dej Prison.', '55. On 22 March 2012 the applicant was transferred to Târgu Mureș Prison. He did not complain about the conditions of his detention in Târgu Mureș Prison.', '56. On 12 January 2012 the applicant was transported from Gherla Prison to Rahova Prison.', '57.

He also complained that the van had not been heated and had had no windows or internal lighting, and that he had had no opportunity to use the toilet during the journey.', '58. The applicant also alleged that he had been deprived of food and water during transportation.', '59. The applicant lodged a complaint with the prison authorities regarding the conditions in which he had been transported from Gherla Prison to Rahova Prison. In a letter of 22 February 2012 the National Administration of Prisons acknowledged that he had been transported in a small-capacity van belonging to Gherla Prison, as the prison did not have at its disposal another van.', '60. According to the Government, a special journey was for the applicant and a co-defendant in order to ensure their attendance at the hearing scheduled by the High Court and Cassation for the following day. The vehicle left Gherla Prison at 5 p.m. on 12 January 2012 and arrived at Rahova Prison at 1.30 a.m. on 13 January 2012. The vehicle was fully equipped and adapted for detainees.

He lodged another similar request on 20 March 2012.', '64. The prison authorities justified the applicant’s separation from his lawyer by a glass partition by citing the existing legal provisions.']","['3', '8']",['8-1'],[],[],[],[]

According to him, at 3 p.m., when he and his girlfriend were buying something at a kiosk in the street, three men in plain clothes approached him, pushed him to the tarmac, handcuffed him and put him in an unmarked car without any explanation. A plastic bag was put over his head, making it difficult for him to breathe, and he was taken to a forest, where the three men subjected him to ill-treatment, demanding that he accept their conditions and do as he was told. He was punched (in particular on the forehead), kicked (after he had fallen to the ground), and administered electric shocks through wires attached to the thumbs. He agreed to cooperate and was taken to investigator G at the YoshkarOla Central police station.', '13. During the criminal proceedings against him the applicant asserted that he had never shown the whereabouts of A.K.’s body to the investigating authorities; rather, it was his co-accused R.K. who had shown them the body (see paragraph 37 below).', '14. At 10.45 p.m. the applicant was placed in a temporary detention facility (“the IVS”) at the Ministry of Interior of Mariy El. An officer on duty recorded the following injuries on him: a swelling and a haematoma on the left side of the forehead; haematomas on the right side of the chest, on the right shoulder and right shoulder blade; and abrasions on the back in the region of the waist.', '15. At 2.35 p.m. on 8 September 2007 the applicant was taken from the IVS to investigator G. to take part in two confrontations, which were carried out between 3.30 p.m. and 5.25 p.m. The applicant, who was represented by lawyer V.K., again refused to give statements.', '16. According to the IVS’s records, the applicant was brought back to the IVS at 3.20 a.m.', '17. In a “statement of surrender and confession” (явка с повинной) drawn up by investigator G. at 7 p.m. in the absence of a lawyer, the applicant confessed to participating in a conspiracy to murder A.K. and to stealing A.K.’s car. The applicant stated that A.K. had been strangled by his partners in crime, R.K. and M.Ts.', '18. According to investigator G., that day the applicant remained in his office until he was taken back to the IVS.', '19. According to the applicant, investigator G. demanded that he confess to the crimes. The applicant refused, and after 9 p.m., G. telephoned someone and three men took the applicant out of the town by car. They beat him up, strangled him, threatened him with a revolver, tied him up with a car tow rope, threw him into a pit dug by one of them and threatened to bury him alive, demanding that he confess to the murder. After being taken back to the IVS, the applicant signed a statement of surrender and confession, as requested by the investigator.', '20. During the criminal proceedings against him the applicant stated that he had never signed the statement of surrender and confession, and that his signature on the record had been forged by the investigator. On 16 July 2008 a criminal complaint lodged by the applicant on 1 February 2008 against the investigator was dismissed after a handwriting expert was unable to determine whether his signature had been forged.', '21. At 8.20 a.m. on 9 September 2007 the applicant was taken to investigator G., charged with murder and robbery, and questioned as an accused in the presence of lawyer V.K. According to the record of his questioning, he stated that he had given the statement of surrender and confession the previous day voluntarily, without any pressure from police officers. He reiterated his self-incriminating statements.', '22. During the criminal proceedings against him the applicant claimed that he had never signed the record of his questioning as an accused, and that his signature on the record had been forged by an investigator. A handwriting expert, whose opinion was sought by an investigator, concluded that a handwritten note in which the applicant fully acknowledged his guilt of A.K.’s murder had been written by the applicant, but that it was impossible to determine whether he had also signed that record. On 16 July 2008 the applicant’s criminal complaint against the investigator (see paragraph 20 above) was dismissed.', '23. On the same day the Yoshkar-Ola Town Court, at a hearing held in the presence of the applicant and his lawyer, V.K., investigator G. and a prosecutor, ordered that the applicant be detained on remand.', '24. At 5.30 p.m. he was placed in pretrial detention facility IZ-12/1. Upon his admission he was examined by a medical assistant, who recorded the following injuries on him: an 8-cm-long bruise on the front side of the neck, a bruise 2 cm in diameter on the right side of the chest, and a 3cmlong abrasion at the level of the first lumbar vertebra.', '25. On 17 October 2007 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Mariy El, requesting that investigator G. and the police officers responsible for his ill-treatment (see paragraphs 12 and 19 above) be prosecuted. An inquiry into his allegations was carried out under Article 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (“CCrP”) by the investigative committee of the Mariy El prosecutor’s office.', '26. The pit into which the applicant had allegedly been thrown on 8 September 2007 with the threat that he would be buried alive was located in a forest at a place pointed out by the applicant. Statements were taken from investigators and police officers. Investigator G. and operative police officers D.K., O. and S. denied having ill-treated the applicant.', '27. On 18 December 2007 an investigator ordered a forensic expert medical report concerning the applicant’s injuries, as recorded in pretrial detention facility IZ-12/1 (see paragraph 24 above). In a report dated 19 December 2007 the forensic medical expert concluded that the injuries could have been caused by hard blunt objects. They had not resulted in a health disorder of sufficiently long a duration for it to be categorised as health damage. The information contained in the medical records made available to the expert did not make it possible to establish the time at which the injuries had been inflicted.', '28. Investigators refused five times (on 2 and 19 November and 13 December 2007, and 7 April and 29 June 2008) to open criminal proceedings in respect of the applicant’s allegations for lack of the event of a crime (отсутствие события преступления). Each time their decision was annulled as unlawful and unfounded by their superior at the Mariy El prosecutor’s office and an additional inquiry ordered. The annulment of the investigators’ refusals of 13 December 2007, 7 April 2008 and 29 June 2008 followed the YoshkarOla Town Court’s findings of 3 March, 29 May and 31 July 2008 respectively that those refusals had been unlawful and lacking reasoning.', '29. The Town Court’s decision of 31 July 2008 was initially set aside after an appeal by the prosecutor before the Mariy El Supreme Court on 22 September 2008 for the reasons that on 15 August 2008 the criminal case against the applicant had been transferred for trial to the Mariy El Supreme Court, that those proceedings were pending, and that it was open for the applicant to raise in the course of his trial complaints concerning his illtreatment. In supervisory review proceedings on 22 October 2010 the Presidium of the Mariy El Supreme Court quashed the decision of 22 September 2008. It found that the decision had been based on an erroneous interpretation of criminal procedural law and had failed to take into account Article 46 of the Russian Constitution, which guaranteed access to court in respect of complaints against decisions of State authorities. It noted that the Constitutional Court had explained that it was possible under Article 125 of the CCrP to appeal against decisions made by (as well as actions undertaken by or inaction on the part of) investigating authorities at the pre-trial stage of proceedings, regardless of whether issues addressed in those decisions were connected to circumstances concerning other pending or completed criminal proceedings. The Presidium referred to the Constitutional Court’s decisions no. 369-O of 18 November 2004, 156O of 25 March 2004, 500-O of 20 December 2005, 576-O-P of 19 May 2009, 1107-O-O of 13 October 2009 and 79-O of 16 March 2006. The Mariy El Supreme Court stressed that in the course of a trial the task of a court was to examine the admissibility of evidence and other questions relevant to the merits of the case; such questions were factually and legally different from those examined in a review under Article 125 of the CCrP. On 22 November 2010, following supervisory review and appeal proceedings, the Town Court’s decision of 31 July 2008 entered into force.', '30. The most recent decision of the investigative committee of the Mariy El prosecutor’s office was taken on 9 March 2011. An investigator again refused to institute criminal proceedings against investigator G. and police officers D.K., O., S. and Z. for lack of the event of a crime under Article 24 § 1 (1) of the CCrP. Relying on the statements of the applicant’s coaccused, R.K., the investigator concluded that the injuries found on the applicant upon his admission to the IVS could have been inflicted by A.K. on 28 August 2007. R.K. stated that shortly before A.K.’s murder the applicant and A.K. had had a fight in a car and that he had seen them delivering several blows to each other. R.K. was unable to say where A.K. had hit the applicant. As regards the bruise on the applicant’s neck recorded upon his admission to the SIZO on 9 September 2007, the investigator noted that its cause had not been established and concluded that it could have been self-inflicted.', '31. On 7 October 2011 the Yoshkar-Ola Town Court dismissed an appeal by the applicant against the investigator’s decision of 9 March 2011. It found that the investigator had carried out a comprehensive inquiry, having exhausted all possibilities for collecting evidence, and that his decision had been lawful and well-reasoned.', '32. On 5 December 2011 the Mariy El Supreme Court dismissed an appeal by the applicant against the Town Court’s decision. It stated that in a review of an investigator’s decision not to initiate criminal proceedings under Article 125 of the CCrP a court’s task was to check whether the procedure for the examination of a complaint regarding the commission of a crime had been observed. The Mariy El Supreme Court noted that the Town Court had examined the material gathered during the course of the inquiry and established that the applicant’s arguments had been examined by the investigator. It fully endorsed the Town Court’s findings that the inquiry had been thorough and the investigator’s decision of 9 March 2011 lawful and reasoned.', '33. On 12 December 2011 first deputy prosecutor of the Republic of Mariy El annulled the investigator’s decision of 9 March 2011 as unlawful, lacking reasoning and proper assessment of evidence, and based on an inquiry which had not been thorough and had not exhausted all possibilities for collecting evidence. In particular, the applicant’s allegations of illtreatment had not been refuted; the circumstances in which he had received the injuries had not been established; the existence of the pit at the place of the applicant’s alleged ill-treatment had not been assessed; the allegations of electric shocks had not been verified; and the forensic medical expert had not been given all the necessary information (including the applicant’s version of the cause of the injuries). Consequently, the forensic expert (see paragraph 27 above) had not made a full assessment, in particular of the injuries recorded upon the applicant’s admission to the IVS. The prosecutor further noted that (i) the IVS records, which recorded at what times in the period from 7 until 9 September 2007 the applicant had been taken from the detention facility for the purpose of carrying out investigative actions and when he had been brought back, had not been assessed, and (ii) the documents indicating the grounds for the applicant’s absence from the detention facility were missing. It was necessary, inter alia, to establish the applicant’s location and a detailed chronology of the events in which had had participated in the period from 7 until 9 September 2007, taking into account the fact that he had actually been arrested at 3 p.m. on 7 September 2007, as established at the applicant’s trial. The prosecutor ordered that the investigative committee of the Mariy El prosecutor’s office carry out an additional inquiry.', '34. The applicant’s case was heard by the Mariy El Supreme Court. On 20 August 2008 it ordered that a preliminary hearing be held in order to examine the applicant’s request for the exclusion of some evidence as inadmissible. On 28 August 2008 the applicant withdrew his request. On 1 September 2008 the Mariy El Supreme Court – after hearing the applicant and his legal counsel, who confirmed the withdrawal of the request – ruled that the request should not therefore be examined. According to the trial records of 23 October 2008, in the course of the trial the applicant lodged a new request for the exclusion of some evidence as inadmissible, which he again withdrew.', '35. As regards the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment, the firstinstance court (“the trial court”) examined witnesses and other evidence collected in the course of the inquiry carried out by the investigative committee of the Mariy El prosecutor’s office. In particular, it heard investigators A. and G. and police officers O. and S., who denied having ill-treated the applicant. A., O. and S. stated that the applicant had pointed out the location of A.K.’s body. The trial court found it impossible to establish the circumstances in which the applicant had received the injuries. It noted that it could examine allegations of unlawful investigative methods as long as the admissibility of evidence was at issue, and that this was not the case because no evidence whose admissibility would have been prejudiced by the discovery of the applicant’s injuries had been examined by it. It stressed that the circumstances in which the applicant’s injuries had been inflicted could be established by the relevant law enforcement authorities by means of an inquiry.', '36. In respect of an attack on A.K. in his car shortly before his murder, R.K. stated that he had seen the applicant punching A.K. to the head and body and A.K. trying to defend himself. In respect of the same episode another of the applicant’s co-accused, M.Ts., who had also been in the car, stated that he had seen the applicant beating A.K. and A.K. covering himself from the blows.', '37. The applicant pleaded not guilty. When asked whether he had been taken to the place where A.K.’s body had been found, he answered that he had been taken by car to an unknown place, where he had seen R.K. talking to police officers. R.K. had been covered in mud. The applicant had been told by a driver that R.K. had dug out A.K.’s body with his bare hands. The applicant further stated that he had not written the statement of surrender and confession.', '38. In its judgment of 5 November 2008 the Mariy El Supreme Court established that the applicant had murdered A.K. by strangling and had stolen his car. It found the applicant guilty of murder and robbery and sentenced him to sixteen years’ imprisonment. The finding of the applicant’s guilt was based, inter alia, on statements made by R.K. and M.Ts. (his accomplices in the robbery and eyewitnesses to the murder). In deciding on the punishment for the robbery the Mariy El Supreme Court held that the applicant had played an active role in solving the crime by pointing out the location of A.K.’s body, and that this constituted a mitigating circumstance. The applicant’s coaccused, R.K. and Ts., were convicted of aggravated robbery and sentenced to three and a half and three years’ imprisonment respectively; in M.Ts.’s case the sentence was suspended.', '39. The applicant lodged an appeal with the Russian Supreme Court against the judgment, complaining, inter alia, that the Mariy El Supreme Court should not have examined as evidence the witness statements made by A., O. and S. He further complained that his sentence in respect of the murder had been unfair because, in contrast with the decision on the punishment for the robbery, his disclosure of the whereabouts of A.K.’s body had not been taken into account as a mitigating circumstance.', '40. On 5 February 2009 the Russian Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the judgment of the Mariy El Supreme Court. It stated that in view of the disputed origin of the applicant’s injuries the trial court had rightly not used evidence adduced at the time of the applicant’s alleged ill-treatment. It agreed with the applicant that the record of his arrest had been drawn up more than three hours after his actual arrest at 3 p.m. on 7 September 2007, in breach of Article 92 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It further noted that the trial court had rectified that violation by including the time spent by the applicant in pre-trial detention in the sentence to be served.']","['3', '5']",['5-1'],[],[],[],[]

Mr Abdulazhon Mamadzhanovich Isakov was born in 1963 and lived, prior to his disappearance, in Tyumen. He is a stateless person. The application in his name was submitted to the Court by Ms N. Yermolayeva, a lawyer practising in Moscow. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.', '2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '3. In 1989 Mr Isakov moved from Uzbekistan to the Tyumen Region in Russia.', '4. In 1998 the Uzbek authorities opened a criminal case against Mr Isakov on charges of attempting to overthrow the State’s constitutional order in Uzbekistan and put his name on the wanted persons’ list.', '5. On 6 March 2008 Mr Isakov was arrested in Tyumen, Russia, and remanded in custody with a view to extradition.', '6. On 12 August 2008 the Russian Prosecutor General’s office decided to extradite Mr Isakov to Uzbekistan. The domestic courts at two levels of jurisdiction upheld the extradition order. A final decision on the matter was taken by the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation on 22 December 2008.', '7. On 21 March 2008 Mr Isakov lodged an application with the Court in which he complained about his detention in Russia with a view to extradition to Uzbekistan where he faced politically-based persecution by the local authorities. On 30 September 2008 Mr Isakov signed an authority form authorising several lawyers, including Ms Yermolayeva, to represent him in the proceedings before the Court.', '8. On 10 November 2008 the Court granted Mr Isakov’s request for the application of interim measures under Rule 39 of the Rules of the Court and indicated to the Russian Government that he should not be extradited to Uzbekistan until further notice. On the same date the application was communicated to the Government which were requested to submit observations concerning the risk of ill-treatment if the extradition order in respect of Mr Isakov were enforced, lawfulness and review of his detention in Russia and alleged lack of effective remedies in this respect. The parties’ observations were received on 28 July and 2 October 2009 respectively. The Government complied with the Court’s request as to the application of interim measures and submission of observations.', '9. On 5 March 2010 Mr Isakov was released from custody and on 17 March 2010 he was granted temporary asylum in Russia.', '10. On 8 July 2010 the Court delivered a judgment in Mr Isakov’s case (see Abdulazhon Isakov v. Russia, no. 14049/08, 8 July 2010) where it found, inter alia, that in the event of the extradition order against Mr Isakov being enforced, there would be a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.', '11. On 1 June 2011 the Presidium of the Supreme Court quashed the decision of 12 August 2008 and the ensuing judicial decisions, including the Supreme Court’s decision of 22 December 2008 (see paragraph 6 above).', '12. Mr Isakov and his family (wife and children) continued to reside in Tyumen, Russia.', '13. On 3 February 2012 the Government informed the Committee of Ministers of the individual measures taken within the framework of the execution of the judgment in Mr Isakov’s case. In particular, the Government reported that (1) the judgment had been enforced as regards the payment of non-pecuniary damage and reimbursement of costs and expenses and (2) the extradition-related judicial decisions had been quashed.', '14. In September 2013, within the framework of the supervision of the execution of a number of judgments against Russia relating to disappearances and/or forcible transfers and also repeated allegations of such incidents, the Committee adopted an Interim Resolution (CM/ResDh(2013)200) exhorting the Russian authorities to develop without further delay an appropriate mechanism tasked with both preventive and protective functions to ensure that applicants belonging to the risk group benefit from immediate and effective protection against unlawful or irregular removal from the Russian territory.', '15. In the night of 21-22 July 2014 Mr Isakov’s car was found damaged on the road and Mr Isakov had disappeared. His family’s attempts to establish his whereabouts were to no avail.', '16. On 22 July 2014 A.M., Mr Isakov’s nephew, reported Mr Isakov’s disappearance to the regional department of the interior. Mr Isakov’s family retained counsel Kh. to represent them in connection with the investigation into Mr Isakov’s disappearance.', '17. On 23 July 2014 the Court granted a request lodged by Ms Yermolayeva, under Rule 39 of the Rules of the Court, and indicated to the Government that Mr Isakov should not be extradited, expelled or otherwise involuntarily removed from Russia to Uzbekistan or another country for the duration of the proceedings before the Court. The Government were also requested to furnish any information about Mr Isakov’s whereabouts and possible arrest and detention in Russia and/or removal to Uzbekistan. The application was also granted priority under Rule 41 of the Rules of the Court.', '18. On 6 August 2014 the Government reported that the investigation into Mr Isakov’s disappearance was pending and that his whereabouts were unknown to the authorities.', '19. On the same date, relying on the authority form issued by Mr Isakov in 2008, Ms Yermolayeva lodged an application in Mr Isakov’s name. She alleged that Mr Isakov had been abducted by Russian state agents and forcefully removed to Uzbekistan where he would be subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. Referring to Article 34 of the Convention, she argued that the Government had failed to comply with the Court’s indication made under Rule 39 of the Rules of the Court.', '20. On 25 August 2014 the senior investigator with the regional investigative committee opened criminal investigation into Mr Isakov’s disappearance.', '21. On 4 September 2014 the senior investigator in charge of Mr Isakov’s disappearance questioned Kh.I., Mr Isakov’s brother. Kh.I. submitted that, according to his older sister who lived in Uzbekistan, Mr Isakov was allegedly in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.', '22. On 12 September 2014 the President of the Section gave notice of the application to the Government and invited the latter to submit written observations on the admissibility and merits of the case.', '23. On 24 October 2014 the senior investigator in charge of Mr Isakov’s disappearance questioned Z.I., Mr Isakov’s son.', '24. On 29 October 2014 the Government submitted the observations.', '25. On 8 January 2015 Ms Yermolayeva submitted the observations on the matter maintaining the complaints on Mr Isakov’s behalf and claims for just satisfaction.', '26. On 12 February 2015 the Government provided comments on the claims for just satisfaction and further observations.', '27. On 15 April 2015 the President of the Section invited the parties, under Rule 54 § 2 (c) of the Rules of the Court, to submit further observations on the admissibility and merits of the case. The parties were to comment as to whether the application was compatible ratione personae with the provisions of the Convention and the Government’s failure to submit a complete investigation file concerning Mr Isakov’s alleged abduction and disappearance.', '28. On 31 May and 1 June 2015 Ms Yermolayeva and the Government respectively submitted further observations (see paragraphs 34-35 below).', '29. Mr Isakov’s whereabouts remain unknown to date.', '30. In its decisions adopted at 1214th and 1230th meetings (December 2014 and June 2015), the Committee of Ministers, responding to the situation concerning disappearances and/or forcible transfers, noted that the Russian authorities adopted a number of awareness-raising measures and instructions. Nevertheless, the Committee of Ministers considered that these measures were insufficient and invited the authorities to adopt special protective measures in respect of the applicants who were exposed to such risks and underlined the need for special measures to ensure rapid and effective investigations into such incidents.', '31. On 2-4 December 2014 (CM/Del/Dec(2014)1214E/05 December 2014) at its 1214th meeting (DH), the Committee of Ministers noted as follows, as regards Mr Isakov’s situation:', '“As to the investigation of the alleged abductions of Messrs Abdulazhon Isakov and Mukhitdinov reported in July 2014, criminal cases have been opened. No evidence has thus far been obtained regarding the removal of Mr Abdulazhon Isakov from the territory of the Russian Federation. The Russian authorities also insisted that the Committee of Ministers was not competent to supervise this issue as it was already being examined in the adversarial proceedings before the European Court.', 'As regards the Russian authorities’ comments with respect to the Committee’s competence to supervise the investigations into the recent alleged abductions of Messrs Abdulazhon Isakov and Mukhitdinov, the following factors have to be taken into account. As regards the first case, there already exists a final Court judgment establishing a violation, granting the Committee full competence to look into both individual and general measures, irrespective of any new application made on behalf of the same person to the Court. Such situations are frequent and have never led the Committee to exempt the State concerned from its obligation to keep the Committee informed of the developments. As regards the second case, while it is true that there is no final judgment at the moment, the case is relevant for execution purposes as an example, among others, of the development of the situation and the efficiency of the general measures adopted (see e.g. the Court’s indication in the Savriddin Dzhurayev judgment (§263).”']",[],[],[],[],[],[]

The applicant was born in 1927 and lives in Rīga.', '5. On 10 August 1998 the Office of the Prosecutor General separated materials of the criminal case no. 81204496 and initiated new criminal proceedings in respect of the applicant’s activities during the period from 1948 to 1953, when he was an investigator at the Ministry of State Security of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Latvia. According to the Office of the Prosecutor General, the applicant had participated in political repressions of the Soviet regime.', '6. On 23 October 1999 the prosecutor informed the applicant that he was suspected of having committed genocide. More specifically, the Office of the Prosecutor General alleged that the applicant had participated in military operations against members of the Latvian armed resistance, collected evidence in criminal proceedings against them, arrested them and their supporters and collected evidence and arrested people who had possessed anti-Soviet manuscripts.

The applicants’ dates of birth and places of residence are given in the Appendix.', '6. At the material time the first applicant was a member of the youth committee of an opposition party, the Popular Front Party of Azerbaijan (Azərbaycan Xalq Cəbhəsi Partiyası – “the PFPA”), and the second applicant was a chairman of a youth organisation called Azad Genclik.', '7. Both applicants participated in a number of unauthorised peaceful demonstrations organised by the opposition. In the course of many of those demonstrations, they were arrested and convicted. In particular, the first applicant was arrested during the demonstrations on 15 May, 19 June and 31 July 2010.', '8. The number of opposition demonstrations increased in 2011. That tendency continued into the following years. Demonstrations were held, inter alia, on 11 March 2011 and 20 October and 17 November 2012.', '9. The second applicant attended the demonstrations of 11 March 2011 and 20 October 2012. The first applicant attended the demonstrations of 20 October and 17 November 2012.', '10. According to the first applicant, he also intended to participate in the demonstration of 11 March 2011. Moreover, he was actively promoting public participation in that assembly on online social networks.', '11. It appears that the organisers of the demonstration of 11 March 2011 gave no proper prior notice to the relevant authority, the Baku City Executive Authority (“the BCEA”). Information about the assembly was disseminated through Facebook or the press.', '12. Prior to the demonstrations of 20 October and 17 November 2012, on 15 October and 12 November 2012 respectively the organisers had given notice to the BCEA.', '13. The BCEA refused to authorise the demonstration of 20 October 2012 at the site indicated by the organisers and proposed another location on the outskirts of Baku the grounds of a driving school situated in the 20th habitable area of the Sabail District.', '14. The BCEA also refused to authorise the demonstration of 17 November 2012. It noted in general terms that that assembly would not be in accordance with the Law on Freedom of Assembly. The BCEA further noted that the square where the organisers proposed to hold the assembly was a designated public leisure area and that the assembly itself would be impractical.', '15. The organisers nevertheless decided to hold the demonstrations as planned. According to the applicants, the demonstrations were intended to be peaceful and were conducted in a peaceful manner. The participants were demanding democratic reforms in the country and free and fair elections, and protesting against impediments on freedom of assembly.', '16. On 4 March 2011 the first applicant was arrested and brought to police station no. 22 of the Nasimi district police office.', '17. According to the official records, he was arrested because at around 11.20 a.m., in front of the National Bank in Baku, he had disobeyed a lawful order of the police to stop speaking loudly on a mobile phone and to stop using foul language. He also swore at the police officers and tried to run away when being arrested.', '18. The applicant contested the official version of his arrest. He stated that he had been arrested in an Internet café by three persons in plain clothes who had failed to present themselves or give reasons for the arrest. They had taken his belongings from the Internet café, including his mobile phone. He had been pushed into an unmarked car. There one of the persons who had arrested him had presented himself as a police officer and shown a police badge. The other two had presented themselves as agents of the Ministry of National Security, without showing any supporting document. He had been told that the arrest had been in connection with the demonstration of 11 March and another protest planned to be held on 12 March 2011.', '19. At the police station an administrative-offence report (inzibati xəta haqqında protokol) was issued in respect of the applicant, setting out the charges against him. The report stated that the applicant had committed an administrative offence under Article 310.1 of the Code of Administrative Offences (“the CAO”) (failure to comply with a lawful order of a police officer).', '20. According to the applicant, he was never served with a copy of the administrative-offence report or with other documents from his case file. He was also not given access to a lawyer after his arrest or while he was in police custody.', '21. On the day of his arrest the applicant was brought before the Nasimi District Court, which on the same day adopted a decision on the merits.', '22. According to the applicant, he was not given an opportunity to appoint a lawyer of his own choosing. A State-funded lawyer (Mr O.A.) was appointed to assist him.', '23. According to the transcript of the first-instance court’s hearing, Mr O.A. did not make any oral or written submissions.', '24. In his statement before the court the applicant contested the police officers’ version of events and argued that he had been arrested unlawfully. The court disregarded that statement as non-reliable.', '25. Only the police officers who, according to the official records, had arrested the applicant and the police officer who issued the administrativeoffence report in respect of him were questioned as witnesses. In their statements those police officers reiterated the official version of the reasons for the applicant’s arrest (see paragraph 17 above).', '26. The court found that the applicant had committed the administrative offence attributed to him (see paragraph 17 above). It convicted the applicant under Article 310.1 of the CAO and sentenced him to ten days’ administrative detention.', '27. According to the applicant, until 6 March 2011 his whereabouts were unknown to his family and friends.', '28. Only on 7 March 2011 was a lawyer hired by his family able to meet the applicant and to learn the details of his arrest, detention and the court proceedings against him.', '29. On an unspecified date the applicant lodged an appeal with the Baku Court of Appeal, presenting his version of the events surrounding his arrest, and arguing that he had been arrested in connection with the demonstration scheduled for 11 March 2011. The applicant also complained that the hearing before the first-instance court had not been fair.', '30. In addition, he applied to the appellate court to have examined his mobile-phone call records in respect of the date and time of the alleged administrative offence.', '31. The applicant was represented before the Baku Court of Appeal by a lawyer of his own choosing.', '32. On 19 March 2011 the Baku Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the decision of the first-instance court, stating that the conclusions reached by that court had been correct.', '33. The appellate court did not address the applicant’s above-mentioned request to have his mobile-phone call records examined.', '34. As mentioned above, the demonstration of 11 March 2011 was attended by the second applicant, the demonstration of 20 October 2012 by both applicants, and the demonstration of 17 November 2012 by the first applicant.', '35. All three demonstrations were dispersed as soon as the protesters began to gather. Both applicants were arrested during the dispersal operations and after each arrest were taken to police station no. 9 of the Sabail district police office.', '36. According to the applicants, during the dispersal of the demonstrations of 20 October and 17 November 2012 they were arrested by individuals in plain clothes.', '37. On the day of each of the applicants’ respective arrests, administrative-offence reports were issued in respect of them. In each case the applicants were charged with an administrative offence under Article 310.1 of the CAO. Following their arrest on 20 October 2012 the applicants were additionally charged under Article 298 (violation of rules on holding public assemblies) of the CAO.', '38. According to the applicants, they were never served with a copy of the administrative-offence reports or with other documents from their case files. They were also not given access to a lawyer after their arrests or while they were in police custody.', '39. The applicants were brought before the Sabail District Court on the day of each arrest (specifically, the first applicant on 20 October and 17 November 2012, and the second applicant on 11 March 2011 and 20 October 2012).', '40. According to the applicants, the respective hearings before the firstinstance court were very brief. Members of the public were not allowed inside the courtroom, even though the court had not taken a formal decision to close the hearings to the public.', '41. According to the applicants, they were not given an opportunity to appoint lawyers of their own choosing.', '42. A State-funded lawyer was appointed to defend the applicants at each hearing.', '43. According to the transcript of the hearing of 11 March 2011, in his oral submissions the State-funded lawyer for the second applicant (Mr V.M.) briefly asked the court to consider the young age of the applicant and his sincere regret for having committed the administrative offence.', '44. None of the material submitted to the Court contains any record showing that at the hearings of 20 October and 17 November 2012 respectively the State-funded lawyer for the second applicant (Mr K.B.) or the State-funded lawyer for the first applicant (Mr Z.A.) made any oral or written submissions on behalf of the applicants.', '45. According to a statement (“ərizə”) signed by the first applicant, he refused the assistance of the State-funded lawyer at the hearing of 20 October 2012 and decided to defend himself in person.', '46. The only witnesses questioned during the hearing of 11 March 2011 concerning the second applicant were police officers who, according to official records, had arrested him. They testified that together with some other people the applicant had attempted to hold an unlawful demonstration and continued to protest despite the order to disperse. During the hearings of 20 October 2012 and 17 November 2012 the court did not question any witnesses.', '47. In each case the Sabail District Court found that the applicants had failed to stop participating in an unauthorised demonstration. The court convicted the applicants under Article 310.1 of the CAO. In the proceedings related to his participation in the demonstration of 20 October 2012 the second applicant was also convicted under Article 298 of the CAO. The applicants were sentenced to various periods of administrative detention (see Appendix).', '48. On unspecified dates the applicants lodged appeals with the Baku Court of Appeal, arguing that their convictions had been in violation of their rights, because the protest in which they had participated had been peaceful. The applicants also complained that their arrests had been unlawful, and that the hearings before the first-instance court had not been fair. They asked the Baku Court of Appeal to quash the first-instance court’s decisions in their respective cases.', '49. The first applicant was assisted by a lawyer of his own choosing in each case before the Baku Court of Appeal. The second applicant was assisted by a lawyer of his own choosing during the appellate-court proceedings related to his participation in the demonstration of 20 October 2012, but he was not represented by a lawyer during the appellate-court proceedings related to his participation in the demonstration of 11 March 2011.', '50. On various dates the Baku Court of Appeal dismissed the applicants’ appeals and upheld the decisions of the first-instance court (see Appendix).']","['11', '5', '6']","['11-1', '5-1', '6-1', '6-3']",[],[],[],[]

The applicant was born in 1934 and lived in Moscow.', '7. In June 1998 he deposited 5,187.40 United States dollars in a threemonth account with Russian Credit, a private bank.', '8. In August 1998 the country suffered a financial crisis, the rouble fell, and the bank defaulted. In December 1998 the applicant accepted the bank’s offer to settle and close his account in return for the balance in depreciated roubles. By the time the money reached the applicant in March 1999, the rouble had depreciated further.', '9. In October 1999 the bank went into external administration and its debt repayments were frozen pending a restructuring.', '10. In May 2000 the bank and its creditors negotiated a group settlement of the pre-October 1999 debt and had it approved by the courts. The settlement discharged the bank from fines, penalties, default interest, and damages arising under legislation, contracts with clients, and court decisions.', '11. In December 2001 the applicant sued the bank for the loss caused by the exchange-rate fluctuations between the day he had accepted the bank’s offer and the day the money had arrived. The bank objected to that claim on the ground that it had extinguished its obligations by repaying the deposit to the applicant. On 17 April 2002 the Golovinskiy District Court of Moscow awarded the applicant 77,603.50 Russian roubles (RUB).', '12. In May 2003 the applicant filed a writ of execution with a bailiff.', '13. On 17 June 2003, on the application of the bank, the District Court terminated the enforcement of its judgment in view of the group settlement. The District Court said:', 'Considering the nature of the legal relationship at issue, the court takes into account the fact that the enforcement proceedings have been instituted with the purpose of collecting from [Russian Credit] the liabilities that had come into existence before 18 October 1999 inclusive and, under the ... terms of the friendly settlement, are related to [the bank’s] restructured liabilities subject to novation on the terms of the friendly settlement approved by a [court decision] that had defined the procedure and terms of the extinction of the liabilities.', 'Pursuant to section 23 § 2 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings, the conclusion of a friendly settlement between a creditor and a debtor constitutes a ground for the termination of the enforcement proceedings, and therefore the [bank’s] application shall be granted and the [enforcement proceedings] shall be terminated.', '14. In July 2003, in reply to the applicant’s query, the bank’s external administrator informed the applicant that his deposit had not been on the books and that under the terms of the group settlement his judgment debt could not be paid.', '15. On 14 August 2003 the Moscow City Court upheld the District Court’s decision, finding that the applicant’s individual claim was to be settled with the group claim. The City Court said:', 'When terminating the [enforcement] proceedings the [District Court] has referred to the provisions of section 439 of the Code of Civil Procedure and reached the conclusion that the terms of the said friendly settlement regarding the restructuring of the credit obligations of [Russian Credit] extended also to [the applicant].', 'The [City Court] agrees with the said conclusion of the [District Court] as based on the provisions of the law and confirmed by the circumstances of the present case.']",[],[],[],"['6', 'P1']","['6-1', 'P1-1']",['P1-1-1']

On 22 September 1990 the applicant married B.M., whom she divorced after the events to which the application relates. According to her explanations, since 1983 B.M. had been living with Dr M.S., a man fifteen years his elder, who had taken him in following B.M.’s arrival from Morocco, providing him with a home and paying for his studies.', '11. The applicant and her husband had five children. In 1992, shortly after the birth of her first child, the applicant began suffering from depression and stopped working as a French and history teacher, only returning for a few months in 1993. Dr M.S. certified her unfit for work on account of depression and asthenia. Subsequently, her insurance company’s medical adviser confirmed that she was unfit for work on account of depression. In October 1996 a report by a court-appointed psychiatrist, which was later endorsed by the Employment Tribunal, diagnosed her as suffering from “recurrent endogenous anxiety and depression, with a slightly destabilised basic personality”, rendering her more than 66% unfit for work. The expert concluded as follows:', '“... social contact feeds a sense of persecution and interpretative paranoia. The patient is socially withdrawn and has a tendency to retreat into herself. When faced with anxiety-inducing situations, the patient regresses emotionally, retreats into herself and takes refuge in passive-receptive and hypochondriac behaviour. On account of her intrinsic sensitivity, her anxiety may be combined with reactive depression. To conclude, we are confronted with a fragile, sensitive and anxious personality, with feelings of abandonment and phobic and obsessional components, who is likely, in situations of anxiety, to regress emotionally, to withdraw into herself and to develop various manifestations of anxiety, persecution and depression.”', '12. The applicant and B.M. lived in a house which had been bought in their name but paid for by Dr M.S. The applicant’s husband worked part-time as Dr M.S.’s administrative assistant.', '13. On 25 June 2004, on the recommendation of Dr M.S., who was her general practitioner, the applicant consulted a psychiatrist, D.V., who prescribed an antidepressant, sleeping tablets and anti-anxiety medication. Dr D.V., who had suggested that the applicant undergo psychiatric monitoring, saw her again on 4 February 2005, among other occasions, and wrote to M.S. recommending that he prescribe her a new antidepressant, as well as sleeping tablets and anti-anxiety medication. The applicant consulted D.V. once a month between February 2005 and the summer of 2006. The latter noted that the applicant appeared to be “always very tense and suffering from nervous exhaustion, constituting all the hallmarks of rumination” and that she showed “symptoms of social withdrawal and abnormal exhaustion during household tasks”. In the spring of 2006 the applicant reported to D.V. that she felt isolated from her own family. From September 2006 she saw him every three weeks. In December 2006 D.V. successively prescribed the applicant two types of sleeping tablets. On 12 January 2007 she linked her exhaustion to the fact that she could not bear Dr M.S.’s presence, and on that occasion D.V. noted “a feeling of dependence” on M.S. financially, “a feeling of insecurity” and “a feeling towards that person [M.S.] which was one of intrusion, of having an unwelcome person under her roof, and also a great deal of ambivalence”.', '14. Dr D.V. saw the applicant again on 30 January and 9 and 13 February 2007. On the last-mentioned date the applicant wrote him a letter, which read:', '“Doctor, I don’t feel very well when I wake up, I have trouble getting out of bed and I have stomach cramps. I have to get up though because I have diarrhoea every morning. I have this big knot. The whole of my left arm is frozen. I feel so sad, deeply sad. I can no longer manage a coffee in the morning. I feel very weak and lacking energy. I am afraid all the time. I am afraid of myself. I am afraid of the future. When I walk down the street, I am afraid. I don’t have the courage. I don’t know where to find the courage and I am tired of it all. I don’t want to believe in a better future. I am at a dead end. I have been to a shop. I went to see if they had a very sharp meat knife. I don’t know how I am going to tell my husband all this, that I don’t feel well and that I have always kept it hidden that I felt so bad about myself and in my head and that I was taking medication. Please do something for me. I am being crushed by a mass of bad feelings. I have never felt so vulnerable. I feel unwell during the night. I often wake up and think. Ms Lhermitte ...”', '15. In February 2007 the applicant mentioned sharp knives to D.V. on one or two occasions. D.V. interpreted this as “an impulse phobia”. He saw her again on Friday 23 February 2007, noting that the applicant remained “extremely preoccupied as well, in the absence of her husband who [had] gone to Morocco again, and [found] herself having to deal alone with her uneasy feelings towards [M.S.]”.', '16. Early in the morning of 27 February 2007, the day before the incident, the applicant went to Dr D.V.’s practice and delivered a second letter which she had just written. The letter read as follows:', '“Dr [V.], you don’t have much time. I have not felt well these last few days. I’m having dark thoughts. They are suicidal thoughts which are going to carry me away and I will take my children with me. It’s a daily struggle. My friend [V.G.] is supporting me. There is no solution to my problem. I feel walled up. I feel like a prisoner. I no longer have the strength. I don’t think my husband will save me because whichever way you look at it, he is in a favourable position. He is coming home tomorrow evening but I can’t tell him of all my pain and distress. The family situation cannot be turned around. I have already had suicidal thoughts in the past. I imagine scenarios which are both true and realistic and I know I am capable. This is not a game. Sorry to take up your time! Ms Lhermitte ...”', '17. Later that day, in the early afternoon, the applicant telephoned Dr D.V.’s practice to check that her letter had actually been received.', '18. The applicant’s letters addressed to Dr D.V. dated 13 and 27 February 2007 were not included in the file on the criminal investigation. D.V. later indicated that they had not formed part of the applicant’s medical records.', '19. On 28 February 2007 the applicant left a final letter, together with a bag of jewellery, in the letterbox of her friend and confidante V.G. The letter read as follows:', '“My dear friend [V.],', 'I have cut off my phone and I am now starting to write this letter.', 'I hope you will not be shocked by what I’m going to write.', 'You must show it to [Dr D.V.] who will be at Érasme [hospital] on Friday morning at 9. He will be able to help you and explain what you explained to me so kindly when you came to my house. I don’t have the courage to get things moving and I am completely frozen and paralysed with fear because there is no solution to my problem. You have always opened your door to me and my children and have been a ray of sunshine in our life, and I will thank you forever. I have decided to go a long way away with the children forever. One day, you’ll see, we’ll meet again but I don’t regret this final solution.', 'Please let my sister Mireille ... and my other sister Catherine ... know. Please forgive me. I beg my sisters to forgive me if I have hurt them. I can no longer bear this situation, because my husband is blind and deaf and despite that, he is happy in this situation.', '[M.S.] is a bastard who has ruined my life and robbed me of my privacy with my husband and children. I left the hell of my parents’ home only to fall into another hell. ...”', '20. The applicant ended her letter by asking her friend to share her jewellery with her two sisters. She also left a voicemail message on V.G.’s mobile phone – in a voice which the investigating officers later described as “trembling” and “hesitant” – telling V.G. that she had left a letter and a present in her letterbox and asking to be “forgiven”, before saying “goodbye”.', '21. Afterwards, using two knives which she had stolen from a department store, the applicant killed her five children one by one before attempting suicide.', '22. After writing the message “call the police” on a sheet of paper stuck to her front door, she telephoned the emergency services to say that she had killed her five children and to report her suicide attempt. When the police, the ambulance crew and the medical services arrived at the scene, they found the applicant, who was injured, and the bodies of the five children with their throats slit.', '23. When the applicant was admitted to the intensive-care unit on the day of the incident, the doctor treating her noted “depressive, self-destructive thoughts against a background of psychotropic, anti-anxiety and antidepressant medication”. During her initial police interview, the applicant had explained that she had acted in a fit of despair caused by her family’s dependence on Dr M.S.', '24. On 1 March 2007 an investigating judge at the Nivelles Court of First Instance charged the applicant with the intentional and premeditated homicide of her five children. The applicant was also placed in pre-trial detention.', '25. Forensic medical reports produced between 12 March and 31 December 2007 concluded that the five homicides had been committed in a relatively short time – about ten minutes in each case – and that, in view of the speed at which the events had occurred, they were the result of a preconceived plan. In addition, toxicological analyses carried out on blood samples taken from the applicant confirmed that she had only been taking a combination of anti-anxiety medication and sleeping tablets, the plasma levels detected being described as subtherapeutic – in other words, very low.', '26. The investigating judge ordered several psychological reports. Two psychologists examined the applicant and submitted their respective reports on 30 October and 8 November 2007. They both concluded that the applicant was suffering from inner fragility requiring massive, rigid defences to preserve a perfect facade. She had developed a maternal omnipotence and a lack of psychological distance between the children and herself. Thus, by killing her children – love-objects in whom she had over-invested – the applicant was killing herself both as a person and as a mother.', '27. A psychiatric assessment was also ordered by the investigating judge, who appointed a panel of three psychiatrists, Drs G., B. and M. The panel of experts examined the applicant and drew up a report dated 30 October 2007, in which they concluded:', '“We consider that [the applicant] was in a severe state of anxiety and depression which encouraged her to act as she did and profoundly impaired her judgment, without destroying it altogether.', '...', 'The accused was not suffering at the time of the events, and is not currently suffering, from a mental disorder or a severe mental disturbance or defect making her incapable of controlling her actions.”', '28. In an order of 17 June 2008 the Indictments Division (chambre des mises en accusation) of the Brussels Court of Appeal, upholding an order made by the investigating judge on 19 May 2008, committed the applicant to stand trial in the Assize Court for the following offence:', '“... in Nivelles, on 28 February 2007,', 'having knowingly, intentionally and with premeditation, killed the following persons:', '- [Y.M.], born on 13 August 1992;', '- [N.M.], born on 13 February 1995;', '- [My.M.], born on 20 April 1997;', '- [Mi.M.], born on 20 May 1999;', '- and [Me.M.], born on 9 August 2003.”', '29. The indictment of 19 October 2008, drawn up by the Principal Public Prosecutor, ran to fifty-one pages and gave an account of the precise sequence of events, the steps taken and evidence obtained during the investigation, and the forensic medical reports; a substantial part of it also focused on the applicant’s personal history and family life and the motives and reasons that had prompted her to carry out the killings, particularly in the light of the expert assessments of her psychological and mental state.', '30. The applicant’s trial took place in the Assize Court of the province of Walloon Brabant from 8 to 19 December 2008. At the start of the trial the indictment was read out by the Advocate-General representing the prosecution, and the nature of the offence forming the basis of the charge and any circumstances that might aggravate or mitigate the sentence were likewise indicated.', '31. While giving testimony during the trial in the Assize Court, Dr D.V. mentioned the existence of the two letters dated 13 and 27 February 2007 which the applicant had addressed to him. He produced them in court, thus disclosing them for the first time in the proceedings. In view of this new evidence, the President of the Assize Court duly instructed the panel of three psychiatrists, G., B. and M., who had already been involved at the investigation stage and had already confirmed their findings orally before the Assize Court, to produce a further report.', '32. On 14 December 2008 the panel of three psychiatrists adopted a report in which they expressed a unanimous opinion. They began by noting by way of introduction:', '“[The first question, concerning the applicant’s ability to control her actions at the time of the events and at present] is regularly the most difficult and controversial because of the ‘all or nothing’ nature of the answer that has to be given regarding inability to control one’s actions, so much so that some psychiatrists have for that reason declined to produce expert reports in criminal cases. A total loss of control over one’s actions is absolutely clear only in certain cases, such as delusional psychosis (‘dementia’). In other cases, it is more debatable and the personal conviction of the experts will be influenced by the presence of certain indicators. Their conclusions, in concise form, must give precise answers to the questions set out in the instructions. These answers reflect the experts’ personal conviction after carrying out the various written procedures. They are only ever an informed opinion, and not an absolute scientific truth.”', 'The experts went on to make the following findings in particular:', '“The letter of 13 February [2007] suggests all the signs of melancholic major depression. ... These melancholic states are grounds for emergency hospital admission, or observation, where necessary. ... In the second letter, although in terms of content she unequivocally expresses her anxiety in relation to a suicide where ‘I will take my children with me, because there is no longer any future’, in terms of meaning she is clearly asking for help, apparently foreseeing her inability to control her future actions. ... These documents thus demonstrate beyond doubt that Ms Lhermitte no longer felt capable of controlling her actions ... it has always been clear that there was mental disturbance ... new evidence [warrants] the firm conviction that at the time of the events, Ms Lhermitte was incapable of controlling her actions on account of a severe mental disturbance. ... Ms Lhermitte developed a severe state of anxiety and depression ... [and] a transient dissociative state of depersonalisation, causing her to perform acts of extreme violence.

The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Strathfield in Australia.', '8. At the material time he had been a correspondent with an Australian newspaper in Turkey. He had also been working voluntarily for a bookshop specialising in books on Christianity.', '9. On 24 June 1997 he appeared in a television documentary broadcast in the framework of the programme Son çare (“Last Resort”), hosted by Ms Hülya Koçyiğit.', '10. During the programme the hostess introduced the documentary by pointing out that it concerned covert activities conducted in Turkey by “foreign pedlars of religion” (yabancı din tüccarları).', 'The ensuing documentary was along the following lines:', 'Over footage of mosques and then Christian religious ceremonies, a voice stated that everyone, whether a member of the Muslim majority or a religious minority, had the right to belong to the religion of his or her own choosing and the freedom to practise that religion. According to the voice-over, it was strange that some proselytising activities were being carried out in a covert manner, despite the freedom of conscience and religion.', 'Against a background of images of a dhikr ceremony performed by a Muslim brotherhood, showing followers in a state of trance, the voiceover asked whether, “in order to combat such instances of bigotry (yobazlık), an attempt was being made to set up groups of Christian converts, plunging the country into chaos”.', 'The voiceover explained that the aim of the programme was not to judge any specific religion but to show that whatever their nationalities or religious beliefs, the pedlars of religion all used the same methods.', '11. The voiceover explained that the programme producers had been contacted by a certain A.N., who lived in Samsun. This person had been intrigued by an advertisement asking “would you like to read books free of charge?”, and had replied. In return, he had received a number of books by mail, all of them concerning Christianity. He had written back and had once again received books on the same subject. The second dispatch had been accompanied by a letter thanking him for his interest in the subject.', '12. There had subsequently been a telephone exchange between A.N. and the sender, who had proved to be the applicant.', '13. After that exchange it had been agreed that the applicant would travel to Samsun to meet A.N.', '14. It was at that point that A.N. had decided to inform the programme producers and to invite them to make a documentary on the subject.', '15. On 17 June 1997 the applicant had travelled to Samsun to meet A.N. and some of his “friends [purportedly] interested in Christianity” for the first time, in a restaurant. The conversation had been filmed by a hidden camera.', '16. According to the voiceover, the applicant had then presented the teachings of the Bible. He had continued by comparing Christianity with other religions, emphasising his own beliefs. However, that sequence was not shown, on the grounds that the aim of the documentary was not to discuss the merits of specific beliefs but to expose the methods used.', '17. A.N. and the applicant had arranged to meet up again the next day in an apartment, again accompanied by a group of A.N.’s friends purportedly desirous of learning about the Christian religion.', '18. During that second meeting the applicant had explained that he was not alone but was part of a group working throughout Turkey. He had said that premises could be rented in Samsun for the converts, but that he would have to talk to his “boss” about that. The question of where the money would come from was difficult, but an open, intelligent attitude had to be adopted to such matters because converts could be accused of having changed religions thanks to pecuniary considerations rather than conviction.', '19. The documentary then showed the following dialogue between the applicant and one of the participants:', '“Participant:', '- Have you read the Koran?', 'Applicant:', '– Yes.', 'Participant:', '– What did you think of it?', 'Applicant:', '– I liked it. Some of the verses are good, but...', 'Participant:', '– ... but there is also some nonsense?', 'Applicant:', '– No, I wouldn’t say that, but it cannot save me, because I know I am a sinner.', '...', 'Applicant:', '– The knowledge which God has sent us is set out in the Bible, the Torah and the Book of the Psalms of David. [That knowledge] is complete in itself. We need no other prophet, because Jesus is divine in essence ...”', '20. Just as the applicant was apparently preparing, with the help of a bowl of water, to explain to the participants the ritual of baptism, the person hosting the programme, Hülya Koçyiğit, burst into the room with a camera and a microphone.', '21. She told the applicant that she had heard about the meeting and had come to make his acquaintance. She asked him who he was and where he came from.', '22. The applicant replied that he was Australian and held an identity card up to the camera. He added that he was a journalist, and was involved in explaining the Christian faith on a voluntary basis.', '23. Asked why the latter activity was covert, he answered that it was not covert, and that he had come to Samsun with full trust in the person who had contacted him.', '24. The documentary then presented an interview between Ms Koçyigit and an academic from the Istanbul Faculty of (Islamic) Theology. The latter explained that Muslims were duty-bound to respect and believe in the divine nature of the holy books of all the monotheistic religions, pointing out that Islam was a religion of tolerance. However, he voiced his surprise at the covert nature of the activities shown in the documentary.', '25. At the end of the programme the applicant was shown walking along carrying a bag. The voiceover described him as “Dion, the pedlar of religion, on his way to the police station to give a statement”.', '26. According to the applicant, the hostess of the TV programme had been accompanied by police officers when she had burst into the room, and the officers had remanded him in custody after the discussions.', '27. He had been released the following day, after having given his statement.', '28. On 25 June 1997 the Samsun prosecutor’s office brought criminal proceedings against the applicant for insulting Allah and Islam.', '29. On 28 April 1998 Samsun Criminal Court found the applicant innocent given that no evidence had been provided of a criminal offence.', '30. On 24 June 1998 the applicant filed an action for damages against the programme presenter and producers.', '31. Istanbul Regional Court (“IRC”) dismissed that action by judgment of 18 March 2003 on the grounds of the public interest of dissemination of information.', '32. By judgment of 15 June 2004 the 4th Civil Chamber of the Court of Cassation set aside the latter judgment, by four votes to one.', 'In its reasoning the Chamber noted that the case concerned a conflict of rights between freedom of expression, on the one hand, and personality rights on the other. Having reiterated the fundamental importance of freedom of the press, it pointed out that that freedom nevertheless had its limits. It considered that the claimant had not committed any unlawful act but had merely exercised his rights to freedom of expression and freedom of conscience, which two rights were secured under both the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights. That being the case, the claimant’s right to respect for his private life had suffered a twofold violation, first of all when he had been filmed by a hidden camera, and secondly when the images had been broadcast, accompanied by such expressions as “pedlar of religion” and “bigotry”.', '33. On 18 March 2003, ruling on the case referred back to it, the TGI decided not to follow the reasoning of the 4th Civil Chamber and instead to maintain its previous judgment.', '34. In the face of such resistance from the IRC, the case was referred ex officio to the Assembly of Civil Chambers of the Court of Cassation. By judgment of 7 December 2005, that Assembly upheld the finding of the first-instance court by thirty-five votes to eleven.', 'In their reasoning, the judges of the superior court held that the impugned images had not concerned details of the applicant’s private life, but had been part of a documentary on a topical issue of interest to the general public. They considered that there had been a major public interest in broadcasting the documentary at issue and that the documentary-makers had struck a fair balance between the merits and the formal aspects of the subject.', '35. According to the case file that judgment was served on the applicant on 28 February 2006.', '36. The applicant submitted that the owner of the apartment which he had rented had ended his lease following the transmission of the documentary for security reasons.', '37. He added that he had been expelled to Bulgaria.', '...']",['8'],['8-1'],[],[],[],[]

""THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA""",4,Inadmissible,Armen Harutyunyan;Kristina Pardalos;Ledi Bianku;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Pauliine Koskelo;Robert Spano,"['1. The applicant, Mr Blage Miloševski, is a Macedonian national who was born in 1960 and lives in Skopje. He was represented before the Court by Mr S. Janev, a lawyer practising in Skopje.', '2. The Macedonian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Bogdanov.', '3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '4. On 14 August 2001 J.G. (a Czech national with two office addresses, in the United Kingdom and in the Czech Republic) issued a “payment order” to Bank T., a bank incorporated in the respondent State, for payment of 1,450,000 United States dollars (USD) to the applicant, conditional upon the availability of funds in J.G.’s bank accounts in Bank T. The payment order also specified that if no funds were available in those bank accounts, J.G. would be liable to pay the applicant the pledged sum of money in cash. The relevant part of the payment order, co-signed both by J.G. and the applicant, reads as follows:', '“I, Dr J.G., Trustee and Attorney with this, hereby inform and give an irrevocable order to Fiduciary bank: T. a.d. Skopje to unconditionally pay out in my name to Mr Milosevski Blage ... the amount of USD 1,450,000.00 USD (in words: USD one million four hundred and fifty thousand) in cash from either of my accounts [opened with Bank T.] immediately after the arrival of USD 4,500,000.00 in those accounts. This payment order shall constitute a firm obligation on the part of Bank T. and it shall pay out the amount stated hereunder to Mr. Milosevski Blage immediately, whenever this payment order is presented to T. a.d. Skopje.', 'In the event that such resources ... have not arrived in either of my accounts [specified] above in due time, I am fully legally responsible to fully pay the amount of USD 1,450,000.00 in cash to Mr Milosevski Blage at his first call and demand.”', '5. On 29 June 2004 the applicant, through his representative, submitted the payment order to the Skopje Court of First Instance (“the first-instance court”) and requested its enforcement. In his “enforcement request” (предлог за извршување), amended on 3 November 2004, the applicant stated that both Bank T. and J.G. had failed to fulfil the provisions of the payment order. He proposed that enforcement be allowed in the following terms:', '“Enforcement is allowed of the payment of USD 1,450,000.00, plus interest ... and costs ... from the debtor’s [J.G.’s] funds (парични средства), that is to say (односно) from his assets in company D., incorporated in Ireland as capital of 51% in company T.T. incorporated in the Czech Republic ... by the transmission of the [first-instance court’s] enforcement order from the Ministry of Justice [of the respondent State] to the Ministry of Justice of the Czech Republic so that the competent court in the Czech Republic might proceed further with the enforcement and transfer the above-mentioned amount to the [applicant’s] personal bank account ... in Bank T. in Skopje.', 'Alternatively, if no assets of company T.T. are available in the Czech Republic, enforcement is proposed in respect of those of the debtor’s funds that are available in company T.T.’s bank accounts at Bank M. in Frankfurt, Germany, or at any other institution where the debtor holds personal capital or stake in his other companies in the Czech Republic, or movable or immovable property or capital to be found at any other place.', 'This decision will be delivered to the [respondent State’s] Ministry of Justice, so that it can be transmitted for enforcement, via the competent [Czech] ministry, to the competent authorities in the Czech Republic.', 'The applicant and his representative will be notified in the event of any problems with the enforcement.”', '6. On 9 November 2004, by affixing the standard stamp to the applicant’s enforcement proposal, the first-instance court allowed the enforcement, as proposed by the applicant (the “enforcement order”). According to the instruction contained in the text of the stamp, the debtor could object (приговор) to the enforcement order within eight days of receiving it. The enforcement order was signed by Judge V.B.', '7. The enforcement order was transmitted in the Czech Republic, through the Ministries of Justice of the respondent State and the Czech Republic, to J.G.. On 28 February 2005 J.G. signed the delivery slip, which together with the complete file was returned to the respondent State. The fact that the file was returned was the reason for the first-instance court’s seeking further information from the relevant Ministries as to whether J.G. had indeed received the enforcement order translated into Czech. The relevant Ministry did not clarify the matter.', '8. On 29 June 2005 the first-instance court, relying on “the general provisions and principles of the Enforcement Proceedings Act” (hereafter “the Act”), terminated the enforcement (се запира извршувањето) and quashed the enforcement measures (спроведените извршни дејствија се укинуваат). The first-instance court stated that the payment order could not be regarded as suitable for enforcement (извршна или веродостојна исправа), that the enforcement order had been issued in error (превид), and that it was in both parties’ interests that the enforcement be terminated. This decision was made by Judge Z.C., who had in the meantime been appointed to sit in the case.', '9. On 31 May 2006 the Skopje Court of Appeal (“the second-instance court”) upheld the applicant’s appeal and remitted the case for fresh consideration. It found that the first-instance court was bound by its enforcement order of 9 November 2004 and that it was unclear why it had concluded that it was in the parties’ interests for enforcement to be terminated. In this connection it noted that the enforcement order had been served on both parties, that neither party had appealed against it, and that the first-instance court could not assess the “substantive legality” (материјалната законитост) of the enforcement order. The second-instance court added that the first-instance court, when considering the case anew, should assess whether any of the statutory conditions for the termination of the enforcement (запирање на извршувањето) had been met.', '10. On 26 June 2006 the president of the first-instance court granted a request by the applicant for the withdrawal of Judge Z.C. and appointed Judge M.N. to sit in the case. On 12 July 2006 the first-instance court again terminated the enforcement. It noted that it had received, on two occasions, a notification from Bank T. that no funds had been available on J.G.’s bank accounts to cover the applicant’s claim. By citing provisions of the Act relevant to the courts’ territorial competence for enforcement over funds, movable property and stakes in companies (see paragraph 14 below) and by taking into account the provisions of the Trade Companies’ Act regarding companies’ seats and legal status, the first-instance court concluded that the enforcement, as allowed by the enforcement order, was impossible. In this connection, it stated:', '“... the enforcement sought concerned moveable property outside (the respondent State) ... It is absolutely impossible for a court in (the respondent State) to carry out enforcement against property in a foreign State in which different rules apply. It is true that the enforcement in the present case was allowed and that the (enforcement order) became final ... the court has no jurisdiction to proceed with the enforcement against shares in a foreign company in a foreign State ... the enforcement concerns shares of a foreign company from the Czech Republic, which is absolutely impossible to carry out under the Enforcement Act of the Republic of Macedonia. The Trade Companies’ Act clearly provides that the competent court ratione loci is the court in the place where the foreign company is registered.”', '11. On 20 July 2006 the applicant appealed, arguing, inter alia, that there was no legal ground in the Act for the termination of the enforcement in the instant case. He further submitted that under the bilateral agreement applicable between the respondent State and the Czech Republic (hereafter “the Bilateral Agreement”) (see paragraphs 16 to 18 below), the enforcement order should have been transmitted through the respondent State’s Ministry of Justice to the competent Czech authorities, so that the latter could proceed further with the enforcement.', '12. On 28 March 2007 the Skopje Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal and confirmed the lower court’s decision. It held that the first-instance court had not terminated the enforcement proceedings, but had only terminated the enforcement. In this connection it observed that a distinction should be made between (i) the termination of enforcement proceedings (запирање на извршната постапка) as a final completion of enforcement proceedings and (ii) the termination of enforcement (запирање на извршувањето) as completion of only a stage of the enforcement proceedings, completely or regarding a particular object of enforcement. The court referred to the lack of funds in J.G.’s accounts in Bank T. and reiterated the reasons of the lower court that the Macedonian courts had no jurisdiction to proceed with the enforcement against funds and moveable property in foreign companies for which the power of enforcement was vested with the courts of the jurisdiction within which such assets were located. The applicant was served with this decision on 4 October 2007.', '13. Subsequently, the applicant asked the first-instance court to attest to the finality and enforceability of the enforcement order (издавање на правосилност и извршност на решение). On 7 April 2008 the applicant’s request was dismissed. The first-instance court held that no such measure could be taken, since there existed a final decision on the termination of the enforcement. It further pointed out that no further enforcement measures could be taken on the basis of the enforcement order. On 3 July 2008 the second-instance court dismissed the applicant’s appeal and confirmed the first-instance court’s decision.', '14. This Act regulated the enforcement of court decisions. Section 13 provided for the subsidiary application of the Civil Proceedings Act. Section 69 contained a general provision that an enforcement proposal concerning moveable assets should be decided by a court with jurisdiction in the territory in which such assets are located. Sections 91 and 206 specified that an enforcement proposal concerning funds or the transfer of moveable assets should be decided, respectively, by a court with jurisdiction in the territory in which the debtor in question lives or in which such moveable assets are located. Section 137-a prescribed that enforcement proposals concerning shares and stakes in companies should be decided by a court with jurisdiction in the territory in which the company concerned is registered.', '15. Section 15 of this Act stipulated that a court should regularly and of its own motion verify that a pending case was within its competency.', '16. Article 53 of the Bilateral Agreement, which is binding on the respondent State, stipulates that the competent court for recognition and enforcement of a court judgment delivered by courts of a Contracting State shall be the court of the State in which the judgment is to be enforced.', '17. Article 54 provides that a request for recognition or enforcement can be submitted to the directly competent court in the State in which the judgment is to be recognised or enforced, or to the court which decided the matter at the first instance which shall, in such a case, transmit that request to the other State. Any such request shall be accompanied by a certified copy of the enforcement decision, together with an attestation that the decision has become final and enforceable (unless this stems from the decision itself).', '18. Under Article 55, the court of the State in which the enforcement should take place shall decide and proceed with the enforcement in line with its national legislation.']",[],[],[],[],[],[]

The applicant is a lawyer who also writes articles for various Russian law journals and online legal information databases and networks.', '7. According to the applicant, his work usually requires extensive scientific research, including in the field of law enforcement in the Khabarovsk Region. He supported his assertion with copies of contracts with well-known Russian publishing houses and owners of a number of legal magazines, including one supervised by the Secretariat of the President of the Russian Federation. Under the contracts he undertook the task of writing articles on specific topics of legal and social interest.', '8. Having received an assignment to write an article on prostitution and the fight against it in the Khabarovsk Region, on 12 May 2009 the applicant wrote to the head of the Khabarovsk Region police department by registered letter, asking for statistical data for his research. The relevant parts read:', '“[I am] interested in [receiving] information for the period between 2000 and 2009, in particular:', '[information on] the number of people found administratively liable under Article 6.11 of the ... Code of Administrative Offences (prostitution), with a breakdown by sex, residence (residents of the Khabarovsk Region or visitors), nationality (nationals of the Russian Federation, foreigners or stateless persons) and the year [of the offence];', '[information on] the number of criminal cases instituted during the abovementioned period under Articles 241, 242, 242.1 [and] 127.1 (cases related to sexual exploitation) of the ...

It appears from an acknowledgement of receipt that the letter reached the Khabarovsk Region police department on 25 May 2009.', '10. Under Russian law, State officials must provide a reply to letters from individuals within thirty days. In the absence of any response, on 26 June 2009 the applicant lodged a claim with the Tsentralniy District Court of Khabarovsk (“the District Court”), complaining that the police authorities had failed to provide him with the information he had requested and requesting for access. Relying on the Information Act (see below) and Article 10 of the Convention, he argued that the officials’ implied refusal to provide him with the information had been unlawful as he had not asked for access to any confidential personal information, State secrets or information related to internal police working methods. He claimed that his request had related purely to statistical data of a general nature collected by the Information Centre of the Khabarovsk Region police department (hereinafter “the Information Centre”).', '11. On 18 July 2009 the applicant received a letter from the head of the Information Centre, notifying him that information as specific as he had asked for could only be collected on production of a written order issued by a deputy Minister of Internal Affairs, a head of a regional or municipal police department or their divisions or a prosecutor or investigator from a prosecutor’s office. The Information Centre did not collect such information at the request of private individuals. General statistical data summarised by the Information Centre was provided to the Federal Service of State Statistics and in particular its regional office for the Khabarovsk Region, to whom the applicant could apply for the statistical data.', '12. On 19 July 2009 the applicant wrote to the Khabarovsk Region Service of State Statistics (hereinafter “the Statistics Service”) by registered letter, asking for the statistical data for his research.', '13. On 23 July 2009 the head of the Statistics Service replied, stating that specific statistical information on the fight against prostitution had never been provided by the Khabarovsk Regional police department.', '14. The applicant filed copies of his letters from the Information Centre and Statistics Service with the District Court.', '15. On 4 August 2009 it dismissed the applicant’s claim on the grounds that the Information Centre was not authorised to process data requests from private individuals. Under domestic law, the Statistics Service was tasked with dissemination of official statistical data on a broad variety of subjects, including those falling within the applicant’s field of interest. It also noted that the applicant had failed to obtain the information sought from open sources, such as libraries, archives and the Internet. The District Court also stressed that the information requested did not touch upon the applicant’s rights and legitimate interests, so the authorities’ refusal to grant him access to such information had been lawful and well-founded under section 8(2) of the Information Act.', '16. The applicant appealed, arguing, among other things, that the police authorities had exclusive possession of the information sought by him and that he had no other means, including through assistance from the Statistics Service, of obtaining the necessary data. In addition, he submitted that the fact that his rights and legitimate interests were not affected by the requested information had no bearing on the case as under Russian law, it was not only those directly concerned who were granted access to public information.', '17. On 16 September 2009 the Khabarovsk Regional Court upheld the judgment of 4 August 2009. Relying on section 8(2) of the Information Act, it concluded that the authorities were not obliged to provide the applicant with the information as it did not touch upon his rights and legitimate interests.']",[],[],[],['10'],['10-1'],[]

The applicant was born in 1955 and is currently detained in HMP Whatton.', '6. On 25 April 2007 he received an indeterminate sentence for public protection (“IPP sentence”) following his conviction of the sexual assault of a fifteen-year old girl. The offence had been committed while the applicant was on licence in the community following his release from a sentence for indecent assault against girls under the age of sixteen and while he was undertaking the Sex Offender Treatment Programme (“SOTP”) in the community. A minimum term (“tariff”) of four years was fixed.', '7. The applicant was initially detained in HMP Armley. It was recommended in 2007 that he complete the SOTP.', '8. In June 2008 he was transferred to HMP Rye Hill. He completed an Enhanced Thinking Skills (“ETS”) course in 2008 and the core SOTP on 8 March 2009. On an unknown date, he completed an Alcohol Awareness course.', '9. In August 2009 a Structured Assessment of Risk and Need (“SARN”) report identified that further work was required to reduce the applicant’s risk of reoffending. It was recommended that he complete the extended SOTP and, possibly, a Better Lives Booster (“BLB”) programme. The extended SOTP consisted of seventy-four interactive sessions plus some individual work and generally lasted for around six months.', '10. At a Parole Board review on 7 September 2009 the Panel said that much offending work still had to be done in order to reduce the applicant’s risk and that he should therefore remain in closed conditions.', '11. In September 2009 the applicant was transferred to HMP Acklington. He claims that he had been informed that the extended SOTP was available at that prison.', '12. A memo dated 24 August 2010 from the Programmes Department of HMP Acklington confirmed that the applicant had been assessed as suitable to attend the extended SOTP and that he would have to be transferred to another establishment to complete the course as it was not offered at HMP Acklington.', '13. On 27 August 2010 the applicant completed the Thinking Skills Programme (“TSP”) at HMP Acklington.', '14. In January 2011 a pre-tariff-expiry paper Parole Board review took place. By letter dated 24 February 2011 the applicant was informed that the Parole Board had not recommended his release. His request for an oral hearing was refused.', '15. The letter explained:', '“... The [Intensive Case Management] decision provides a detailed account of the index offence and your previous offending record ... You are given credit for the offence related work you have undertaken but further work in the form of an Extended SOTP (and possible a BLB programme thereafter) is considered necessary to further address your risk factors ... It is clear that significant risk reducing work is required in closed conditions before you can progress further.”', '16. By letter dated 6 April 2011 the National Offender Management Service informed the applicant that the Secretary of State agreed with the Parole Board recommendation. She considered that a number of risk factors were outstanding, namely sexual offending, feelings of grievance, distorted thinking, alcohol misuse and outbursts of anger. She was of the view that the extended SOTP was necessary to reduce the applicant’s risk level. She also indicated that an assessment for the BLB programme was necessary following completion of the extended SOTP and recommended that the applicant continue addressing his alcohol misuse. The letter expressed the expectation that the relevant interventions, or other equivalent risk reduction work, would be completed prior to the next Parole Board review. It clarified, however, that the Secretary of State could not guarantee to place the applicant on the courses identified as there were limits on the availability of resources.', '17. The review period was set at twenty-one months and was made up the following: transfer to an establishment to undertake the extended SOTP; participation in the extended SOTP; participation in post-course reviews; consolidate and test the skills learned; continued development and practice of appropriate risk strategies; assessment for the BLB programme; continued monitoring of alcohol misuse and relapse prevention work if necessary. The review was scheduled to commence in March 2012 and conclude in November 2012, with an oral hearing in September.', '18. On 26 April 2011 the applicant’s tariff period expired.', '19. The applicant sought advice on possible judicial review proceedings in respect of the delay in providing access to the extended SOTP. A letter was sent to HMP Acklington by his solicitors. On 22 September 2011 he was transferred to HMP Whatton.', '20. On 10 October 2011 the applicant requested information from HMP Whatton as to when he would begin the extended SOTP. He was informed in reply that he would be contacted to arrange an assessment as soon as possible.', '21. Meanwhile, the applicant’s solicitors wrote to HMP Whatton seeking information on when he would be allowed to participate in the extended SOTP. By reply dated 28 October 2011, the deputy extended SOTP treatment manager explained:', '“In order that we can be responsive to the needs of Mr Dillon, it is essential that we allow him a period of settling in at HMP Whatton before an assessment for the Extended SOTP can take place.', 'Assessments and placements are prioritised on a number of factors including tariff expiry, risk level and treatment readiness. However, please be assured that an assessment will take place as soon as practically possible.', 'We anticipate delivering 4 Extended Programmes in 2012 and Mr Dillon will be considered for one of these programmes, if he is found suitable. The extended programme lasts 5 months. A SARN report will then have to be completed within 26 weeks of treatment being completed. The SARN report will identify any further treatment that is necessary.”', '22. On 12 November 2011 the applicant indicated to HMP Whatton his concern that he might not be adequately prioritised for the extended SOTP, referring to the expectation that the course would be completed by his next Parole Board review. He requested confirmation that he would be prioritised for the extended SOTP.', '23. By reply dated 18 November 2011 he was informed that HMP Whatton made “every attempt to ensure prisoners are treated fairly and have access to offending behaviour programmes”. However, the letter noted that there were limited resources and that there was a large number of IPP prisoners and life sentence prisoners at HMP Whatton whose tariffs had expired.', '24. On 6 January 2012 the applicant’s solicitors wrote to the Governor of HMP Whatton to notify him of the fact that judicial review proceedings were being contemplated. They sought an undertaking that the applicant would be given access to an extended SOTP scheduled to begin in April 2012.', '25. On 19 January and 6 February 2012 the applicant was reassessed for participation in the extended SOTP. In a report dated 6 February 2012 he was found not to be sufficiently motivated to undertake the course. The report noted that the second meeting had had to be terminated on account of the applicant’s use of abusive and disrespectful language and his loud and aggressive tone. It explained that while, given the applicant’s tariff expiry date, he would have been prioritised for the April 2012 extended SOTP course, it was considered that he was not ready for secondary treatment at that time. It was recommended that the applicant complete individual work with his offender supervisor to consider, inter alia, the costs and benefits of engaging in the extended SOTP and to address his outstanding treatment needs. Further assessment would take place in June/July 2012.', '26. The applicant subsequently pursued a request for a place on an extended SOTP scheduled to commence in August 2012.', '27. On 13 June 2012 the Parole Board notified the applicant of its decision on the papers not to direct his release or to recommend his transfer to open conditions. The Parole Board set out the details of the index offence and noted that the applicant had committed the offence while on a three-year extended licence following another conviction for sexual offences (see paragraph 6 above). It considered that he had breached the trust placed in him and expressed concern that this might not bode well for the applicant’s likely compliance with licence conditions. The Parole Board reiterated the applicant’s risk factors and turned to examine the evidence of any change during sentence. It explained:', '“You completed the Core SOTP in 2009 and the Thinking Skills Programme in 2010. It was then recommended that you complete the Extended SOTP. Once this has been completed you will be assessed for other programmes such as the Better Lives Booster Programme and the Healthy Sexual Functioning Programme. You are reported to have attended for a programme assessment for the ESOTP at HMP Whatton but prison records state that this was a challenging meeting and that you were not sufficiently motivated to commence the group. You do not agree with this assessment. You will be offered the opportunity to attend for suitability assessment in the future. You have also been put forward for the CALM programme due to the violent offences on your record and difficulties in managing your emotions.”', '28. The Parole Board agreed that the applicant posed a high risk of harm to children. It commended the applicant on his completion of the ETS and core SOTP. However, it concluded:', '“... [T]here is a considerable amount of accredited offending behaviour work still recommended for you to complete to reduce your risks to a level that can be safely managed in less secure conditions. In the first instance it is recommended that you complete the Extended SOTP and CALM and that following the SARN you may need to be assessed for the Better Lives Booster Programme and Health Sexual Functioning Programme. Clearly this will take some considerable time and whilst core areas of risk remain unaddressed there is no merit in an oral hearing being held ...”', '29. The applicant was reassessed for the extended SOTP in July 2012. He was found to be suitable to participate.', '30. In late July 2012 the applicant was informed that he was being considered for a place on an extended SOTP commencing in October 2012.', '31. The applicant completed the extended SOTP in March 2013. He was advised that a SARN report would be completed within the next six months to identify any further work that needed to be done. The SARN report was completed in March 2014.']",[],[],[],['5'],['5-1'],[]

The applicant, a medical doctor by profession, was born in 1967. She currently lives in Celje, Slovenia, having lived in Šabac, Serbia, at the material time.', '6. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '7. On 2 September 1997 the applicant and her neighbour P.V. confronted each other in front of their houses following a verbal conflict between P.V. and the applicant’s mother. While the applicant allegedly shouted obscenities at him, P.V. allegedly punched her in the face, causing her to fall down and lose consciousness.

De Gaetano,"['6. The applicant company is a public limited company with its registered office in Hamburg. Among other activities, it is the publisher of the mass-circulation daily newspaper Bild.', '7. On the evening of 22 May 2005, after his party (the Social Democratic Party (SPD)) had suffered a heavy election defeat in the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia, Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who had been in power as head of the Federal Government since 1998, announced that parliamentary elections would be brought forward to autumn 2005 from their scheduled date in September 2006. Because the early elections could not be held until the Bundestag (German Federal Parliament) had been dissolved – a process which could only take place by order of Federal President of Germany after a motion of confidence in the Federal Chancellor had been defeated – Chancellor Schröder called a vote of confidence on 1 July 2005 and lost it, with 148 of the 304 members of parliament from the parties making up his government abstaining as requested by the Chancellor. On 21 July 2005 Federal President Horst Köhler dissolved the Bundestag. This means of securing the dissolution of Parliament prompted discussions in public and among members of parliament, and was also the subject of appeals to the Federal Constitutional Court, which, by a majority, dismissed them and ruled that the disputed procedure was in conformity with the Basic Law (see in particular the decision of 25 August 2005, nos. 2 BvE 4/05 and 7/05).', '8. The elections were held on 18 September 2005. None of the main political parties emerged victorious with a sufficient majority, but the parties forming the outgoing Schröder government (the SPD and the Greens) lost their majority. Subsequently, the conservative parties (the CDU and CSU) and the SPD agreed to form a coalition headed by Ms Angela Merkel, the candidate for the CDU and CSU. On 22 November 2005 Mr Schröder left office and Ms Merkel was elected as the new Federal Chancellor.', '9. On 9 December 2005, at a ceremony to mark the start of work on the Baltic Sea gas pipeline (“Ostseepipeline”), it was announced that Mr Schröder had been appointed chairman of the supervisory board of the German-Russian consortium NEGP (Konsortium Nordeuropäische Gaspipeline). The aim of the consortium, which had its registered office in Switzerland and was controlled by the Russian company Gazprom, was to build a gas pipeline to supply Russian gas to western Europe. The agreement on the principle of building the pipeline had been signed on 11 April 2005 by the German company BASF and Gazprom in the presence of Mr Schröder and the Russian President Vladimir Putin. The signing of the contract itself, initially scheduled for mid-October at an energy summit in Moscow, had taken place on 8 September 2005 – again in the presence of Mr Schröder and Mr Putin – ten days before the early elections.', '10. On the day of the announcement, a member of Bild’s editorial staff attempted to contact the deputy spokesperson for the government, S. (who had continued to occupy this post under the new government), for information on the subject but received no reply. The following day he made a further attempt, which was likewise unsuccessful. Following a third request later that day, the deputy spokesperson informed the journalist that Mr Schröder had nothing to add to his statement of 9 December 2005 in which he had indicated his willingness to accept an offer from the consortium partners to take up a position on its supervisory board.', '11. On Sunday 11 December 2005 a Bild journalist called the vice-chairman of the parliamentary group of the Free Democratic Party (FDP), Carl-Ludwig Thiele.', '12. In a sworn statement of 14 December 2005 the journalist affirmed that Mr Thiele had wondered whether Chancellor Schröder had already spoken to the Russians about a lucrative position before calling the early elections in May 2005. When asked by the journalist what he meant, Mr Thiele had replied: “The early election gambit must now be seen in a new light”. The journalist had then asked Mr Thiele whether he meant that Mr Schröder might have triggered the fresh elections on the basis of promises from Russia. Mr Thiele had replied: “That’s a question we need to ask”. He had added that, from his own experience in politics, a matter involving such a major change in personal activity must have been settled well before May. He had then asked two further questions: “Did Schröder want to resign because he had been offered lucrative positions? Did he have personal motives in deciding to call early elections in a politically desperate situation?”', 'According to the statement, Mr Thiele had agreed for his comments to be quoted. On 14 December 2005 the journalist called Mr Thiele again and asked him whether, in the light of the warning (Abmahnung) which Mr Schröder had issued to Bild, he still stood by his comments; Mr Thiele confirmed that he did.', '13. In its edition of 12 December 2005 Bild published a front-page article with the headline: “What does he really earn from the pipeline project? Schröder must reveal his Russian salary.” On page 2 of the newspaper, under the headline “Russian salary – will Schröder earn more than a million a year?” the article read as follows:', '“The ex-Chancellor and Russian gas: there is growing outrage among all political parties. For Schröder is to head the supervisory board of a business seeking to build a four-billion-euro gas pipeline through the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany. While he was Chancellor, he pushed this project through despite considerable resistance.', 'Lower Saxony Prime Minister Christian Wulff (CDU) called on Schröder to act, either by declining the chairmanship of the NEGP consortium’s supervisory board, or by revealing all his income from his Russian job!', 'Wulff told Bild: ‘Through his behaviour Gerhard Schröder has seriously damaged the reputation of politics in Germany. Schröder must decline the job of supervisory board chairman, because otherwise this may create the impression of being a reward for promoting the pipeline.’', 'The politician added: ‘If Schröder nevertheless accepts his appointment to the supervisory board, he must disclose what he is getting paid. This is a requirement under the regulations on disclosure [of income], which were toughened up by the Schröder government this year. The fact that the pipeline company has its headquarters in Switzerland is no reason for the former Federal Chancellor not to abide by these rules.’', 'Insiders reckon that Schröder is pocketing more than a million dollars a year for his gas job. After all, the Russians are not stingy. For example, five supervisory board members of the Russian company Northgas, a Gazprom subsidiary, have received payments totalling seven million dollars.', 'The fact that Schröder is walking into the joint German-Russian venture so soon after leaving the Government has been met with incredulity across all political parties. One particularly delicate matter is that on 11 April the Russian energy giant Gazprom and the German [company] BASF signed a memorandum in Hanover for the joint exploitation of a Russian gas field, in the presence of Schröder and Russian head of State Vladimir Putin. Following the signing, the two government leaders stayed up late drinking red wine together.', 'Was Schröder’s recruitment to the multinational gas company already being discussed at that time – six weeks before he called the early elections?', 'The vice-chairman of the FDP parliamentary group, Carl-Ludwig Thiele, said: ‘That’s a question we need to ask!’ Thiele has a monstrous suspicion: ‘Did Schröder want to resign because he had been offered lucrative positions? Did he have personal motives in deciding to call early elections in a politically desperate situation?’ The early election gambit should ‘now be seen in a new light’, he added.', 'Peter Ramsauer, chairman of the CSU parliamentary group in the Bundestag, said: ‘You don’t make a deal like that overnight, and Gerhard Schröder was still Chancellor three weeks ago. He should now lay his cards on the table and say whether these agreements had already been reached while he was in office.’', 'The vice-chairman of the CDU parliamentary group, Wolfgang Bosbach, added: ‘Schröder should finally say what’s going on (was Sache ist)!’', 'The economic affairs spokesperson for the Greens parliamentary group, Matthias Berninger, said: ‘Schröder must now ensure maximum transparency and disclose his contract and remuneration.’”', '14. The article on page 2 was accompanied by a photograph of Mr Schröder wearing a chapka on his head. Further down there was a short article stating that the NEGP consortium was headed by a former major from the State Security Ministry of the former German Democratic Republic, who was a friend of Mr Putin.', '15. Mr Schröder’s appointment as chairman of the supervisory board gave rise to public debate and was reported in the media and discussed in the German Parliament, in particular on 15 December 2005.', '16. An article published in Focus magazine (no. 50/2005) on 12 December 2005 stated that a journalist from the magazine had contacted the Schröder government in August 2005 to find out whether indications from Moscow that Gazprom was preparing a post for Mr Schröder were true. The government spokesperson had said that this was absurd and denied the existence of any such offer.', '17. In April 2006 it emerged that in late October 2005, while government business was still being conducted on an interim basis by the outgoing government pending Ms Merkel’s election as Chancellor, guarantees had been signed whereby the German government agreed to underwrite a loan of one billion euros from two German banks in favour of Gazprom and part of the pipeline. Mr Schröder indicated that he had had no knowledge of the signing of the guarantees and Gazprom stated that it had not made use of them.', '18. On an unspecified date in 2006 Gerhard Schröder sought an injunction in the Hamburg Regional Court prohibiting any further publication of the following passage of the article:', '“Thiele has a monstrous suspicion: ‘Did Schröder want to resign because he had been offered lucrative positions? Did he have personal motives in deciding to call early elections in a politically desperate situation?’”', '19. In a judgment of 24 June 2005 the Regional Court granted the injunction. It held in particular that the quotation in issue was neither a factual allegation nor a value judgment but mere speculation in the form of questions, the legality of which was a matter for assessment in the light of the principles established for reporting on suspicions (Verdachtsberichterstattung). According to these criteria, the courts had to assess whether the impugned report concerned a matter of public interest, whether there was a sufficient factual basis for the speculation, whether the newspaper had been sufficiently diligent in carrying out its research and in deciding to publish the report, and whether the nature of the report made it sufficiently clear that what was being reported was speculation and that the factual reality might be different. The regional court held that the publication of the passage in issue in the case before it did not satisfy these criteria in so far as the applicant company had not sought to obtain Mr Schröder’s views on the matter beforehand and had not established a sufficient factual basis to justify publishing the passage in question.', '20. In a judgment of 8 April 2008 the Hamburg Court of Appeal upheld the Regional Court’s judgment. It held that the publication of the offending quotation breached Article 823 § 1 of the Civil Code, in conjunction with Article 1004 § 1 (by analogy) of the Civil Code and the right to protection of personality rights (Allgemeines Persönlichkeitsrecht – see “Relevant domestic law and practice”), because it suggested to readers of the newspaper that Chancellor Schröder had taken the decision to hold early parliamentary elections on the basis of private considerations motivated by self-interest. The Court of Appeal found it unnecessary to determine whether the quotation in issue amounted to a genuine (open) question or a factual allegation in the form of a question, since the applicant company had conveyed a suspicion which could also have been formulated as a question. The Regional Court had thus been correct in applying the criteria for reporting on suspicions.', '21. The Court of Appeal observed that the report published by the applicant company did not merely reproduce what Mr Thiele had said, but the quotation had formed part of a significantly longer article intended to steer readers in a certain direction. It further pointed out that the article had begun by saying that Mr Schröder and the Russian President Putin had met in April 2005, and had then asked whether Chancellor Schröder’s activities on behalf of Gazprom had been discussed on that occasion. In the court’s view, this encouraged readers to believe that it was possible that an agreement had been reached for Mr Schröder to take up a private-sector post and that he had used the election defeat in North Rhine-Westphalia as a pretext for triggering a series of events that would lead to his leaving office as Chancellor. It added that this line of thinking was borne out by the two questions in the quotation in issue and the use of the phrases “early election gambit” and “must now be seen in a new light”.', '22. The Court of Appeal observed that the principles for reporting on suspicions applied to the case before it, although the report in question had not contained any suspicion that Mr Schröder had committed a criminal offence. What was decisive in the court’s view was that the applicant company had conveyed a suspicion entailing a serious and damaging accusation against the former Chancellor. The article had suggested that he had misled the general public and the electorate about the true reasons for his decision to call early elections and that he had prioritised his own financial interests over the common good, which he was required to serve as Federal Chancellor. The Court of Appeal considered that this was one of the most serious accusations that could be levelled against a person who had formerly held one of the highest State offices. In its view, the quotation in issue confirmed the seriousness of the accusation by using the phrase “monstrous suspicion”.', '23. The Court of Appeal added that the applicant company had not had due regard to the principles established for reporting on suspicions. According to these principles, any such reports had to concern a matter of justifiable public interest, have a minimum factual basis, set out the facts objectively by indicating both the circumstances supporting the suspicion and those pleading in favour of the person under suspicion, be published, in principle, after obtaining comments about the accusations from the person concerned and be the result of research satisfying the requirements of journalistic rigour.', '24. Applying those principles to the case before it, the Court of Appeal noted firstly that the subject-matter of the report was in the public interest. It also accepted that there had been sufficient material to justify reporting on the suspicions in question. In that connection, it recapitulated the sequence of events forming the background to the article, namely that Mr Schröder had expressed support for the pipeline project throughout his time as Chancellor, that he had met President Putin at the signing of the declaration of 11 April 2005 by two Russian and German private-sector firms, that he had decided to hold early elections at a time when his political party had been in difficulty following its election defeat in North Rhine-Westphalia, that he had triggered a process resulting in his relinquishing the office of Chancellor and that – according to the Court of Appeal – it had emerged that between the date of the early elections and his last day as Chancellor, Mr Schröder had secured a very well-paid post in a consortium controlled by Gazprom.', '25. The Court of Appeal added that it was especially legitimate to ask how Mr Schröder could have secured that post as the events in question belonged to an area of fundamental importance in shaping public opinion. It pointed out that the requirements for assessing the legitimacy of such a report should not be too stringent. Otherwise, there was a risk that the media would be limited to commenting on politicians’ conduct only where there was substantial evidence corroborating the suspicions raised. Such a restriction, however, was not acceptable in this sphere. The Court of Appeal noted that anyone who attracted public attention, such as politicians, had to accept that the threshold beyond which their conduct could be investigated by the media was lower than that applicable to anyone not in the public domain.', '26. The Court of Appeal added that the impugned publication had lacked objectivity and balance. It pointed out that the version of events set out in a report should not amount to a prejudgment (Vorverurteilung) of the person concerned. This was not only the case where the report gave the impression that the person had in fact done what he or she was suspected of doing, but also when a report was intentionally biased and distorted the facts for sensationalist purposes, without regard to the circumstances militating in favour of the person concerned. In the Court of Appeal’s view, this was what had happened in the case of the report in issue, since it had made no mention of any factors casting doubt on the accusations made but had referred solely to circumstances corroborating the suspicions, which to a certain extent were concentrated within the offending quotation.', '27. In this connection the Court of Appeal observed that the report did not mention that the May election defeat in North Rhine-Westphalia had considerably weakened the authority of the government majority at federal level and could have constituted a valid reason for asking the electorate, by means of early elections, whether it still supported this majority. Likewise, the report did not mention anywhere that Chancellor Schröder had not adopted an attitude of resignation but rather had been active and combative throughout the election campaign. Lastly, the Court of Appeal found that at the time of the article’s publication there had been no information from anyone close to Mr Schröder to suggest that he had based his decision to call early elections on grounds that were spurious (sachfremd).', '28. The Court of Appeal added that the applicant company had no basis for arguing that these circumstances were so well known to readers that there was no need to reiterate them in the report, since the entire article had sought to suggest to readers that there were no circumstances casting doubt on the facts as presented. Similarly, the fact that the subject of the report was of considerable public interest could not exempt the applicant company from its duty to present a balanced account of the facts. On this point, the Court of Appeal emphasised that the applicant company was not prevented from criticising Mr Schröder. However, in view of the extremely serious accusation being made, it could have been expected to indicate that the facts had yet to be established.', '29. The Court of Appeal held, lastly, that the applicant company had not carried out sufficient research before publishing the article. It considered that irrespective of whether the politician quoted in the article should have been required to conduct his own research before raising his questions, the applicant company had had a duty to clarify the facts further before publicly reproducing those questions, which concerned extremely serious allegations. It pointed out that there had been sufficient connecting factors in this regard. For example, the applicant company could have contacted the consortium in Switzerland, Mr Schröder himself or one of his team to find out when the post for the former Chancellor had been planned or created, when he had discovered the existence of the post and when and by whom the post had been offered to him. The Court of Appeal added that the fact that other media outlets had reported on similar suspicions could not release the applicant company from its duties. Moreover, the company had not asked Mr Schröder for his views. In the Court of Appeal’s opinion, irrespective of whether the views of the person concerned should always be sought when suspicions were being reported, the press had a duty in any event, in order to satisfy the requirements of journalistic rigour, to contact the person concerned when publishing speculation relating to that person’s motives, provided that the person could be reached for comment. The Court of Appeal concluded that this duty had been all the more compelling in the case before it, in view of the especially serious nature of the allegation being made.', '30. In a decision of 13 January 2009 the Federal Court of Justice refused the applicant company leave to appeal on points of law, holding that the case did not raise a question of fundamental importance and was not necessary for the development of the law or to guarantee uniformity of the case-law.', '31. On 18 February 2010 a chamber of the Federal Constitutional Court decided not to accept for adjudication a constitutional appeal by the applicant company (no. 1 BvR 368/09). It declined to give reasons for its decision.']",['10'],['10-1'],[],[],[],[]

The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Yerevan.', '6. She is a civil servant working for the Ministry of Environmental Protection (hereinafter “the Ministry”) as a State inspector. She suffers from cardiac problems, including a heart rhythm disorder.', '7. According to the applicant, on 10 January 2012 H.A., her head of division, and A.K., his deputy, used violence against her in H.A.’s office. In particular, they assaulted her, grabbed her hands, insulted her and forcibly took a document concerning her which she had taken in to them in order to write down her objections. As a result of the violence she fainted, sustained bodily injuries, received numerous bruises on her hands and was seriously humiliated.', '8. On 12 January 2012 the applicant filed a written report with the head of staff of the Ministry, giving a detailed account of what had happened. She stated, inter alia, that she had returned her appraisal report for the second half of 2011 to H.A. since she had disagreed with the assessment received. On 10 January 2012 she had been informed by one of her colleagues that H.A. wanted to see her in his office. During their meeting, H.A. had given her the appraisal report and asked her why she had not signed it. She had responded that she wanted to discuss it. H.A. had refused to provide any clarifications, stating that he was the one to make decisions and would submit the report to the relevant division without her signature. H.A. had then ordered her to return the appraisal report, which she had refused to do, stating that she would write down her objections, sign the document and then return it to him. When she had been about to leave, H.A. had immediately closed and locked the door to his office and had started to approach her, shouting that she was a thief and had stolen a document from his office. Using physical violence and personal insults, he had tried to take the papers from her. After she had called for help, A.K. had entered the office and instead of diffusing the situation had also insulted her and ordered her to hand him the documents. The two of them had grabbed her hands, causing her serious pain, and forcibly taken away the papers. As a result of the stress and pain she had fainted for a short period of time, after which she had been told that she could leave as there was nothing else to discuss. She concluded by stating that as a result of the violent behaviour of H.A. and A.K. she had suffered injuries, health problems and serious distress. She requested that the relevant measures be taken in accordance with the law.', '9. After the incident, the applicant felt unwell and underwent a medical examination. She was diagnosed with acute bronchitis and WolffParkinson-White syndrome (a heart rhythm disorder) and was put on sick leave from 13 to 27 January 2012.', '10. On 14 January 2012 the applicant reported the incident to the police, stating that on 10 January 2012 she and H.A., her head of division, had had an argument during which he had been violent and caused her bodily harm. She made a statement giving an account of events similar to that in her report to the head of staff of the Ministry.', '11. The investigator ordered a forensic medical examination the same day to determine whether the applicant had any bodily injuries and, if so, their nature, origin, seriousness and the time and manner of their infliction.', '12. On 15 January 2012 H.A. gave a statement to the police. In particular, he stated that the applicant had refused to return her appraisal report to him, after which he had left his office, closed the door and called A.K., asking him to come to see him with the other employees. During that time the applicant had kept shouting and swearing. She had called their superior to say that he had locked her in. He denied harassing the applicant either physically or verbally and said that she had used foul language.', '13. On the same day A.K. made a statement and similarly denied using violence against the applicant. Between 16 and 25 January 2012 a number of the applicant’s colleagues who were at work on the day of the incident were questioned and denied that H.A. and A.K. had been violent towards the applicant.', '14. On 18 January 2012 the forensic medical examination was completed. The relevant parts of the expert’s opinion read as follows:', '“Complaints: At present [the applicant] complains of a nervous breakdown.', 'Results of personal examination: An irregularly shaped, non-homogenous, greenishyellow ecchymosis measuring 6 x 2 cm is present on the mid-third of the inner right upper arm. Two similar round-shaped ecchymoses are present on the inner surface of the same area measuring 1 cm in diameter: on the mid-third of the inner left upper arm measuring 1 cm in diameter; on the lower third of the inner left upper arm measuring 2 x 1 cm and 1.5 x 1.2 cm and on the mid-third of the outer left forearm measuring 2.5 x 1.5 cm.', 'Conclusion: [The applicant’s] bodily injuries in the form of ecchymoses [around] the right and left upper arms and the left forearm have been inflicted with blunt, hard objects possibly in the period mentioned; [the injuries] taken separately as well as all together do not contain elements of [short-term] damage to health.”', '15. On 24 January 2012 the investigator took an additional statement from the applicant. She stated that she had no objections to the opinion of the forensic medical expert and intended to pursue her complaint.', '16. On 25 January 2012 the investigator took another additional statement from the applicant. The relevant parts read as follows:', '“Question: In the course of collecting evidence H.A. and A.K. said that they did not hit you and did absolutely not grab your hands. What can you say about this?', 'Answer: ... I do not know why H.A. and A.K. said that but it is logical that they would deny committing such acts. I will reiterate once again that H.A. and A.K. pulled and pushed me and grabbed my hands thus causing me injuries.”', '17. On 27 January 2012 the investigator took a further additional statement from the applicant. She stated:', '“I inform you that since the time I [went] to the police ... [H.A.] and [A.K.] have not even apologised; moreover, they have created such an atmosphere that it is impossible to work, since other employees ignore me and avoid contact with me for fear of losing their jobs. Since H.A. and A.K. are continuing this kind of behaviour, abusing their official capacity, in the circumstances I am unable to reconcile with them. I am complaining and requesting that H.A. and A.K. be prosecuted. I also wish to add that because of their actions I have had health problems and as a result have been on sick leave from 13 to 27 January ...”', '18. On 28 January 2012 H.A. was questioned again and stated, inter alia, that the applicant had made a false statement. He had never harassed her or grabbed her hands and had remained seated in his chair until she had left. As for the injuries discovered on the applicant’s body, H.A. stated that he had never touched her and did not know how they had been inflicted.', '19. It appears that no decision was taken by the investigator for about a month.', '20. On 24 February 2012 the applicant sent a written request to the head of the Marash Division of the Central Police Department for criminal proceedings to be brought against H.A. and A.K. She stated in her request, inter alia, that she had been informed of the provisions of Article 183 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, under which criminal proceedings could only be instituted on the basis of a complaint by her. She further stated that she had not reconciled with H.A. and A.K. and was calling for them to be prosecuted. On the same date the investigator took an additional statement from the applicant. A further additional statement was taken from her on 27 February 2012.', '21. On 1 March 2012 the prosecutor instructed the investigator to refuse to bring criminal proceedings against H.A. and A.K. on the grounds that no crime had been committed. It was suggested that the applicant had perceived the events subjectively and that her supervisors had never used violence against her.', '22. On 5 March 2012 the investigator refused to bring criminal proceedings against H.A. and A.K. for lack of corpus delicti in their actions. The decision stated, in particular, that the applicant had made unclear and contradictory statements with regard to the incident. It further stated that the evidence collected had revealed that on 10 January 2012 first H.A. and then A.K., who had gone to the latter’s office, had tried to calm the applicant down, as she had been insulting H.A. During the incident A.K. had caught hold of her hand and taken the document that she had taken from H.A. Intentional infliction of bodily harm was punishable under Article 118 of the Criminal Code, but negligent infliction of bodily harm was not punishable. In the case at hand the applicant’s injuries had been caused by H.A. and A.K.’s negligence; it had not been established that they had intentionally caused her injuries.', '23. On 13 March 2012 the applicant lodged a complaint with the prosecutor against the investigator’s decision. She argued, inter alia, that contrary to what was stated in the decision she had described in detail how she had been treated. In particular, she had submitted that first H.A. had grabbed her hands using force, harassed her and locked her in his office so that she could not leave. Thereafter A.K. had come in and also assaulted her. The applicant complained that the conclusion in the investigator’s decision, according to which H.A. and A.K. had caused her injuries by negligence, could not be substantiated and pursued the purpose of exonerating public officials from responsibility. She further complained that, as a result of deliberate violence on the part of H.A. and A.K., she had experienced severe emotional suffering as a woman since her superior had debased her and caused her serious bodily harm without good reason, right in the workplace. In addition, the applicant stated that the incident had taken place in the workplace and naturally all the witnesses questioned by the investigator were the subordinates of H.A. and A.K. If criminal proceedings were instituted, they would be questioned as witnesses and warned about criminal liability for making false statements.', '24. H.A. also lodged a complaint against the investigator’s decision, claiming that it had not been established that he or A.K. had ever hit the applicant.', '25. On 15 March 2012 the prosecutor dismissed the applicant’s complaint and allowed H.A.’s complaint. In particular, the prosecutor upheld the investigator’s refusal to institute criminal proceedings but changed the grounds for it, stating that no crime had been committed involving H.A. and A.K. The decision stated that no evidence had been obtained that would establish that H.A. and A.K. had inflicted injuries on the applicant, except her own unspecified and contradictory statements. As regards the applicant, the decision stated, inter alia, that because the stress she had suffered as a result of the incident in H.A.’s office she had perceived and described what had happened in a subjective manner. In these circumstances, her contradictory statements did not correspond to the evidence gathered but that did not create grounds for prosecuting her for false accusations.', '26. On 4 April 2012 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Kentron and Nork-Marash District Court (hereinafter “the District Court”), requesting that criminal proceedings be instituted. She reiterated her previous arguments and complained, in particular, that the question of her injuries had not been addressed at all in the prosecutor’s decision, which had ignored the results of the forensic medical examination. In the end, it had never been established who had inflicted her injuries. The applicant further complained that the prosecution had relied on the statements of subordinates of those who had committed the offence in question. Their statements could not be considered objective and reliable in view of the serious fear of those concerned losing their jobs. If criminal proceedings were instituted, they would have the procedural status of witnesses and would be warned about criminal liability for making false statements.', '27. On 18 May 2012 the District Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint. In doing so, it found that the disputed decision had been lawful, while the applicant’s arguments stemmed from an individual and subjective interpretation of the events in question and the procedural measures undertaken in relation to them.', '28. The applicant lodged an appeal against the District Court’s decision. She argued, inter alia, that it had failed to examine her arguments. In particular, the issue of the existence of a number of injuries on her body as established by the forensic medical examination had not been addressed at all.', '29. On 12 July 2012 the Criminal Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal and fully upheld the District Court’s decision. In doing so, it stated that the applicant had made unclear and contradictory statements about the circumstances of the incident which had not been corroborated by other evidence, namely the statements of H.A., A.K. and others questioned in relation to the incident.', '30. On 2 August 2012 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. She argued that the decisions of the District Court and the Criminal Court of Appeal had failed to explain the existence of injuries on her body or the fact that H.A. had locked her in his office. She also reiterated her arguments in relation to the refusal to institute criminal proceedings and the unreliability of the statements made by her colleagues.', '31. On 6 September 2012 the Court of Cassation declared the applicant’s appeal on points of law inadmissible for lack of merit.']",['3'],[],[],['3'],[],[]

The applicant was born in 1944. At the time of lodging his application, he was detained in a Centre for persons in preventive detention in Hamburg-Fuhlsbüttel Prison. He now lives in Pinneberg.', '6. On 28 March 1994 the Lübeck Regional Court convicted the applicant of rape and sexual assault. It sentenced him to eight years’ imprisonment and ordered his preventive detention under Article 66 § 1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 23 below). The court found that in August 1986 the applicant, having acted with full criminal responsibility, had raped an eighteen-year-old woman whom he had lured into a forest. It noted that between 6 October 1970 and 28 May 1991 the applicant had been convicted of five counts of rape of young women, committed only a couple of months after his release from prison. Therefore, and having consulted a medical expert, the court found that the applicant had a propensity to commit serious sexual offences and was dangerous to the public.', '7. On 10 January 2002 the applicant, who had fully served his prison sentence, was placed for the first time in preventive detention, initially in Lübeck Prison. He had thus served ten years in preventive detention by 9 January 2012.', '8. On 2 October 2012 the Lübeck Regional Court, having heard the applicant in person as well as his lawyer, by whom he was represented throughout the proceedings, ordered the applicant’s preventive detention to continue.', '9. The Regional Court considered that the requirements set up by Article 67d of the Criminal Code, read in the light of the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment of 4 May 2011 (see paragraph 23 below), in order for retrospectively-extended preventive detention to continue, were met. It found that the applicant suffered from a mental disorder, for the purposes of section 1 (1) of the Therapy Detention Act (see paragraph 23 below). He had a personality and conduct disorder as described by the relevant tool for the classification of diseases, the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems in its current version (ICD-10). The Regional Court endorsed the findings which psychiatric expert B. had made in his report dated 4 June 2010 on the possibility of granting relaxation of the conditions of the applicant’s detention (Vollzugslockerungen) after having examined the applicant in person. The expert had found that the applicant suffered from a profound and serious personality disorder with narcissistic elements and a lack of self-esteem. His disorder was characterised by denying and idealising conduct, total denial of his own aggression and minimisation of his criminal acts.', '10. Furthermore, in the Regional Court’s view, there was still a high risk that the applicant, owing to the said specific circumstances relating to his person and his conduct, would commit the most serious sexual offences if released. It had repeatedly been confirmed, in particular, by expert B. and by the Hamburg-Eppendorf University hospital, that the applicant needed comprehensive therapy for sexual offenders in a social therapeutic institution. However, the applicant, who had not completed therapy, had confirmed at the hearing that he refused transfer to the prison’s social therapeutic department. Furthermore, the applicant had already raped six women and had repeatedly reoffended shortly after his release.', '11. On 24 October 2012 the applicant lodged an appeal against the Regional Court’s decision with the Schleswig-Holstein Court of Appeal. He argued that his continued preventive detention beyond the former tenyear time-limit breached the Basic Law, as interpreted by the Federal Constitutional Court, and the Convention. He complained, in particular, that the Regional Court had failed to obtain a new report by a different expert and had relied on the report of expert B. dating back two-and-a-half years, on relaxation of the conditions of the applicant’s detention, which had not addressed the issues relevant to his continued detention.', '12. On 21 November 2012 the Schleswig-Holstein Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal. As regards the finding that the applicant suffered from a mental disorder for the purposes of section 1 (1) of the Therapy Detention Act, the Court of Appeal stressed that the decision to extend the applicant’s preventive detention had not only been based on the written report submitted by expert B. in 2010. The expert had been heard in person by the Regional Court in different proceedings (concerning the applicant’s transfer to a psychiatric hospital, see paragraph 19 below) on 6 June 2012 and had updated and confirmed his previous findings. His assessment had further been shared by the Hamburg-Eppendorf University hospital in its statement dated 27 March 2012 on the therapeutic progress made by the applicant. The hospital, having regard to the voluminous casefile, had confirmed expert B.’s conclusion that the applicant, who had refused any therapeutic treatment for years, suffered from a profound personality disorder as defined by the ICD-10, namely a narcissistic personality disorder with emotionally unstable and sadistic elements.', '13. The Court of Appeal, having regard to the applicant’s previous offences and the fact that therapy to date had not yielded success, further agreed that there was still a high risk that the applicant would commit the most serious sexual offences if released. As had been confirmed by the applicant in the hearing before the Regional Court, his personal and therapeutic situation had not changed since the Court of Appeal’s last decision of 18 November 2011 in which, in periodic review proceedings, it had ordered the extension of the applicant’s preventive detention.', '14. On 17 December 2012 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court. He complained that the extension of his preventive detention beyond the former statutory ten-year time-limit had violated his right to liberty and the protection of legitimate expectations in a State governed by the rule of law.', '15. The applicant claimed that the restrictive criteria set up by the Federal Constitutional Court in its judgment of 4 May 2011 for a continuation of his retrospectively extended preventive detention had not been met. In particular, the order for the continuation of his preventive detention had been based on an old expert report on relaxation of the conditions of his detention, which had not addressed the criteria set up by the Federal Constitutional Court. In these circumstances, the courts had not had at their disposal a sufficient basis for concluding that he had a mental disorder for the purposes of the Therapy Detention Act. In any event, he did not suffer from a mental illness as required by Article 5 § 1 (e) of the Convention.', '16. On 20 March 2013 the Federal Constitutional Court, without giving reasons, declined to consider the applicant’s constitutional complaint (file no. 2 BvR 2886/12).', '17. From 10 January 2002 until 22 May 2013 the preventive detention order against the applicant was executed in Lübeck Prison, where the applicant was detained together with persons serving their prison sentence. For as long as the applicant’s detention was executed at that prison during the time covered by the proceedings at issue, the applicant, having refused repeated offers of treatment, in particular transfer to the socialtherapeutic institution of Lübeck Prison, apparently did not undergo any therapy for sexual offenders. His occasional conversations with the prison psychologists had been discontinued in May 2012.', '18. On 22 May 2013 the applicant was transferred to the newly-set-up Centre for persons in preventive detention in Hamburg-Fuhlsbüttel Prison. That Centre was built in order to comply with the constitutional requirement, as defined by the Federal Constitutional Court in its judgment of 4 May 2011, to differentiate between preventive detention and imprisonment. Soon after his transfer to that Centre the applicant started comprehensive therapy, including one-to-one and group therapy sessions. He was granted leave without escort from March 2014 onwards.', '19. Prior to the proceedings at issue, on 14 June 2012 the Lübeck Regional Court dismissed the prosecution’s request to transfer the applicant to a psychiatric hospital for the further execution of his preventive detention under Article 67a § 2 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 23 below). Having heard psychiatric expert B., the Regional Court found that the applicant’s reintegration into society could not better be supported in a psychiatric hospital. It was necessary for the applicant to undergo therapy for sex offenders in a social-therapeutic department in prison or possibly with an external social therapist. Transferring the applicant, who was not willing to undergo therapy, to a psychiatric hospital against his will would not yield any success.', '20. On 24 October 2013, in new review proceedings, the Hamburg Regional Court ordered the applicant’s preventive detention to continue. It had regard to the report dated 28 August 2013, submitted by psychiatric expert L., on the applicant’s mental condition and the danger he represented. Having examined the applicant in person, L. had considered that the applicant was an accentuated personality, possibly with sadistic personality traits, and lacked self-esteem. He found, however, that the applicant could not be diagnosed with a mental disorder as defined in the ICD-10; in particular, he showed no signs of sexual sadism. There was a medium risk that the applicant would again commit serious sexual offences if released.', '21. On 29 August 2014 the Hamburg Regional Court, having regard to an additional report drawn up by expert L., declared the applicant’s preventive detention terminated and ordered his release on 1 October 2014. It found that the applicant neither suffered from a mental disorder nor was there a high likelihood that he would commit the most serious crimes of violence or sexual offences if released.']",[],[],[],"['5', '7']","['5-1', '7-1']",[]

The applicant was born in 1964. He is currently serving a prison sentence in the Pravieniškės Correctional Home (Pravieniškių pataisos namai – atviroji kolonija).', '6. In March 2009 the applicant was arrested and placed in pre-trial detention on suspicion of several instances of trafficking drugs in very large amounts as part of an organised group.', '7. Between 30 March 2009 and 14 June 2010 the applicant was held at Lukiškės Remand Prison (Lukiškių tardymo izoliatorius - kalėjimas) in cells which measured approximately eight square metres and which housed between two to four detainees.', '8. On 14 June 2010 the applicant was transferred to Kaunas Remand Prison (Kauno tardymo izoliatorius). According to a document issued by that prison, the average space per prisoner in the cells where the applicant was held varied, but was sometimes less than three square metres per inmate.', '9. On 2 September 2011 the applicant complained to the Prisons’ Department (Kalėjimų departamentas), a body that oversees Lithuanian prisons, about the conditions in which he had been held (dėl buvusių prastų kalinimo sąlygų) in Lukiškės Remand Prison. In its reply of 15 September 2011, the department admitted that the applicant’s allegations that he had been held in overcrowded cells in Lukiškės had been partly proved.', '10. After visiting Kaunas Remand Prison on 28 November 2011, the Public Health Centre (Visuomenės sveikatos centras) found that the prison complied with general health and hygiene requirements.', '11. On 5 August 2013 the applicant started court proceedings for damages, arguing that the conditions of his detention in Lukiškės Remand Prison had been abysmal.', '12. By a decision of 19 November 2013, the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court held that the applicant had missed the three years’ statutory deadline to lodge a claim for damages, because he had been released from Lukiškės Remand Prison on 14 June 2010.', '13. The applicant appealed, arguing that he had only learned in July 2012 that his rights had been breached, when he had started communicating with his current representative before the Court, Mr S. Tomas.', '14. By a final decision of 30 October 2014, the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the appeal, noting that the applicant could have asked for legal aid to start court proceedings for damages in a timely fashion if he had been without sufficient means to employ a lawyer.', '15. On 22 September 2011, while he was being held at Kaunas Remand Prison, the applicant had his first myocardial infarction. He was taken that day to a public hospital – the cardiology unit of the Hospital of the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences’ Kaunas Clinics (Lietuvos sveikatos mokslų universiteto ligoninė – Kauno klinikos, hereinafter – “the Kaunas Clinics”), where he underwent a surgical intervention. The doctors noted in the applicant’s medical file that he was a heart attack risk because he had smoked 10-15 cigarettes a day for twenty-five years. Another risk factor was hereditary, because the applicant’s father had had myocardial infarction.', '16. On 28 October 2011 the Kaunas Clinics’ doctors concluded that the applicant’s condition had stabilised (būklė stabilizavosi). The applicant was prescribed medications for his condition (medikamentinis gydymas), explained what kind of diet and health regime to follow and transferred to the Prison Department Hospital (Laisvės atėmimo vietų ligoninė).', '17. As can be seen in the documents submitted by the parties, and as was later confirmed by the Ombudsperson (see paragraph 30 below), the doctors at the Prison Department Hospital, on the instructions of the doctors at the Kaunas Clinics, performed a number of tests on the applicant (including urine, blood, and an ECG). They also prescribed a diet that was low on salt and fat. Given that the applicant’s state of health was stable and improving, on 3 November 2011 the applicant was sent back to Kaunas Remand Prison. The doctors recommended that he continue to take the medications he had been prescribed.', '18. On 6 December 2011 the applicant was again placed in the Prison Department Hospital for an earlier scheduled consultation. He had some diagnostic tests and was treated with medications.', '19. On 14 December 2011, while at the Prison Department Hospital, the applicant had a second myocardial infarction and was immediately transferred to a public hospital – the Cardiology and Angiology Centre of Vilnius University Hospital’s Santariškės Clinics (Vilniaus Universiteto Ligoninės Santariškių klinikos, hereinafter – “the Santariškės Clinics”), where he was examined and tests were performed. Two days later, on 16 December 2011, the doctors in Santariškės held that the applicant’s state of health was stable, and on that day he was returned to the Prison Department Hospital.', '20. While being held at the Prison Department Hospital, on 6 March 2012 the applicant was taken back to the Santariškės Clinics for a consultation. The doctors recommended the applicant be treated with medications and also prescribed a diet which was low on salt and fat. The doctors also recommended that the applicant engage in physical activity for 45 to 50 minutes a day. They also recommended that the applicant be “brought back to the Santariškės Clinics’ Cardiology and Angiology Centre after six months (po 6 mėnesių) for a consultation, having registered in advance”.', '21. On 15 March 2012 the Prison Department Hospital released the applicant back to Kaunas Remand Prison. The applicant’s medical record indicates that he was released because his state of health “had improved (pagerėjo)”. It also states that the applicant “could walk (gali eiti)”. Among the risk factors, the doctors noted that the applicant smoked. It was recommended that the applicant have further outpatient treatment with medications (medikamentinis ambulatorinis gydymas), follow a diet that was low on fat and salt and be physically active by taking exercise (fizinis aktyvumas).', '22. On 31 December 2011 the applicant was issued with a certificate that he had lost 60% of his capacity for work. The document stated that he could not perform any work where he needed to lift more than 15 kilograms. However, the applicant could do work that involved walking, sitting or bending.', '23. In reply to a complaint by the applicant’s lawyer, on 14 May 2012 the Prison Department Hospital noted that it had rigorously adhered to the instructions from cardiologists of category III medical care institutions (see paragraph 65 below).', '24. The applicant was again admitted to the Prison Department Hospital, staying there from 27 to 29 March 2012 with digestion-related issues (haemorrhoids). The doctors noted that the applicant had got haemorrhoids three years previously. After examining the applicant, they prescribed outpatient treatment with medications, and noted that he was fit enough to be taken to a court hearing.', '25. In April 2012 the Kaunas Remand Prison’s administration told the applicant in reply to a request that as of that month he would be provided the same menu of food as women (Jums bus tiekiamas maitinimas pagal moterų valgiaraštį).', '26. After visiting the Prison Department Hospital between 7-22 May 2012, the Public Health Centre concluded that the hospital complied with general health-care and hygiene requirements.', '27. The applicant was admitted to the Prison Department Hospital from 21 to 28 June 2012 for a scheduled follow-up (planine tvarka) of his heart condition. The applicant’s medical record shows that a number of tests had been performed on him, the doctors concluded that his state of health was “unchanged (be pakitimų)” and “satisfactory (patenkinama)”. The medical certificate issued at the time of the applicant’s discharge from the hospital on 28 June 2012 also indicated that he smoked, which was a risk factor.', '28. In March 2012 the applicant also wrote to the Ombudsperson, complaining that he had been held at Lukiškės Remand Prison, Kaunas Remand Prison and at the Prison Department Hospital, where he had suffered great psychological stress. He argued that in those facilities his health had worsened and as a consequence he had suffered two myocardial infarctions. He also claimed that in Kaunas Remand Prison he had not been provided with the right diet, going against the doctors’ recommendations. The applicant was also dissatisfied with the fact that he had not been provided rehabilitation therapy. In April 2012 the applicant withdrew, in writing, the part of his complaint concerning Kaunas Remand Prison, stating that he had no complaints about that facility.', '29. On 6 June 2012 the Ombudsperson accepted the applicant’s withdrawal of his complaint as regards Kaunas Remand Prison. The Ombudsperson, however, established that the conditions of the applicant’s detention at Lukiškės Remand Prison, where he had been held between March 2009 and June 2010, as well as at the Prison Department Hospital, where he had been held between 16 December 2011 and 15 March 2012, had been in breach of domestic legislation on overcrowding. In particular, the applicant had been held in the Prison Department Hospital in a room where he had had 4.42 square metres of personal space.', '30. The Ombudsperson nevertheless dismissed the complaint about a lack of proper medical care. After examining the documents related to the applicant’s treatment in hospitals, the Ombudsperson noted that, contrary to the applicant’s submissions, neither the Kaunas Clinics nor the Santariškės Clinics had prescribed him a course of rehabilitation therapy after the applicant’s first and second heart attacks respectively. On the contrary, both Clinics had made recommendations for further treatment, such as the medications, tests and dietary requirements which were required, and which the Prison Department Hospital had followed.', '31. According to three documents provided by the applicant’s representative, Mr. S. Tomas, in September and December 2012 and in April 2013 the outpatient polyclinic in Upninkai (Upninkų ambulatorija, hereinafter – Upninkai Polyclinic), a village in Jonava district in Lithuania, gave “the applicant’s authorised person” three written statements by the polyclinic’s head doctor. They noted that the applicant had suffered from myocardial infarction and summarised his medical history. One of those documents also stated that because of his state of health, as seen in the light of certain legal acts issued by the Minister of Health, the applicant should be released from serving his sentence.', '32. In November 2012 the applicant was taken to the Prison Department Hospital for a planned consultation with a cardiologist. The applicant spent about a month there. During that time, on 15 November 2012, he was also taken to the Santariškės Clinics, where the doctors performed a cardiopulmonary exercise test (veloergometrija) and an ultrasound examination of the heart (ultragarsinis širdies tyrimas). The applicant’s heart was rhythmical, with no decompensation. The cardiologists prescribed medications to treat the applicant, said he should limit his intake of fat and salt (as concerned his diet) and have 45-50 minutes of physical activity a day. He was to return for a further consultation, although the exact date was not indicated.', 'The doctors in the Prison Department Hospital also performed a number of tests. When they released the applicant back to Kaunas Remand Prison on 5 December 2012 they concluded that “his illness was without complications (ligos eiga: be komplikacijų)”. The applicant’s state of health was “satisfactory (patenkinama)”.', '33. As can be seen from the applicant’s medical records, on 12 February 2013 Kaunas Remand Prison sent him to the Prison Department Hospital for “a full examination, follow-up and treatment” of his heart condition. The doctor’s examined the applicant, including an ECG and blood tests, and concluded that his state of health was “satisfactory”. It was noted that the applicant smoked.', '34. After the applicant’s arrest on 25 March 2009, a court sanctioned his pre-trial detention for an initial duration of three months. The detention was then prolonged a number of times.', '35. On 28 November 2011 the Kaunas Regional Court extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention for three months on the grounds that the applicant was suspected of being the organiser of a criminal group which committed drug-related crimes, that he had connections abroad, did not work and faced a heavy sentence. Moreover, there was evidence in the file that the applicant had attempted to influence other suspects, thus impeding the criminal investigation.', '36. The applicant’s lawyer appealed, arguing that her client had suffered a double myocardial infarction, had been operated on and treated at the Prison Department Hospital. In addition, he had another illness, connected to the digestive system. The lawyer argued that her client would not receive proper medical assistance, as regarded his regime and diet, in the Prison Department Hospital. She asked that a milder remand measure than pre-trial detention be ordered.', '37. On 29 December 2011 the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, finding that milder remand measures would hinder the course of justice. It held that there was no information in the file preventing the holding of the applicant in pre-trial detention because of his state of health. The court noted that the applicant was being held at the time at the Prison Department Hospital and was receiving 24-hour medical assistance.', '38. In March 2012 the applicant’s lawyer submitted several new requests asking to replace detention with a less severe remand measure owing to the deterioration of the applicant’s health while in detention. She also relied on the Santariškės Clinics’ record of 6 March 2012, where it was stated that the applicant needed a low-salt diet, a special regime for his meals and physical activity. The lawyer maintained that such assistance could not be provided at Kaunas Remand Prison or at the Prison Department Hospital, thus preventing the applicant from having satisfactory medical care.', '39. On the basis of the request by the applicant’s lawyer, on 23 March 2012 the Kaunas Regional Court ordered a comprehensive forensic examination to be performed by a doctors’ commission, comprising a cardiologist, to answer the question whether the applicant was ill with a serious, incurable illness (sunki nepagydoma liga), and, if so, whether for that reason he could be released from serving a sentence. In the meantime, the court extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention.', '40. On 20 April 2012 the Court of Appeal upheld the decision to extend the applicant’s detention. The court observed that although the applicant had serious health problems, he had always been provided with adequate treatment at the Prison Department Hospital or, if necessary, in a public hospital.', '41. After examining the applicant’s medical records from the Kaunas Clinics and the Santariškės Clinics, as well as from the Prison Department Hospital, on 11 June 2012 experts from the State Forensic Medicine Service (Valstybinė teismo medicinos tarnyba) produced report no. EKG 24/12 (02). It read that the applicant had an ischaemic heart illness, having suffered a myocardial infarction; he also had hypertension and ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Those ailments should be classified as serious and incurable illnesses. However, the experts concluded that the applicant’s state of health at the time did not meet the criteria which allowed a convicted person to be exempted from serving a sentence, according to the rules set by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of the Interior (see paragraph 49 below). One of the doctors on the commission was a cardiologist, a professor and habilitated doctor of sciences at the Kaunas Clinics. Another doctor was a surgeon with 35 years of experience.', '42. The applicant’s pre-trial detention was then prolonged by court rulings on 13 June, 24 July and 25 September 2012.', '43. The last pre-trial detention order was upheld on 19 October 2012 by the Court of Appeal. The applicant’s lawyer referred to the reports from the Upninkai Polyclinic and claimed that neither Kaunas Remand Prison nor the Prison Department Hospital could guarantee the necessary medical care for the applicant. The Court of Appeal however noted absence of any new documents showing that the applicant’s state of health had worsened. The Court of Appeal also had regard to the practice of the Court to the effect that the State should protect inmates’ physical health (it relied on Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, ECHR 2000XI, and Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, ECHR 2001III). However, in the applicant’s case there was no evidence that there would be a lack of medical assistance. Furthermore, the comprehensive medical examination (see paragraph 41 above) had not ruled out keeping the applicant detained, and, in the court’s view, its conclusions prevailed over those of the Upninkai Polyclinic. There was no reason to hold that keeping the applicant detained, and, if necessary, treating him at the Prison Department Hospital or in another hospital, could be considered as inhuman or degrading.', '44. By a judgment of 13 December 2012, the Kaunas Regional Court found the applicant guilty of a number of drug-related crimes and sentenced him to sixteen years and six months imprisonment in a correctional home. The applicant was to remain detained until the judgment became final.', '45. The applicant’s conviction was upheld by the Court of Appeal on 31 March 2014, but the sentence was changed to fourteen years of deprivation of liberty in a correctional home.', '46. By a final judgment of 16 December 2014, the Supreme Court upheld the appellate court’s verdict. The Supreme Court also relied on expert report no. EKG 24/12 (02) (see paragraph 41 above), and held that the lower courts had been correct in finding that the applicant’s state of health did not prevent him from serving a prison sentence.']",[],[],[],['3'],[],[]

The applicant was born in 1991 and lives in Zakan-Yurt, Chechnya.', '6. The facts of the case are connected to Isayeva v. Russia, no. 57950/00, 24 February 2005, and Abuyeva and Others v. Russia, no. 27065/05, 2 December 2010. These two applications were lodged by residents of Katyr-Yurt, Chechnya, who alleged that their relatives had been killed or wounded, and that they had suffered injuries and lost their property during the attack on the village from 4-7 February 2000. In the Isayeva case, cited above, the applicant and her relatives were trying to flee the fighting on 4 February 2000 when an aviation bomb exploded near their minivan, wounding the applicant and killing three of her relatives. In the Abuyeva and Others case, cited above, the applicants described how they had been trapped in the village during intense shelling and had tried to leave through what they had perceived to be a safe exit route. The Court has established a number of facts relevant to the present case, which can be summarised as follows.', '7. Ever since the start of operations by the Russian military and security forces in Chechnya in the autumn of 1999, the village of Katyr-Yurt, situated in the Achkhoy-Martan district, had been considered a “safe zone”. By the beginning of February 2000 up to 25,000 persons were living there, including local residents and internally displaced persons from elsewhere in Chechnya. In the period leading up to 4 February 2000 the residents of Katyr-Yurt were not informed by the State authorities about the possible advance of illegal fighters into the village, even though such information was available to the military commanders. On 4 February 2000 the village was captured by a large group of Chechen fighters escaping from Grozny. The Russian military forces carried out an assault, using indiscriminate weapons such as heavy, free-falling aviation bombs, artillery, missiles and other weaponry. Although the operation was not spontaneous and involved the use of indiscriminate and highly lethal weaponry, the residents of the village were provided neither with sufficient time to prepare to leave nor with safe exit routes to escape the fighting. The two exits from the village were controlled by the military by means of roadblocks. The residents were allowed to leave through the roadblock on the road leading towards the district centre of Achkhoy-Martan, but the other one, on the road leading towards Valerick, remained closed during most of the fighting. The shelling of Katyr-Yurt continued until 7 February 2000 inclusive (see Abuyeva and Others, cited above, §§ 8 and 197-201).', '8. The applicant and her family had been living in the village of ZakanYurt, situated about thirteen kilometres from Katyr-Yurt. In November 1999 the applicant turned eight years old. She had lived with her mother, father, two elder brothers and a younger sister. She could remember the events of winter 1999-2000 when the hostilities erupted. On 1 February 2000 a large group of insurgent fighters entered Zakan-Yurt, walking into houses and asking for clothes and food. On the same day airstrikes started. The applicant’s family went into hiding in a cellar.', '9. On 2 February 2000 the applicant’s family decided to travel to KatyrYurt, which the applicant’s father described as a “peace zone”. The applicant’s father drove his black Volga car; her mother and brother Magomed sat in front, while the applicant, her sister Madina and brother Ruslan, as well as two cousins, Khava and Luiza Abakarovy, were in the back seat. On the same day they arrived in Katyr-Yurt and stopped in the centre of the village.', '10. According to the applicant, they did not know anyone in the village and an unknown man invited them to stay at his house, as did many other villagers. The family stayed with this man for two nights and everything was calm. On the morning of 4 February 2000 airstrikes started, and there were a lot of explosions. The applicant’s family went into the cellar under their host’s house. Many other people also arrived, including relatives and acquaintances from Zakan-Yurt. They stayed in the cellar throughout the day, while the shelling of the village continued.', '11. Later in the afternoon the applicant’s father said that it was too dangerous to stay in Katyr-Yurt and that they would drive to AchkhoyMartan. The applicant’s father, mother, two brothers and two cousins, as well as the applicant herself, got into the car. The applicant remembered seeing a lot of people on cars, tractors and on foot trying to get out of KatyrYurt. There were explosions.', '12. At some point the applicant lost her conscious awareness of what was happening and found herself lying in the road. Their car was burning. She could see her sister Madina, brother Ruslan and cousin Luisa. They were all alive but wounded and burned. The applicant could not see her parents. An old man brought the applicant into the courtyard of a house. Sometime later the applicant, her sister, brother and cousin were put on a bus. The applicant lost consciousness and woke to find herself in hospital in Urus-Martan. Her legs were covered with plaster, and her face and hands were burned. She also saw her sister Madina in the same room.', '13. On 5 February 2000 the applicant and her sister were brought by ambulance to Nazran, Ingushetia. The following morning the applicant did not see her sister and she did not know at that time where her family was.', '14. On 4 March 2000 the applicant was discharged from the Nazran hospital, with her legs still in plaster. She was diagnosed with fractures of the left hip and right shin, and thermal burns. The circumstances of the wounding were indicated as “shelling, direct hit on the car in which the family was travelling”. The applicant went to live with her grandmother in Zakan-Yurt. There she learnt that her whole family had died. As a result of the air-strike, the following relatives of the applicant were killed:', '- Mr Mansur Abakarov, born in 1955, the applicant’s father;', '- Mrs Khava Zaumayeva, born in 1954, her mother;', '- Mr Ruslan Abakarov, born in 1987, her brother;', '- Mr Magomed Abakarov, born in 1985, her brother; and', '- Mr Madina Zaumayeva, born in 1994, her sister.', '15. The applicant’s cousin Ms Khava Abakarova was also killed.', '16. In March and April 2000 the Achkhoy-Martan district civil registration office recorded the deaths of the applicant’s mother, father and three siblings which had occurred in Katyr-Yurt on 4 February 2000. The cause of death was recorded as splinter wounds and burns.', '17. On 16 September 2000 the prosecutor’s office of the AchkhoyMartan district (the district prosecutor’s office) initiated an investigation into the events of 2-7 February 2000 in Katyr-Yurt in response to a complaint by the applicant in the Isayeva case, cited above.', '18. On 19 February 2001 the investigation into the criminal case was transferred to the military prosecutor’s office of the North-Caucasus Military Circuit (the military prosecutor’s office). The case file was assigned number 14/00/0004-01.', '19. It appears that in 2000-2001 the investigation questioned most of the applicants in application no. 27065/05, as well as other individuals who had been in Katyr-Yurt at the time.', '20. At that time the investigation found it established that 43 civilians had been killed and 53 wounded as a result of the operation. 62 individuals were granted victim status in the proceedings. The applicant’s relatives and the applicant herself were not listed among the victims.', '21. On 13 March 2002 the military prosecutor’s office terminated the proceedings in criminal case no. 14/00/0004-01. The decision referred to a large quantity of documents and statements from dozens of witnesses, including local residents, servicemen from various units, and commanding officers. The decision also referred to the results of the military experts’ report of 11 February 2002, which established that the actions of officers from the Internal Troops involved in the special operation in Katyr-Yurt on 4-6 February had been appropriate to the circumstances and in line with the applicable legal provisions. On this basis the investigation concluded that command corps’ actions were absolutely necessary and proportionate to the resistance put up by the insurgent fighters. It found an absence of corpus delicti in the actions of the servicemen. By the same decision the victim status of 62 individuals was withdrawn. The individuals in question were to be informed of the possibility of seeking redress through civil proceedings.', '22. It appears that the victims were not informed by the prosecutor’s office about the termination of the proceedings and nothing happened until January 2005, when they learnt that the proceedings had been terminated.', '23. Between January and March 2005 the applicants in application no. 27065/05 contacted the military prosecutor’s office in writing, seeking information about the progress of the investigation in case no. 14/00/000401. They referred to the circumstances of the deaths and wounding of their family members and asked to be granted formal status of victims in the proceedings.', '24. In response to these requests, between January and April 2005 the military prosecutor’s office informed the applicants of the results of the military experts’ report, the termination of proceedings in criminal case no. 14/00/0004-01 and the withdrawal of victim status in 2002. The letters also confirmed that the investigation had established the deaths and injuries of which they had complained and informed them that they could apply to a civil court to obtain compensation. Some of these letters contained the decision of 13 March 2002 as attachment.', '25. On 6 June 2005 26 applicants in Abuyeva and Others case lodged a claim with the military court of the North-Caucasus Military Circuit. They complained about the ineffectiveness and incompleteness of the investigation. In particular, the applicants noted that some of their relatives’ deaths had not been recorded by the investigation and that these persons had not been listed amongst those who died in Katyr-Yurt in February 2000. They asked the court to quash the decision to terminate the criminal proceedings and to oblige the military prosecutor’s office to resume the investigation in the criminal case, to grant each of them the status of victim in the criminal proceedings, and to issue them with copies of the relevant decisions. These complaints did not directly refer to the situation of the applicant’s family.', '26. The applicants’ request was granted and the case was reopened in 2007 under the number 44/00/0026-05. However, on 14 June 2007 the investigation was closed, with the same conclusions as in March 2002, on the basis of Article 39, part 1 of the Criminal Code. The decision confirmed the deaths of 46 and the wounding of 53 local residents, without listing their names. An additional expert report was produced by the Military Academy of the Armed Forces in June 2007, which found that the actions of the command corps in planning and executing the operation had been reasonable and in line with domestic law. No copy of that report has ever been disclosed to the applicants or submitted to the Court. The decision stated in this respect:', '“... The actions of the fighters (the occupation of Katyr-Yurt by a group of fighters numbering three to four thousand persons, the fighters establishing strongholds in the houses, [their] fierce resistance and their using local residents as a “human shield”) ... represented a real danger to the lives and health of the local residents, and could have entailed unnecessary losses by the federal forces ...', 'These circumstances required the taking of adequate measures by the command corps in order to prevent the danger of armed assault against the citizens and their lives and property (residents of Katyr-Yurt and military servicemen), in addition to [the need to safeguard] the interests of society and the State which are protected by law (the reinstatement of the constitutional order in Chechnya). After issuing a preliminary notification and giving the civilians a real opportunity to leave the village, the subsequent extermination of pockets of the fighters’ resistance by means of artillery and attack aircraft, employing area-point method (“зонально-объектовый метод”), did not exclude deaths among civilians. At the same time, the use of such means of extermination was consistent with the circumstances and with the measures taken in order to minimise losses among civilians. The actions of the command corps (commanders) during the preparation and carrying out of the special operation aimed at the liberation of Katyr-Yurt between 4 and 7 February 2000 were in line with the requirements of relevant field manuals, internal regulations and instructions, were lawful and did not contain elements of criminally ”.', '27. The decision to grant victim status to 95 people was quashed. The military prosecutor of the United Group Alliance in the Northern Caucasus (UGA) forwarded the decision to the head of the Government of Chechnya, asking it to identify the victims’ places of residence and to inform them of the closure of the investigation, as well as the possibility of seeking compensation through the civil courts.', '28. The name of the applicant in the present case was not listed among the 95 individuals who had been granted victim status.', '29. After discharge from hospital, the applicant had to keep plaster on her legs for three months. Because the hostilities in Chechnya were still ongoing, her relatives took her to the Volgograd Region to continue her treatment. In 2002 the applicant was taken to Norway for treatment for one week. In 2002 her paternal grandmother, with whom she had been living after her parents’ deaths, died. After that the applicant lived with her maternal grandparents in Zakan-Yurt.', '30. In their observations of September 2010, the Government stated that in 2001 a witness had told the investigators about the deaths of six people in a Volga car (see Isayeva, cited above, § 56) but their identities were unknown at that time. It was not until the applicant’s questioning in March 2007 (see below) that the investigation obtained this information.', '31. In December 2006 a distant relative of the applicant’s took her to a human rights organisation, at her request, where she found out for the first time that a criminal investigation had been opened into the attack at KatyrYurt.', '32. On 18 December 2006 the applicant wrote a letter to the military prosecutor of the UGA and informed him about the deaths of her five relatives and the injuries she suffered on 4 February 2000 in Katyr-Yurt. She attached five death certificates and her discharge papers from the Nazran hospital dated 4 March 2000.', '33. On 19 March 2007 the applicant was questioned and granted the status of victim in criminal case no. 34/00/0026-05. At that time the applicant was a minor but the questioning took place in the absence of legal guardian or representative. According to the parties, there is no information indicating the establishment of guardianship over the applicant up to the age of majority.', '34. She was not informed of the decision to close proceedings of 14 June 2007 (see paragraphs 26–28 above). The Government submitted in their observations that this had been an omission on the part of the investigator which had been due to the large number of victims in the case.', '35. As is apparent from subsequent documents submitted by the applicant, the investigation into the attack upon Katyr-Yurt was reopened in September 2012. The investigators commissioned an additional expert report into the lawfulness and reasonableness of the military intervention. Neither party submitted to the Court the decision to commission the expert report, the questions put to the experts, or a copy of the report itself, nor is it clear which documents were made available to the experts. The applicant’s knowledge of and involvement in this procedural step has not been clarified. It appears that the document, as most other documents in the file, has been classified. A summary thereof and summaries of other documents are contained in a twenty-page-long extract from the decision to close the criminal investigation issued by a senior investigator of the Military Investigations Unit of the Investigative Committee in the Southern Federal Circuit on 9 March 2013 (extract dated 16 March 2013).', '36. The aforementioned extract opensat that time. According to the text, on the night of 3 to 4 February 2000 a group of between three and four thousand fighters under the command of field commander Gelayev had entered Katyr-Yurt (also spelled Katar-Yurt). They were armed with automatic firearms, large-calibre machine guns, flame-throwers, portable anti-aircraft launchers and armoured vehicles. On 4 February 2000 the head of the operations centre (OC) of the Western Zone Alignment in Chechnya gave orders to block the village to carry out a special operation. By that time, most inhabitants had left the village and others were hiding in their houses. The decision to evacuate the civilians was taken between 7 and 11 a.m. on 4 February. The population had been informed of this possibility through the head of the administration and by means of a loudspeaker device mounted on a helicopter. Following skirmishes on the outskirts of Katyr-Yurt and casualties suffered by the security forces, at 9 a.m. artillery started to carry out pin-point strikes aimed at clusters of fighters in the centre and on the periphery of the village. After sustaining casualties, a reconnaissance group retreated from Katyr-Yurt on the morning on 4 February, following which attack aircraft were called in. Due to the fierce fighting and the artillery and air strikes upon the clusters of fighters, the residents started to leave, and by midday on 4 February “their outflow had become significant”. The extract stated that the special operation had continued for two days, although the strikes continued until 7 February. On the third night [presumably the night of 6 to 7 February] a significant proportion of the fighters, numbering about 800 in all, had left the village under cover of poor visibility and escaped into the mountains; 386 had been killed during the operation. The commanders of the special operation had taken measures to arrange the evacuation of civilians but their plans had been upset by the fighters, especially in the initial stages of the operation. Many residents trying to leave the village had been caught in the crossfire between the fighters and the security forces. Most residents had been killed or injured in the initial stages of the operation, in the central part of the village where the most intense fighting had taken place. No conclusive figure of injured or dead civilians, fighters or security forces was given in the extract.', '37. The extract then states that the latest decision to terminate proceedings had occurred on 28 September 2012. That decision was quashed on 9 October 2012 and the investigation was extended until 9 March 2013.', '38. The extract goes on to cite statements from various military and civilian witnesses, without indicating their names or ranks or the dates when these statements were taken (see Isayeva, cited above, §§ 42-92).', '39. The document also refers to an additional operational-tactical expert report (“дополнительная комиссионная оперативно-тактическая судебная экспертиза”) produced on 24 September 2012 by unnamed “external experts from the military faculty of the Southern Federal University” (“внештатные эксперты факультета военного обучения Южного федерального университета”) based in Rostov-on-Don. As summarised in the extract, the experts’ conclusion did not differ from the findings reached by the previous expert reports commissioned by the investigation (see paragraphs 21-27 above). The expert report is cited as follows:', '“In early February 2000 the operational situation in the area of the counter-terrorist operation in Chechnya was extremely tense and difficult. ... After the defeat suffered in the plains of Chechnya and in Grozny, [the illegal insurgents] attempted to move into harsh southern mountainous regions where they would be able to take rest and recover, in order to organise further military action. ... A very difficult situation developed in the area covered by the Western Zone Alignment. Their main task was to prevent the illegal insurgents from breaking through from the mountainous areas of Chechnya to the plains, to identify, disarm and detain members of the illegal armed groups, and to destroy them in the event of armed resistance ...', '... In early February 2000 reconnaissance information was received about the taking of Katyr-Yurt by a large group of fighters. The exact number of fighters was unknown. In order to prevent any further gathering of the fighters, it was decided to surround the village and carry out a special operation there ... A plan for the special operation was worked out. The plan detailed the detachments responsible for blocking and searching, the order of fire contact in the event of armed resistance by the fighters, the location of the command headquarters and control points ... The artillery targets were established in advance along the lines of the fighters’ possible escape routes from Katyr-Yurt and potential arrival of reinforcements, outside of the village. Two control points (roadblocks) were established at the two ends of the village to ensure the exit of civilians – one towards Achkhoy-Martan and the other towards Valerik. The civilians left the village through the two roadblocks, along ‘humanitarian corridors’.', 'The head of Katyr-Yurt was informed of the decision to carry out a special operation. He requested postponement in order to ascertain the situation with his own resources and to drive the fighters out of the village. The special operation was postponed for one day. However, the following morning the fighters attacked OMON [special police forces] based in Katyr-Yurt and attempted to break through the lines of the security forces. The security forces sustained casualties. As became apparent during the clashes, the fighters were armed not only with firearms, but also with grenades and fire-launchers, large calibre machine guns, mine-launchers and anti-tank rocket launchers. The fighters were well prepared and were able to use artificial and natural hiding places in order to deliver combat in a populated area. The number of fighters greatly exceeded the security forces (by 4-6 times).”', '40. The decision goes on to cite the report’s conclusion that the use of fighter jets, artillery and mine-launchers upon fortified positions had been justified and that the refusal to employ them would have resulted in heavy losses among the security forces and failure to achieve the goals as set. Over a period of three days most fighters present in the village were killed (one military unit had reported 386 killed fighters).', '41. The report cited military field manuals and concluded that the actions of the commanders had been in full compliance with those acts. The commanders had organised and planned the enforcement of the objectives set. The pin-point air strikes upon previously agreed targets, the direct strikes by artillery and anti-tank rocket launchers, and the tank and anti-tank guns had been directed by forward air controllers and artillery pointers upon clearly established and observed targets.', '42. Page 12 of the extract contains the following citation from the decision: “the evidential material in the criminal investigation file ... shows that over 1,000 fighters who entered Katyr-Yurt were armed with automatic firearms, large-calibre machine-guns, grenade-launchers and armoured vehicles; fortified firing points had been established in the captured houses. [In such circumstances] the use of artillery and airborne weapons between 4 and 7 February 2000 was justified ...”', '43. As cited in the extract, the experts focused on the use of artillery and aircraft. From the operative military documents referring to the use of artillery it was impossible to discern where and when exactly, and at what targets the artillery had been employed, since all the documents reviewed by the experts were judged by them as either irrelevant to the operation in question or not containing any relevant information. As to the aircraft, they had used aviation bombs and unguided and guided missiles of undisclosed types. The number of aircraft involved and the number and timing of the mission sorties, as well as the number of missiles and bombs used, was not specified. As cited, the report established that during the mission sorties the pilots had received information from the forward controllers, because the missions were taking place in the vicinity of, or within, the populated area. The target selection was done using smoke pods or by reference to clearly identifiable topographical “highpoints”. There was no evidence of provocations by fighters or mistakes in selecting targets. The document went on to state that the identification of targets had occurred on the basis of information received prior to departure, from the forward air controllers during the flight, and from the observed activity. Since their use by illegal insurgents could not be verified, attacks on vehicles were ruled out unless very precise and distinguishable directions had been received from the ground. The aircraft attacked from a height of about two kilometres and from a distance of about two kilometres; from that distance details such as clothing and the presence of firearms could not be distinguished. For that reason, contact with the air controllers was necessary before and after hitting the selected target.', '44. In the cited extract, the experts concluded that “such engagement of artillery and aviation munitions practically ruled out the likelihood of casualties to civilians, except those who were with the fighters in houses occupied by the latter”.', '45. They further concluded that the “employment of a minimal amount of artillery, the choice of the most accurate target direction possible, and the use of the minimum amount of shells necessary ... guaranteed safety from injuries by splinters both for the civilians and security forces. ... Having examined the criminal investigation file, the experts concluded that the OC of the Western Zone Alignment and the head of the special operation in Katyr-Yurt had taken all possible measures in order to prevent losses among civilians while planning and carrying out the operation”.', '46. Turning to the situation of the civilians, the experts judged that they had been able to leave the village along “humanitarian corridors” through two roadblocks. The information about the corridors had been communicated by means of a helicopter and an armoured personnel carrier (APC). The head of the administration had been properly informed of the beginning of the special operation and, at his request, its start had been postponed for a day. The civilians had been informed of the need to evacuate and two roadblocks had ensured safe and unhindered passage. The civilians had been accorded the time necessary for the evacuation and the transport carrying the civilians was able to travel back and forth through the roadblocks.', '47. While the report, as cited in the extract, conceded that an unspecified number of civilians had been killed during the operation through the use of weapons under the control of the operation’s commanders, such measures had been in compliance with the appropriate order of decision-taking in the choice of targets and means employed during the special operation.', '48. On the basis of this report, the investigator concluded that the measures resulting in civilian casualties had been absolutely necessary within the meaning of Article 39, part 1 of the Criminal Code (as in the previous decisions of 13 March 2002 and 14 June 2007 – see Abuyeva and Others, cited above, § 159).', '49. The extract ended by listing the names of the 47 individuals who had been killed, but Mr Z. M. Isayev (a son of the applicant in the Isayeva case, cited above) was listed twice. It did not contain the names of the applicant’s five family members, nor of her cousin Khava Abakarova (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above). Nor did it contain the names of five relatives of applicants 2 and 24 in the Abuyeva and Others case (see Abuyeva and Others, cited above, § 156). The non-exhaustive list of the wounded included the applicant; however no separate list of victims has been drawn up; nor does it appear that a copy of that decision was sent to them.', '50. On 26 September 2013 a lawyer representing Mrs Marusa Abuyeva, another victim in criminal investigation no. 14/90/0092-11, appealed to the Grozny Garrison Military Court against the decision of 9 March 2013 to close the criminal investigation and to terminate Mrs Abuyeva’s victim status in the proceedings. The statement of appeal was based on the following grounds: the decision had not been based on the established facts, no proper collection and examination of evidence had taken place and legal classification of the events had been incorrect.', '51. Firstly, it was argued that the investigation had failed to establish the following pertinent facts: the number of illegal fighters in Katyr-Yurt; the timing and conditions of the transmission of information about the operation and evacuation of civilians; the purpose of the roadblocks at the two extremities of the village; and the details of the aircraft bombings. As to the number of fighters, the statement of appeal referred to various figures cited in the extract and emphasised the fact that the source of this information had not been identified. Likewise, there was a lack of clarity as to the number of fighters killed, nor were there any indications as to any names, identification procedures etc. The appeal statement also pointed out that the number of the security force personnel involved had not been given; it was therefore difficult to evaluate the numerical superiority of the fighters and the need to employ massive weapons. Furthermore, the victim challenged the statement that the administration and population of Katyr-Yurt had been informed about the operation in advance, pointing to the absence of any clear evidence in the case-file to that effect. Turning to the roadblocks set up by the security forces, the appeal statement pointed out that there were no grounds for concluding that this measure had facilitated the exit of civilians from Katyr-Yurt and reiterated the findings made in this respect by the Court in the judgments in the Isayeva and Abuyeva and Others cases (both cited above, §§ 194 and 199, accordingly). As to the details of aircraft bombing, it was argued that the investigators had accepted two mutually incompatible versions and no steps had been taken in order to clarify whether the pilots, or the aviation controllers who had coordinated the fire, had been able to observe and distinguish legitimate targets (members of illegal armed groups) from civilians. It was also pointed out that the employment of unguided missiles and free-falling general purpose bombs in any event ruled out the possibility of limiting the impact to the selected targets.', '52. As regards the incompleteness of the investigation, it was stressed that the investigators had failed to collect the information necessary to evaluate the threat to the civilian population and the appropriateness of the use of selected weapons and ammunition, and to compile an exhaustive list of victims and damage caused. On the last point, it was emphasised that no list of those who had been killed, both civilians and fighters, had ever been compiled and that the information in this regard remained incomplete.', '53. Finally, it was argued that the legal classification of the commanders’ actions had been incorrect and that the application of Article 39 part 2 of the Criminal Code had been unjustified without the prior', '54. On 6 December 2013 the Grozny Military Garrison Court examined and dismissed the appeal. The court referred to the conclusions of the expert report of 24 September 2012, according to which the actions of the operational commanders had been in accordance with the relevant field manuals and other instructions and were justified in view of the numerical superiority of the fighters. The court also found that the evidence collected by the investigation justified the conclusions reached as regards each of the points raised by the appeal. As to execution of the Isayeva and Abuyeva and Others judgments, the court stressed that in accordance with Article 46 of the Convention, and in line with the Resolution of the Plenary of the Supreme Court No. 21 of 27 June 2013, the investigation had been reopened in 2012 and a number of relevant steps had been taken. In particular, a new expert report had been commissioned and carried out. The Court’s position on the ineffectiveness of the previous investigation had therefore been taken into account and the failings had been rectified.', '55. The victim appealed. In her appeal of 23 December 2013 it was stressed that the breach of procedural obligations under Article 2 in this case had taken on a lasting character. Pointing to the relevant passages in the Isayeva and Abuyeva and Others judgments, both cited above, the appeal argued that the following fundamental defects of the investigation, as identified by the Court, had not been corrected in the new round of proceedings: there had been no independent evaluation of the proportionality and necessity of the lethal force used; no individual liability had been established for the aspects of the operation which had led to civilian losses, and these aspects had not been studied and evaluated by an independent body, preferably a judicial one. It was reiterated that the expert report of September 2012, as cited in the decision of 9 March 2013, had simply repeated the findings of two previous expert reports which had already been examined by the Court. Like the previous two, it had not been based on the pertinent facts of the case. Finally, the important question of the total number of victims had still not been resolved, as demonstrated by the failure to include some of the victims’ deceased relatives in the total.', '56. On 6 March 2014 the Rostov Circuit Military Court examined the appeal. During the hearing, the victim’s representative submitted a number of additional points. He concentrated on the relevant precepts of international humanitarian law and the practice of international criminal tribunals which, he argued, should have guided the investigator in his examination of the case. In his view, the decision of 9 March 2013 had failed to take into account the relevant interpretation of these provisions in so far as it concerned the definition of victims as civilians, and the widespread, systematic, indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks on them.', '57. The Circuit Military Court dismissed the appeals. It found that the Garrison Court had examined all the relevant evidence and had applied a comprehensive and consistent interpretation thereto. At this stage, the judge was unable to analyse the substance of the question of guilt or innocence, or to evaluate the correctness or sufficiency of the evidence collected. The Circuit Court stressed that the victim’s arguments regarding both the incompleteness of the investigation and the failure to take into account the European Court’s binding judgments had been thoroughly examined and dismissed.', '58. As is apparent from subsequent documents, the victim’s Supreme Court cassation appeal was unsuccessful. On 25 September 2014 a judge of the Supreme Court refused to accept the request for review, in view of the detailed and well-reasoned decisions of the military courts. The victim’s argument that the legal position of the Court in the new round of proceedings had not been taken into account was judged to be unfounded.']","['13', '2']",['2-1'],[],[],[],[]

SWEDEN,3,No violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Expulsion) (Conditional) (Kyrgyzstan),Aleš Pejchal;André Potocki;Angelika Nußberger;Ganna Yudkivska;Helena Jäderblom;Mark Villiger;Vincent A. De Gaetano,"['6. The applicant was born in 1985 and is currently in Sweden.', '7. In December 2009 the applicant arrived in Sweden and applied for asylum and a residence permit. Before the Migration Board (Migrationsverket), he submitted essentially the following. He is an ethnic Uyghur from Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. He had run a business in his home country and had bought goods from his business partner, also an ethnic Uyghur, in China. In August 2009 the business partner had been arrested and since he had been in the possession of a receipt from the applicant, they had both been indicted on suspicion of financially supporting the Uyghur disturbances in China. In September 2009 the applicant had been arrested by the Kyrgyz police. His health had deteriorated while he was in custody and, after his release, he had been hospitalised because of his kidney problems. The doctors had informed him that he needed to have blood dialysis but that there was a two-year waiting list. After having been pressured by the authorities, the doctors had informed the applicant that he would not receive any blood dialysis. Moreover, his family had informed him that the police had come to his house looking for him several times after he had left the country. He suffered from chronic kidney failure and was in need of dialysis three times per week.', '8. The Board held a supplementary interview with the applicant in June 2010 where he claimed that, during his detention, the Kyrgyz police had taken his passport, forced him to sign a travel ban and had also ill-treated him. He had been summoned to appear in court a few times and, after the second summons, he had left the country. He had received written summonses but he had not brought them with him to Sweden and he could not contact his family since he feared their telephone was tapped. The applicant further believed that the Chinese authorities had contacted the Kyrgyz authorities and that for this reason he had been refused medical treatment. However, he also claimed that he had been refused treatment already in the spring of 2009, before being called by the police.', '9. On 17 June 2010, the Migration Board rejected the application. It first noted that the applicant had failed to submit any written evidence in support of his claims. It further found it noteworthy that central parts of the applicant’s story had only been provided at the supplementary interview and not at the initial interview or in written submissions. It therefore considered that he had escalated the threat against him during the asylum proceedings. The Board further noted that the applicant had submitted contradictory information as to when he had been denied health care. First he had stated that he had been refused dialysis after his detention in the autumn of 2009 while, during the supplementary interview, he had stated that he had been refused treatment already in the spring of 2009. In any event, the Board observed that there had been a regime change in Kyrgyzstan since the applicant had left the country and that there was nothing to indicate that the present regime would have any specific interest in him. Thus, the Board concluded that the applicant was not in need of international protection.', '10. As concerned the applicant’s health, the Board noted that the applicant had submitted a medical certificate according to which he suffered from chronic kidney failure secondary to chronic glomerulonephritis and received blood dialysis three times per week. Without the dialysis he would die within two to three weeks. The Board found that, according to the applicant’s own submissions, blood dialysis was available in Kyrgyzstan and, since he had not been found credible, he had also failed to substantiate that he would be denied proper treatment upon return. Consequently, he could not be granted a residence permit and was to be expelled from Sweden.', '11. The applicant appealed to the Migration Court (Migrationsdomstolen), maintaining his claims and adding that he had not given contradictory information about the refusal to treat him in Kyrgyzstan. He had been diagnosed during the spring of 2009 and then been informed about the two to three years’ waiting time. However, it was only after his arrest in September 2009 that the doctors told him that he would not receive any dialysis treatment at all. As concerned the regime change, there was no indication that the situation had improved for the Uyghur people. He further submitted new medical certificates confirming his illness and need for treatment.', '12. The Migration Court decided to hold an oral hearing during which the applicant added, inter alia, the following. He had been questioned by the police twice. The first time, in September 2009, the police had asked him whether he financially supported the Uyghur disturbances in China and they had beaten him all over his body, including on the kidneys. When he had lost consciousness, the police had become scared and had released him. During the second questioning, the police had confiscated his passport and imposed a travel ban on him. He had later been summoned to court but had not attended. Instead, he had decided to leave the country and had paid a smuggler to help him. After arriving in Sweden, he had been in contact via telephone and internet with friends and family in Kyrgyzstan, who had informed him that the Kyrgyz authorities had been to his house looking for him and that he had received further summonses. In relation to his illness, he claimed that the Chinese would keep searching for him and that he would therefore not receive any treatment in his home country. He also submitted an extract from his Kyrgyz medical record which he had received when he was released from hospital in November 2009 and which he had brought with him to Sweden.', '13. On 13 July 2011, the Migration Court rejected the appeal. It noted that the applicant had failed to substantiate his identity but accepted that he came from Kyrgyzstan. It further observed that he had not submitted any written evidence in support of his alleged need for protection for which reason his credibility was decisive for the outcome. However, the court considered that the applicant’s submissions were far-fetched, lacking in detail and that they contained contradictory information. For instance, as concerned the applicant’s submissions that the Chinese authorities suspected him of sponsoring the Uyghur disturbances in China, the court found this improbable since the applicant had had a clear business relationship with the person in China over several years. Moreover, he had submitted contradictory information as to when he had been refused medical treatment and how many times he had been summoned to court. Therefore, the court concluded that the applicant’s submissions were not credible and that he had failed to substantiate that he would be at risk of persecution upon return.', '14. As to the applicant’s health, the court noted that it was undisputed that he suffered from chronic kidney failure and that he was in need of regular blood dialysis and medication to survive. Without the dialysis, he would die within a couple of weeks and, apart from regular treatment, the only other solution was a kidney transplant. His state of health was consequently extremely serious. Moreover, the court observed that it was clear that blood dialysis was available in Kyrgyzstan while, according to the applicant, kidney transplants were not carried out. According to the applicant’s own submissions, in the spring of 2009 he had been placed on a waiting list for dialysis and the waiting time had been two to three years. After having been arrested in September 2009, his name had allegedly been removed from the waiting list and he had been refused treatment. However, the court noted that, according to the extract from the applicant’s medical records, he had been hospitalised in Kyrgyzstan because of his kidney disease in April 2009 and again from 27 October to 5 November 2009, on the second occasion with the diagnosis of chronic terminal kidney failure. Since, according to the most recent Swedish medical certificate, a person with such a diagnosis would die within a couple of weeks without blood dialysis, the court concluded that the applicant had received medical care both before and after being arrested by the police. He had thus failed to substantiate that he would not receive adequate treatment within a reasonable time upon return to Kyrgyzstan.', '15. Upon further appeal by the applicant, the Migration Court of Appeal (Migrationsöverdomstolen) refused leave to appeal on 24 November 2011. Hence, the expulsion order became enforceable.', '16. On 23 December 2011 the applicant lodged his application with the Court and requested it to apply Rule 39 of the Rules of Court. On 18 January 2012, the acting President of the Section to which the case had been allocated acceded to the applicant’s request and indicated to the Government that the applicant should not be expelled to Kyrgyzstan for the duration of the proceedings before the Court. On the same date, the application was communicated to the Government.', '17. In view of the Court’s indication to the Government, the Migration Court decided, on 19 January 2012, to stay the enforcement of the expulsion order against the applicant until further notice.', '18. In the meantime, on 2 January 2012 the applicant requested the Migration Board to stay the enforcement of the expulsion order as there were impediments to it due his deteriorated health and to grant him a residence permit. He submitted a medical certificate, dated 29 December 2011, by a Chief Physician at the Kidney Medical Clinic of Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm. It stated that the applicant had had a crisis reaction to the expulsion order against him and had not attended two dialysis sessions. As a result, his health had significantly deteriorated and he had been given emergency dialysis and had also met with a psychiatrist. He had been kept in hospital due to his poor mental and physical health. It would be completely unreasonable to expel him without ensuring that dialysis would be available to him upon return to his home country.', '19. On 23 January 2012 the Migration Board rejected the request. It considered that the applicant had invoked no new circumstances concerning his health which could alter the assessment made by the Migration Court in the initial proceedings or which amounted to an impediment to the enforcement of the expulsion order.', '20. In September 2012 the applicant again requested the Migration Board to stay the enforcement of the expulsion order and to grant him a residence permit in Sweden since the impediment to the enforcement was permanent. He had been in contact with his family in Kyrgyzstan and, through them, obtained a certificate from the Kyrgyz Ministry of Health, dated 9 July 2012, which confirmed that the applicant had been on the national waiting list for blood dialysis since 27 October 2009. It further stated that due to the lack of dialysis equipment and the increasing number of patients in need of treatment, there was currently no possibility to offer the applicant dialysis within the public health care system in the country. The applicant had also received from his family a certificate, dated 23 December 2011, and issued by the hospital where he had previously been treated, the National Centre for Cardiology and Treatment. It stated that the applicant had been treated at the Centre’s unit for nephrology for glomerulonephritis and final stages of chronical kidney failure. It further stated that due to the lack of equipment he could not go through the programme for dialysis. He had, however, been put on the national waiting list.', '21. On 20 November 2012 the Migration Board rejected the request as it found that the new certificates did not alter the assessment made in the initial proceedings and that, consequently, there were no grounds on which to grant the applicant a residence permit.', '22. In February 2014 the applicant’s father wrote to the Kyrgyz Ministry of Health requesting that the applicant be given treatment in Kyrgyzstan for his illness. He noted in the letter that he had had to send the applicant to Sweden to save his life but that they wanted him to be treated in Kyrgyzstan.', '23. A week later, on 17 February 2014, the Ministry replied to the applicant’s father. However, the reply, which contains no specific addressee, would appear to be rather a request to the Swedish health care system to provide the applicant with proper treatment as it states that, due to the long waiting time and lack of dialysis equipment, it is not possible for them to treat the applicant in Kyrgyzstan and they are grateful for the invaluable contribution to the health care of a citizen of Kyrgyzstan.']",[],[],[],['3'],[],[]

On 27 August 2002 the applicant brought civil proceedings against the Administration of the Mirninskiy Ulus of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic (“the Administration”), a private person S., her husband B., and a private company A. claiming a title to a flat, damages, and S.’s eviction from the flat.', '6. On 18 September 2002 the Mirninskiy District Court of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic (“the District Court”) refused to consider his action, because there already had been a decision of 6 February 2001 taken by the District Court concerning the same dispute.', '7. On 13 November 2002 the Supreme Court of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic overruled the refusal and remitted the case for a new examination, as the action included a new co-defendant, and, therefore, it could not be said that the dispute was among the same parties.', '8.

On 29 August 2003 the District Court examined the case, ordered the Administration to pay the applicant 800,000 Russian roubles (RUB) in respect of the flat’s market value and dismissed the remainder of the claims.

The Presidium found that the courts had incorrectly applied the material law to various aspects of the case, and had failed to join the appropriate financial body as co-defendant.', '20.

The applicant was born in 1969 and lives in Samobor.', '7. The applicant owned a flat in Zagreb situated on the third floor of a residential building, where he lived with his wife and two children.', '8. In 2003, three years after he had bought the flat, the applicant’s wife gave birth to their third child. The child was born with multiple physical and mental disabilities.', '9. After the birth the child underwent a number of medical treatments and his condition was under the constant supervision of the competent social care services. In April 2008 an expert commission diagnosed him with incurable cerebral palsy, grave mental retardation and epilepsy. In September 2008 the social services declared the child 100% disabled.', '10. In the meantime, in September 2006, the applicant bought a house in Samobor, and in October 2008 he sold his flat. According to the applicant, the reason for buying a house was the fact that the building in which his flat was situated had no lift and for that reason did not meet the needs of his disabled child and his family. In particular, it was very difficult to take his son out of the flat to see a doctor, or to take him for physiotherapy and to kindergarten or school, and to meet his other social needs.', '11. On 19 October 2006, after he had bought the house in Samobor, the applicant submitted a tax exemption request to the tax authorities. He relied on section 11(9) of the Real Property Transfer Tax Act, which provided for the possibility of tax exemption for a person who was buying a flat or a house in order to solve his or her housing needs, if he or she, or his or her family members, did not have another flat or house meeting their housing needs (see paragraph 24 below). In his request the applicant argued that the flat which he owned did not meet the housing needs of his family since it was very difficult, and in fact becoming impossible, to take his disabled child out of the flat from the third floor without a lift, given that he was in a wheelchair. The applicant therefore submitted that he had bought the house in order to cater for his son’s needs.', '12. On 6 May 2009 the Samobor Tax Office (Ministarstvo Financija – Porezna uprava, Područni ured Zagreb, Ispostava Samobor) dismissed the applicant’s request, giving the following reasons:', '“Section 11(9) of the Real Property Transfer Tax Act ... provides for tax exemption for citizens who are buying their first real property in order to meet their housing needs, under conditions which must be cumulatively satisfied, including the requirement that the taxpayer in question, or his or her family members, do not have another flat or a house meeting their housing needs. During the proceedings it was established that the taxpayer Joško Guberina had owned a flat measuring 114,49 square metres, in Zagreb ..., which he had sold on 25 November 2008 to ... Given that the surface of that real property, and in view of the number of the taxpayer’s immediate family members (five), satisfied the housing needs of the taxpayer and his immediate family, within the meaning of section 11(9.3) of the Real Property Transfer Tax Act, and given that it satisfied all housing needs in terms of hygiene and technical requirements as well as the basic infrastructure (electricity, water and [access to] other public utilities), under section 11(9.5) of the Real Property Transfer Tax Act, the taxpayer does not meet the cumulative conditions provided under section 11(9) of the Real Property Transfer Tax Act. It was therefore decided as noted in the operative part [of the decision].”', '13. The Samobor Tax Office ordered the applicant to pay 83,594.25 Croatian kunas (HRK; approximately EUR 11,250) in tax.', '14. The applicant appealed against the above decision to the Finance Ministry (Ministarstvo Financija, Samostalna služba za drugostupanjski upravni postupak; hereafter, “the Ministry”), and on 6 July 2009 the Ministry dismissed his appeal as ill-founded, endorsing the reasoning of the Samobor Tax Office. The relevant part of the decision reads:', '“Section 11(9) of the Real Property Transfer Tax Act (Official Gazette, nos. 69/07-153/02) provides for tax exemption for citizens who are buying their first real property in order to meet their housing needs. It further lays down conditions which the citizen must meet in order to demonstrate that he or she is buying his or her first real property in order to meet his or her housing needs. In this connection, one of the conditions laid down under indent 9.5 is that the citizen and the members of his or her immediate family must not have another real property (flat or house) meeting their housing needs; and indent 9.6 also provides that the citizen and the members of his or her immediate family must not own a flat, a holiday house, or property of a significant value (other property of a significant value can include a piece of land where construction is allowed) or a business premises where the citizen or his or her immediate family members do not exercise a registered [business] activity, whereby the value of the real property is similar to that of the real property (flat or house) which the citizen is purchasing.', 'Given the rationale of the cited provisions and the facts of the case as established beyond doubt during the proceedings, [the Ministry] considers that the first-instance authority was justified in rejecting the appellant’s request for tax exemption ... The right to tax exemption exists if the citizen, or his or her immediate family members, at the time of purchase [of the real property], do not own, or did not own, another real property meeting their housing needs or a flat, a holiday house or other real property of a significant value. As this is not the situation in the present case, given that the appellant, at the time of purchase [of the house], owned a flat in Zagreb ... larger than the real property he was buying and in respect of which he sought tax exemption, it cannot be said that by buying the house the appellant was purchasing his first real property in order to meet his housing needs.”', '15. On 7 September 2009 the applicant lodged an administrative action with the High Administrative Court (Visoki upravni sud Republike Hrvatske), arguing that in their decisions the lower bodies had ignored his specific family situation and, in particular, his child’s disability and therefore the housing needs of his family. In the applicant’s view, it was necessary to recognise that in his particular case the availability of a lift in the building was an infrastructural requirement on the same level as access to water and electricity in general. He also emphasised that the house was the first real property in respect of which he had sought a real property transfer tax exemption.', '16. On 21 March 2012 the High Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s administrative action as ill-founded, endorsing the reasoning of the lower administrative bodies. The relevant part of the judgment reads:', '“Given that the surface area of the flat [which the applicant owned] satisfied the needs of five members of the plaintiff’s family (provision 9.3) and that the flat at issue was equipped with the basic infrastructure and hygiene and technical requirements, the defendant correctly concluded that the plaintiff, in the given case, did not meet the conditions for a tax exemption set out in section 11(9) of the Real Property Transfer Tax Act.', 'The arguments regarding the administrative action are ineffective in changing the decision in this administrative matter, and therefore the court considers that the impugned decision did not breach the law to the plaintiff’s detriment.”', '17. On 25 May 2012 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) relying on Article 14 of the Constitution, contending, inter alia, that, given the specific accommodation needs of his family due to his child’s disability, he had been discriminated against by unfair application of the relevant tax legislation. He argued, in particular, that the competent administrative authorities had failed to correct the factual inequality inherent in his particular situation with regard to the ordinary meaning of the term basic infrastructural requirements meeting the housing needs of his family.', '18. On 26 September 2012 the Constitutional Court, endorsing the reasoning of the lower bodies, dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint as ill-founded on the grounds that there was no violation of his constitutional rights. In particular, having examined his complaints from the angle of the right to a fair trial, the Constitutional Court held that no issue arose with regard to the other complaints relied upon by the applicant.', '19. The decision of the Constitutional Court was served on the applicant’s representative on 11 October 2012.', '20. The Government provided a report by the Ministry of Social Policy and Youth (Ministarstvo socijalne politike i mladih) of 6 November 2013, according to which the applicant’s child had been in receipt of monthly monetary allowances of HRK 1,000 (approximately EUR 130) in the period between 19 January 2006 and 10 September 2012, and allowances of HRK 625 (approximately EUR 80) from 11 September 2012 onwards. In addition, he had been involved in various therapeutic and social assistance activities, and for the period between 29 June 2010 and 2 October 2011 the applicant’s wife had been granted special status related to her child’s disability and had received inter alia, monthly payments of HRK 2,500 (approximately EUR 300).', '21. According to the applicant, the annual expenses relating to his son’s special needs amounted to some HRK 80,000 (approximately EUR 10,400). This included HRK 28,800 for physiotherapy, HRK 4,500 for speech therapy, HRK 900 for a child neurologist, HRK 7,200 for drugs, HRK 21,175 for a wheelchair (with additional State support of HRK 8,900); HRK 7,200 for swimming therapy; and HRK 9,150 for daily transport to the day-care centre for ten months.']","['14', 'P1']",['P1-1'],[],[],[],[]
001-164227,ENG,HRV,ADMISSIBILITY,2016,KRPIĆ v. CROATIA,4,Inadmissible,Jon Fridrik Kjølbro;Julia Laffranque;Paul Lemmens;Georges Ravarani;Ksenija Turković,"['1. The applicant, Mr Antun Krpić, is a Croatian national, who was born in 1958 and lives in Zagreb. He was represented before the Court by Mr Z. Zaninović, an advocate practising in Zagreb.', '2. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Š. Stažnik.', '3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '4. The applicant held a specially protected tenancy (stanarsko pravo) of a flat in Zagreb measuring 16.25 square metres. The flat was located in a socially-owned building in the centre of Zagreb built in 1776.', '5. By a decision of 16 January 1990 the local authorities decided to demolish the building because it was so dilapidated that it risked collapsing at any time and thus posed a risk to life and property. The decision specified that the building would be demolished once all the tenants (five at the time, including the applicant) had vacated it, after being provided with replacement flats pursuant to the law, in particular section 107(2) of the Housing Act (see paragraph 24 below).', '6. On the basis of that decision two of the tenants living in the building were subsequently allocated replacement flats.', '7. On 19 June 1991 the Specially Protected Tenancies (Sale to Occupier) Act entered into force (see paragraph 25 below). It entitled holders of specially protected tenancies to purchase the flats in respect of which they held such a tenancy under favourable conditions. In that way, a large majority of specially protected tenancies became a right of ownership for those tenants.', '8. On 11 January 1993 an explosive device was detonated in front of one of the flats in the building, which caused further damage.', '9. On 14 January 1993 the applicant and another tenant who were still living in the building, wrote to the local authorities housing department asking it to allocate them urgently replacement flats, as after the explosion the building was no longer suitable for habitation.', '10. On 25 January 1993 the local authorities held an on-site inspection and established that due to the damage caused by the explosion, the building was indeed no longer habitable and that the two remaining tenants (of which one was the applicant) had moved in with their friends.', '11. On 26 January 1993 the applicant was offered a replacement flat in Zagreb measuring 17.10 square metres. He refused the flat, stating that it “was damp and had rotten floors” and was therefore uninhabitable.', '12. On 8 April 1994 the applicant, relying on section 107 of the Housing Act (see paragraph 24 below), brought a civil action against the local authorities, in particular the City of Zagreb, before the Zagreb Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Zagrebu), seeking to be provided with a replacement flat. More specifically, he asked to be awarded a specially protected tenancy of such a flat.', '13. At the hearing held on 3 July 1996 the applicant stated, inter alia, that the building in which his old flat was located had been demolished.', '14. On 5 November 1996 the Lease of Flats Act entered into force (see paragraph 27 below). It repealed the Housing Act, abolished the legal concept of the specially protected tenancy and provided that the remaining holders of such tenancies were to become “protected lessees” (zaštićeni najmoprimci, see paragraphs 29 and 32 below). Under the Act such lessees are subject to a number of protective measures, such as the duty of landlords to conclude a lease of indefinite duration; payment of protected rent (zaštićena najamnina), the amount of which is set by the Government and is significantly lower than the market rent; and better protection against termination of the lease (see paragraph 28 below).', '15. Accordingly, in his written submissions of 4 March 1997 the applicant amended his action and sought to be awarded a replacement flat under the protected lease scheme, with an option to purchase it under the conditions set forth in the Specially Protected Tenancies (Sale to Occupier) Act (see paragraph 25 below).', '16. On 1 April 1998 the applicant deregistered his domicile at the address at which his old flat was located and registered it at the address where his stepson was living.', '17. By a judgment of 26 September 2006 the Municipal Court dismissed the applicant’s action. The court established, on the basis of a witness testimony, that the replacement flat the applicant had been offered but had refused (see paragraph 11 above) had indeed been unsuitable for habitation because it was shabby and had flooded floors and damp walls. It held, however, that while the local authorities had indeed been bound under section 107 of the Housing Act (see paragraph 24 below) to provide the applicant with a replacement flat, that obligation had been extinguished with the entry into force of the Lease of Flats Act, which had repealed the Housing Act and abolished the specially protected tenancy as such.', '18. On 27 April 2010 the Zagreb County Court (Županijski sud u Zagrebu) dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant and upheld the first-instance judgment by endorsing the reasons given therein. The first-instance judgment thereby became final.', '19. The applicant then, on 24 June 2010, lodged an appeal on points of law (revizija) against the second-instance judgment. Aware that the value of the subject matter of the dispute, amounting to 21,000 Croatian kunas (HRK), which he had set when bringing his action did not reach the statutory threshold (HRK 100,000) for lodging an ordinary appeal on points of law, the applicant lodged a so-called extraordinary appeal on points of law under section 382(2) of the Civil Procedure Act (see paragraph 23 below), stating that the main issue in his case was important for the uniform application of the law.', '20. By a decision of June 2011 the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) declared inadmissible the applicant’s appeal on points of law. It found that the applicant had not complied with the formal requirements for lodging an extraordinary appeal on points of law, as stipulated in section 382(3) of the Civil Procedure Act (see paragraph 23 below), because he had not specified the legal issue for which he had lodged the appeal or explained why it was important for the uniform application of the law.', '21. On 26 July 2011 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the Supreme Court’s decision, alleging violations of his constitutional rights to equality before the law, equality before the courts, fair procedure and the right of ownership.', '22. By a decision of 7 May 2012 the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) declared inadmissible the applicant’s constitutional complaint and served that decision on his representative on 25 May 2012. It held, inter alia, that the Supreme Court’s decision was not arbitrary and that it did not raise a constitutional law issue.', '23. The relevant provisions of the Civil Procedure Act (Zakon o parničnom postupku, Official Gazette of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia no. 4/1977 with subsequent amendments, and Official Gazette of the Republic of Croatia no. 53/1991, with subsequent amendments), which has been in force since 1 July 1977, read as follows:', '“(1) Parties may lodge an appeal on points of law (revizija) against a second-instance judgment:', '- if the value of the subject matter of the dispute of the contested part of the judgment exceeds HRK 100,000,', '- [in certain employment disputes],', '- [if the second-instance court assessed the evidence and/or established the facts differently from the first-instance court or held a hearing].', '(2) In cases where parties are not entitled to lodge an appeal on points of law in accordance with paragraph 1 of this section, they may [nevertheless] do so if a decision in the dispute depends on the resolution of a substantive or procedural legal issue [that is] important for ensuring the uniform application of the law and equality of citizens, for example:', '- if the Supreme Court has not yet ruled on that issue ... in respect of which there is divergent case-law of the second-instance courts,', '- if the Supreme Court has not yet ruled on that issue and the second-instance court may develop divergent case-law in respect of it, for example, because of possible different interpretations of certain statutory provisions,', '- if the Supreme Court has already ruled on that issue but the decision of the second-instance court is not in conformity with that ruling,', '- if the Supreme Court has already ruled on that issue and the decision of the second-instance court is in conformity with that ruling but ... the case-law should be revisited in view of changes in the legal system occasioned by new legislation, international treaties or decisions of the Constitutional Court or the European Court of Human Rights.', '(3) In the [extraordinary] appeal on points of law referred to in paragraph 3 of this section, the appellants must specify the legal issue for which they are lodging the appeal and give reasons as to why they find that issue important for ensuring the uniform application of the law and equality of citizens.', '(4) An appeal on points of law must be lodged within thirty days of the service of the second-instance judgment.”', '“A belated, incomplete or inadmissible [in the strict sense] (section 386) appeal on points of law shall be declared inadmissible by a decision of the judge rapporteur of the Supreme Court, unless the first-instance court ... has not already done so.”', '24. The relevant provision of the Housing Act (Zakon o stambenim odnosima, Official Gazette nos. 51/1985, 42/1986, 22/1992 and 70/1993), which was in force between 25 December 1985 and 5 November 1996, read as follows:', '“(1) A specially protected tenancy shall be terminated if, on the basis of a decision issued by the relevant authority or in the proceedings for enforcement of a decision on expropriation, the building or part of the building in which the flat is located has to be demolished.', '(2) If, in the case referred to in paragraph (1) of this section the tenants have to move out, on the basis of a decision [issued] by the housing authority, the municipality or the person to whose benefit the building is being demolished shall provide them with another [replacement] flat which does not significantly reduce the quality of their housing.', '(3) If the relevant authority establishes that a building has to be demolished or reconstructed because it poses a risk to life or property, or for other reasons specified in separate legislation, the specially protected tenancy of flats in such a building shall be terminated and the provider of the flats ... shall provide the tenants with other [replacement] flats which do not significantly reduce the quality of their housing.”', '(4) ...', '(5) ...”', '25. The Specially Protected Tenancies (Sale to Occupier) Act (Zakon o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo, Official Gazette no. 27/91 with subsequent amendments – “the Sale to Occupier Act”), which entered into force on 19 June 1991, entitled holders of specially protected tenancies of flats in social or State ownership to purchase the flats in respect of which they held such tenancy under favourable conditions.', '26. Section 3(1) subparagraph 1 excluded the application of the Act to the sale of flats located in buildings in respect of which proceedings for demolition had been instituted.', '27. The Lease of Flats Act (Zakon o najmu stanova, Official Gazette no. 91/1996 of 28 October 1996), which entered into force on 5 November 1996, regulates the legal relationship between landlords and lessees with regard to the lease of flats.', '28. Transitional provisions (sections 30-49) of the Lease of Flats Act establish a special category of lessees (“protected lessees” – zaštićeni najmoprimci), namely, those who previously held specially protected tenancies in respect of privately owned flats or those who did not purchase their flats under the Specially Protected Tenancies (Sale to Occupier) Act. Such lessees are subject to a number of protective measures, such as the obligation of landlords to conclude a lease of indefinite duration; payment of protected rent (zaštićena najamnina), the amount of which is set by the Government; and a limited list of grounds for termination of the lease.', '29. Section 30 of the Act provided for the abolition of the remaining specially protected tenancies and holders of such tenancies became “protected lessees” once the Act entered into force.', '30. Section 51 provided, inter alia, that within six months of the Act’s entry into force the local authorities had to adopt criteria for renting out flats in their ownership.', '31. Section 52(1) provides that proceedings instituted under the Housing Act must be concluded under the provisions of that Act.', '32. Section 53 provided that on the date of the Act’s entry into force, the Housing Act was repealed.', '33. In its decision no. U-III-1925/2005 of 19 December 2007 the Constitutional Court held that after the repeal of the Housing Act, the right of a holder of a specially protected tenancy to be provided with a replacement flat under section 107 of the Act (see paragraph 24 above) had been transformed into the right to be provided with such a flat with an option to purchase it under favourable conditions, as provided for in the Sale to Occupier Act (see paragraph 25 above).', '34. In that case the complainant’s flat, in respect of which she held a specially protected tenancy, was located in a building that had to be demolished. The local authorities eventually allocated a replacement flat to the complainant in 1998, that is, after the repeal of the Housing Act. She therefore could not acquire a specially protected tenancy of the replacement flat (see paragraph 29 above).', '35. The complainant sued the local authorities before the ordinary courts, seeking to purchase the replacement flat under favourable conditions, a right granted to holders of specially protected tenancies under the Sale to Occupier Act. The ordinary court held that the complainant’s specially protected tenancy of her old flat had been extinguished in 1990 when the local authorities had decided to demolish the building in which the flat was located. Furthermore, the complainant did not have a specially protected tenancy of the replacement flat for the reason stated (see the preceding paragraph). Consequently, she had no right to purchase that flat, as under the Sale to Occupier Act such a right was granted only to holders of specially protected tenancies.', '36. The Constitutional Court allowed the constitutional complaint, found a violation of the complainant’s constitutional right to equality before the law and quashed the judgments of the ordinary courts. It held as follows:', '“[From the complainant’s submissions] it is evident that her constitutional complaint is essentially based on the view that, despite the fact that her specially protected tenancy had undoubtedly been extinguished by the operation of the law, there is a need for more extensive interpretation of the relevant legislation, in which case her right to purchase a flat would continue to exist. The applicant considers that she was prevented from exercising her right to purchase a flat only because the time-limits for submitting a request to that effect had expired, which was not due to her fault, but the fault of [the local authorities] which had offered her appropriate replacement flat ‘too late’.', 'The contested decisions [of the ordinary courts] are based exclusively on the fact that the complainant’s specially protected tenancy had been extinguished in 1990 on the basis of section 107 of the Housing Act ...', 'Bearing in mind that the Sale to Occupier Act recognises the right to purchase flats only in respect of tenants, and that after the entry into force of the Lease of Flats Act a specially protected tenancy could no longer be acquired, the [ordinary] courts took the view that, because she had lost the status of a holder of a specially protected tenancy, the complainant did not have the right to purchase the flat, and [thus] dismissed her action.', '...', 'The purpose of the Sale to Occupier Act was, regarding specially protected tenancies of socially-owned flats, to precisely define owners of socially-owned property, and that the owners would primarily be the persons who legally occupied such flats thus far. The said Act was amended on several occasions in ways that clearly indicate that its purpose was, taking into account the objective social circumstances and the legal and factual difficulties, to facilitate the exercise of the right [to purchase the flat] for those who under that Act were entitled to do so. The loss of rights of citizens because of the expiry of time-limits, prescription or similar reasons was not the aim of the Act, as this would have been contrary to its purpose.', 'Therefore, the court, in principle, finds well-founded the arguments raised in the constitutional complaint ... concerning the need for an extensive interpretation of the relevant legal norms, when this is in accordance with the Constitution.', '...', '[T]his means that the complainant had lost her specially protected tenancy of the old flat but that, under the assumption that she was allocated another appropriate flat while the Housing Act was still in force, she would have reacquired the rights and obligations of a holder of a specially protected tenancy on the basis of the mere fact that she had previously held such a tenancy. It is evident that in the period between the termination of one and the acquisition of another specially protected tenancy there can be no ‘legal vacuum’. On the contrary, during this period the rights inherent to a specially protected tenancy exist as ‘pending’ rights. It is beyond doubt that citizens who were at the same time in the same legal situation as the complainant, save for the fact that in their cases the proceedings for allocating replacement flats were shorter, had acquired specially protected tenancies and, as holders of such tenancies, had acquired the right to purchase their flats under the Sale to Occupier Act. In the end, they had acquired ownership of those flats.', 'In this case, however, the procedure for allocating another appropriate flat to the complainant was not completed while the Housing Act was still in force. The Act was repealed by the entry into force of the Lease of Flats Act on 5 November 1996 ...', 'However, section 52(1) of the Lease of Flats Act provides that proceedings instituted under the Housing Act must be concluded under the provisions of that Act. This provision implies that even in the changed legislative circumstances the interpretation that the rights inherent in the specially protected tenancy ..., which have been the subject of proceedings [instituted] while the Housing Act was in force but not completed before the entry into force of the Lease of Flats Act, exist even after the repeal of the Housing Act. Otherwise, the meaning and purpose of section 52(1) of the Lease of Flats Act would be called into question. It is clear that since the Housing Act has been repealed the legal basis for acquiring a specially protected tenancy no longer exists ... However, respecting the principles and values of the constitutional order of the Republic of Croatia ... requires the legislature and the authorities ... applying the law ... to be guided by these principles and values \u200b\u200band to follow them.', '...', 'The legal views expressed in the judgments of the competent courts are based on a constitutionally unacceptable interpretation of the relevant substantive law because it neglects the constitutional guarantee of equality. The scope and effects of this principle in the present case are not determined by the mere mechanical subsuming of the facts under the relevant provisions of the Housing Act and the Lease of Flats Act, but also by giving effect to the other highest values of the constitutional order of the Republic of Croatia.”']",[],[],[],[],[],[]

The second applicant, Ms Tsveta Ivanova Ludneva, is a Bulgarian national who was born in 1951 and lives in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. The two applicants were represented by Ms N. Markova, a lawyer practising in Plovdiv.', '2. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms I. Stancheva-Chinova, from the Ministry of Justice.', '3. In 2000 the first applicant set up a limited liability company in Bulgaria. The second applicant was employed by the company. Between 2000 and 2003 the first applicant visited Bulgaria on several occasions. On 2 July 2003 the two applicants married. After that the first applicant started living permanently in Bulgaria and in 2005 was granted a permanent residence permit.', '4. On 25 September 2006 the Director of the National Security Service (“the NSS”), at the time a department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, issued an order revoking the first applicant’s residence permit, ordering his expulsion and barring him from entering Bulgaria for ten years. The order relied on sections 42 and 44(1) of the Aliens Act of 1998. It indicated that it was based on the reasons set out in a classified document named “proposal” (“предложение”) and bearing the number RB2020001-001-03/Пд/C3533/25.09.2006, and on the fact that the first applicant represented a threat to national security. It was also indicated that the order was subject to immediate execution.', '5. After communication of the present application, the Government provided the Court with an excerpt from proposal RB2020001-001-03/Пд/C3533/25.09.2006, which had been declassified on 24 August 2012. The excerpt, in which the names of the other persons are concealed, was shown to the first applicant in the proceedings concerning the judicial review of the order of 25 September 2006 (see below), and was included in the case file. The document refers to “operational intelligence data” showing that the first applicant was involved in drug trafficking. In particular, it is alleged that he was in contact with persons known to be involved in such activities, and used his company’s trucks to transport drugs to Russia and Turkey. It is also stated that in April 2005 a truck belonging to the first applicant’s company was caught in the area of Dobrich carrying 200 kg of amphetamines.', '6. The Government submitted an excerpt from another document entitled “information document” (“справка”) bearing the number RB2020001-001-03/Пд/C3532/25.09.2006, also declassified on 24 August 2012, which contained the same statements and alleged, in addition, that the first applicant was involved in “unlawful drug trafficking, under the control of the Syrian secret services, who provide logistical support to the terrorist organisation Hezbollah”. This excerpt was also presented to the first applicant and included in the case file in the judicial-review proceedings he instigated (see below).', '7. The first applicant was expelled to Jordan on 26 January 2007.', '8. On 19 October 2006 the first applicant filed an administrative appeal against the order of 25 September 2006. On 24 October 2006 the Minister of Internal Affairs dismissed his appeal, finding that the proposal and the information document drawn up by the NSS contained data leading to the conclusion that the first applicant posed a threat to national security. The Minister went on to say that there had been sufficient grounds to justify the order; by law, when issuing such orders the authorities had to refrain from setting out in them the facts justifying their conclusion that the respective person represented a national security risk.', '9. In November 2006 the first applicant sought judicial review of the expulsion order by the Sofia City Court. He argued that it was unclear on what factual circumstances the expulsion order had been based and that he had not been given an opportunity “to defend himself against arbitrary action”. The first applicant also sought a stay of the enforcement of the expulsion order pending the outcome of the proceedings.', '10. The Sofia City Court accepted the application for judicial review for examination. In decisions issued on 7 December 2006 and 8 February 2007 it refused to stay the enforcement of the expulsion order.', '11. Following amendments to the Aliens Act 1998 that made expulsion orders subject to review by the Supreme Administrative Court (“the SAC”), the case was transferred to that court on an unspecified date. In the proceedings before it, the first applicant had legal representation.', '12. In his submissions to the SAC the first applicant disputed the allegations ‒ made in the proposal and the information document referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6 above ‒ that he had been involved in drug trafficking. He also disputed the claim that in 2005 in the region of Dobrich the authorities had discovered drugs in a truck belonging to his company. He pointed out that at the time in question he had not sent trucks into that area and argued that if the allegation were true he would have been under investigation. He presented additional documents issued by the prosecution authorities, stating that he had no criminal convictions and that there were no ongoing investigations concerning him in the regions of Dobrich or Plovdiv. The first applicant also contested the allegations that he had worked for the Syrian secret services and Hezbollah, pointing out that he was a Jordanian and a Sunnite, and that Hezbollah was a Shia militant group. He stated that his expulsion had disrupted his commercial activities in Bulgaria. Lastly, he said the following:', '“[I]t should be noted that my personal rights have been unlawfully encroached upon, which is unjustified. My family has been separated for more than a year.”', '13. In a judgment of 9 January 2008, which was final, the SAC found that the order of 25 September 2006 was lawful and disallowed the first applicant’s application for judicial review. Its decisive reasoning was as follows:', '“The disputed order was made by a competent body, no material breaches of the rules of administrative procedure have been committed, and it does not contradict the applicable law and its intent. The argument raised in the application for judicial review that the disputed administrative act did not contain any reasoning and was not based on the law is ill-founded. The disputed order refers to the legal provisions it is based on and ‒ given that it concerns compulsory measures under section 46(2) of the [Aliens Act] ‒ pursuant to section 46(3) of the same Act it should not disclose the factual grounds justifying it. Moreover, those factual grounds are set out in detail in [proposal RB2020001-001-03/Пд/C3533/25.09.2006] and are indicated in the disputed order as the factual basis, as can be seen from the [excerpt from the document] included in the case file. On the basis of the information contained in the proposal, the administrative body has reached a reasoned conclusion that the [applicant’s] presence in the country amounts to a serious threat to national security, and that the preconditions have been satisfied for the imposition of the compulsory measure ‘expulsion’ [...], together with the compulsory measures ‘revocation of residence permit’ and ‘bar on entering the [Republic of Bulgaria]’ which accompany it on a mandatory basis. [...] As can be seen from the proposal and the information document [RB2020001-001-03/Пд/C3532/25.09.2006], an excerpt of which [...] has also been included in the case file, the operational investigative activities carried out have established the grounds for imposing the compulsory measure ‘extradition’, together with the remaining [compulsory measures taken]. Contrary to the applicant’s arguments, the excerpts presented in the case ‒ prepared in accordance with the [law on classified information] ‒ are official attestation documents, which have binding force for the court as regards the contents of the proposal and the information document, on the basis of which ‒ in accordance with the applicable substantive rules ‒ the disputed order has been made.”', '14. With the order of 25 September 2006 the Director of the NSS ordered the first applicant’s detention pending expulsion. On 26 September 2006 the Director of the Plovdiv Regional Police Directorate, relying on section 44(6) and (8) of the Aliens Act, also ordered his detention pending enforcement of the expulsion order. On the same day the first applicant was detained and placed in the Centre for Interim Detention of Aliens (“the CIDA”) in Busmantsi, where he remained until his expulsion on 26 January 2007.', '15. The order of 26 September 2006 stated that it was subject to judicial review. It does not appear that the first applicant sought such review.', '16. Around 6 p.m. on 30 December 2006 the first applicant was beaten by a codetainee, an Iraqi national, with whom he had been accommodated in the same room in the CIDA. Immediately after the accident the Iraqi was placed in another room.', '17. In the early hours of 31 December 2006 the first applicant was transferred to a hospital where it was established that he had a broken nose. On 3 January 2007 he underwent surgery. He was discharged from hospital on 8 January 2007.', '18. On 19 January 2007 the first applicant complained to the prosecution authorities and requested them to investigate his beating. On 1 February 2007 a prosecutor from the Sofia District Public Prosecutor’s Office instructed the police to carry out a check-up. After this had been done, in a decision of 27 March 2007 the prosecutor found that the injury suffered by the applicant was considered by the Criminal Code to be one of a minor severity, which meant that its infliction was a privately prosecutable offence. Thus, the prosecutor discontinued the criminal proceedings.', '19. The above decision, which was served on the first applicant’s lawyer, was appealable to a higher-ranking prosecutor. The first applicant did not appeal. Nor did he lodge a private criminal complaint against his attacker, who was likewise expelled from Bulgaria on an unspecified date.', '20. The relevant domestic law concerning the expulsion of aliens on grounds of national security, as in force at the time, has been set out in detail in the Court’s judgments in the cases of C.G. and Others v. Bulgaria (no. 1365/07, §§ 18-26, 24 April 2008) and Raza v. Bulgaria (no. 31465/08, §§ 3035, 11 February 2010).']",[],[],[],[],[],[]

De Gaetano,"['8. The applicant was born in 1967 and is living in The Hague.', '9. In March 1987 the applicant met and started a relationship with Mr W., who – like the applicant – was born and had always lived in Suriname. Both of them had acquired Surinamese nationality in 1975 when Suriname gained its independence (Article 3 of the Agreement between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Suriname concerning the assignment of nationality (Toescheidingsovereenkomst inzake nationaliteiten tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Republiek Suriname), see paragraph 62 below). In September 1989, the applicant and Mr W. started to cohabit in the house of the latter’s paternal grandfather in Suriname.', '10. On 19 October 1991, Mr W. travelled from Suriname to the Netherlands, holding a Netherlands visa for the purpose of stay with his father in the Netherlands. In 1993, Mr W. was granted Netherlands nationality which entailed the renunciation of his Surinamese nationality.', '11. Mr W. has one sister, two brothers and one half-brother who are living in the Netherlands. Two other half-brothers and one half-sister are living in Suriname. The applicant has one brother, G., who was expelled from the Netherlands to Suriname in 2009. The applicant has also one half-brother and one half-sister who are living in the Netherlands. She has another half-sister who is living in Suriname.', '12. Between 1991 and 1995, the applicant filed five unsuccessful requests for a Netherlands visa for the purpose of visiting a relative. These requests were rejected because her sponsor (referent) was insufficiently solvent, had failed to sign the required affidavit of support (garantverklaring) or had failed to supply sufficient information required for the assessment of the visa request. The applicant did not challenge any of these rejections in administrative appeal proceedings.', '13. On 19 November 1996 the applicant filed a sixth visa request for the purpose of visiting a relative. After this request had been granted on 4 March 1997, the applicant entered the Netherlands on 12 March 1997 and did not return to Suriname when her visa expired 45 days later. To date, she has been staying in the Netherlands. She lived in Rotterdam until 20 July 1998, when she moved to The Hague. Since 17 December 1998 she has been living at the same address in The Hague.', '14. On 20 October 1997, the applicant applied for a residence permit. According to the applicant, she had done so for the purpose of taking up residence with her Netherlands-national partner Mr W. According to the Government, the applicant’s stated aim had been to take up “paid employment”. On 16 February 1998, the Deputy Minister of Justice (Staatssecretaris van Justitie) decided not to process the application (buiten behandeling stellen) as the applicant had on two occasions failed to appear in person before the immigration authorities for the purpose of giving further information about her application. When, on 13 February 1998, the applicant’s lawyer had requested a new appointment on the ground that she would be unable to attend the interview scheduled for 16 February 1998, she was informed by the immigration authorities that – despite her lawyer’s absence – the applicant should appear in person. The applicant did not appear on 16 February 1998. The Deputy Minister’s decision of 16 February 1998 was notified to the applicant on 23 February 1998 and she was ordered to leave the Netherlands within seven days.', '15. The applicant filed an objection (bezwaar) against the decision of 16 February 1998. As this objection was denied suspensive effect, she applied for a provisional measure (voorlopige voorziening) in the form of a court injunction preventing her expulsion pending the determination of her objection. This application was rejected on 23 December 1999 by the Acting President of the Regional Court (rechtbank) of The Hague sitting in Haarlem. The applicant’s objection against the decision of 16 February 1998 was rejected by the Deputy Minister on 17 January 2000. The applicant’s appeal against this decision to the Regional Court of The Hague and her accompanying application for a provisional measure were rejected on 12 July 2001 by the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Utrecht. No further appeal lay against this ruling.', '16. In the meantime, the applicant had married Mr W. on 25 June 1999 and, in September 2000, a son was born of this marriage. Under the Netherlands nationality rules, the applicant’s child is a Netherlands national. Since the child was unwell, he required lengthy treatment in hospital. He is currently attending secondary school and has no health problems.', '17. On 20 April 2001, the applicant applied unsuccessfully for a residence permit on the basis of the so-called three-year policy (driejarenbeleid) or for compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature. Under this three-year policy a residence permit could be granted if a request for such a permit had not been determined within a period of three years for reasons not imputable to the petitioner and provided that there were no contra-indications such as, for instance, a criminal record. In the course of the proceedings on this request, the provisional-measures judge (voorzieningenrechter) of the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Amsterdam granted the applicant’s request for a provisional measure (injunction on removal) on 23 February 2004. The final decision was given on 17 May 2004 by the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Amsterdam.', '18. On 10 December 2005, a second child was born of the applicant’s marriage. This child also holds Netherlands nationality.', '19. On 23 January 2007, the applicant filed a request for a residence permit for the purpose of stay with her children in the Netherlands. This request was rejected because the applicant did not hold the required provisional residence visa (machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf). Such a visa has to be applied for at a Netherlands mission in the petitioner’s country of origin and it is a prerequisite for the grant of a residence permit (verblijfsvergunning) which confers more permanent residence rights. The applicant was not exempted from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa. She challenged this decision unsuccessfully in administrative appeal proceedings in which the final decision was taken by the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Haarlem on 19 April 2007.', '20. On 7 May 2007, the applicant requested the Deputy Minister of Justice to reconsider (heroverwegen) the negative decision on her last request. On 28 September 2007, the applicant filed a complaint with the Deputy Minister on account of the latter’s failure to reply to her request for reconsideration. By letter of 12 November 2007, the Deputy Minister informed the applicant that although her complaint concerning delay was well-founded there was no reason for a reconsideration of the decision.', '21. On 28 September 2007, the applicant applied for a grant of a residence permit at the discretion of the Deputy Minister (conform beschikking staatssecretaris) based on grounds of special and individual circumstances (vanwege bijzondere en individuele omstandigheden).', '22. On 7 July 2008, the Deputy Minister of Justice rejected this application. The applicant filed an objection with the Deputy Minister against this decision as well as an application to the Regional Court of The Hague for a provisional measure (injunction on removal pending the objection proceedings). On 17 November 2008, having noted that this request was not opposed by the Deputy Minister, the Regional Court of The Hague granted the provisional measure. On 11 March 2009, after a hearing on the applicant’s objection held on 15 January 2009, the Deputy Minister rejected the applicant’s objection.', '23. The applicant’s appeal against the decision of 11 March 2009 to the Regional Court of The Hague and her accompanying application for a provisional measure in the form of an injunction on her removal pending the determination of her appeal were rejected on 8 December 2009 by the provisional-measures judge of the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Haarlem. In its relevant part, this ruling reads as follows:', '“2.11 It is not in dispute that the appellant does not hold a valid provisional residence visa and that she is not eligible for an exemption from the requirement to hold such a visa under section 17 § 1 of the Aliens Act 2000 (Vreemdelingenwet 2000) or section 3.71 § 2 of the Aliens Decree 2000 (Vreemdelingenbesluit 2000). It is only in dispute whether reason dictates that the defendant should exempt the appellant from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa on the basis of section 3.71 § 4 of the Aliens Decree [for reasons of exceptional hardship (onbillijkheid van overwegende aard)].', '2.12 The Regional Court finds that the defendant could reasonably conclude that in the present case there are no special and individual circumstances on the basis of which insistence on compliance with the visa requirement would entail exceptional hardship. ...', '2.18 The appellant’s reliance on Article 8 of the Convention fails. There is family life between the appellant and her husband and her minor children, but the defendant’s refusal to exempt her from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa does not constitute an interference with the right to respect for family life as the defendant’s decision did not deprive her of a residence permit enabling her to enjoy her family life in the Netherlands.', '2.19 It does not appear that there is a positive obligation for the Netherlands State under Article 8 of the Convention to exempt the applicant, contrary to the policy pursued in this area, from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa. It is of importance at the outset that there has been no appearance of any objective obstacle to the enjoyment of family life outside the Netherlands. Taking into account the young age of the appellant’s children, it can also reasonably be expected that they would follow the appellant to Suriname for the duration of the proceedings relating to the provisional residence visa. This is not altered by the fact that both children are Netherlands nationals. The fact that the appellant’s husband is currently being detained gives no cause for finding that ... there is an objective obstacle.', '2.20 The appellant has cited the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in the cases of Rodrigues da Silva [and Hoogkamer v. the Netherlands, no. 50435/99, ECHR 2006I], Said Botan [v. the Netherlands (striking out), no. 1869/04, 10 March 2009] and Ibrahim Mohamed [v. the Netherlands (striking out), no. 1872/04, 10 March 2009]. This cannot succeed, for the following reasons. The case of Rodrigues da Silva did not concern a temporary separation in connection with maintaining the requirement to hold a provisional residence visa, so the case cannot be said to be comparable. In the cases of Said Botan and Ibrahim Mohamed the European Court found that the reasons for lodging the complaints had been removed, because a residence permit had been granted to the complainants in those cases. For that reason, their complaints were not considered further. The Regional Court fails to see in what manner the European Court’s findings in those two cases could be of relevance to the appellant’s case.', '2.21 The appellant has further invoked Article 2 of the International Convention on the Rights of the Child. In so far as the provisions invoked entail a directly applicable norm, they have no further implications beyond the fact that in proceedings such as those at hand, the interests of the children concerned must be taken into account. In the decision of 11 March 2009, the situation of the appellant’s two minor children was explicitly taken into account in the assessment. As the provisions invoked do not contain a norm as regards the weight that must be given in a concrete case to the interests of a child, there is no ground for finding that those provisions have been violated.', '2.22 The Regional Court will declare the appeal unfounded.”', '24. On 2 August 2009, upon his return to the Netherlands from a trip to Suriname for the funeral of his foster mother, the applicant’s husband had been found to have swallowed cocaine pellets. He was placed in pre-trial detention. On 8 October 2009, a single-judge chamber (politierechter) of the Haarlem Regional Court convicted him of offences under the Opium Act (Opiumwet) and sentenced him to seven months’ imprisonment. On the basis of this conviction, the Netherlands Royal Constabulary (Koninklijke Marechaussee) included his name on a blacklist provided to airline companies operating direct flights between the Netherlands and Aruba, the former Netherlands Antilles, Suriname and Venezuela. His name was to remain on the list for a period of three years, the aim being to prevent him from reoffending. On 31 December 2009, after having served his sentence, the applicant’s husband was released from prison. His name was removed from the airline blacklist on 2 August 2012.', '25. The applicant’s appeal of 7 January 2010 to the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State (Afdeling bestuursrechtspraak van de Raad van State) against the judgment of 8 December 2009 of the provisional-measures judge of the Regional Court of The Hague was dismissed on 6 July 2010. The Administrative Jurisdiction Division found that the appeal did not provide grounds for quashing the impugned ruling (kan niet tot vernietiging van de aangevallen uitspraak leiden). Having regard to section 91 § 2 of the Aliens Act 2000, no further reasoning was called for as the arguments submitted did not raise any questions requiring a determination in the interest of legal unity, legal development or legal protection in the general sense. No further appeal lay against this decision.', '26. In the meantime, the applicant filed a fifth request on 16 April 2010 for a residence permit with the Minister of Justice (Minister van Justitie) for the purpose of stay with a child, arguing that she should be exempted from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa on grounds of special and individual circumstances.', '27. This request was rejected on 11 May 2010 by the Minister, who held that there was no reason to exempt the applicant from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa and that the refusal of a residence permit was not contrary to Article 8 of the Convention. While accepting that there was family life within the meaning of Article 8 between the applicant, her husband and their children, the Minister found that there was no interference with the right to respect for family life as the refusal to grant the applicant’s request for exemption did not deprive her of a residence permit which enabled her to exercise her family life in the Netherlands.', '28. As to the question whether the applicant’s rights under Article 8 entailed a positive obligation for the Netherlands to grant her a residence permit, the Minister found that the interests of the Netherlands State in pursuing a restrictive immigration policy outweighed the applicant’s personal interest in exercising her right to family life in the Netherlands. In balancing these competing interests, the Minister took into account the following: already in Suriname and before her arrival in the Netherlands the applicant had been in a relationship with her current spouse; she had entered the Netherlands without having been granted entry clearance for joining her partner as required under the relevant immigration rules; and she had created her family in the Netherlands without holding a residence permit. When it transpired in the course of the proceedings that the applicant was pregnant, the Minister further held that it had not been established, nor did it appear that the applicant would be unable – should hospitalisation be necessary – to give birth in a hospital in Suriname or that there would be any insurmountable objective obstacles to the exercise of family life in Suriname. On this point, the Minister noted that Dutch was spoken in Suriname and that the transition would not therefore be particularly difficult for the applicant’s children, who could continue their education in Suriname in a normal manner.', '29. The Minister added that the mere fact that the applicant’s spouse and children were Netherlands nationals did not entail an automatic obligation for the Netherlands authorities to grant the applicant a residence permit, or lead to the conclusion that the exercise of family life would only be possible in the Netherlands. The Netherlands authorities could not be held responsible for the consequences of the applicant’s personal choice to come to, settle and create a family in the Netherlands without any certainty as to her entitlement to permanent residence. In the balancing exercise, the Minister attributed decisive weight to the fact that the applicant had never resided lawfully in the Netherlands and that there was no indication whatsoever that it would be impossible to exercise family life in Suriname.', '30. The Minister further rejected the applicant’s argument that she ought to be exempted from the visa requirement, on the basis that inter alia the length of the applicant’s stay in the Netherlands was a consequence of her personal choice to continue to remain there. She had met with several refusals of her applications for a Netherlands residence permit but had nevertheless opted each time to file a fresh request, thus accepting the risk that, at some point in time, she would have to leave the Netherlands, at least, temporarily. The Minister further considered that the applicant had been born and raised in Suriname where she had resided most of her life and, given her age, she should be regarded as capable of returning to and fending for herself in Suriname, if need be with financial and/or material support from the Netherlands, pending the determination of an application for a provisional residence visa to be filed by her in Suriname. The Minister concluded on this point that the case disclosed no circumstances warranting a finding that the decision not to exempt the applicant from the visa requirement constituted exceptional hardship within the meaning of section 3.71 § 4 of the Aliens Decree 2000.', '31. On 17 May 2010, the applicant filed an objection against this decision with the Minister. She filed additional grounds for her objection and furnished further information by letters of 20 and 25 May and 8 June 2010.', '32. On 2 July 2010, the applicant requested the Regional Court of The Hague to issue a provisional measure (injunction on expulsion pending the outcome of the objection proceedings).', '33. On 3 August 2010, following a court hearing held on 28 July 2010 and having regard to pending proceedings taken by the applicant seeking deferral of her removal under section 64 of the Aliens Act 2000 (see paragraph 53 below), the provisional-measures judge of the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Amsterdam rejected the request for a provisional measure on the basis that it was moot.', '34. On 19 December 2011 the Minister rejected the applicant’s objection of 17 May 2010. An appeal by the applicant against that decision was rejected on 17 July 2012 by the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Dordrecht. In so far as relevant, its judgment reads:', '“2.4.1. It must be examined whether the defendant could have refused to exempt the appellant from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa, as required under section 3.71 § 1 of the Aliens Decree 2000, on the ground that removal is not contrary to Article 8 of the Convention.', '2.4.2. It is not in dispute between the parties that there is family life between the appellant and her husband and their three minor children. Refusing the application [for a residence permit] does not constitute interference within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention. No residence permit which actually enabled the appellant to enjoy family life in the Netherlands has been taken away from her. The subsequent question arises whether there exist such facts and circumstances that the right to respect for family life may be said to entail a positive obligation for the defendant to allow the applicant to reside [in the Netherlands]. In making this assessment, a ‘fair balance’ must be found between, on the one hand, the interests of the alien concerned in enjoying family life in the Netherlands and, on the other, the general interest of the Netherlands State in pursuing a restrictive immigration policy. In this balancing exercise, the defendant has a certain margin of appreciation.', '2.4.3. It was reasonable for the defendant to attach more weight to the general interest of the Netherlands State than to the personal interests of the appellant and her family members. The defendant did not have to accept an obligation to grant the appellant residence in the Netherlands on the basis of Article 8 of the Convention. In this balancing exercise, the defendant was entitled to weigh heavily to the appellant’s disadvantage the fact that she had started family life in the Netherlands when she had not been granted a residence permit for this purpose, and that she had further intensified her family life despite the refusal of her requests for residence. This is not altered by the fact that for a certain period the appellant was lawfully resident while awaiting the outcome of proceedings concerning a request for a residence permit.', '2.4.4. The defendant was entitled to take the position that the consequences of the appellant’s choices were at her own risk. According to the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights (Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer v. the Netherlands [no. 50435/99, ECHR 2006I]), where family life has started while no residence permit for that purpose has been granted, removal will lead to a violation of Article 8 only in the most exceptional circumstances. The appellant has not established that, as regards her and her family, there are such exceptional circumstances. Her reliance on the judgments in Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer and Nunez v. Norway (no. 55597/09, 28 June 2011) fails, as her situation is not comparable to the one in the cases of Rodrigues da Silva and Nunez. In those cases it was established that the children could not follow their mother to the country of origin. With the removal of the mother, contact with the children would become impossible. However, in the appellant’s case, it has not become sufficiently apparent that her husband and children could not follow her to her country of origin to continue family life there. The appellant has insufficiently demonstrated that her family members will encounter difficulties in entering Suriname. The consequence of her husband’s inclusion on a blacklist is that airlines can refuse to allow him on direct flights from the Netherlands to the Netherlands Antilles, Aruba, Suriname and Venezuela during the period between 2 August 2009 and 2 August 2012. This does not mean that it is self-evident that the husband will not be admitted to Suriname. The appellant has not established that it would be impossible for her husband to travel to Suriname in another manner. In addition, it is important to note that registration on the blacklist is only of a temporary nature.', '2.4.5. No other circumstances have appeared on the basis of which the existence of an objective obstacle to continued family life in Suriname must be accepted. There is also no question of excessive formalism. The appellant’s situation is not comparable to the one in the case of Rodrigues da Silva. The defendant has taken the interests of the minor children sufficiently into account in the balancing exercise. The children were all born in the Netherlands and hold Netherlands nationality. At the time the impugned decision was taken, they were respectively eleven, six and one year old. The children have always lived in the Netherlands. Although the oldest child has built up bonds with the Netherlands, the defendant did not have to accept this as a basis for holding that the children could not take root in Suriname. In this connection it is also relevant that Dutch is spoken in Suriname and that both parents hail from Suriname.', '2.4.6. This is not altered by the fact that the appellant’s husband and children hold Netherlands nationality and, on the basis of Article 20 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (hereinafter ‘TFEU’), can derive rights from their EU citizenship. It can be deduced from the considerations of the Court of Justice of the European Union (hereinafter ‘ECJ’) in the Dereci et al. judgment of 15 November 2011 (C-256/11), in which a further explanation is given of the Ruiz Zambrano judgment of 8 March 2011 (C-34/09), that in answering the question whether a citizen of the EU who enjoys family life with a third-country national will be denied the right to reside in EU territory flowing directly from Article 20 of the TFEU, only a limited importance is given to the right to respect for family life. As follows from paragraphs 68 and 69 of the Dereci judgment, this right is not, as such, protected by Article 20 of the TFEU but by other international, EU and domestic rules and regulations, such as Article 8 of the Convention, Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, EU Directives and section 15 of the Aliens Act 2000. In answering this question the desire of family members to reside as a nuclear family unit in the Netherlands or the European Union is, inter alia, also of limited importance.', '2.4.7. The situation of an EU citizen being denied the right to reside in EU territory arises only when the EU citizen is so dependent on the third-country national that, as a consequence of the decision by the defendant, he has no other choice than to stay with that national outside EU territory. In the appellant’s case, that has not occurred. The appellant’s children can be cared for by their father. The father also has Netherlands nationality. The appellant’s husband and children are not obliged or actually compelled to go with her to Suriname in connection with the application for a provisional residence visa. Their rights as EU citizens are thus not breached.', '2.4.8. It was reasonable for the defendant to take the view that there was no appearance of very special individual circumstances leading to undue hardship. The proceedings concerning the appellant’s previous requests for a residence permit and the course of events during her placement in aliens’ detention for removal purposes cannot be regarded as such. The lawfulness of the decisions taken in those proceedings cannot be examined in the present appeal proceedings. The appellant has further not substantiated her claim that, when she submitted her first request for a residence permit, she complied with all the requirements and that she should then have been granted a residence permit. ...”', 'The Regional Court went on to find that the applicant had not substantiated her alleged medical problems or why these problems should lead to exempting her from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa. The court further found that the applicant had not demonstrated her claim that, apart from the requirement to hold a provisional residence visa, she met all requirements for the issuance of a residence permit.', '35. On 14 August 2012, the applicant filed a further appeal with the Administrative Jurisdiction Division. No further information about the proceedings on this latest request for a residence permit has been submitted by the parties.', '36. On 5 January 2007, the aliens’ police ordered the applicant to report to them on 10 January 2007 so that she could be served with notice to leave the country within two weeks. This order was withdrawn owing to the applicant’s third request for a residence permit filed on 23 January 2007 (see paragraph 19 above).', '37. On 26 February 2010, the applicant’s lawyer was informed by the aliens’ police that – as the applicant’s appeal against the judgment of 8 December 2009 (see paragraphs 23 and 25 above) did not have suspensive effect – they would proceed with the applicant’s removal.', '38. On 10 April 2010, having failed to respond to a summons of 4 March 2010 to report to the aliens’ police, the applicant was placed in aliens’ detention (vreemdelingenbewaring) for removal purposes in accordance with section 59 § 1 (a) of the Aliens Act 2000. She was taken to the Zeist detention centre where she was found to be pregnant, her due date being 14 December 2010.', '39. The applicant’s three successive release requests were rejected by the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Rotterdam on 27 April, 1 June and 8 July 2010, respectively. In each decision, the Regional Court found that there were sufficient prospects of expulsion within a reasonable time frame and that the Netherlands authorities were pursuing the applicant’s removal with sufficient diligence. In its rulings, the Regional Court also rejected the applicant’s arguments that her pregnancy rendered her detention contrary to Article 3 and that, against that background, her conditions of detention were incompatible with that provision. In this context, in a letter of 29 June 2010 and addressed to the applicant’s lawyer who submitted it in the proceedings to the Regional Court, the Netherlands section of Amnesty International expressed its concern about the applicant’s placement in aliens’ detention. Although aware that the applicant had failed to respect the duty to report imposed on her, Amnesty International considered that a less severe measure than deprivation of liberty would be appropriate in the particular circumstances of the applicant’s case.', '40. In the course of her placement in aliens’ detention, the applicant, on 28 June, 15 July and 3 August 2010, also filed complaints about her conditions of detention with the competent Supervisory Board (Commissie van Toezicht) of the two detention centres where she was held. These complaints were decided in two decisions given on 12 and 29 November 2010, respectively. Apart from the applicant’s complaint of 28 June 2010 that she had been required to wear restraints during transports to hospital, which was accepted as well-founded in the decision of 29 November 2010, the applicant’s complaints were dismissed. On 6 June 2011 the Appeals Board (beroepscommissie) of the Council for the Administration of Criminal Justice and Juvenile Protection (Raad voor Strafrechtstoepassing en Jeugdbescherming) gave final decisions on the applicant’s appeals against the decisions of 12 and 29 November 2010. It held that the use of restraints for pregnant women was impermissible. It also held that the applicant had received too little supplementary nutrition upon arrival at the Rotterdam detention centre. These complaints were considered by the Court in its decision on admissibility of 4 December 2012 (see paragraph 4 above) and were declared inadmissible for the reasons set out therein.', '41. The applicant was released from aliens’ detention on 5 August 2010 and her third child was born on 28 November 2010.', '42. On 25 September 2012, the Consulate General of Suriname in Amsterdam issued a Surinamese passport to the applicant, which is valid until 25 September 2017.']",['8'],['8-1'],[],[],[],[]
