GREECE", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violations of Art. 3;No separate issue under Art. 13;No violation of Art. 14+3 (alleged racist treatment);Violation of Art. 14+3 (failure to investigate possible racist motives);Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["8. The applicants, who are Greek nationals of Roma origin, were born in 1980 and live in Mesolonghi (Western Greece).", "9. On 8 May 1998, at approximately 00.45 a.m., a patrol car from the Mesolonghi police station responded to a telephone complaint reporting the attempted burglary of a kiosk. The call had been made by the grandson of the owner of the kiosk, Mr Pavlakis. Upon arriving at the scene, the latter found the first applicant attempting to break into the kiosk with an iron bar while the second applicant was apparently acting as a lookout. He struggled with the second applicant, who subsequently stated that Mr Pavlakis had punched him in the face.", "10. At that point three police officers, Mr Sompolos, Mr Alexopoulos and Mr Ganavias, arrived. The first applicant claimed that he was initially handcuffed without being beaten. Then, an officer removed his handcuffs and repeatedly beat him on the back and the head with a truncheon. He stopped when the first applicant complained that he had a medical condition and was feeling dizzy.", "11. Following their arrest, the applicants were taken to the Mesolonghi police station, where officers Tsikrikas, Avgeris, Zalokostas, Skoutas and Kaminatos were present. The first applicant alleged that as he was being led to his cell one officer beat him twice with a truncheon and another slapped him in the face.", "12. At 10.00 a.m. the first applicant was taken to the interview room, where allegedly three police officers punched him in the stomach and the back, trying to extract confessions to other crimes and information about who was dealing in drugs in the area. According to the first applicant, the police officers took turns beating him, slapping him and hitting him all over his body. The first applicant further alleged that another police officer beat him with the iron bar that had been used in the attempted burglary. He alleged that this officer also pushed him against the wall, choking him with the iron bar and threatening to sexually assault him, saying \u201cI will f... you\u201d, while trying to lower his trousers.", "13. The second applicant said that he was also abused throughout his interrogation. During the early hours of the day, he was allegedly beaten with a truncheon on his back and kicked in the stomach by an officer who later returned to beat him again. Subsequently, the second applicant identified the officer as Mr Tsikrikas. The second applicant also testified that the police officers \u201cinserted a truncheon in [his] bottom and then raised it to [his] face, asking [him] whether it smelled\u201d.", "14. The applicants stated that they were both able to hear each other\u2019s screams and cries throughout their interrogation. The first applicant testified before the domestic court: \u201cI could hear Koutropoulos crying in the other room\u201d. The second applicant stated: \u201cI screamed and cried when they were beating me. I could also hear Bekos\u2019s screams and cries\u201d. They also claimed that they suffered repeated verbal abuse about their Roma origins. In his sworn deposition dated 3 July 1998 the first applicant testified before the public prosecutor that the officer who had choked him with the iron bar said to him \u201cyou guys f... your sisters\u201d and \u201cyour mothers are getting f... by others\u201d (see also paragraph 25 below).", "The Government disputed that the applicants had been assaulted or subjected to racial abuse while in police detention.", "15. The applicants remained in detention until the morning of 9 May 1998. At 11.00 a.m. they were brought before the Mesolonghi Public Prosecutor. The first applicant was charged with attempted theft and the second applicant with being an accomplice. The Public Prosecutor set a trial date and released the applicants. In November 1999 the applicants were sentenced to thirty days\u2019 and twenty days\u2019 imprisonment respectively, in each case suspended for three years.", "16. On 9 May 1998, the applicants went to the regional hospital in order to obtain medical evidence of their injuries. However, the intern they saw at the hospital was only able to verify that they both had bruises. In order to acquire stronger evidence of their injuries, the applicants consulted a forensic doctor in Patras. The latter issued a medical certificate dated 9 May 1998, in which he stated that the applicants bore \u201cmoderate bodily injuries caused in the past twenty-four hours by a heavy blunt instrument...\u201d In particular, the first applicant had \u201ctwo deep red (almost black) parallel contusions with areas of healthy skin, covering approximately 10 cm stretching from the left shoulder joint to the area of the deltoid muscle and the right shoulder joint. He complains of pain in his knee joint. He complains of pain in the left parietal area\u201d. The second applicant had \u201cmultiple deep red (almost black) parallel \u2018double\u2019 contusions with areas of healthy skin covering approximately 12 cm stretching from the left shoulder joint along the rear armpit fold at the lower edge of the shoulder blade, a contusion of the aforementioned colour measuring approximately 5 cm on the rear left surface of the upper arm and a contusion of the aforementioned colour measuring approximately 2 cm on the right carpal joint. He complains of pain on the right side of the parietal area and of pain in the midsection. He complains that he is suffering from a torn meniscus in the right knee, shows pain on movement and has difficulty walking\u201d. The applicants produced to the Court pictures taken on the day of their release, showing their injuries. The Government questioned the authenticity of these pictures and affirmed that they should have first been produced to the domestic authorities. They also questioned the credibility of the forensic doctor who examined the applicants and submitted that he had convictions for perjury.", "17. On 11 May 1998 the Greek Helsinki Monitor and the Greek Minority Rights Group sent a joint open letter to the Ministry of Public Order protesting against the incident. The letter bore the heading \u201csubject matter: incident of ill-treatment of young Roma (Gypsies) by police officers\u201d; it stated that members of the above organisations had had direct contact with the two victims during a lengthy visit to Roma camps in Greece and that they had collected approximately thirty statements concerning similar incidents of ill-treatment against Roma. The Greek Helsinki Monitor and the Greek Minority Rights Group Reports urged the Minister of Public Order in person to ensure that a prompt investigation of the incident was carried out and that the police officers involved be punished. They expressed the view that precise and detailed instructions should be issued to all police stations in the country regarding the treatment of Roma by the police. Reports of the incident were subsequently published in several Greek newspapers.", "18. On 12 May 1998, responding to the publicity that had been generated, the Ministry of Public Order launched an informal inquiry into the matter.", "19. After the incident received greater public attention, the Greek police headquarters requested that the internal investigation be upgraded to a Sworn Administrative Inquiry (\u0395\u03bd\u03bf\u03c1\u03ba\u03b7 \u0394\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03be\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7), which started on 26 May 1998.", "20. The report on the findings of the Sworn Administrative Inquiry was issued on 18 May 1999. It identified the officers who had arrested the applicants and found that their conduct during the arrest was \u201clawful and appropriate\u201d. It concluded that two other police officers, Mr Tsikrikas and Mr Avgeris had treated the applicants \u201cwith particular cruelty during their detention\u201d. The report noted that the first applicant had consistently identified the above officers in his sworn depositions of 30 June and 23 October 1998 and that the second applicant had also consistently and repeatedly identified throughout the investigation Mr Tsikrikas as the officer who had abused him.", "21. More specifically, it was established that Mr Tsikrikas had physically abused the applicants by beating them with a truncheon and/or kicking them in the stomach. It further found that although the two officers had denied ill-treating the applicants, neither officer was able to \u201cprovide a convincing and logical explanation as to where and how the above plaintiffs were injured, given that according to the forensic doctor the ill-treatment occurred during the time they were in police custody\u201d.", "22. As a result, it was recommended that disciplinary measures in the form of \u201ctemporary suspension from service\u201d be taken against both Mr Tsikrikas and Mr Avgeris. The inquiry exculpated the other police officers who had been identified by the applicants. Despite the above recommendation, neither Mr Tsikrikas nor Mr Avgeris were ever suspended.", "23. On 14 July 1999 the Chief of the Greek Police fined Mr Tsikrikas 20,000 drachmas (less than 59 euros) for failing to \u201ctake the necessary measures to avert the occurrence of cruel treatment of the detainees by his subordinates\u201d. The Chief of the Greek Police acknowledged that the applicants had been ill-treated. He stated that \u201cthe detainees were beaten by police officers during their detention ... and were subjected to bodily injuries\u201d.", "24. On 1 July 1998 the applicants and the first applicant\u2019s father filed a criminal complaint against the Deputy Commander in Chief of the Mesolonghi police station and \u201call other\u201d officers of the police station \u201cresponsible\u201d.", "25. On 3 July 1998 the first applicant gave a sworn deposition relating to his allegations of ill-treatment. He claimed that during his arrest, he had been beaten on the head with a truncheon by a \u201ctall, blond\u201d policeman, who also gave him a beating in the police station and that he had been subjected to racial insults (see paragraph 14 above).", "26. On 18 December 1998 the Mesolonghi Public Prosecutor asked the Mesolonghi investigating judge to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the incident (\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7). The findings of the inquiry were then forwarded to the Prosecutor of the Patras Court of Appeal. In January 2000 the Patras Court of Appeal ordered an official judicial inquiry into the incident (\u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7).", "27. On 27 January 1999 and 1 February 2000 the first applicant stated that the behaviour of the police officers \u201cwas not so bad\u201d, that he wanted \u201cthis story to be over\u201d and that he did not want \u201cthe police officers to be punished\u201d. On the same dates the second applicant repeated that he had received a beating at the hands of Mr Tsikrikas, but said that the police officers\u2019 behaviour was \u201crightfully bad\u201d and that he did not want them to be prosecuted. He apologised to the owner of the kiosk and said that he wanted \u201cthis story to be over\u201d because he has joining the army and wanted \u201cto be on the safe side\u201d.", "28. On 31 August 2000 the Mesolonghi Public Prosecutor recommended that three police officers, Mr Tsikrikas, Mr Kaminatos and Mr Skoutas, be tried for physical abuse during interrogation.", "29. On 24 October 2000 the Indictment Division of the Mesolonghi Criminal Court of First Instance (\u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf \u03a0\u03bb\u03b7\u03bc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd) committed Mr Tsikrikas for trial. It found that \u201c[the] evidence shows that Mr Tsikrikas ill-treated [the applicants] during the preliminary interrogation, in order to extract a confession from them for the attempted theft ... and any similar unsolved offences they had committed in the past\u201d. The Indictment Division further stated that Mr Tsikrikas had failed to provide a plausible explanation as to how the applicants were injured during their interrogation and noted that they had both identified Mr Tsikrikas, without hesitation, as the officer who had ill-treated them. On the other hand, it decided to drop the criminal charges against Mr Kaminatos and Mr Skoutas on the ground that it had not been established that they were present when the events took place (bill of indictment no. 56/2000).", "30. Mr Tsikrikas\u2019s trial took place on 8 and 9 October 2001 before the three-member Patras Court of Appeal. The court heard several witnesses and the applicants, who repeated their allegations of ill-treatment (see paragraphs 10-14 above). Among others, the court heard Mr Dimitras, a representative of the Greek Helsinki Monitor, who stated that the said organisation was monitoring the situation of Roma in Greece and that the incident was reported to him during a visit to the Roma/Gypsy camps. He claimed that he was horrified when he saw the injuries on the applicants\u2019 bodies and that the latter were initially afraid to file a complaint against the police officers. Mr Dimitras also referred to the actions subsequently taken by the Greek Helsinki Monitor in order to assist the applicants. The court also read out, among other documents, the Greek Helsinki Monitor\u2019s and the Greek Minority Rights Group\u2019s open letter to the Ministry of Public Order (see paragraph 17 above).", "31. On 9 October 2001 the court found that there was no evidence implicating Mr Tsikrikas in any abuse and found him not guilty (decision no. 1898/2001). In particular, the court first referred to the circumstances surrounding the applicants\u2019 arrest and to the subsequent involvement of members of the Greek Helsinki Monitor in the applicants\u2019 case, noting their role in monitoring alleged violations of human rights against minorities. Taking also into account the forensic doctor\u2019s findings, the court reached the following conclusion:", "\u201c... Admittedly, the second applicant had clashed with Mr Pavlakis. Further, given the applicants\u2019 light clothing, it was logical that they were injured during the fight that took place when they were arrested. Even if some of the applicants\u2019 injuries were inflicted by police officers during their detention, it has not been proved that the accused participated in this in one way or the other, because he was absent when they arrived at the police station and did not have contact with them until approximately two hours later, on his arrival at the police station. In his sworn deposition dated 3 July 1998, the first applicant stated that in the process of his arrest he had been beaten with a truncheon by a tall, blond police officer (a description that does not match the features of the accused) and that the same police officer had also beaten him during his detention. However, the accused was not present when the applicants were arrested. If the applicants had indeed been beaten by police officers during their detention, they would have informed their relatives who arrived at the police station that same night. Thus, the accused must be found not guilty.\u201d", "32. Under Greek law, the applicants, who had joined the proceedings as civil parties, could not appeal against this decision.", "33. In its country reports of the last few years, the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance at the Council of Europe (ECRI) has expressed concern about racially motivated police violence, particularly against Roma, in a number of European countries including Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, France, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia.", "34. The Report on the Situation of Fundamental Rights in the European Union and Its Member States in 2002, prepared by the European Union (EU) network of independent experts in fundamental rights at the request of the European Commission, stated, inter alia, that police abuse against Roma and similar groups, including physical abuse and excessive use of force, had been reported in a number of EU member States, such as Austria, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy and Portugal.", "35. In its second report on Greece, adopted on 10 December 1999 and published on 27 June 2000, ECRI stated, inter alia:", "\u201c26. There have been consistent reports that Roma/Gypsies, Albanians and other immigrants are frequently victims of misbehaviour on the part of the police in Greece. In particular, Roma/Gypsies are often reported to be victims of excessive use of force -- in some cases resulting in death -- ill-treatment and verbal abuse on the part of the police. Discriminatory checks involving members of these groups are widespread. In most cases there is reported to be little investigation of these cases, and little transparency on the results of these investigations. Although most of these incidents do not generally result in a complaint being filed by the victim, when charges have been pressed the victims have reportedly in some cases been subjected to pressure to drop such charges. ECRI stresses the urgent need for the improvement of the response of the internal and external control mechanisms to the complaints of misbehaviour vis \u00e0 vis members of minority groups on the part of the police. In this respect, ECRI notes with interest the recent establishment of a body to examine complaints of the most serious cases of misbehaviour on the part of the police and emphasises the importance of its independence and of its accessibility by members of minority groups.", "27. ECRI also encourages the Greek authorities to strengthen their efforts as concerns provision of initial and ongoing training of the police in human rights and anti-discrimination standards. Additional efforts should also be made to ensure recruitment of members of minority groups in the police and their permanence therein ...", "...", "31. As noted by ECRI in its first report, the Roma/Gypsy population of Greece is particularly vulnerable to disadvantage, exclusion and discrimination in many fields...", "...", "34. Roma/Gypsies are also reported to experience discrimination in various areas of public life...They also frequently experience discriminatory treatment and sometimes violence and abuse on the part of the police ...\u201d", "36. In its third report on Greece, adopted on 5 December 2003 and published on 8 June 2004, ECRI stated, inter alia:", "\u201c67. ECRI notes with concern that since the adoption of its second report on Greece, the situation of the Roma in Greece has remained fundamentally unchanged and that overall they face the same difficulties \u2013 including discrimination - in respect of housing, employment, education and access to public services...", "...", "69. ECRI welcomes the fact that the government has taken significant steps to improve the living conditions of Roma in Greece. It has set up an inter-ministerial committee for improving the living conditions of Roma...", "70. ...ECRI deplores the many cases of local authorities refusing to act in the interests of Roma when they are harassed by members of the local population. It is also common for the local authorities to refuse to grant them the rights that the law guarantees to members of the Roma community to the same extent as to any other Greek citizen...", "...", "105. ECRI expresses concern over serious allegations of ill-treatment of members of minority groups, such as Roma and both authorised and unauthorised immigrants. The ill-treatment in question ranges from racist insults to physical violence and is inflicted either at the time of arrest or during custody. ECRI is particularly concerned over the existence of widespread allegations of improper use of firearms, sometimes resulting in death. It is equally concerned over reports of ill-treatment of minors and expulsion of non-citizens outside of legal procedures.", "106. The Greek authorities have indicated that they are closely monitoring the situation and that mechanisms are in place to effectively sanction such abuses. For example, the Internal Affairs Directorate of the Greek Police was established in 1999 and is responsible for conducting investigations, particularly into acts of torture and violation of human dignity. The police \u2013specifically police officers working in another sector than that of the person under suspicion - and the prosecution equally have competence over such matters and must inform the above-mentioned body when dealing with a case in which a police officer is implicated. The Greek Ombudsman is also competent for investigating, either on request or ex officio, allegations of misbehaviour by a police officer, but he is only entitled to recommend that appropriate measures be taken. ECRI welcomes the fact that the chief state prosecutor recently reminded his subordinates of the need for cases of police ill-treatment, particularly involving non-citizens, to be prevented and prosecuted with the appropriate degree of severity. The authorities have pointed out that instances of ill-treatment were primarily due to difficult conditions of detention. ECRI notes with satisfaction cases of law enforcement officials having been prosecuted, and in some cases penalised, for acts of ill-treatment. However, human rights NGOs draw attention to other cases where impunity is allegedly enjoyed by officials responsible for acts of violence, whose prosecution has not lead to results or even been initiated. ECRI deplores such a situation and hopes that it will no longer be tolerated.\u201d", "37. In their joint report published in April 2003 (\u201cCleaning Operations \u2013 Excluding Roma in Greece\u201d), the European Roma Rights Center and the Greek Helsinki Monitor, which represent the applicants in the instant case, stated, inter alia:", "\u201cERRC/GHM monitoring of policing in Greece over the last five years suggests that ill-treatment, including physical and racist verbal abuse, of Roma in police custody is common. Although Greek authorities deny racial motivation behind the ill-treatment of Roma, Romani victims with whom ERRC/GHM spoke testified that police officers verbally abused them using racist epithets.", "Anti-Romani sentiment among police officers often leads to instances of harassment, inhuman and degrading treatment, verbal and physical abuse, and arbitrary arrest and detention of Roma at the hands of police. The ERRC and GHM regularly document ill-treatment of Roma at the hands of the police, either at the moment of arrest or in police custody. Police officers\u2019 use of racial epithets in some cases of police abuse of Roma is indicative that racial prejudice plays a role in the hostile treatment to which officers subject Roma...\u201d", "38. According to Article 2 \u00a7 1 of the Greek Constitution, the \u201cvalue of the human being\u201d is one of the fundamental principles and a \u201cprimary obligation\u201d of the Greek State.", "39. Article 5 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution reads as follows:", "\u201cAll persons living within the Greek territory shall enjoy full protection of their life, honour and liberty irrespective of nationality, race or language and of religious or political beliefs.
