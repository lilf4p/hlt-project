The applicants were born in 1959 and 1963 and live in Ljubljana and Trbovlje respectively.", "7. The applicants were detained in Ljubljana prison pending their trial. Mr Mandi\u0107 was detained in the period between 10 July 2009 and 2 February 2010 and Mr Jovi\u0107 in the period between 5 June 2009 and 13 January 2010.", "8. Ljubljana prison is the third largest prison in Slovenia. It holds sentenced prisoners, remand prisoners and prisoners in administrative detention. It has an official capacity of 128 inmates, which includes 55 places designated for prisoners on remand, who by law must be held in a separate section of the prison. In principle there are two types of cells in which the prisoners are held. Small cells measuring about 7.5 square metres (8.8 square metres including the sanitary annex) and normally containing two sleeping places, and large cells measuring 16.28 square metres (18 square metres including the sanitary annex) and normally containing six sleeping places. The windows of the cells face either west or east. Remand prisoners are held on the ground floor, which contains sixteen small and five large cells, and on the first floor, which has fourteen cells, including three small and eleven large cells. On the second floor, which contains fifteen cells, thirteen of which are large cells, both remand prisoners and sentenced prisoners are held. In the loft, which contains fourteen large cells, only sentenced prisoners seem to be held.", "9. According to the Government, plans for constructing the new prison to replace Ljubljana prison were in progress. However, completion depended on financial resources and no definite date could be given.", "10. The applicants were both detained in cell no. 100, which was situated on the first floor.", "11. The cell, with a ceiling 2.88 metres high, measured 16.28 square metres. It was equipped with three bunk beds with a total of six sleeping places, one large and one small table, six chairs and a set of cupboards for each of the detainees. The cell had four windows measuring 91x57 centimetres each, which the prisoners were free to open and close. According to the applicants, six prisoners were held in the cell in the period of their detention. The Government, however, submitted that the number varied between five and six.", "12. The cell had no artificial ventilation. It was aired by opening the windows and, also, opening the doors in the summer when the detainees were out. During the summer, the detainees were also allowed to bring in ventilators, but they rarely did so. The cell was also equipped with a functioning radiator, which the detainees were free to regulate.", "13. The applicants were allowed to bring in a small TV or, with the approval of the prison governor, radios or other electronic devices. In addition, they could borrow books from the prison library and read them in their cells.", "14. According to the data provided by the Government, the average temperature in the cells in the late afternoon (5-5.30 p.m.) in the second half of July and August 2009 was approximately 28 oC, exceeding 30 oC on seven days.", "15. The applicants received their meals in their cell.", "16. A sanitary annex, measuring 1.72 square metres, was attached to cell no. 100. It was a room with floor-to-ceiling walls and a door, equipped with one basin with warm and cold water, a toilet, a drain and a mirror. It had a functioning artificial ventilation system.", "17. The applicants had access to the shower room situated on the same floor and containing five showers with partitions. According to the Government, the applicants could use the shower for ten minutes every day in accordance with the daily schedule.", "18. Detergents and products for personal hygiene were distributed to the detainees on a weekly basis. Their bed linen was washed once a week and they were given a clean blanket on arrival at the prison. Regular everyday cleaning and thorough weekly cleaning was carried out by the prisoners under the supervision of the prison staff.", "19. In the remand section of the prison the cells were locked throughout the day. The applicants could leave the cell only for scheduled activities, such as visits, phone calls, exercising, cleaning, etc.", "20. According to the information supplied by the Government, the applicants were allowed to spend by average two hours and a half out of their cell per day. In particular, they could spend two hours per day in the outside yard, which measured 610 square metres and was not covered by any roof. It was usually used by less than 30 prisoners at a time. In addition, they could use a recreation room, measuring around 17 square metres, twice a week for one hour and also for one hour every third Sunday. This room was equipped with two benches, two exercise mats and some weights. The room had natural light. It was usually used by four prisoners simultaneously.", "21. A medical office operated in the prison subject to the general regime of the national health-care system. It was open for six hours, three times a week. A dental-care office was open once a week for six hours. A psychiatric clinic was open twice a week for half a day. The prison also employed two psychologists. All detainees underwent a medical examination upon their arrival. Detainees who were using intravenous drugs received vaccinations against hepatitis B following the standard protocol used in such cases.", "22. The prison provided the detainees with the possibility to undergo testing for hepatitis B and C and HIV. In 2009 107 detainees were tested. Five were diagnosed with Hepatitis C; other tests were negative, but one person was diagnosed with TBC.", "23. According to the prison records, none of the applicants required special medical treatment. Mr Mandi\u0107, however, visited the medical office sixteen times, including three visits to a psychiatrist. He also received dental care.

The relevant extracts from the 2nd General Report by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) (CPT/Inf (92) 3) read as follows:", "\u201c46. Overcrowding is an issue of direct relevance to the CPT\u2019s mandate. All the services and activities within a prison will be adversely affected if it is required to cater for more prisoners than it was designed to accommodate; the overall quality of life in the establishment will be lowered, perhaps significantly. Moreover, the level of overcrowding in a prison, or in a particular part of it, might be such as to be in itself inhuman or degrading from a physical standpoint.", "47. A satisfactory programme of activities (work, education, sport, etc.) is of crucial importance for the well-being of prisoners ... [P]risoners cannot simply be left to languish for weeks, possibly months, locked up in their cells, and this regardless of how good material conditions might be within the cells. The CPT considers that one should aim at ensuring that prisoners in remand establishments are able to spend a reasonable part of the day (8 hours or more) outside their cells, engaged in purposeful activity of a varied nature ...", "48. Specific mention should be made of outdoor exercise. The requirement that prisoners be allowed at least one hour of exercise in the open air every day is widely accepted as a basic safeguard ... It is also axiomatic that outdoor exercise facilities should be reasonably spacious ...", "49. Ready access to proper toilet facilities and the maintenance of good standards of hygiene are essential components of a humane environment ...", "50. The CPT would add that it is particularly concerned when it finds a combination of overcrowding, poor regime activities and inadequate access to toilet/washing facilities in the same establishment. The cumulative effect of such conditions can prove extremely detrimental to prisoners.\u201d", "39. The CPT\u2019s 7th General Report (CPT/Inf (97) 10) contains the following passage:", "\u201c13. As the CPT pointed out in its 2nd General Report, prison overcrowding is an issue of direct relevance to the Committee\u2019s mandate (cf. CPT/Inf (92) 3, paragraph 46).", "An overcrowded prison entails cramped and unhygienic accommodation; a constant lack of privacy (even when performing such basic tasks as using a sanitary facility); reduced out-of-cell activities, due to demand outstripping the staff and facilities available; overburdened health-care services; increased tension and hence more violence between prisoners and between prisoners and staff. This list is far from exhaustive.", "The CPT has been led to conclude on more than one occasion that the adverse effects of overcrowding have resulted in inhuman and degrading conditions of detention ...\u201d", "40. The CPT\u2019s 11th General Report (CPT/Inf (2001) 16) provides:", "\u201c28. The phenomenon of prison overcrowding continues to blight penitentiary systems across Europe and seriously undermines attempts to improve conditions of detention. The negative effects of prison overcrowding have already been highlighted in previous General Reports ...", "29. In a number of countries visited by the CPT, particularly in central and eastern Europe, inmate accommodation often consists of large-capacity dormitories which contain all or most of the facilities used by prisoners on a daily basis, such as sleeping and living areas as well as sanitary facilities. The CPT has objections to the very principle of such accommodation arrangements in closed prisons and those objections are reinforced when, as is frequently the case, the dormitories in question are found to hold prisoners under extremely cramped and insalubrious conditions ...", "Large-capacity dormitories inevitably imply a lack of privacy for prisoners in their everyday lives... All these problems are exacerbated when the numbers held go beyond a reasonable occupancy level; further, in such a situation the excessive burden on communal facilities such as washbasins or lavatories and the insufficient ventilation for so many persons will often lead to deplorable conditions.\u201d", "41. The CPT visited Ljubljana prison in 1995 and 2001. During its most recent visit in 2006 the CPT visited the remand section of Ljubljana prison.", "42. In 1995 the number of prisoners held in the prison was 188 prisoners, which is significantly lower than it is currently (see document CPT/Inf (96) 18). Following the visit in 2001, the following recommendations were made to the Slovenian authorities (CPT/Inf (2002) 36):", "\u201cii. Ljubljana prison", "59. ... the CPT reiterates its recommendation that efforts be made to reduce to a maximum of four the number of prisoners held in the cells measuring 18 m\u00b2, and to accommodate only one prisoner in each cell measuring 8 m\u00b2.\u201d", "43. Following the visit in 2006, the following observations were made to the Slovenian authorities in respect of the remand section of Ljubljana prison (CPT/Inf (2008) 7):", "\u201c48. The objective of the 2006 follow-up visit to the Ljubljana Prison was to examine measures taken by the Slovenian authorities aimed to implement the CPT\u2019s recommendations with respect to remand prisoners. It should be stated from the outset that the CPT is concerned by the lack of progress as regards remand prisoners\u2019 conditions of detention.", "49. With an official capacity of 73, the remand section of the Ljubljana prison was accommodating 123 persons (including three juveniles) at the time of the visit [the whole establishment was accommodating 238 prisoners (with an official capacity of 128)]. Prisoners continued to be accommodated under cramped conditions, with generally five persons in 18 m\u00b2 cells and two persons in cells measuring 8 m\u00b2 (including the sanitary annexe). Naturally, this situation had negative repercussions for all aspects of life, both for prisoners and staff. The CPT calls upon the Slovenian authorities to implement its long-standing recommendation to reduce cell occupancy rates at Ljubljana prison. Cells measuring 18 m\u00b2 should not accommodate more than four prisoners, and the 8 m\u00b2 cells should preferably not accommodate more than one prisoner.", "...", "50. At the time of the 1995 and 2001 visits, Ljubljana prison was not in a position to offer remand prisoners anything which remotely resembled a programme of activities. Apart from two hours of daily outdoor exercise and access to a recreation room twice a week, the vast majority of those prisoners spent up to 22 hours a day confined to cramped cells, their only distraction being watching television, listening to the radio or reading books or newspapers. Regrettably, the situation observed in 2006 was hardly any different. The only positive developments concerned increased access to the recreation room (one-hour sessions three times a week) and the installation of a table tennis table in the exercise yard. Only five prisoners were provided with work and two had access to education. The CPT reiterates its recommendation that the Slovenian authorities intensify their efforts to develop a programme of activities for remand prisoners at Ljubljana prison. As stressed by the Committee in previous visit reports, the aim should be to ensure that those prisoners are able to spend a reasonable part of the day outside their cells engaged in purposeful activities of a varied nature (work; education; sport; recreation/association) ...", "...", "86. In respect of remand prisoners, the CPT is pleased that the Slovenian authorities have implemented its recommendation made in the 2001 visit report, enabling remand prisoners to receive open visits from their relatives (e.g. without a glass partition). However, material conditions in the visiting facilities at Ljubljana prison remained unsatisfactory; especially, they offered little privacy to inmates and visitors and were insufficient for the number of prisoners held.", "...", "88. At all the establishments visited, sentenced prisoners had adequate access to telephones. The situation was less favourable in respect of remand prisoners. Although entitled to a 10-minute conversation every week, a number of them complained that their calls were in practice shorter.

According to the Annual reports issued by the Administration for the Execution of Penal Sentences, the remand section of Ljubljana prison held on average 148 remand prisoners in 2009 (2009 Report, 9. 31) and 139 remand prisoners in 2010 (2010 Report, p. 31).", "45. In the chapter concerning the living conditions in Slovenian prisons, the reports include information on prison overcrowding. The rate of overcrowding is calculated on the basis of the domestic statutory requirement for the imprisonment of sentenced individuals, which is 9 square metres for a single occupancy cell and 7 square metres per person in a shared cell. According to the 2009 and 2010 reports nationwide prison occupancy exceeded the official capacity by 29 and 23 percent respectively. Almost all closed prison facilities accommodating male prisoners were overcrowded. The Ljubljana prison was the most overcrowded prison in Slovenia in 2009 and 2010. With an official capacity of 128 prisoners, it held 261 and 245 prisoners in 2009 and 2010 respectively. This meant that the level of overcrowding was 204 and 191 percent respectively (2009 Report, pp. 97 and 98; 2010 Report, pp. 98 and 99). According to the 2008 Report, the level of overcrowding in 2007 and 2008 was 200 and 196 percent respectively (p. 98). These figures include both sentenced and remand prisoners.", "46. The 2010 Report noted that in respect of Ljubljana prison the maximum number of prisoners allowed was set at 245; if this number was exceeded the prison administration was required to institute a transfer procedure (p. 100). The report also noted (p. 100):", "\u201c... Poor living conditions are coupled with overcrowding, which is most present in the large prisons in Slovenia, Dob, Ljubljana and Maribor. The urgency of improving living conditions has been stressed by the Human Rights Ombudsman the CPT and other institutions.", "... It is understandable that such living conditions adversely affect prisoners\u2019 hygiene and privacy. Poor living conditions sometimes also obstruct the exercise of prisoners\u2019 rights (work, exercise and recreation, religious ceremonies). In some establishments, prisoners on remand live in worse conditions than sentenced prisoners. The outdated and inadequate furniture in living rooms and other areas presents an additional problem ...\u201d", "47. On 17 and 18 February 2009 the Human Rights Ombudsman conducted a visit to Ljubljana prison in her capacity as a \u201cnational preventive mechanism\u201d under the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cthe Optional Protocol\u201d). The report published following the visit reads as follows:", "\u201cOfficial capacity is still 128 prisoners. This includes 55 places designated for prisoners on remand, 65 places for sentenced prisoners and 8 places for prisoners in administrative detention. On the day of the visit, the prison held 254 prisoners (126 prisoners on remand, 126 sentenced prisoners and two prisoners in administrative detention). The official capacity was therefore exceeded by 98%.", "... the prison administration has replied that in the present circumstances all realistic possibilities for reducing the occupancy level have been exhausted ... The Ministry has also warned that the conditions are unacceptable and the Government should be aware of the problem ... As regards the information about the construction of a new prison, the prison administration has stated that it is not realistic to expect the construction to be completed in a short time ...", "We are therefore not surprised that in all the cells the number of beds has only increased since our last visit ...", "... In the light of the critical overcrowding and all the consequences which relate to it, we consider the conditions unacceptable.", "The prison still does not have a special drug-free unit. ... The prison administration said that in the current overcrowding conditions it is impossible to organise such a unit. The administration estimated that about 50% of the prison population have drugrelated problems. ...", "Smoking is allowed only in the cells, whereas the prison does not have permanent smoking or non-smoking cells. Efforts are made to separate the smoking and nonsmoking prisoners, but due to overcrowding this is often very difficult or impossible. ...", "Prisoners on remand are locked in their cells for on average more than 21 hours a day. The only everyday activity outside cells is exercise in the small internal courtyard ... However, a roof has still not been constructed to allow the use of the courtyard in bad weather as well. This has not been improved due to lack of financial means.
