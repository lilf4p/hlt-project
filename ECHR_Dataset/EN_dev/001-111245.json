Germany, nos. 45749/06 and 51115/06, \u00a7 87, 22 January 2009). In criminal cases the courts may either afford compensation by declaring that a specified part of the sentence had to be considered as having already been served or they may terminate proceedings with the consent of the prosecution.", "33.

Germany (no. 1), no. 10597/03, \u00a7 67 et seq., 13 November 2008), the provisions of section 198 CCA apply (see official motivation of the draft law: record of Bundestag 17/3802 page 24) and redress will be granted by monetary compensation.", "34.
