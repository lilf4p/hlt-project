The applicants were born in 1959 and 2003 respectively and live in Lausanne (Canton of Vaud).", "16. The facts as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows.", "17. The first applicant, who refers to herself as Jewish, decided to settle in Israel in 1999. There she met an Israeli national, who is also Jewish, and they were married on 23 October 2001 in Israel. They had a son, Noam, who was born in Tel Aviv on 10 June 2003. He has Israeli and Swiss nationality.", "18. According to the applicants, in the autumn of 2003 the child\u2019s father joined the Jewish \u201cLubavitch\u201d movement, which they have described as an ultra-orthodox, radical movement that is known for its zealous proselytising.", "19. Marital difficulties then arose, and the first applicant, fearing that her husband would take their son to a \u201cChabad-Lubavitch\u201d community abroad for religious indoctrination, applied to the Tel Aviv Family Court for a ne exeat order to prevent Noam\u2019s removal from Israel. On 20 June 2004 the court made a ne exeat order that was to expire when the child attained his majority, that is to say on 10 June 2021, unless annulled by the court in the meantime.", "20. In an interim decision of 27 June 2004, the same court granted \u201ctemporary custody\u201d of the child to the mother and requested the Tel Aviv social services to draw up an urgent welfare report. The \u201cguardianship\u201d of the child was to be exercised jointly by both parents.", "21. In a decision of 17 November 2004, the court, on the recommendation of a social worker, confirmed the first applicant\u2019s custody of the child and granted a right of visitation to the father.", "22. On 10 January 2005 the Israeli social services were obliged to intervene. They instructed the parents to live apart, in the interest of the child. The letter they sent to the parents read as follows:", "\u201c1. We take the view that to maintain a common home and live, as you have been doing, under the same roof is not in the child\u2019s interest \u2013 and that is an understatement. It appears to us that the environment of constant recrimination and invective created by Shai against Isabelle has caused her permanent stress that may prevent her from fulfilling her role as a mother, when she is already faced with the need to find a job in order to support herself and pay the rent. It should be noted that Shai pays neither the maintenance ordered by the court nor the rent.", "We felt that some of Shai\u2019s recriminations verged on the absurd. He has decided that the child\u2019s illness, like the glandular fever and the epileptic fit that the child has suffered, are the mother\u2019s fault. Shai persists in asserting that Isabelle \u2018is not a good mother\u2019; he does not accept the fact that the child attends nursery school, and claims that the medical certificates are insufficient. We advise Shai to speak to the doctors who are treating the child.", "Although he is maintained by Isabelle, Shai demands that the food complies to a very strict degree with Jewish dietary laws, observing one dietary rule or another ...", "There is no doubt that living apart will resolve some of these problems.", "We find that Shai creates a hostile environment at home \u2013 an atmosphere of verbal aggression and threats that terrorise the mother.", "In the light of the foregoing, we cannot but find that the mother is exposed to mental harassment and that the maintaining of a common home is harmful to the child.", "2. Under the powers conferred on us by sections 19 and 68 of the Law on legal capacity, we reiterate our warning to Shai, calling on him not to take his child with him to engage in religious proselytising on the public highway, where he encourages passers-by to put on phylacteries and collects donations.", "Likewise, the father is requested not to take the child with him to the synagogue for a whole day at a time.", "We emphasise that the provisions on access in respect of the child are intended to bring father and child together for their common activities, and not for other purposes.\u201d", "23. That same day, the first applicant filed a complaint with the police accusing her husband of assault.", "24. In an injunction of 12 January 2005 the competent judge of the Tel Aviv Family Court, upon an urgent application lodged earlier that day by the first applicant, prohibited the father from entering the child\u2019s nursery school or the first applicant\u2019s flat, from disturbing or harassing her in any manner whatsoever, and from carrying or possessing a weapon. Restrictions were also imposed on the access right granted to the father, who was now authorised to see the child only twice a week under the supervision of the social services at a contact centre in Tel Aviv.", "25. The couple\u2019s divorce was pronounced on 10 February 2005 with no change in the attribution of guardianship.", "26. As the father had defaulted on his maintenance payments to the first applicant, an arrest warrant was issued against him on 20 March 2005.", "27. In a decision of 27 March 2005, a judge of the Tel Aviv Family Court dismissed an application lodged by the first applicant for the annulment of the ne exeat order prohibiting the removal of the second applicant from Israel. The judge found, in particular, that there was a serious risk that the mother would not return to Israel with the child after visiting her family abroad, in view of the fact that she had no ties in that country.", "28. On 24 June 2005 the first applicant secretly left Israel for Switzerland with her son.", "29. On 27 June 2005 Noam\u2019s father contacted the Israeli Central Authority, which was unable to locate the child until 21 May 2006, when Interpol Jerusalem forwarded him a note from Interpol Berne indicating that the first applicant was in Switzerland.", "30. On 22 May 2006 the Israeli Ministry of Justice transmitted to the Swiss Federal Office of Justice an application for the return of the child pursuant to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction of 25 October 1980 (the \u201cHague Convention\u201d; see paragraph 57 below). In support of its application it indicated, among other things, that Interpol Berne had notified it only the day before that Noam and his mother were living in Lausanne and that the latter had applied for the renewal of her Swiss passport.", "31. In a decision of 30 May 2006, delivered upon an application by the child\u2019s father, the Tel Aviv Family Court observed that the child was habitually resident in Tel Aviv and that, as of 24 June 2005, the date of the applicants\u2019 departure, the parents had been joint guardians of their son, with the mother having temporary custody and the father a right of access. The court held that the child\u2019s removal from Israel without the father\u2019s consent had been wrongful within the meaning of Article 3 of the Hague Convention.", "32. On 8 June 2006 the child\u2019s father lodged an application with the Lausanne District Justice of the Peace seeking an order for his son\u2019s return to Israel. He requested in particular, as an extremely urgent measure, that the Lausanne Passport Office be ordered to retain the applicants\u2019 Swiss passports.", "33. On 12 June 2006 the Justice of the Peace made an order allowing the application by Noam\u2019s father for an extremely urgent measure.", "34. Following a new application for an extremely urgent measure, faxed by the child\u2019s father on 27 June 2006, the Justice of the Peace, in a provisional-measures order made that same day, ordered the first applicant to deposit her passport and that of Noam immediately with the court registry of the Justice of the Peace, on pain of criminal sanctions for refusal to comply with the decision of an authority.", "35. The first applicant, assisted by counsel, and the legal representative of the father, whose obligation to appear in person had been waived, made representations to the Justice of the Peace on 18 July 2006.", "36. In a decision of 29 August 2006, after a hearing, the father\u2019s application was dismissed by the Lausanne District Justice of the Peace. The court took the view that, whilst the child\u2019s removal had been wrongful within the meaning of Article 3 of the Hague Convention, it had to apply Article 13, sub-paragraph (b), of that Convention, as there was a grave risk that the child\u2019s return would expose him to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place him in an intolerable situation.", "37. On 25 September 2006 the father appealed against that decision before the Guardianship Division (chambre des tutelles) of the Vaud Cantonal Court, which ordered an expert\u2019s report and for that purpose appointed Dr B., a paediatrician and child psychiatrist. In his report, delivered on 16 April 2007, he stated that the child\u2019s return to Israel with his mother would expose him to a risk of psychological harm whose intensity could not be assessed without ascertaining the conditions of that return, in particular the conditions awaiting the mother and their potential repercussions for the child; that the return of the child without his mother would expose him to a risk of major psychological harm; and that the maintaining of the status quo would also represent for the child a risk of major psychological harm in the long term.", "38. On 30 November 2006 the competent court in Tel Aviv cancelled an indictment for domestic violence that the second wife of Noam\u2019s father had initiated, as she had left the country.", "39. In a letter of 12 March 2007, in connection with the proceedings to secure the child\u2019s return, the Israeli Central Authority made the following observations to its Swiss counterpart:", "\u201cWe acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 7 February 2007. We wish to respond to the questions raised in that letter as follows:", "Mr Shuruk states that in the event that the mother refuses to return to Israel, he will take care of the child. He currently lives in an apartment with a roommate, however if the child is returned to Israel, he states that he will immediately secure an apartment to live in with the child. He is currently working and studying at an institution for religious learning, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. The child would be in day care/nursery school during those hours. Mr Shuruk points out that prior to the child\u2019s abduction to Switzerland, he was in day care as the mother worked. Mr Shuruk advises that his extended family would provide a back-up system for him in the event that he would need assistance from time to time.", "The Appeal Court in Switzerland has raised a concern as to how Mr Shuruk can care for the child when his right of access has been restricted. As we stated in our letter to your office dated 28 September 2006, it must be remembered that according to the report of the social worker in Israel, the father and child had a wonderful relationship. There were plans to expand the visitation, to include overnight visits, however these plans were interrupted as a result of the mother\u2019s abduction of the child. If the mother were to refuse to return to Israel with the child, she would in effect be agreeing to the father having de facto custody, and Mr Shuruk could apply to the Israeli court to grant an order reflecting the new reality.", "You further asked what steps could be taken to protect the mother should she return, given her allegations of violence on the part of Mr Shuruk. Mr Shuruk denies all such allegations. Furthermore, we are attaching a copy of the decision of the Tel Aviv Magistrate\u2019s Court dated 30 November 2006, together with a translation into English. This decision concerned an indictment filed against Mr Shuruk for allegations of assault by his second wife. As you can see, the complainant apparently left Israel and could not be located, therefore the court cancelled the indictment against Mr Shuruk.", "In any event, we wish to draw your attention to the law in Israel that provides protection in cases of allegations of family violence; that law is the Prevention of Family Violence Law 1991. We are attaching a translation of that law into English, and an unofficial translation into French. Section 2 provides for protection orders that can be made. Therefore, if the mother has any concerns for her safety, she can apply to the court in Israel and request any necessary protection. Her allegations should not constitute a basis for the Swiss court to refuse to return the child to Israel.", "You informed us that the court ordered a psychological evaluation of the child. We must express our concern in this respect. Such evaluation was not ordered by the lower court, and we wish to inquire as to why it has been ordered at this late stage. It must be remembered that the child was abducted by the mother in June 2005. The child has not seen his father in almost two years. During this period he has been subject to the sole influence of the mother. We therefore question what can be gained by a psychological evaluation of the child. It must be remembered that this is a Hague Convention proceeding, and not a custody case. It seems that the mother is trying to prove that the child will be psychologically damaged by being separated from her if he is returned to Israel. However this can be avoided if the mother will act in the child\u2019s best interests and return with him. As we stated in our letter of 28 September 2006, the mother does not appear to have any justifiable reason under the Hague Convention to prevent her return ...\u201d", "40. In a letter of 30 April 2007 to the lawyer acting for Noam\u2019s father, the Israeli Central Authority made the following observations on the question whether the first applicant would be prosecuted or imprisoned if she returned to Israel:", "\u201c... You have requested that we inform you as to the legal consequences that would face the mother, Isabelle Neulinger, should she return to Israel with the child, as a result of the act of abduction of the child.", "In terms of criminal consequences for the act of abduction, abduction is an offence under Israel\u2019s Penal Law 1977 and carries a possible penalty of imprisonment. However, according to the guidelines of the State Attorney of Israel, upon receipt of a criminal complaint of parental abduction, the police are to forward the matter to the Central Authority under the Hague Convention for guidelines as to how to proceed in the matter. The State Attorney\u2019s guidelines provide that criminal proceedings should be commenced only in very exceptional circumstances. In Ms Neulinger\u2019s case, should she comply with an order to return the child to Israel, not disappear with the child upon her arrival to Israel, cooperate with the Israeli authorities and comply with the existing court order for supervised visitation by Mr Shuruk (pending any further decision), the Central Authority for Israel would positively consider instructing the Israel Police to close the criminal file for lack of public interest, provided that Ms Neulinger not commit further acts of abjection with respect to the child.", "In terms of civil consequences, we can inform you that the sole consideration in both the Israeli civil courts and Rabbinical courts, when deciding matters such as custody and access, is the best interests of the child ...\u201d", "41. In a judgment of 22 May 2007, the Guardianship Division of the Vaud Cantonal Court dismissed the father\u2019s appeal. Having carried out an additional investigation, and taking into account the expert\u2019s report by Dr B. of 16 April 2007, it took the view that the child\u2019s return carried a grave risk of psychological harm, whether or not he was accompanied by his mother, and would also place him in an intolerable situation. It therefore considered that the conditions of Article 13, sub-paragraph (b), of the Hague Convention were met. Finding, however, that the child could not be deprived of all relations with his father, it prescribed measures with a view to rebuilding the personal relationship between them. Its judgment read as follows:", "\u201c4. (d) ... In response to the questions put to him, expert B. ... states in his conclusions that Noam\u2019s return to Israel with his mother would expose him to psychological harm, the intensity of which cannot be assessed without knowledge of the conditions of such return, in particular those awaiting his mother and the repercussions which they might have on the child; as regards the child\u2019s return to Israel without his mother, [the expert] is of the opinion that it would expose him to major psychological harm, as described in detail in the report. In the \u2018discussion\u2019 part of his report the expert emphasises that Noam\u2019s situation seems at present to be completely blocked. On the one hand, given his young age and his complete lack of recollection of his first years in Israel, including of his father, any visit to that country without his mother, even a brief visit, and even if the legal situation allowed it, would be psychologically highly traumatic, involving extreme separation-related anxiety and a major risk of severe depression. On the other hand, the possibility of the mother\u2019s return to Israel with Noam, even for a short period, is totally out of the question for the mother. In answer to the question whether Noam\u2019s return to Israel might place the child in an intolerable situation, the expert replied that it was \u2018clearly\u2019 the conditions of the child\u2019s possible return to Israel that would or would not render the situation intolerable. He observed that, likewise, it was the conditions of his continuing residence in Switzerland that would or would not render his situation there intolerable and that the maintaining of the status quo represented a long-term major psychological risk for the child, with the result that, if there were no understanding between his parents, an agreement would urgently be required between the child protection services of the States of the parents\u2019 residence in order to make up for their failure to act.", "In accordance with Article 13, third paragraph, of the Hague Convention, this court also requested the Israeli Central Authority to provide information about the child\u2019s social background, by answering the following questions: \u2018in the event that, as she has stated, the mother does not return to Israel, who will take care of the child and where will he stay? As the father does not appear to be in gainful employment, who will provide for the child\u2019s upkeep? As the right of access has been restricted by judicial decisions, what measures will be taken to ensure that the exercise of the right of access does not harm the child\u2019s physical and psychological welfare?\u2019 In its letter of 12 March 2007 the Israeli Central Authority did not really answer the questions put to it, so it is impossible to be satisfied about the interests of the child. The Central Authority merely mentioned the appellant\u2019s intentions concerning his son if his son should return to Israel without his mother, in the following terms: \u2018[I]n the event that Noam\u2019s mother refuses to return to Israel, the father will take care of the child. He currently lives in an apartment with a roommate; however if the child is returned to Israel, he states that he will immediately secure an apartment to live in with the child. He is currently working and studying at an institution for religious learning, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. The child would be in day care/nursery school during those hours. Mr Shuruk points out that prior to the child\u2019s abduction to Switzerland, he was in day care as the mother worked. Mr Shuruk advises that his extended family would provide a back-up system for him in the event that he needs assistance from time to time.\u2019 As to the issue of how Shai Shuruk would be able to take care of the child, given that he has only a restricted right of access, the Israeli Central Authority emphasised: \u2018As we stated in our findings of 28 September 2006, according to the report of the social worker in Israel, the father and child had a wonderful relationship. There were plans to expand the visitation, to include overnight visits; however these plans were interrupted as a result of the mother\u2019s abduction of the child.\u2019 The Israeli Central Authority concluded that \u2018[i]f the mother were to refuse to return to Israel with the child, she would in effect be agreeing to the father having de facto custody, and Mr Shuruk could apply to the Israeli court to grant an order reflecting the new reality\u2019.", "It should be noted that neither the conclusions of the child psychiatrist\u2019s report nor the information provided by the Israeli Central Authority are conducive to Noam\u2019s return to Israel. Not only would such a return entail a grave risk of exposure to psychological harm, whether or not he is accompanied by his mother, it would also place him again in an intolerable situation. Firstly, the psychiatric expert observes that if the child returns to Israel with his mother, he will risk being exposed to psychological harm whose intensity cannot be assessed without knowledge of the conditions of that return. In that connection, the Guardianship Division is of the opinion that, since the child\u2019s removal to Israel, even if his mother accompanies him, may expose the child to psychological harm and since, unlike the \u2018classic scenario\u2019 envisaged by the Hague Convention, the respondent has custody of her son, she cannot reasonably be required to return to Israel. An additional factor is that the mother\u2019s return to Israel would also undermine the child\u2019s economic security, since the mother would be required to find a job there, in order to provide not only for her own needs but also for those of her son. The fact that the appellant has never provided for his child\u2019s upkeep and that he is known to earn only 300 [Swiss] francs per month cannot be disregarded when the interests of the child are taken into consideration in that context. Lastly, it must be considered that the requirement of the mother\u2019s return is disproportionate to the reason for the return: the object of the Hague Convention is to put the child back into the legal situation in which he was before he was abducted. However, the present return is requested in order to allow the appellant to exercise his right to a personal relationship, a right which is shown to have been exercised before the child\u2019s departure under the supervision of the social services in the form of two weekly meetings of two hours each. To require a mother to uproot herself in order to permit the exercise of such a restricted right of access, when the child\u2019s return certainly entails a risk of grave psychological harm, in view of the conditions of insecurity in which the return will take place, constitutes an intolerable situation for the child within the meaning of Article 13, sub-paragraph (b), of the Hague Convention.", "As to Noam\u2019s return to Israel without his mother, the expert is of the opinion that it would be psychologically highly traumatic, involving extreme separation anxiety and a major risk of severe depression, which can be explained by his young age and his total lack of recollection of his first years in Israel, including of his father. That element is sufficient for a finding that the condition laid down in Article 13, sub-paragraph (b), is satisfied. In addition, the information provided by the Israeli Central Authority about the arrangements envisaged in the event that the child returns without his mother are, at the very least, a matter for concern: although the appellant has, legally speaking, only a very restricted right of access, under supervision, it is envisaged, according to the information provided by the Central Authority, that the appellant will take his son home (without any guarantee that he will by then have an individual flat) and will thus have de facto custody. In that connection, the Israeli Central Authority claims that by refusing to return to Israel with her son, the respondent is implicitly acquiescing in that change of situation \u2013 a new reality of which the appellant will then seek validation by the Israeli judicial authorities. That does not correspond to the aim pursued by the Hague Convention, which provides for the immediate return of the unlawfully removed child in order to put it back in the status quo ante. Such a return cannot therefore be ordered on the basis of the Hague Convention, and it is emphasised that there is no doubt that Noam\u2019s return to Israel in such circumstances would definitely expose him to a risk of major psychological harm, owing not only to the fact that he would be abruptly separated from his mother, when she has been his principal parental reference since he was born and has been the only one to provide for his upkeep, but also to the fact that he will be just as abruptly faced with a father of whose existence he has just learnt. In the light of the foregoing, the appeal on this point must be dismissed. ...", "5. ... In the present case, it is apparent from the file that Noam Shuruk has lived with his mother, who has custody of him, for at least one year in Lausanne. Thus, the Justice of the Peace of the District of Lausanne had jurisdiction, ratione loci and ratione materiae, to take the disputed protective measure. As to the merits, it is sufficient to state that, since the child has no recollection of his father, owing to the process of physiological amnesia attributable to his very young age, there are valid grounds for avoiding an abrupt reunion, as the welfare of the child requires that the resumption of a personal relationship with his father should take place calmly and gradually, after he has been properly prepared for that new situation, as may be seen from the expert\u2019s convincing submissions on that point. The ground of appeal is therefore ill-founded and must be rejected ...\u201d", "42. The father lodged a civil appeal with the Federal Court seeking the quashing of the Cantonal Court\u2019s judgment and the return of the child to Israel. He alleged that the court had misapplied Article 13, sub-paragraph (b), of the Hague Convention, principally, and Article 3 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, secondarily.", "43. In a decision of 27 June 2007, the President of the appropriate division of the Federal Court granted the father\u2019s request for immediate suspension of the judgment.", "44. In a judgment of 16 August 2007, served on the first applicant\u2019s lawyer on 21 September 2007, the Federal Court allowed the father\u2019s appeal. The relevant passages of its judgment read as follows:", "\u201c3. The object of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any Contracting State (Article 1, sub-paragraph (a)). The removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person, an institution or any other body, either jointly or alone, under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention (Article 3, sub-paragraph (a)). \u2018Rights of custody\u2019 include rights relating to the care of the person of the child and, in particular, the right to determine the child\u2019s place of residence (Article 5 (a)). In the present case it is not in dispute that the child\u2019s removal to Switzerland was wrongful, since the father retained, jointly with the respondent, the right of \u2018guardianship\u2019, which under Israeli law includes the right to decide on the child\u2019s residence. Moreover, since the application for return was presented within a period of one year after the removal, the respondent cannot deny either that, in principle, pursuant to Article 12 of the Hague Convention, the child\u2019s prompt return should be ordered. The only matter in dispute is therefore the question whether an exception to that return may be applied under Article 13, sub-paragraph (b), of the Hague Convention.", "4. According to the appellant, by refusing to order the child\u2019s return to Israel, the Cantonal Court misapplied Article 13, sub-paragraph (b), of the Hague Convention.", "4.1 Under Article 13, sub-paragraph (b), of the Hague Convention, in respect of which the Federal Court is entitled to examine matters of compliance freely (section 95(b) of the Federal Court Act), the judicial authority of the requested State is not bound to order the child\u2019s return when the person opposing that return establishes that there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.", "The exceptions to return provided for under Article 13 of the Hague Convention must be interpreted restrictively; the parent who has abducted the child cannot take advantage of his or her unlawful conduct (judgment 5P.71/2003 of 27 March 2003, recital 2.2, in FamPra.ch 2003, p. 718). Only grave risks must be taken into consideration, excluding any grounds relating to the parents\u2019 child-rearing capacities, as the purpose of the Hague Convention is not to attribute parental authority (Federal Court judgment 131 III 334, recital 5.3; 123 II 419, recital 2b, p. 425). An exception to return under Article 13, sub-paragraph (b), of the Hague Convention, is therefore not open to consideration unless the child\u2019s intellectual, physical, moral or social development is under serious threat (judgment 5P.65/2002 of 11 April 2002, recital 4c/bb, in FamPra.ch 2002, p. 620 and the reference cited therein). The burden of proof lies with the person who opposes the child\u2019s return (ibid., recital 4b, in FamPra.ch 2002, p. 620 and the reference cited therein).", "4.2 The Cantonal Court observed that the case concerned a very young child in the custody of his mother, who had always provided for him. The father, for his part, lived in a religious community where he was fed, and from his activity as a sports and art teacher he had a monthly income of only 300 [Swiss] francs. The custody of the child had been withdrawn from him on account of the atmosphere of fear that he had created at the family home. For the same reason, the Israeli courts ordered him to live separately and prohibited him from approaching the mother\u2019s flat. Before the child\u2019s removal to Switzerland he had only had a restricted right of visitation, limited to two hours twice a week, under the supervision of the Israeli social services. Concerning the conditions of a possible return of the child without his mother, according to the information provided by the Israeli Ministry of Justice on 12 March 2007, the father, who now shares a flat with one other tenant and still works in an institution for religious education, would be prepared to take care of the child. Taking into account the laconic and not very reassuring nature of this information, together with the expert\u2019s report by Dr ..., a psychiatrist, the Cantonal Court considered that a return to Israel involved a risk of psychological harm for the child and might place him in an intolerable situation, whether or not he was accompanied by his mother. The court added that, in view of the father\u2019s low income, the return to Israel of the respondent would also undermine the child\u2019s economic stability and the mother would have to find a job in order to provide for them both.", "In his appeal, the appellant does not criticise the Cantonal Court\u2019s finding that there was a grave risk that the child would be exposed to psychological harm if he returned to Israel without his mother. He is of the opinion, however, that such a risk would not exist if the child\u2019s mother accompanied him to Israel, as could be reasonably expected of her. As regards that latter hypothesis, the judgment of the Cantonal Court fails to provide any evidence of such a grave risk of harm, or of any intolerable situation for the child. The expert psychiatrist failed, in particular, to address that question, simply explaining that the risk could not be assessed without ascertaining the conditions of a possible return. As to the appellant\u2019s aggressive behaviour towards the respondent, it does not appear from the Cantonal Court\u2019s judgment that the child would be threatened directly or indirectly as a result of witnessing such violence against his mother. She stated that the father had complied with the arrangements for his right of visitation and that the visits had gone well. The social worker appointed to supervise the right of visitation had described as \u2018wonderful\u2019 the father-son relationship as established just before the child\u2019s abduction by his mother. She has not claimed that the appellant breached the judicial instructions which required him not to approach her flat or to disturb and/or harass her. As to the considerations relating to the father\u2019s low income and his ties with the \u2018Lubavitch\u2019 religious community, as they stand they do not indicate a grave risk that the child would be exposed to harm within the meaning of Article 13, sub-paragraph (b), of the Hague Convention. Whilst such considerations may help to determine which of the two parents offers the best child-rearing capacities for the purpose of deciding on the attribution of the right of custody \u2013 a matter that is decided by the judicial authorities of the place of habitual residence (Article 16 of the Hague Convention) \u2013 they are not pertinent, however, for a decision about the return of a child after a wrongful abduction (see recital 4.1 above).", "As to the mother\u2019s threat not to return to Israel, the judgment of the Cantonal Court did not deal at all with the reasons for her refusal, whereas it should have established the existence of objective circumstances justifying that attitude. The Cantonal Court judges quoted the expert psychiatrist who had referred to the \u2018judicial risks\u2019 that would be entailed in the event of a return to Israel, without any indication as to whether the respondent actually faced a prison sentence as a result of the abduction. Supposing that such a risk were proven, she could not be expected to return to Israel with the child \u2013 and that would accordingly rule out the return of [the child] in view of the major psychological harm that would be caused to him by the separation from his mother. She made no comment on that question in her reply to the Federal Court; in particular, she has not claimed that immediate imprisonment, or even any criminal sanction at all, would be imposed on her. Neither has she argued that in the event of her return to Israel it would be impossible or very difficult for her to integrate, or, in particular, to find a new job. Consequently, it cannot be said that the mother\u2019s return, and therefore that of the child, would be unbearable for economic reasons either. Therefore, as the respondent has failed to establish the existence of reasons that would objectively justify a refusal on her part to return to Israel, it must be accepted that she could reasonably be expected to return to that State of origin accompanied by the child. In these circumstances, it is of no import that the information provided by the Israeli Central Authority (see recital 4.2 above) on which the Cantonal Court based, in particular, its justification of the exception to the child\u2019s return as provided for by Article 13, sub-paragraph (b), of the Hague Convention, was deemed not very reassuring, because that information was based only on the hypothesis of the child\u2019s return without his mother.", "Accordingly, the Cantonal Court judges breached Article 13, sub-paragraph (b), of the Hague Convention in finding that they were entitled to apply an exception to the child\u2019s return to the State of his habitual residence. The appeal must therefore be allowed and the judgment of the court below quashed, without it being necessary to examine the complaint concerning a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It is incumbent on the respondent to secure the return of the child ... to Israel by the end of September 2007. ...", "The Federal Court therefore finds as follows:", "1. The appeal is allowed and the judgment of the court below is quashed.", "2. The respondent is ordered to secure the return of the child ... to Israel by the end of September 2007.", "...\u201d", "45. On 20 August 2007 the child\u2019s father, through counsel, lodged an application with the Lausanne District Justice of the Peace, who was responsible for the enforcement of the return decision, seeking the appointment of an ad hoc administrator for the child who would be entrusted with the organisation of his departure. On 1 October 2007 he withdrew that application after the Court had decided, on 27 September 2007, to indicate interim measures to the Government.", "46. Subsequently, the applicants transmitted to the Court a medical certificate issued on 23 February 2009 by Dr M.-A., a paediatrician in Lausanne, which reads as follows:", "\u201cI, the undersigned, certify that I have seen the child Noam Shuruk, born on 10 June 2003, on a number of occasions since 7 October 2005.", "On each occasion Noam has been accompanied by his mother, with whom he has a very good relationship.", "His behaviour is appropriate and his level of psychomotor development and language are above average.

"Consequently, the child now has a stable relationship only with his mother.", "It is therefore appropriate to allow her application and to decide provisionally that Noam should reside in Lausanne, Switzerland, at the place of his habitual residence, with his mother.", "Article 273 \u00a7 1 of the Civil Code provides that the father or mother not having parental authority or custody and the minor are reciprocally entitled to maintain such personal relations as may be appropriate in the circumstances.", "The right to personal relations is intended to preserve the bond between parents and children ...", "The maintaining and development of this bond is obviously beneficial to the child.", "Personal relations must accordingly be fostered, unless the child\u2019s welfare is endangered.",

most important assessment criterion (see Federal Court judgment 127 III 295, \u0441 4a).", "The entitled person\u2019s situation and interests should also be taken into consideration: his or her

respondent, could only be gradual.", "The respondent\u2019s place of residence is currently unknown.", "In the circumstances it appears appropriate to order the provisional suspension of the respondent\u2019s access rights in respect of his son Noam.", "The applicant requests that \u2018parental authority in respect of Noam, born on 10 June 2003, be exclusively and provisionally granted

has no identity documents.", "He had a Swiss passport until recently.", "However, when it expired the administrative authorities refused to issue him with a new one without the father\u2019s consent,

child lives in Switzerland with her,", "and she has custody of him.", "The present case, on the merits, admittedly concerns a change in the attribution of parental authority, since the applicant requests that by virtue of Swiss law it be exclusively granted to her.", "It may appear that the provisional measure requested, if granted, settles the case on the merits.", "However, the requested measure is far more limited in scope since it is only to ensure the possibility of obtaining identity papers for the applicant\u2019s child.", "The child is a Swiss national resident in Switzerland.",

In addition, the Committee has emphasised on various occasions that the Convention must be considered as a whole, with the relationship between the various articles being taken into account. Any interpretation must be consistent with the spirit of that instrument and must focus on the child as an individual having civil and political rights and its own feelings and opinions (ibid., p. 40).", "52.

For abandoned children, special measures must be taken in order to enable them to develop in conditions that most closely resemble those characterising the family environment.

In a case examined on 16 November 2006 by the House of Lords concerning the abduction of a child from Romania to the United Kingdom, Lord Hope observed:", "\u201c... it is impossible to believe that the child\u2019s best interests would be served by his return forthwith to Romania.\u201d (In re D (a child), [2006] UKHL 51, [2007] 1 AC 619)", "65. Article 5 (a) of the Hague Convention defines custody rights as \u201crights relating to the care of the person of the child, and, in particular, the right to determine the child\u2019s place of residence\u201d. The Convention recognises that custody may arise in particular by operation of law or by reason of a judicial or administrative decision, or by reason of an agreement having legal effect under the law of the State in which the child had its habitual residence immediately before removal or retention (Article 3 in fine). Furthermore, the Explanatory Report on the Convention emphasises the drafters\u2019 intention to protect all the ways in which custody of children can be exercised and recognises that there can be wrongful removal or retention even if parents have joint custody of their child:", "\u201cIn terms of Article 3, custody rights may have been awarded to the person who demands that their exercise be respected, and to that person in his own right or jointly. ... Now, from the Convention\u2019s standpoint, the removal of a child by one of the joint holders without the consent of the other, is equally wrongful, and this wrongfulness derives in this particular case, not from some action in breach of a particular law, but from the fact that such action has disregarded the rights of the other parent which are also protected by law, and has interfered with their normal exercise\u201d (Explanatory Report by Elisa P\u00e9rez-Vera, Acts and Documents of the Fourteenth Session, vol. III, Child Abduction, Hague Conference on Private International Law, paragraph 71, pp. 447-48)", "66. The drafters of the Convention created an autonomous definition of custody rights quite apart from domestic-law interpretations of that concept. This autonomous nature was confirmed in the \u201cOverall Conclusions of the Special Commission of October 1989 on the operation of the Hague Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction\u201d (\u00a7 9, p. 3), which stated as follows:", "\u201c... \u2018rights of custody\u2019 as referred to in the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction constitute an autonomous concept, and thus such rights are not necessarily coterminous with rights referred to as \u2018custody rights\u2019 created by the law of any particular country or jurisdiction thereof. ... [T]he award of what is called \u2018custody\u2019 to only one parent under domestic law, does not necessarily mean that all \u2018rights of custody\u2019 within the intent of the Hague Convention have been granted to that parent. Since each domestic legal system has its own terminology for referring to rights which touch upon the care and control of children, and even some English-language systems do not employ the term \u2018custody\u2019, it is necessary to look to the content of the rights and not merely to their name.\u201d", "67. The autonomous meaning of \u201crights of custody\u201d was further confirmed during the second meeting of the Special Commission when the following conclusion, among others, was adopted:", "\u201c... the expression \u2018rights of custody\u2019 ... does not coincide with any particular concept of custody in a domestic law, but draws its meaning from the definitions, structure and purposes of the Convention.\u201d (Report of the Second Special Commission Meeting to review the operation of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction held on 18-21 January 1993, p. 4)", "68. In addition, according to the Explanatory Report, the Convention is engaged only by issues relating to breaches of custody rights. It does not in principle concern situations arising from breaches of access rights, in particular where the child is taken abroad by its custodian (Explanatory Report, paragraph 65).", "69. The Hague Convention provides no enforcement mechanism or oversight body to ensure that Contracting States implement it. Therefore, it is possible that the case-law of domestic courts relating to the Hague Convention may differ from one Contracting State to another. In practice, there is a lack of consistency in the interpretation of the various judicial bodies as regards the Hague Convention\u2019s distinction between custody rights and access rights, more specifically where they have to decide whether to grant the remedy of return to non-custodial parents who hold access rights.", "70. However, there seems to be a trend towards a wide interpretation of wrongful removal or retention, thus broadening the scope of custody rights to allow types of parenting other than the holding of custody rights to benefit from the Convention\u2019s protection.", "71. In the case of C. v. C. (England and Wales Court of Appeal; [1989] 1 WLR 654, 657-58), for example, a custodial parent had removed a child from Australia in breach of a restraining order (also called a ne exeat order, prohibiting a child\u2019s removal from a given geographical area). In that case the child could not be removed without the consent of the non-custodial parent. The court found that the Convention\u2019s judicial remedy of return applied. They justified this reasoning by equating the ability to grant or withhold consent for relocation with a custodial \u201cright to determine the child\u2019s place of residence\u201d.", "72. The Family Court of Australia took the same approach in the case of Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Resina, where a father lodged an application under the Convention for the return of his children after they had been taken to France by their maternal grandparents (Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Resina and Muriel Ghislaine Henriette Resina, [1991] FamCA 33). The Australian court considered both a custody order, which gave the father \u201creasonable access\u201d to the youngest child, and an injunction restraining both the mother and the father from removing the children from Australia. It ultimately ordered the return of the children pursuant to the Convention because their removal had violated the father\u2019s custody rights that had been created by the restraining order. Similarly, the Israeli Supreme Court found that a custody agreement between parents contained a mutual consultation clause for major changes and unusual events, which implicitly included decisions on the residence of the child (Foxman v. Foxman, Israeli Supreme Court, 1992). The court thus considered that the father had rights of custody within the meaning of the Convention.", "73. It appears that other national courts, in particular in common-law countries, have largely cited the C. v. C. case and have followed its general holding that if the custodial parent needs permission from the court or the non-custodial parent before removing the child from a country, a removal without such permission may be regarded as \u201cwrongful\u201d within the meaning of Article 3 of the Hague Convention (see Re F, England and Wales Court of Appeal, [1995] 3 WLR 339, where the father had rights of custody, even though the mother had a court order giving her temporary \u201ccare and control\u201d and there was no order barring the child\u2019s removal).", "74. However, the practice of domestic courts is not homogeneous. Thus, for example, the United States Court of Appeals found that access rights coupled with a ne exeat clause did not constitute \u201crights of custody\u201d within the meaning of the Hague Convention (Croll v. Croll, 229 F.3d 133, 143, Second Circuit, 2000).", "75. On 21 December 2007 the Swiss Federal Parliament enacted the \u201cFederal Act on International Child Abduction and the Hague Conventions on the Protection of Children and Adults\u201d, for the purpose of clarifying certain notions, especially in relation to the application of the Hague Convention of 1980. The Act came into force on 1 July 2009. The sections of the Act referred to by the applicants read as follows:", "\u201cThe return of a child places him or her in an intolerable situation, within the meaning of Article 13, sub-paragraph (b), of the Hague Convention, in particular where the following conditions are met:", "(a) placement with the parent who lodged the application is manifestly not in the child\u2019s interests;", "(b) the abducting parent is not, given the circumstances, in a position to take care of the child in the State where the child was habitually resident immediately before the abduction, or this cannot reasonably be required of that parent; and", "(c) placement in the care of a third party is manifestly not in the child\u2019s interests.\u201d", "\u201cThe court dealing with the application for the return of the child shall decide, as required, on the child\u2019s personal relations with his or her parents and order the measures necessary to ensure his or her protection.", "Where the application for return has been received by the Central Authority, the competent court may, at the request of the Central Authority or any of the parties, order the appointment of a representative or a guardian for the child, or take other protective measures even if the application for return is not yet pending before the court.\u201d", "76. In connection with the federal decree concerning this Act, the Federal Council submitted to Parliament a \u201cdispatch\u201d (Feuille F\u00e9d\u00e9rale 2007, pp. 2433-682), of which the relevant passages read as follows:", "In order to ensure an application of the Hague Convention of 1980 that is better adapted to the interests of the child, it is necessary for the legislature to specify the various situations in which the return of the child can no longer be taken into consideration because it would place him or her in a manifestly intolerable situation. The rule in section 5 is not supposed to supersede the provision of Article 13, sub-paragraph (b), of the Hague Convention of 1980. The term \u2018in particular\u2019 means that the list merely enumerates a few situations which \u2013 although essential \u2013 do not preclude reliance on the clause provided for in the Convention.", "Firstly, sub-paragraph (a) refers to the situations in which the child\u2019s accommodation by the parent who requested the return is manifestly not in the child\u2019s interests. If that is not so, in particular where the parent who lodged the application has an exclusive right of custody or is the only one who could be granted such responsibility, there will not, in principle, be any cause for fear that the child will be placed in an intolerable situation on his or her return and therefore there is no reason why the return should be refused. This will not be the case where it appears obvious to the court that the party lodging the application would not be able to take care of the child.", "Sub-paragraph (b) governs cases in which the appropriateness of the child\u2019s return can be assessed only from the standpoint of his or her relationship with the abducting parent. Where the child\u2019s accommodation by the parent who requested the return is manifestly not to be taken into consideration, the problem of his or her return to the State of origin will be addressed differently, depending on whether the person who wrongfully removed or retained the child (usually the mother) is or is not in a position to return to that State. If the said parent is not able to do so because, for example, he or she faces a prison sentence that would lead to separation from the child or because the parent has very close family ties in Switzerland (for example following remarriage or on account of a situation of hardship suffered by another family member living in Switzerland), the child\u2019s psychological and physical stability may be at stake, because the child would, after the return, be obliged to live apart from his or her parents. Such separation is tolerable only in exceptional cases and must constitute an ultima ratio.", "Second type of situation: where, given all the circumstances, it cannot reasonably be required of the abducting parent that he or she take care of the child in the State where the child had his or her habitual residence immediately before the abduction (section 5(b)). It is not sufficient for the parent who wrongfully removed or retained the child to state that he or she refuses to return to that State. He or she would also have to be in a situation of hardship such that he or she could not reasonably be expected to return to his or her place of prior residence to await there, with the child, the court\u2019s final decision on the granting of custody. In that context, we have in mind especially those cases in which the mother cannot be guaranteed safe or affordable accommodation outside the home of her former partner. One must further take into account those cases in which the parent who has requested the return of the child will not resume the exercise of the right of custody and will not obtain it by court order, whilst the abducting parent is clearly the child\u2019s primary carer. In such a case the child would only be taken to the State of origin to await the final attribution of the right of custody to the abducting parent, before coming back to Switzerland again with that parent. Such coming and going would ultimately only have served the purpose of bringing the case before the authorities of the former State of residence. Such a solution would be inadmissible according to the spirit and purpose of the Hague Convention, because it would be incompatible with the child\u2019s interests. But the situation would have to be beyond doubt for the Swiss court dealing with the request for return. Unless the circumstances can be established clearly, the court will have to rule that the return to the parent\u2019s State of origin is bearable and that, accordingly, the child will not be placed in an intolerable situation such as to justify a decision denying the return under Article 13, sub-paragraph (b), of the Hague Convention.", "Sub-paragraph (c) refers to placement with third parties. If the child\u2019s return were to lead to separation from the parent who wrongfully removed or retained the child (because return is impossible for that parent or cannot reasonably be required of him or her), it could only be carried out in appropriate conditions if the child were placed with a third party in the State of origin. However, such a solution should only be sought, with the resulting possibility for the competent Swiss court to order the child\u2019s return, if placement with a third party is not manifestly contrary to the child\u2019s interests. That third condition can be satisfied only if separation from the parent remaining in Switzerland is bearable for the child \u2013 which may be the case where he or she has an antagonistic relationship with that parent \u2013 and if the foster family receiving the child can provide proper guarantees as to the protection and normal upbringing of the child. In any event, such a situation should only be envisaged as an ultima ratio.", "It must further be noted that, for the return to be compatible with the child\u2019s interests and, in particular, for the conditions of Article 13 of the Hague Convention to be fulfilled, the authority ruling on the matter has to be apprised of the situation prevailing in the State of origin and of the legal provisions in force there. Thus, the parties, and in particular the parents, have a duty to participate in the establishment of the facts. The hearing of the parties in person by the court (section 9(1) and (2)) is therefore of great importance. The new provisions concerning the procedure and the cooperation with the competent authorities of the State of origin also play an essential role. The court must be able to verify whether, and in what manner, it is possible to ensure the child\u2019s return (section 10(2)). If it does not succeed in that task, or succeeds only partially, it will not be in a position to weigh up all the consequences that a return might have for the child. The same will be true if it does not succeed in obtaining from the local authorities any reliable assurances as to the conditions of the child\u2019s reception and protection, in particular when there is some doubt about the requesting parent\u2019s capacity to look after the child properly. In this respect, section 10 is thus directly related to the practical application of section 5.\u201d", "77. The concept of guardianship is defined in Chapter 2 of the Capacity and Guardianship Law 1962. The term custody is not defined as such but is mentioned.", "78. Section 14 of that Law provides that \u201c[p]arents shall be the natural guardians of their minor children\u201d. In Israel, parents, whether married, divorced or unmarried, are joint and equal guardians of their children. The term \u201cguardianship\u201d may be regarded as equivalent to \u201cparental authority\u201d in other jurisdictions.", "79. Guardianship is an automatic right which both parents acquire and can only be restricted or removed in exceptional circumstances (where a Magistrate\u2019s Court adopts one of the measures mentioned in section 3(3) or (4) of the Youth (Care and Supervision) Law). This rule is set out in section 27 of the Law.", "80. Section 15 defines and describes the role of parents in Israeli law and outlines what parental guardianship entails in the following terms:", "\u201cThe guardianship of the parents shall include the duty and the right to take care of the needs of the minor, including his education, studies, vocational and occupational training and work and to preserve, manage and develop his property; it shall also include the right to the custody of the minor, to determine his place of residence and the authority to act on his behalf.\u201d", "81. Section 17 sets the standard of parents\u2019 duties. It states that in exercising their guardianship, \u201cparents [must] act in the best interests of the minor in such manner as devoted parents would act in the circumstances\u201d.", "82. There is a general presumption that parents should cooperate in taking decisions relating to their guardianship (section 18). However, where no agreement is reached, they may refer to the court to decide the issue (section 19).", "83. Section 24 provides that, when parents live apart, they may reach an agreement as to: who is going to have guardianship of the minor, wholly or in part; who is going to have custody of the minor; and what rights the other parent is going to have, in particular as regards contact with the child. Such an agreement is subject to the approval of the court.", "84. Under section 25, if the parents cannot reach such an agreement these issues may be determined by the court having regard to the best interests of the child.", "85. Section 25 further creates a presumption of custody in favour of the mother for children under six years old unless there are special reasons for directing otherwise.", "86. Accordingly both parents share joint decision-making authority regarding their child\u2019s place of residence. One parent cannot remove the child from Israel without the permission of the other parent or of a court. If one parent wishes to remove the child from Israel without the other parent\u2019s consent, then the parent wishing to leave must apply to the Israeli courts for a relocation order and an order for custody of the child."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
