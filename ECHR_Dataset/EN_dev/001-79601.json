AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant, Gr\u00fcner Klub im Rathaus, is the fraction of an Austrian party to the Vienna Regional Parliament (Landtag). It was represented before the Court by Mrs M. Windhager, a lawyer practising in Vienna. The respondent Government were represented by Mr F. Trauttmansdorff, Head of the International law Department at the Federal Ministry for Foreign Affairs.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "In the autumn of 2000 a police officer, Mr Kleindienst, revealed that he and some colleagues had repeatedly transmitted data from the central police computer to officials of the Austrian Freedom Party (FP\u00d6). Subsequently criminal investigations were opened against several persons. In the autumn of 2002 the Vienna Regional Court (Landesgericht) convicted Mr Kleindienst and the FP\u00d6 official Mr Krei\u03b2l and sentenced them to six months\u2019 imprisonment suspended on probation. This judgment was later, in February 2004, quashed upon appeal and Mr Kleindienst and Mr Krei\u03b2l were acquitted.", "In the meantime, after the first instance judgment, the applicant issued, on 17 September 2002, a press release which read as follows:", "\u201cMember of the Green Party to the police information scandal:\u201d[A] gift and [a] shame.\u201d", "Maria Vassilakou: Austria desperately needs a new Minister of Justice", "Vienna (Member of the Green Party): \u201cA shame. This judgment quite clearly bears the hallmark of Krei\u03b2l\u2019s fellow party member, the Minister of Justice, B\u00f6hmdorfer\u201d so [says] the Green Member of the City Council Maria Vassilakou in view of the low [sentences of the] judgments against Kleindienst and Krei\u03b2l. \u201cIf one considers the genesis of this incredible police information scandal, one has to wonder very much that after a dozen of suspects, month-long investigations and a long trial only this [judgment] remains.\u201d", "Vassilakou concludes: \u201cAn embarrassing judgment which lets down the persons who have been spied upon and opens the floodgates for further abuse of personal data by \u2018political engaged\u2019 or simply \u2018currupt\u2019 executive officers\u201d", "[Gr\u00fcne zu Spitzelaff\u00e4re:\u201dGeschenk und Schande\u201d", "Maria Vassilakou: \u00d6sterreich braucht dringend neuen Justizminister.", "Wien (Gr\u00fcne) \u201cEine Schande. Dieses Urteil tr\u00e4gt ganz klar die Handschrift von Krei\u03b2els Parteifreund Justizminister B\u00f6hmdorfer\u201d, so die Gr\u00fcne Stadtr\u00e4tin Maria Vassilakou in Anbetracht der geringen Urteile gegen Krei\u03b2l und Kleindienst. \u201cBetrachtet man die Genesis dieser unglaublichen Spitzelaff\u00e4re wundert man sich schon sehr, wenn von mehreren Dutzend Verd\u00e4chtigen, monatelangen Untersuchungen und ein langwieriger Prozess lediglich dies \u00fcbrig bleibt.\u201d", "Vassilakou abschlie\u03b2end: \u201cEin peinliches Urteil, das die bespitzelten Personen im Regen stehen l\u00e4sst und T\u00fcr und Tor f\u00fcr weiteren Missbrauch von vertraulichen Personendaten durch \u2018politisch engagierte\u2019 oder schlicht \u2018k\u00e4ufliche\u2019 Exekutivbeamten \u00f6ffnet\u201d]", "Mr B\u00f6hmdorfer subsequently brought proceedings under section 6 of the Media Act (Mediengesetz) with the Vienna Regional Court (Landesgericht f\u00fcr Strafsachen).", "On 28 November 2002 the Regional Court, having held on oral hearing, found that the statement \u201cA shame. This judgment quite clearly bears the hallmark of Krei\u03b2l\u2019s fellow party member, the Minister of Justice, B\u00f6hmdorfer\u201d amounted to defamation within the meaning of Articles 111 and 297 of the Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch). It ordered the applicant under section 6 of the Media Act to pay compensation to Mr B\u00f6hmdorfer in the amount of 3,000 euros (EUR). It further ordered it to publish the judgment.", "The court noted that the impugned statement read in its context suggested that Mr B\u00f6hmdorfer had abused his authority as Minister of Justice to influence the deciding court. However, the applicant had failed to prove that this had indeed been so.", "The applicant appealed and submitted in particular that the impugned statement amounted to a value judgment on a political issue and it was therefore, in any event, not possible to prove its veracity. Furthermore, there had been some factual basis for the statement. The applicant referred in this regard to the general political background of the \u201cpolice information scandal\u201d, the conduct of the criminal investigations and to the fact that Mr B\u00f6hmdorfer at the beginning of the investigations had refused all reproaches of illegal data consulting. The applicant finally contended that the court should have interpreted the statement in a broader sense, meaning that the judgment against Mr Kleindienst and Mr Krei\u03b2l corresponded to Mr B\u00f6hmdorfer\u2019s political mindset and style.", "On 8 September 2003 the Vienna Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht) dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal. It found that the impugned statement, read in its context, did not allow any other conclusion to be drawn than that Mr B\u00f6hmdorfer had unlawfully influenced the deciding judge in the criminal proceedings. However, the evidence adduced by the applicant, namely general press releases relating to the conduct of the criminal investigations in the police information case, Mr B\u00f6hmdorfer\u2019s statements in the context of these investigations and the fact that Mr B\u00f6hmdorfer had himself been criticised for allegedly having used illegal obtained material, did not give any indication for the veracity of this allegation. The applicant\u2019s right to freedom under expression under Article 10 of the Convention did not protect false statements of facts. Moreover, the applicant had not even given Mr B\u00f6hmdorfer the opportunity to comment.", "This judgment was served on the applicant\u2019s counsel on 22 October 2003."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
