The Constitutional Court found, among other things, that the transitional instruction as well as the internal regulations on remand prisons had not been made public and that they were internal normative acts (iek\u0161\u0113jie normat\u012bvie akti). As a result, it concluded that some of the rules contained in the internal regulations on remand prisons were unconstitutional, but not those concerning short-term visits.", "33. On 23 April 2009 the Constitutional Court delivered its judgment in case no. 2008-42-01 on whether the restriction of the duration of short-term visits to one hour for detainees, which emanated from the Law on Custody Procedure (in effect since 18 July 2006), was in compliance with the Constitution.", "34. Having examined the Court\u2019s case-law, the practice of several member States of the Council of Europe, and the European Prison Rules, the Constitutional Court found, on the one hand, that there was no obligation for States to ensure long-term visits for detainees and that the restriction to receive such visits was compatible with the Constitution, namely, with the right to private and family life contained therein. On the other hand, the Constitutional Court held that the blanket one-hour restriction on monthly short-term visits was not proportionate and thus not compatible with the Constitution. The restriction was abrogated as of 1 December 2009 and, since 11 August 2011, the relevant provision reads: \u201cdetainees have the right to receive visits lasting at least one hour from their relatives or other persons at least once a month\u201d.", "35.
