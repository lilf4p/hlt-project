In a letter of 10 April 1992 the investigator requested the police to establish the full names and addresses of four witnesses.", "14. On 28 April 1992 the investigator established that Mr D.I. had not appeared before him, although he had been duly summoned, and that the whereabouts of certain witnesses were unknown. He proposed that the criminal proceedings be stayed. By a decree of 24 November 1992 the district prosecutor stayed the criminal proceedings against Mr T.Z. and Mr D.I., on the ground that the latter\u2019s whereabouts were unknown.", "15. There is no information as to whether the authorities took any steps to find the persons concerned.", "16. In a report of 8 September 2000 a police officer stated that Mr D.I. had been found.

The district prosecutor was ordered to monitor the case and see to the lawful and timely completion of the investigation within two months. The decision further stated that the applicant\u2019s account of the events had been corroborated by numerous pieces of circumstantial evidence and that the prescription period for prosecuting Mr D.I. had not expired because there was evidence of complicity between the two accused which affected the legal characterisation of the charges.", "35. On 5 October 2004 the district prosecutor referred the case back to the investigator with instructions to gather additional evidence within thirty days. On 8 November 2004 this deadline was extended by thirty days.", "36. In a letter of 3 January 2005 the district prosecutor instructed the investigator to send him the file as soon as possible.

The defendants did not plead the statute of limitations but asked the court to pronounce a judgment.", "48. In a judgment of 30 November 2005 the District Court convicted Mr D.I. of aggravated rape but relieved him from liability and punishment. It reasoned that although Mr D.I. had not pleaded the statute of limitations, the latter was nevertheless an absolute obstacle to his punishment. It further convicted Mr T.Z. of attempted aggravated rape and sentenced him to three years\u2019 imprisonment. It found that the long lapse of time since the rape represented a mitigating factor which must be taken into account in determining his punishment. The court acquitted the two accused of the complicity charges.", "49. Upon appeals by the applicant, the district prosecutor and Mr T.Z., on 20 October 2006 the Stara Zagora Regional Court upheld the judgment of 30 November 2005 in respect of Mr D.I.

The applicant did not appeal.", "52. Pursuant to the 1974 Criminal Procedure Code, in force at the relevant time and until 2006, as well as the constant case-law of the Supreme Court of Cassation, the courts had to terminate criminal proceedings upon expiry of the statutory period of limitation. Nevertheless, the accused could request their continuation (Article 21). In such a case, the court could find him guilty but could not punish him (Article 303)."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
