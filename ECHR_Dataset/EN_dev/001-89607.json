At about 5 a.m. on 9 May 1998 the applicant and an accomplice were surprised by police while in the process of trying to enter a computer equipment shop through a hole in the wall of the basement of a neighbouring building. They had previously drilled the hole over the course of several nights, and in this way had attracted the attention of the building\u2019s inhabitants.", "6. On the morning of 9 May 1998 the applicant and his accomplice were heavily armed. The applicant opened fire and shot a police officer dead. Later he detonated a hand grenade. In the ensuing exchange of gunfire his accomplice was injured and died. The special antiterrorism squad intervened later in the morning. The applicant gave himself up and was arrested at about 8.30 a.m., after negotiations with the police, a psychologist and a public prosecutor.", "7. On the same day, 9 May 1998, the applicant was charged with attempted robbery committed in conspiracy with others and accompanied by murder, and placed in pretrial detention.", "8. The charges against him were later amended to include the unlawful possession of firearms, ammunition and explosives in large quantities, the murder of a police officer, and attempted murder of six police officers committed in a manner and by means which endangered several lives and by a person who had already committed murder. The maximum penalty on conviction for those offences was life imprisonment, with or without parole.", "9. After the Sofia City Prosecutor\u2019s Office referred the case back to the investigator on three occasions for additional investigation, on 13 August 1999 the investigator finished his work on the case, recommending that the applicant be committed for trial.", "10. On 29 December 1999 the Sofia City Prosecutor\u2019s Office filed an indictment against the applicant with the Sofia City Court.", "11. On 21 February 2000 the judgerapporteur to whom the case was assigned set it down for hearing on 8 and 9 June 2000. As required by Article 241 \u00a7 2 (4) of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure, as in force at that time, he examined of his own motion whether the applicant\u2019s pretrial detention should be replaced with a more lenient measure, and confirmed it without giving reasons.", "12. The trial against the applicant began in June 2000, but had to restart in October 2001, as in May 2001 the judge-rapporteur was appointed as the Minister of Justice and the formation examining the case did not include a reserve judge.", "13. Over the course of the next few years numerous hearings were adjourned for various reasons. On some occasions the adjournments were made necessary by the fact that the applicant had dismissed his counsel and instructed new ones, who needed time to acquaint themselves with the case file.", "14. In a judgment of 14 October 2005 the Sofia City Court found the applicant guilty of murdering a police officer, attempting to murder another police officer and unlawfully possessing firearms and explosives. Although under the relevant provisions of the 1968 Criminal Code it could have imposed a sentence of life imprisonment, it opted for a lesser penalty and sentenced the applicant to thirty years\u2019 imprisonment, citing his clean criminal record, and the facts that he had a family and had not been fully discredited morally and socially.", "15. Both the applicant and the prosecution appealed. The prosecution requested that the applicant\u2019s sentence be increased to life imprisonment.", "16. On 2 October 2007 the Sofia Court of Appeal upheld the Sofia City Court\u2019s judgment. When considering the appropriateness of the applicant\u2019s sentence, it found that the mitigating circumstances relied on by the lower court were not sufficient to warrant a sentence less than the maximum penalty. It also found that the Sofia City Court had failed to take into account certain aggravating circumstances, such as the victim\u2019s good moral character. In its judgment, the murder committed by the applicant was considerably graver than other offences of that type and the aggravating circumstances were, overall, of such weight and intensity as to rule out a penalty showing any degree of lenience. However, it went on to say, by express reference to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, that the criminal charges against the applicant had not been determined within a reasonable time, with all the negative repercussions which this had had on him. It found that the excessive length of the proceedings was not attributable to the applicant\u2019s conduct, although he had at times failed to organise his defence efficiently. In the court\u2019s view, the undue delay amounted in itself to a mitigating circumstance, which obviated the need to imprison the applicant for life, in line with the former Commission\u2019s and the Court\u2019s caselaw that the excessive length of criminal proceedings could be remedied by a reduction in sentence.", "17. The applicant and the prosecution appealed on points of law. The prosecution again argued that the penalty was far too lenient and should be increased to life imprisonment.", "18. In a judgment of 5 March 2008 the Supreme Court of Cassation upheld the Sofia Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment, endorsing its reasoning.", "19. The applicant was arrested on 9 May 1998 and detained by an investigator\u2019s order of the same day. The reasons given by the investigator were that the applicant had committed a serious wilful offence and that there existed a genuine risk that he might abscond. On the same day the investigator\u2019s order was approved by a prosecutor.", "20. The applicant made his first request for release on 2 October 1998, when the proceedings against him were at the preliminary investigation stage. The request was dismissed by the Sofia City Court at a public hearing held on 13 October 1998. The court observed that the applicant had committed a serious wilful offence carrying a very severe penalty, and that no special circumstances warranting his release existed. This decision was not subject to appeal. Nevertheless, on 13 December 2000, when the proceedings against him had already progressed to the trial stage, the applicant appealed against it to the Sofia Court of Appeal. In a decision made in private on 15 January 2001 the Sofia Court of Appeal, finding that the applicant\u2019s legal challenge was actually not an appeal but a fresh request for release, sent it to the Sofia City Court for a ruling. On 1 February 2001 the applicant appealed against this decision to the Supreme Court of Cassation. On 21 February 2001 the Sofia Court of Appeal returned the appeal, informing the applicant that its decision was not subject to appeal on points of law. It seems that the Sofia City Court did not examine the request.", "21. On 26 February 2001 the applicant appealed against the decision of the judgerapporteur to confirm his detention of his own motion following receipt of the indictment (see paragraph 11 above). On 9 March 2001 the Sofia Court of Appeal, sitting in private, declared the appeal inadmissible.", "22. The applicant made further requests for release at several trial hearings, held on 9 April and 29 November 2001, and 18 March and 9 May 2002. They were all turned down by the Sofia City Court at the respective hearings. The applicant\u2019s ensuing appeals were dismissed by the Sofia Court of Appeal by decisions made in private on 4 May 2001, 7 January, 15 April and an unknown later date in 2002.", "23. In their reasoning the Sofia City Court and the Sofia Court of Appeal stressed, with various degrees of detail, the following points: (i) the applicant stood accused of several very serious offences, which in itself justified the conclusion that he was a dangerous individual who could abscond or reoffend, (ii) there were no fresh circumstances warranting his release, and (iii) no unwarranted delays had taken place in the criminal proceedings, as the case was factually and legally complex.", "24. In its decision of 4 May 2001 the Sofia Court of Appeal stated that the presumption under Article 152 \u00a7 2 (3) of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure, in the 1 January 2000 version, about the existence of a risk that the detainee might abscond or reoffend (see paragraph 32 below) applied to the applicant\u2019s case. In two other decisions \u2013 those of 7 January and 15 April 2001 \u2013 that court expressed the view that the applicant\u2019s lack of a criminal record, known identity and permanent place of abode were not enough to rebut this presumption.", "25. On at least two occasions, in April and May 2002, the applicant\u2019s appeals against the decisions of the Sofia City Court were sent to the competent public prosecutors, who commented on them in writing. These comments were not communicated to the applicant and later the Sofia Court of Appeal ruled on the appeals in private, without holding a hearing, with the result that the applicant did not have the opportunity of replying to these comments.", "26. In October 2002 and April and December 2003 the applicant made three further requests for release in writing. They were turned down by the Sofia City Court in decisions made in private on 18 October 2002 and 14 April and 29 December 2003. On appeal, these decisions were upheld by the Sofia Court of Appeal in decisions also made in private on 11 November 2002, 23 May 2003 and 12 January 2004.", "27. The applicant later lodged four more requests for release. They were all rejected by the Sofia City Court at public hearings held on 27 January, 4 May, 8 September and 23 November 2004. The applicant\u2019s ensuing appeals were dismissed by the Sofia Court of Appeal by decisions made in private on 19 February, 7 June, 21 September and 20 December 2004. The Sofia City Court declined to examine a further request for release made by the applicant during the trial hearing on 13 January 2005, on the grounds that his counsel was absent and it could not proceed with the case.", "28. In turning down the requests for release made between October 2002 and November 2004 the courts relied on the seriousness of the charges against the applicant, the lack of change in the circumstances save for the passage of time, the complexity of the case and the diligent conduct of the proceedings. In their decisions of 4 May 2004 and 8 September and 23 November 2004 the Sofia Court of Appeal and the Sofia City Court expressed the view that the length of the proceedings was due to the numerous adjournments caused by the applicant.", "29. In its decisions of 4 May, 8 September and 23 November 2004 the Sofia City Court stated that under the newly added Article 268a of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 36 below), when ruling on requests for release made during the trial, it was barred from examining the existence or otherwise of a reasonable suspicion against the applicant. In its view, to do so would mean to prejudge the merits of the criminal case against the applicant. It was true that under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention the court had to examine whether a reasonable suspicion existed, but that applied only to rulings made at the pretrial stage. This view was endorsed by the Sofia Court of Appeal in its decision of 21 September 2004. For this reason, the courts declined to delve into the applicant\u2019s arguments concerning this point.", "30. On 14 October 2005 the Sofia City Court convicted the applicant (see paragraph 14 above). In a separate decision it confirmed his detention.", "31. On 17 June 2002 the applicant asked the Supreme Administrative Court to annul certain provisions of Regulation no. 2 governing the legal regime of pretrial detainees (see paragraph 42 below), which, in his view, violated, inter alia, his freedom of correspondence. In a final judgment of 19 July 2002 the Supreme Administrative Court rejected his application.", "32. The relevant provisions of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure and the Bulgarian courts\u2019 practice before 1 January 2000 are summarised in the Court\u2019s judgments in several similar cases (see, among others, Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, \u00a7\u00a7 2536, ECHR 1999-II; Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 5559, 26 July 2001; and Yankov v. Bulgaria, no. 39084/97, \u00a7\u00a7 7988, ECHR 2003-XII (extracts)). On 1 January 2000 the legal framework of pretrial detention was amended with the aim of ensuring the compliance of Bulgarian law with the Convention (\u0442\u044a\u043b\u043a. \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 1 \u043e\u0442 25 \u044e\u043d\u0438 2002 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u043d.\u0434. \u2116 1/2002 \u0433., \u041e\u0421\u041d\u041a \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u041a\u0421). The amendments and the resulting practice of the Bulgarian courts are summarised in the Court\u2019s judgments in the cases of Dobrev v. Bulgaria (no. 55389/00, \u00a7\u00a7 3235, 10 August 2006), and Yordanov v. Bulgaria (no. 56856/00, \u00a7\u00a7 2124, 10 August 2006).", "33. On 29 April 2006 the 1974 Code was superseded by the 2005 Code of Criminal Procedure, which reproduced all the provisions brought in with the January 2000 reform.", "34. By Article 304 \u00a7 1 of the 1974 Code, during the trial the detainees\u2019 requests for release were examined by the trial court (the same is currently provided for by Article 270 of the 2005 Code). It followed from Article 304 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the 1974 Code that these requests could be examined in private or at an oral hearing (under Article 270 \u00a7 2 of the 2005 Code, these requests must be examined at an oral hearing). The law did not \u2013 and still does not \u2013 require the court to decide within a particular timelimit.", "35. The trial court\u2019s decision was subject to appeal to the higher court (Article 344 \u00a7 3 of the 1974 Code; superseded by Article 270 \u00a7 4 of the 2005 Code). The higher court could examine the appeal in private or, if it considered it necessary, at an oral hearing (Article 348 \u00a7 1 of the 1974 Code, reproduced in Article 354 \u00a7 1 of the 2005 Code).", "36. A new Article 268a was added to the 1974 Code in May 2003. By paragraph 1 of that Article (presently reproduced in Article 270 \u00a7 1 of the 2005 Code), a fresh request for release at the same level of court could be made only if there had been a change in circumstances. Paragraph 2 in fine of this Article (presently reproduced in Article 270 \u00a7 2 in fine of the 2005 Code) provided that the trial court had to refrain from examining the existence or otherwise of a reasonable suspicion against the detainee.", "37.

Italy (judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996V) and Petra v. Romania (judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports 1998VII), it held that a blanket authorisation to inspect the correspondence of all detainees without regard to their particular circumstances and the threat which they allegedly posed to society through such correspondence was contrary to Articles 30 \u00a7 5 and 34 of the 1991 Constitution (see paragraph 40 above).", "49.
