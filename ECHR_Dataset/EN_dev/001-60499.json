THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 14+P1-1;Not necessary to examine Art. 14+8;No violation of Art. 14+8 in connection with widow's pension;Not necessary to examine Art. 14+8 or 14+P1-1 in connection with alleged discrimination against applicant's late wife;No violation of Art. 13", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["7. The applicant is a British national born in 1956 and living in Bristol.", "8. In December 1984 the applicant married Marlene Willis. They had two children: Natasha Uma, born on 24 March 1989, and Ross Amal, born on 2 August 1990. Mrs Willis died of cancer on 7 June 1996, at the age of 39. The applicant is the administrator of his late wife's estate.", "9. Mrs Willis had been employed as a local authority housing officer. For the greater part of her married life, she was the primary breadwinner. She had paid full social-security contributions as an employed earner until 1994, and was subsequently entitled to contribution credits as a person unfit for work. On 3 November 1995 the applicant gave up work to nurse his wife and care for their children. Following his wife's death, he worked part time between 2 September 1996 and 6 November 1996, for an annual salary of 4,393 pounds sterling (GBP), but since this proved uneconomic he stopped working to care full time for the children.", "10. On 4 November 1996 the applicant applied to the Benefits Agency for the payment of social-security benefits. He applied for benefits equivalent to those which a widow whose husband had died in similar circumstances to those of Mrs Willis would have been entitled, namely a widow's payment and a widowed mother's allowance, payable under the Social Security and Benefits Act 1992.", "11. By a letter dated 18 November 1996, the Benefits Agency informed the applicant that the benefits he had claimed did not exist for widowers, and that his claim accordingly could not be accepted as valid. The letter continued:", "\u201cI am afraid I can only explain that the Government says that it has no plans to introduce a widowers' pension on the same line as the existing widows' benefits.", "It may help if I explain the current policy underlying widows' benefits was established at a time when married women rarely worked. It is based on the assumption that women are more likely than men to have been financially dependent on their spouse's earnings and therefore more likely on widowhood to face greater financial hardship. The benefits themselves are concentrated on those widows who are perceived to have the greatest problems, those with children and older women who may have been out of the labour market for many years.", "It is accepted that social patterns have changed considerably since the provisions were first introduced. However, it is still broadly the case that on bereavement, women are more likely than men to be in financial need. For instance, most widowers of working age will have been in employment before the death of their wives. They will not therefore have the same degree of difficulty in supporting themselves as widows who may have been out of the labour market for some time and may find it difficult to obtain paid work. Women on average earn less than men. So even for women who have been working, the financial loss on widowhood is likely to be significantly more than for men.", "Widows' benefits are not means tested and are paid regardless of the level of the widows' earnings. The Government says that the extension of the benefits on the same basis to widowers would mean substantial extra expenditure in paying maintenance benefit to men who are likely to be already maintaining themselves by their earnings, and in some cases, very high earnings indeed. To make existing widows' benefits provisions available to widowers would add an estimated GBP 490 million to the annual Social Security budget. The Government is of the opinion that at a time when all areas of public expenditure are having to be carefully considered, this is simply not a best use of scarce resources.", "In making these points, the Government says that it is in no way minimising the sad problems faced by widowers, in particular those left with small children to care for. For them there are already available benefits such as Child Benefit and One Parent Benefit, together with the range of income-related benefits, for example, Income Support for those not in full time work and Family Credit for low paid workers. In the Government's view this remains the fairest way of providing benefits to meet specific need rather than an extension of widows' benefits along the lines suggested. ...\u201d", "12. The applicant lodged a statutory appeal against this decision on 17 February 1997. The Social Security Appeal Tribunal declined jurisdiction on the basis that no appealable decision had been made.", "13. The applicant currently receives child benefit and, in respect of his son Ross, received a disability living allowance and an invalid care allowance for a period following his wife's death. He is also in receipt of a widower's pension under Mrs Willis's occupational pension scheme. The applicant has capital, much of which is derived from a joint endowment policy (for which he and Mrs Willis had paid premiums) which matured on Mrs Willis's death, from which he obtains a further income of about GBP 150 per month. Because of his savings, the applicant does not qualify for means-tested benefits such as income support or family credit. All the social-security benefits he receives would also be received by a widow, who would in addition be paid a widow's payment and a widowed mother's allowance.", "14. Under United Kingdom law, certain social-security benefits, including widow's payment, widowed mother's allowance and widow's pension, are paid for out of the National Insurance Fund. By section 1 of the Social Security and Benefits Act 1992 (\u201cthe 1992 Act\u201d), the funds required for paying such benefits are to be provided by means of contributions payable to the Secretary of State for Social Security by earners, employers and others, together with certain additions made to the Fund by Parliament.", "15. Male and female earners are obliged to pay the same social-security contributions in accordance with their status as employed earners or self-employed earners.", "16. Under section 36 of the 1992 Act, a woman who has been widowed is entitled to a widow's payment (a lump sum payment of GBP 1,000) if:", "(i) she is under pensionable age at the time when her husband died, or he was not then entitled to a Category A retirement pension; and", "(ii) her husband satisfied certain specified social-security contribution conditions set out in a schedule to the 1992 Act.", "17. Under the relevant part of section 37 of the 1992 Act, a woman who has been widowed (and who has not remarried) is entitled to a mother's allowance on certain conditions, the following being the conditions relevant to the circumstance of the present case:", "(i) her husband satisfied the contribution conditions set out in a schedule to the Act; and", "(ii) she is entitled to receive child benefit in relation to a son or daughter of herself and her late husband.", "The widowed mother's allowance currently amounts to GBP 72.50 per week, with an extra GBP 9.70 per week in respect of the eldest eligible child, and a further GBP 11.35 per week in respect of other children.", "18. Under section 38 of the 1992 Act, a woman who has been widowed (and who is not remarried) is entitled to a widow's pension if her husband satisfied the contribution conditions set out in a schedule to the Act; and", "(i) at the date of her husband's death she was over the age of 45 but under the age of 65; or", "(ii) she ceased to be entitled to a widowed mother's allowance at the time she was over the age of 45 but under the age of 65.", "If the applicant were a woman, he could look forward to entitlement to a widow's pension at some stage between 2006 and 2009, depending on when his youngest child ceased to be a dependant, at which time he would no longer be entitled to the widowed mother's allowance.", "19. Section 1(1) of the 1992 Act, which applies to the applicant, provides that no entitlement to a benefit arises unless a claim for the benefit is made in the prescribed manner and within the prescribed time.", "At the relevant time, the time-limits for claiming a widow's payment and a widowed mother's allowance were set out in the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 (Statutory Instrument 1987/1968), Regulation 19 of which provided:", "\u201c(6) The prescribed time for claiming benefits not specified in column (1) of Schedule 4 shall be \u2013", "...", "(b) twelve months in the case of ... widow's benefit ...", "(7) The periods of six and twelve months prescribed by paragraph (6) are calculated from any day on which, apart from satisfying the condition of making a claim, the claimant is entitled to the benefit concerned.\u201d", "In addition, section 1(2) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 provides, in relation to claims for a widow's payment:", "\u201cWhere under subsection (1) above a person is required to make a claim or to be treated as making a claim for a benefit in order to be entitled to it \u2013", "(a) if the benefit is a widow's payment, she shall not be entitled to it in respect of a death occurring more than 12 months before the date on which the claim is made or treated as made ... \u201d", "20. The Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 (\u201cthe 1999 Act\u201d) introduces two new social-security benefits, the widowed parent's allowance and the bereavement allowance. The widowed parent's allowance replaces the widowed mother's allowance. The bereavement allowance replaces the widow's pension. Both are payable to men and women who meet the relevant qualifying conditions. The 1999 Act also introduces a new social-security payment, called a bereavement payment, payable both to men and women in place of the widow's payment.", "21. The relevant parts of the Act came into force on 9 April 2001 and allow any man whose wife dies before, on or after that date, or any woman whose husband dies on or after that date, to apply for the widowed parent's allowance. It also allows any man whose wife dies on or after that date to apply for the bereavement payment or the bereavement allowance in exactly the same way as a woman whose husband dies on or after that date.", "22. The transitional provisions of the 1999 Act preserve the entitlements of women under the 1992 Act whose husbands died before 9 April 2001. Such women thus continue to be entitled to the widow's payment, the widowed mother's allowance and the widow's pension where the relevant qualifying conditions are met.", "23. On 14 February 2002 Mr Justice Moses delivered judgment in the High Court in a case brought by four claimants, all of whom were widowers claiming, inter alia, that their ineligibility for widows' benefits under the 1992 Act was discriminatory contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with both Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Three of the claimants had been left with dependent children, with the result that the benefits at issue in their cases were the widow's payment and the widowed mother's allowance. The fourth claimant (Mr Naylor) had been left without dependent children, with the result that the benefits at issue in his case were the widow's payment and the widow's pension.", "24. The defendant government department conceded before the High Court that there had been discrimination under Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 8 in relation to non-payment of the widowed mother's allowance. As regards the question of whether the claimants' complaints, in so far as they related to the widow's payment and the widow's pension, fell within the ambit of Article 8, Mr Justice Moses commented as follows:", "\u201cIn my view, the availability of pecuniary support afforded by Widow's Payment and Widow's Pension does have a significant effect on the relationship of a family prior to the death of the spouse. They form a significant part of a family's plans for a secure future. ...", "Financial planning seems to me to be a significant aspect of family life and the benefits play some part in allaying fears for the future of a surviving spouse. ...", "Moreover, Widow's Payments and Widow's Pensions form part of a congeries of provisions, all of which are designed to provide support to a surviving spouse at different stages of her life. Widow's Payments ... are one-off payments made immediately on bereavement. Widowed Mother's Allowances are paid whilst she looks after dependent children and Widow's Pension payable in the longer term between the ages of 45-65 when she has finished bringing up her children. Viewed as part of a package, the payments and pensions payable to a widow are bound to be of concern to the family before the death of the husband.", "Accordingly, for those reasons I conclude that the failure to make Widow's Payment and Widow's Pension available to a surviving widower falls within the ambit of Article 8(1). Thus Article 14 is itself engaged.\u201d", "25. In dismissing the claimants' arguments that the same complaints fell also within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, Mr Justice Moses commented:", "\u201c... In order to establish that the benefits in issue are their possessions, the claimants must establish a pecuniary right based upon their contributions. Absent such contributions, they have no possession within the meaning of Article 1 of the First Protocol. There is no hint, in any of the cases that the [Strasbourg] Court intended to depart from the fundamental principle that to come within the ambit of Article 1 of the First Protocol, a property right must be established. ...", "... A deceased widow's entitlement to benefits depends upon the contributions of the deceased husband. ... A widower has no entitlement under domestic legislation arising from the contributions of his deceased spouse. He thus has no entitlement and consequently no possession within the meaning of Article 1 of the First Protocol.\u201d", "26. Prior to his examination of whether there was objective justification for non-payment of the widow's pension to widowers, Mr Justice Moses observed:", "\u201cOnly Mr Naylor's case raises the issue of Widow's Pension. Although other claimants, in their written argument, raised the issue of future entitlement to Widow's Pension, such a claim is hypothetical, since they are too young to claim it now and may never become entitled should they re-marry, ... or should they co-habit ...\u201d", "Mr Justice Moses concluded that there was objective justification for the difference in treatment between widows and widowers as regards entitlement to a widow's pension under the 1992 Act."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "14", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
