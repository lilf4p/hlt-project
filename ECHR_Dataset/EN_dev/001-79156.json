A copy of the request for an investigation is normally sent to the applicant later, together with a summons to appear before the investigating judge (section 169/4 of the CPA).", "48. The public prosecutor's request for an investigation requires a decision by the investigating judge. The investigating judge may comply with the request and open a criminal investigation or, if he does not agree with it, refer it to the interlocutory-proceedings chamber of three judges (zunaj obravnavni senat) for them to decide. Appeals may be lodged against the decision dismissing or upholding the request (section 169 of the CPA).", "49. After the closure of the criminal investigation the public prosecutor prefers a formal indictment or otherwise drops the charges (sections 184 and 268 of the CPA).", "50. As regards the guarantee of the right to a trial within a reasonable time, the CPA, as far as relevant, provides (sections 15, 185 and 286 respectively):", "\u201cThe court shall use its best endeavours to ensure that the proceedings are conducted without unnecessary delay and that any abuse of the rights of participants in the proceedings is prevented.", "(1) If the criminal investigation is not completed within six months, the investigating judge shall inform the president of the court of the reasons.", "(2) The president of the court shall take the necessary measures to complete the investigation.", "(3) The presiding judge shall schedule the main hearing within a maximum period of two months after an indictment has been referred...
