The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Pruszcz Gda\u0144ski.", "6. On 8 June 2004 he was arrested by the police.", "7. On 9 June 2004 the Gda\u0144sk District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) decided to place the applicant in pre-trial detention as there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that he had been dealing in drugs. The court also cited the risk that the applicant would go into hiding, in view of the likelihood of a heavy sentence.", "8. On 2 September and 4 November 2004 the applicant\u2019s detention was extended. In addition to the two grounds given previously, the District Court cited the need to ensure the proper conduct of the investigation.", "9. On 26 October 2004 the applicant was indicted before the Gda\u0144sk District Court. His pre-trial detention was subsequently extended.", "10. As the length of the applicant\u2019s detention had reached the statutory timelimit of two years laid down in Article 263 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Kodeks post\u0119powania karnego), the District Court made a series of applications to the Gda\u0144sk Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) for the applicant\u2019s detention to be extended beyond that term. On 18 May and 17 August 2006 the Gda\u0144sk Court of Appeal granted the applications and extended his detention, citing the reasonable suspicion against the applicant and the length of the sentence that was likely to be imposed.

The applicant\u2019s detention on remand was not extended beyond that date and on 20 November 2006 he was released.", "15. On 4 August 2006 the applicant lodged a complaint under section 5 of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w post\u0119powaniu s\u0105dowym bez nieuzasadnionej zw\u0142oki) (\u201cthe 2004 Act\u201d).
