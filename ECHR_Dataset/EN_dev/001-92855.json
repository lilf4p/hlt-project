The applicant is a university professor of ancient history and archeology who was appointed at Klagenfurt University in 1998.

On 6 July 2001 the applicant claimed reimbursement of the remaining removal costs in the sum of EUR 4,684.40 and payment of the household allowance in the sum of EUR 5,443.70, plus 4.5% interest since August 1999.", "7.

The applicant appealed on 29 January 2002 to the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture (\u201cthe Ministry\u201d).", "9. The Ministry did not decide within the statutory six-month time-limit laid down in section 73 \u00a7 1 of the General Administrative Proceedings Act. In August 2002 the applicant brought court proceedings relating to the claims at issue. A conditional settlement was reached but was revoked by the applicant in January 2003. The applicant\u2019s action was dismissed in February 2003.", "10. Meanwhile, on 18 November 2002, the applicant complained to the Administrative Court under Article 132 of the Federal Constitution about the administration\u2019s failure to determine his claim.

By decision of 25 July 2006 the Ministry referred the case back to the Dean of Klagenfurt University for a new decision.

The hearing took place on 20 November 2006. According to the minutes the hearing served the purpose of establishing the plausibility of the applicant\u2019s claims as submitted on 6 July 2001 and supplemented on 8 May 2006 and to determine their amount with the participation of the applicant. It is then noted that, in the light of the explanations given, the costs and interest claimed seemed plausible. At the close of the hearing the parties concluded a friendly settlement with the following terms:", "\u201c(a) Klagenfurt University thus declares its willingness to transfer, in addition to the payment already made of EUR 4,000 and the regulated transport costs in the amount of EUR 5,699.21, the lump-sum of EUR 10,000 within 14 days to the account of Professor Strobel.", "(b) Professor Strobel, for his part, withdraws all requests in connection with the proceedings at issue.
