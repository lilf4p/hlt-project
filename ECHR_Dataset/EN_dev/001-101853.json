The first applicant, Mr Greens, was serving a determinate sentence of imprisonment at HM Prison Peterhead at the time his application was lodged with the Court. He was eligible for release on parole from 29 May 2010. It is not known whether he has been released on parole. The second applicant, M.T., is currently serving a determinate sentence of imprisonment at HM Prison Peterhead. According to information provided by the Government, he is scheduled to be released in November 2010.", "8. On 23 June 2008 the applicants posted voter registration forms to the Electoral Registration Officer (\u201cERO\u201d) for Grampian. They sought registration on the electoral register at their address in HM Prison Peterhead.", "9. On 3 July 2008, the ERO replied referring to previous applications for registration which were refused in 2007 under sections 3 and 4 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, as amended, (see paragraph 19 and 21 below) on the basis of the applicants' status as convicted persons currently detained. The ERO requested clarification of whether there had been a change in circumstances in the applicants' cases.", "10. On 5 August 2008 the applicants wrote to the ERO arguing that following the Court's decision in Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) [GC], no. 74025/01, ECHR 2005IX, and the declaration of incompatibility made by the Registration Appeal Court in the case of Smith v. Scott (see paragraphs 27-30 below), the ERO was obliged to add their names to the electoral register.", "11. On 12 August 2008, the ERO refused the applicants' registration applications on the basis of their status as convicted persons detained in a penal institution.", "12. By letter of 14 August 2008 the applicants informed the ERO of their wish to appeal to the Sheriff Court against the refusal.", "13. On 12 September 2008 the Sheriff considered the applicants' appeals together with appeals in a number of other similar cases and ordered written representations to be lodged.", "14. On 25 September 2008 the applicants wrote to the court summarising their position. They provided further submissions on 1 October 2008. The applicants alleged that legal aid was not available for the proceedings and they therefore represented themselves.", "15. On 10 November 2008 the applicants' appeals were refused.", "16. On 20 November 2008 another serving prisoner whose appeal was also refused on 10 November 2008, Mr Beggs, applied to Aberdeen Sheriff Court to request that it state a case for the opinion of the Registration Appeal Court (see paragraph 22 below). On 30 December 2008, the Sheriff refused to state a case. Mr Beggs subsequently applied to the Court of Session for an order requiring the Sheriff to state a case, on the ground that the Sheriff had erred in law in refusing to do so. The most recent information available to the Court was that those proceedings were pending. It is not clear whether that remains the case.", "17.

In Smith v. Scott, the Registration Appeal Court considered the refusal of the ERO for Clackmannanshire, Falkirk and Stirling to enrol a convicted prisoner on the electoral register on the basis of sections 3 and 4 of the 1983 Act, in anticipation of elections to the Scottish Parliament. The Secretary of State conceded in the proceedings that in light of the judgment of this Court in Hirst section 3(1) of the 1983 Act was incompatible with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention and that the appellant's rights under that Article had been violated. He also accepted that for the purposes of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 the Scottish Parliament was a legislature. The court, handing down its judgment on 24 January 2007, summarised the matters for examination in the following terms:", "\u201c1. Since section 3(1) of the 1983 Act, giving the words of that provision their ordinary meaning, was incompatible with Article 3 of the First Protocol, the Court should consider whether it was possible, in terms of section 3(1) of the Human Rights Act, to read it down in such a way as to make it compatible. If that was possible, it should be done and the appeal should be allowed.", "2. If, however, that was not possible, then the appeal would be refused but the Court should consider whether it could and should make a declaration of incompatibility in respect of section 3(1) of the 1983 Act in terms of the Human Rights Act section 4(2). If that could be done, it should be.", "3. If the Court did not take that course, it should consider, in the context of the requirement in terms of section 6 of the Human Rights Act for the Court not to act in a manner incompatible with the appellant's Convention rights, whether by refusing the appeal and providing the appellant with no remedy it would be acting in breach of that statutory requirement. If it would, then the Court was obliged to give such remedy as was open to it within its powers at common law or under any statute. Such a remedy would include granting a declarator that the appellant's rights under Article 3 of the First Protocol of the Convention had been violated. It was open to the Court in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction to grant such a declarator.\u201d", "28. Counsel for the appellant argued that if there was some \u201cpossible\u201d interpretation (or \u201creading down\u201d) of section 3(1) of the 1983 Act which would remove the incompatibility identified by this Court in Hirst, the Registration Appeal Court should adopt it. He considered that insertion of words to the effect that any ban on prisoner voting \u201cwould apply at the discretion of the sentencing judge\u201d would qualify, but not contradict, the \u201cgrain of the legislation\u201d and that the case should accordingly be resolved along those lines. Counsel for the respondent submitted that while section 3 of the Human Rights Act empowered the court to interpret legislation, where possible, in a certain way, it did not entitle the court to amend or reverse clear legislative provisions, nor otherwise to usurp the legislative function of Parliament. The court summarised counsel's argument as follows:", "\u201c26. ... section 3(1) of the 1983 Act clearly provided for a blanket ban on voting which applied to all convicted prisoners serving custodial sentences. There was thus no 'grain of the legislation' which could properly serve as a starting point for any interpretation designed to clothe some or all of such prisoners with voting rights. Over and above that, it was necessary to recognise the complexity of the issues which had been opened up by the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Hirst, and the extensive consultation which would have to be undertaken before the Government could form a view as to the appropriate way forward. Since the Convention rights conferred by Article 3 of the First Protocol were in no way absolute, there were many possible levels at which the line might be drawn for the enfranchisement or disenfranchisement of convicted prisoners in different categories, and it could be no part of this Court's function to make an uninformed choice among such alternatives.\u201d", "29. The court continued:", "\u201c27. Against that background, we are clearly of the opinion that the appellant's submission must be rejected and we decline to 'read down' section 3(1) of the 1983 Act in the manner proposed ... In our opinion to read down section 3(1) of the 1983 Act as providing for full or partial enfranchisement of convicted prisoners serving custodial sentences would be ... to depart substantially from a fundamental feature of the legislation. Without the benefit of consultation or advice, this Court would, in a real sense, be legislating on its own account, especially in view of the wide range of policy alternatives from which a 'possible' solution would require to be selected ...\u201d", "30. The court, however, made a declaration of incompatibility in respect of section 3(1) of the 1983 Act.", "31. On 20 April 2007, the Outer House of the Court of Session considered the disenfranchisement of prisoners in judicial review proceedings challenging the legality of an order made by the Secretary of State for Scotland regarding the organisation of the elections to the Scottish Parliament in May 2007 and the involvement of the Scottish Executive in those elections. The challenge was based on the provisions of the Scotland Act 1998 and in particular the requirement that Scottish legislation and acts of the Scottish Executive be compatible with the Convention. Lord Malcolm rejected the claim for interdict (injunction), emphasising that it was for Parliament to decide whether to remove the incompatibility between domestic legislation and the Convention.", "32. On the question of declaratory relief, he added:", "\u201c11. I should record that I was asked to repeat the declarator of incompatibility pronounced in Smith. There is no dispute in these petitions as to the incompatibility between section 3 of the 1983 Act and article 3 of the first protocol. The discussion focused on other matters. That incompatibility has been authoritatively determined in Smith. I am satisfied that a further declarator in these proceedings is unnecessary and inappropriate ...\u201d", "33. In the case of Toner and Walsh, two convicted prisoners sought, in light of Hirst, a declaration that the disqualification of convicted prisoners from voting did not apply to elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly. After careful consideration of the judgment of this Court in Hirst and the decision of the Registration Appeal Court in Scott v. Smith, Gillen J held:", "\u201c9(iv). I consider that the [Strasbourg] court has deliberately left the method of compliance in the hands of the Contracting States subject to the overriding veto of the court ... Accordingly I see nothing intrinsically objectionable about the various options being explored by the Government proposals contained in the consultation paper of 14/12/06 which makes up its response to the Hirst decision. The consequence of this is that not only is Mr Sweeney [Deputy Director, Rights and International Relations in the Political Directorate at the Northern Ireland Office] entitled to say ... that the Government is unlikely to propose that prisoners serving sentences as long as those of the applicants should become entitled to vote whilst detained, but I am left singularly unconvinced that the applicants are currently or will ever be able to lay claim to a right to vote. I reject the argument of Mr Larkin [for the applicants] that because a blanket prohibition on prisoners is incompatible with the Convention that somehow converts into the proposition that all prisoners are currently entitled to vote until the vacuum is filled. In my view that conforms neither with principle nor logic and certainly does not find any authority in Hirst which expressly recognises that restraints on Article 3 Protocol 1 are justifiable provided they pursue a legitimate aim and are proportionate.\u201d", "34. In judicial review proceedings brought in the High Court in Chester v. Secretary of State for Justice and another, the claimant, a prisoner, argued that his disqualification from voting in the then pending June 2009 European Parliament elections breached his rights under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 and under European Union law. He was granted permission to bring his claim on 27 March 2009. At the hearing before Burton J, he argued that section 8 of the 2002 (see paragraph 23 above) Act should be \u201cread down\u201d in order to enable him to vote or, in the alternative, a declaration of incompatibility as regards section 3 of the 1983 Act and section 8 of the 2002 Act should be made. He accepted that no argument could be mounted that a \u201creading down\u201d of section 3 of the 1983 Act would be feasible, within the parameters of the Human Rights Act.", "35. The claim was dismissed by Burton J on 28 October 2009. As to the possibility of \u201creading down\u201d section 8, Burton J held:", "\u201c29. ... I am being asked effectively to draft fresh legislation by bolting on to existing legislation additional words which not only dramatically change its nature, but are imminently to be considered by the Legislature. Two competing alternatives are presented to me for consideration. One of these affects the franchise by allowing all convicted prisoners to vote. The other amends the statute so as to allow one particular category of convicted prisoners, the post-tariff lifers, to vote, while still retaining a bar on all other prisoners, including those only serving very short terms of imprisonment, to whom it seems, on any basis, the Government is proposing that the franchise should be extended; and to make such differentiation simply because the claimant in this case happens to be one of the category in whose favour the statute would now be amended.", "30. The first proposal is not acceptable, not least for the same reasons as were enunciated by Gillen J in paragraph 9(iv) of his judgment [in Toner and Walsh], which I have cited earlier. Enfranchisement of all prisoners, including those with a minimum term/tariff of life which may or may not be what the legislature after full consultation and discussion of all the issues may consider, but it would be a dramatic change, was not, as Gillen J points out, required by Hirst. As for the alternative, selection of one particular category of prisoner simply because one of that category happens to be the Claimant, to effect what would in fact be a substantial amendment of the legislation, but only as to one category of convicted prisoner, cannot be an appropriate exercise of this jurisdiction. It would lead to piecemeal and possibly continuous amendments, without consideration by Parliament, of legislation dealing with matters of important social policy, all depending upon which claimant happened to be before the Court at any one time.\u201d", "36. Burton J concluded that if and in so far as section 8 of the 2002 Act was incompatible with the Convention or with EU law, reading it down was not an available remedy.", "37. As to whether it would be appropriate to make a declaration of incompatibility in respect of section 3 of the 1983 Act, Burton J concluded:", "\u201c34. ... I am content to say that there is no need for any declaration to be made by yet another court, as one has already been made which is binding on the UK Government.", "35. However, towards the end of his submissions, Mr Southey [for the claimant] put forward another basis upon which to support his case for such a declaration. He submitted that, as the grant of a declaration is discretionary, there is no reason why it cannot be made again, if it is made on different grounds. He submits that I can and should make a declaration that s3 of the 1983 Act is incompatible with the ECHR, and do so by reference to the fact that it excludes (together with all other convicted prisoners) post-tariff lifers. Then there would be some point in making the declaration, given that the Government's proposed legislation seems, subject to what may have emerged from the second consultation, to be intended not to make any change in their position. Hence, it would be a declaration as to the incompatibility with regard to the present legislation, but to be made because it does not appear as if there is going to be any amelioration of his client's position by reference to the proposed legislation. This would effectively simply amount to the declaration of incompatibility being a peg upon which Mr Southey can hang his substantive submissions, to which I shall come in a moment. Subject however to that argument ... I reject his suggestion that I should make a declaration of incompatibility.\u201d", "38. In respect of the application for a declaration of incompatibility as regards section 8 of the 2002 Act, Burton J said:", "\u201c43. I am satisfied that, but for Mr Southey's 'proposed legislation argument', this course is wholly inappropriate as a matter of discretion:", "(i) Simply as a matter of context and background, there is no presently intended European election, to which alone s8 would apply ... These proceedings were brought at the time when the June 2009 European elections were still in the future. There will now not be further such elections for 5 years. By that time, whatever the Claimant's personal position may be, new legislation, whatever it may be, will be well in place (and will have been capable of challenge, if appropriate).", "(ii) More significantly, it is plain that the challenge to s8 is purely parasitic to the real challenge, which is to s3. S8 merely provides that (with the exceptions discussed) the same people can vote in European elections as can vote in UK elections. When there is new legislation in place of s3, s8 will automatically follow. A declaration has already been made in relation to s3, upon which s8 wholly hangs, and legislation is to be put before Parliament with the intention of curing the contravention of the ECHR.", "44. For the reasons I have given, namely that there is already a declaration of such incompatibility in relation to the governing section, s3, upon which s8 entirely depends, the same reasons drive me to conclude that there is no basis in the exercise of my discretion to grant a declaration of incompatibility in relation to s8, any more than there is to s3 ...\u201d", "39. On the need for a further declaration of incompatibility as a result of the apparently limited scope of the proposed legislation, Burton J considered that any declaratory or other relief which was intended to interfere with the process by which new legislation resulting from the consultation process was put before and debated by Parliament was inappropriate and was not to be granted. In any case, he concluded that the court was:", "\u201c... ill-equipped to decide this issue of social policy, and certainly ill-equipped to legislate and provide for the consequences of any view, plain and obvious or otherwise, as to which category of prisoners ought to be enfranchised as a result of the removal of the absolute ban.\u201d", "40. The claimant appealed and on 13 May 2010, was granted leave to appeal by the Court of Appeal. The appeal was heard on 3 November 2010 and the judgment is pending.", "41. In its recent report, \u201cEnhancing Parliament's role in relation to human rights judgments\u201d, 15th Report of 2009-10, published in March 2010, a parliamentary committee, the Joint Committee on Human Rights, considered domestic developments in the execution of the Grand Chamber's judgment in Hirst and noted:", "\u201c108. ... our overriding disappointment is at the lack of progress in this case. We regret that the Government has not yet published the outcome of its second consultation, which closed almost 6 months ago, in September 2009. This appears to show a lack of commitment on the part of the Government to proposing a solution for Parliament to consider.", "...", "116. It is now almost 5 years since the judgment of the Grand Chamber in Hirst v UK. The Government consultation was finally completed in September 2009. Since then, despite the imminent general election, the Government has not brought forward proposals for consideration by Parliament. We reiterate our view, often repeated, that the delay in this case has been unacceptable.", "...", "117. ... Where a breach of the Convention is identified, individuals are entitled to an effective remedy by Article 13 ECHR. So long as the Government continues to delay removal of the blanket ban on prisoner voting, it risks not only political embarrassment at the Council of Europe, but also the potentially significant cost of repeat litigation and any associated compensation.\u201d", "42. On 2 November 2010 a short debate took place in the House of Commons following a question to the Government regarding their plans to give prisoners the right to vote. In the course of that debate, the Minister emphasised that the Government were under a legal obligation to change the law following the judgment in Hirst. He said that the Government were actively considering how to implement the judgment and that once decisions had been made, legislative proposals would be brought forward.", "43. On 3 November 2010, in response to a question in the House of Commons, the Prime Minister also emphasised that the Government were required to come forward with proposals to implement the Court's judgment in Hirst.", "44. On 3 December 2009, in the context of their supervision of the execution of the Court's judgment in Hirst, the Committee of Ministers adopted Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2009)160, which stated as follows:", "\u201cThe Committee of Ministers, ...", "Recalling that, in the present judgment, the Court found that the general, automatic and indiscriminate restriction on the right of convicted prisoners in custody to vote, fell outside any acceptable margin of appreciation and was incompatible with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention;", "Recalling that the Court, while acknowledging that the rights bestowed by Article 3 of Protocol 1 are not absolute, expressly noted that in the present case the blanket restriction applied automatically to all prisoners, irrespective of the length of their sentence, the nature or gravity of their offence and their individual circumstances;", "Recalling further that the Court found 'no evidence that Parliament has ever sought to weigh the competing interests or to assess the proportionality of a blanket ban on the right of a convicted prisoner to vote';", "Noting that the blanket restriction imposed by Section 3 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 remains in full force and effect;", "Recalling that the United Kingdom authorities, in a revised Action Plan submitted in December 2006, committed to undertaking a two-stage consultation process to determine the measures necessary to implement the judgment of the Court, with a view to introducing the necessary draft legislation before Parliament in May 2008;", "Noting that the United Kingdom authorities have provided detailed information as regards the consultation process, and that they are committed to continuing to do so;", "Noting however that the second consultation stage ended on 29 September 2009, and the United Kingdom authorities are now undertaking a detailed analysis of the responses thereto, in order to determine how best to implement a system of prisoner enfranchisement based on the length of custodial sentence handed down to prisoners,", "EXPRESSES SERIOUS CONCERN that the substantial delay in implementing the judgment has given rise to a significant risk that the next United Kingdom general election, which must take place by June 2010, will be performed in a way that fails to comply with the Convention;", "URGES the respondent state, following the end of the second stage consultation period, to rapidly adopt the measures necessary to implement the judgment of the Court;", "...\u201d", "45.
