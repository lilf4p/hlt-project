The applicant is a Turkish citizen who was born in 1957 and lives in Istanbul.", "9. At the material time, the applicant was the major shareholder in Deniz Bas\u0131n Yay\u0131n Sanayi ve Ticaret Organizasyon, a Turkish limited liability company which owns a weekly review entitled Haberde Yorumda Ger\u00e7ek (The Truth of News and Comments), published in Istanbul.", "10. In issue no. 51 of the review, dated 13 March 1993, a news commentary entitled \u201cKawa and Dehak Once Again\u201d was published. The article analysed possible events, which could occur during the upcoming celebrations of Newroz.", "11. A translation of the relevant parts of the news commentary is as follows:", "\u201c... It\u2019s Newroz week in Kurdistan. The biggest confrontation between the demands of the Kurdish people and intolerance in the face of the expression of these demands occurs during these days. The tradition of rebellion is awakened. Dehak and Kawa are once again invested with flesh and bones. It is time to settle accounts. There is nothing vague about Kawa. All the mountains, all the cities are full of Kawa. There are millions of them. All right, who, then, is Dehak? Who is the candidate for representing Dehak in our day? Is it Demirel? Is it G\u00fcre\u015f? The regional Governor? Or the new commander \u0130lter? This time round, is Dehak represented by every counter-insurgency chief, indeed, every counter-insurgency operative, every special team member, every police commissioner or superintendent officer? Has Dehak become anonymous too? Be it as it may, but Dehak and Kawa will settle their accounts once again. ...", "Last year, a revolutionary publication described the days preceding Newroz as follows:", "\u2018Nowadays over 200 thousand soldiers massed into Kurdistan. Tanks and weapons are sent over. Bombs are raining on Kurdish villages and mountains. The Chief of the General Staff has inspected the preparations for the offensive. Instructions are being issued to provincial and district governors, special team leaders, police chiefs and military officials. The Head of M\u0130T intelligence agency talks of the prospect of much blood being shed. Members of Parliament are organising information-gathering trips in order to take the pulse of the people.\u2019 ...", "Unlike previous years, the PKK-leaning Kurdistan National Assembly (KUM) is also expected to take on a role during Newroz this year. ...", "On the other hand emergency measures are being implemented in large cities outside Kurdistan where there are concentrations of Kurdish people. It is highly likely that there will be large demonstrations in the Kurdish quarters there.\u201d", "12. In the same issue and within the context of the above news commentary, an interview was also published by the Kurdish News Agency with a representative of the National Liberation Front of Kurdistan (\u201cthe ERNK\u201d), the political wing of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (\u201cthe PKK\u201d). Both organisations are illegal under Turkish law.", "13. A translation of the relevant part of the interview is as follows:", "\u201c... We wish to emphasise this finding, indeed, we feel that it ought to be underlined. And we call on all European countries. We are open to any humanitarian, political solution, including the calls for an armistice. The PKK movement and its struggle are absolutely not terrorist movements. This misapprehension must be abandoned \u2013 it must definitely be abandoned \u2013 and a move must be made towards co-operation and support. The real terrorist is the Republic of Turkey. We believe that attitudes on this matter will be much clarified this year, that very positive dialogues will develop and that the Republic of Turkey will be gradually further isolated.\u201d", "14. On 14 March 1993 the Istanbul National Security Court (\u0130stanbul Devlet G\u00fcvenlik Mahkemesi) ordered the seizure of all copies of issue no. 51 of the review, since it allegedly disseminated separatist propaganda.", "15. In an indictment dated 22 April 1993, the Public Prosecutor at the Istanbul National Security Court, on account of the publication of the above news commentary, charged the applicant in his capacity as the owner of the review with disseminating propaganda against the indivisibility of the State. He was also charged with publishing the declaration of the ERNK (see paragraph 12 above). The charges were brought under sections 8 and 6 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 (hereinafter \u201cthe 1991 Act\u201d: see paragraphs 24 and 25 below), respectively.", "16. In the proceedings before the Istanbul National Security Court, the applicant denied the charges. He pleaded that the incriminated news commentary did not fall within the scope of section 8 of the 1991 Act. He maintained that arguing and commenting on possible activities in which the PKK might engage during the Newroz celebrations could not be regarded as publishing a declaration of a terrorist organisation within the meaning of section 6 of the 1991 Act. As regards his freedom of expression, the applicant referred to Article 10 of the Convention and the case-law of the Commission and the Court. He stated that pluralism of opinion was essential in a democratic society including opinions which shock or offend. He argued that the provisions of sections 6 and 8 of the 1991 Act restricted freedom of expression in contravention of the Turkish Constitution and the criteria laid down in the case-law of the Commission and the Court.", "17. In a judgment dated 27 September 1993, the Istanbul National Security Court found the applicant guilty of an offence under section 8 \u00a7 2 of the 1991 Act. The court first sentenced the applicant to a fine of 100,000,000 Turkish liras. However, having regard to the applicant\u2019s good conduct during the trial, it reduced the fine to 83,333,333 Turkish liras.", "18. In its reasoning, the court held that the incriminated news commentary contravened section 8 of the 1991 Act. The court concluded that it referred to a certain part of the Turkish territory as \u201cKurdistan\u201d as well as a certain section of the population as \u201cKurds\u201d, and amounted to propaganda against the indivisibility of the Turkish State.", "The court further observed that the review had also published the declaration of an illegal terrorist organisation in which the Republic of Turkey was referred to as a terrorist State. However, it considered that the declaration constituted part of the incriminated news commentary. Having regard to the provisions of Article 79 of the Turkish Criminal Code, the court found no grounds for a separate conviction under section 6 of the 1991 Act.", "19. The applicant appealed against his conviction to the Court of Cassation. He relied on the defence grounds which he had invoked at his trial before the National Security Court.", "20. On 8 February 1994 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal, upholding the National Security Court\u2019s reasoning and its assessment of the evidence.", "On 29 November 1995 the applicant paid the last instalment of the fine imposed on him.", "21. Following the amendments made by Law No. 4126 of 27 October 1995 to the 1991 Act (see paragraphs 24 and 25 below), the Istanbul National Security Court ex officio re-examined the applicant\u2019s case.", "On 22 April 1996 the court ruled that these amendments did not affect the applicant\u2019s case as his sentence had already been executed.", "22. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code read as follows:", "\u201cIn the event of conviction, the court shall order the seizure and confiscation of any object which has been used for the commission or preparation of the crime or offence\u2026\u201d", "Article 79", "\u201cA person who infringes various provisions of this Code by a single act, shall be punished under the provision which prescribes the heaviest punishment.\u201d", "23.

The relevant provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 read as follows:", "\u201cIt shall be an offence, punishable by a fine of from five million to ten million Turkish liras, to announce, orally or in the form of a publication, that terrorist organisations will commit an offence against a specific person, whether or not that person\u2019s ... identity is divulged provided that it is done in such a manner that he or she may be identified, or to reveal the identity of civil servants who have participated in anti-terrorist operations or to designate any person as a target.", "It shall be an offence, punishable by a fine of from five million to ten million Turkish liras, to print or publish declarations or leaflets emanating from terrorist organisations.", "\u2026", "Where the offences contemplated in the above paragraphs are committed through the medium of periodicals within the meaning of section 3 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680), the publisher shall also be liable to a fine equal to ninety per cent of the income from the average sales for the previous month if the periodical appears more frequently than monthly, or from the sales of the previous issue if the periodical appears monthly or less frequently, or from the average sales for the previous month of the daily newspaper with the largest circulation if the offence involves printed matter other than periodicals or if the periodical has just been launched.

The penalty imposed on a reoffender may not be commuted to a fine.", "Where the crime of propaganda contemplated in the first paragraph is committed through the medium of periodicals within the meaning of section 3 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680), the publisher shall also be liable to a fine equal to ninety per cent of the income from the average sales for the previous month if the periodical appears more frequently than monthly.

The Government supplied copies of several decisions given by the prosecutor attached to the Istanbul National Security Court withdrawing charges against persons suspected of inciting people to hatred or hostility, especially on religious grounds (Article 312 of the Criminal Code), or of disseminating separatist propaganda against the indivisible unity of the State (section 8 of Law no. 3713 \u2013 see paragraph 23 above). In the majority of cases where offences had been committed by means of publications the reasons given for the prosecutor\u2019s decisions included such considerations as the fact that the proceedings were time-barred, that some of the constituent elements of the offence could not be made out or that there was insufficient evidence. Other grounds included the fact that the publications in issue had not been distributed, that there had been no unlawful intent, that no offence had been committed or that those responsible could not be identified.", "28. Furthermore, the Government submitted a number of decisions of the National Security Courts as examples of cases in which defendants accused of the above-mentioned offences had been found not guilty.

As regards more particularly proceedings against authors of works dealing with the Kurdish problem, the National Security Courts in these cases reached their decisions on the ground that there had been no dissemination of \u201cpropaganda\u201d, one of the constituent elements of the offence, or on account of the scientific, historical and/or objective nature of the words used.", "30.
