At the material time, the first applicant, Mr \u00dcmit Erdo\u011fdu, was the responsible editor of the monthly review Demokrat Muhalefet! (\u201cDemocratic Opposition!\u201d), published in Istanbul. In the January 1992 issue of the review, an interview which the second applicant, Mr Selami \u0130nce, had conducted with a Turkish sociologist, Dr \u0130.B., was published.", "9. A translation of the relevant parts of the interview is as follows:", "\u201cQ: How and to what extent will Demirel accept the \u2018Kurdish reality\u2019? Can his understanding of the \u2018reality\u2019 be deemed to represent State policy?", "A: \u2026 The government is forced to accept certain facts now that there is armed resistance in Kurdistan. ... Violence by the Turkish forces could not stop the escalation and progress of the PKK [Workers\u2019 Party of Kurdistan] ...", "Q: How will the State shape its new official policy on Kurdistan? Which aspects of the official ideology will be changed and how will they be changed? What effects can this have on the daily lives of the Kurdish people?", "A: \u2026 In Turkey, the government and the State are two very different things. The State functions through institutions and bodies, members of which are designated by appointment. These institutions and bodies represent the power of the State. The government, i.e. the political power, carries very little weight against the power of the State. That is why governments can be overthrown by the State authority so often. Official ideology can only be changed in the long term and the forces which are capable of changing it are non-governmental political and social forces and their struggle. The essence of the ideas and action of the PKK, for example, is such as can change the official ideology, reduce the influence of the appointed bodies of Turkey\u2019s political scene, and increase the weight of parliaments elected by the people. In my opinion, de facto, the influence of the Kurds and, in particular, that of the PKK, will grow further. The influence of the PKK in both the Kurdish and the Turkish societies will spread and deepen. And, as that influence grows, more serious steps will be taken by governments in their policies towards recognising the \u2018Kurdish reality\u2019. It is evident that the State will try to obstruct the government in that process and will try to distort certain ideas and policies. And it is also manifest that the government will be able to survive so long as it can resist the power of the State and control the appointed institutions and bodies, i.e. so long as it has real power.", "These changes will be reflected in the daily lives of the Kurds. Investigations and research will develop in fields such as the Kurdish language, history and folklore. Kurdish culture will be revived. The specificity of a Kurdish society will be emphasised more amongst the Kurdish masses. National awareness and desire for liberation will become stronger and will spread further. The idea and feelings for independence will develop.", "Q: It is now observed that Kurds who, until now, would never have said \u2018I am Kurdish and I am engaging in politics for my present life and for my future\u2019 are now clearly beginning \u2018to get into politics for their own interests\u2019 throughout Kurdistan and Turkey. What sort of developments have brought about this situation? Do Kurds need a political subject in the legal sphere? If so, what form should it take?", "A: Without any doubt, the most important cause of these developments has been the armed combat which the PKK has been waging for almost eight years. The guerrilla warfare has brought about major social and political changes in traditional Kurdish society. Traditional values are in turmoil. There has been very widespread support amongst the people for Kurdish guerrilla fighters ever since 15 August 1984. National awareness is now growing in Kurdish society and this process is spreading rapidly. And we see that, within this process, the political establishment has been used for Kurdish interests, for the move towards autonomy and independence. Kurds, who have always been engaged in politics for others and in order to serve other nations, are now engaged in politics in order to serve the Kurdish people. Healthy national awareness is now developing in response to Turkish racism and colonialism. It would no doubt be over-simplifying to say that all this began after the onset of Kurdish guerrilla warfare on 15 August. This process has roots that go further back into the past but what has been decisive is the new process launched by the PKK. ... Who is illegal in Kurdistan? The guerrillas or the special team of the Turkish armed forces? ...", "Q: What should be done to counteract the wave of chauvinist Turkish nationalism encouraged by the right-wing press and the MCP [Nationalist Workers\u2019 Party]? Is there a possibility of a confrontation between the Turkish and Kurdish peoples? How could that be prevented?", "A: \u2026 Kurds are dying for their nation. What are the Turks dying for? What are they doing in Kurdistan?", "Q: It has been under discussion for some time that the PKK hegemony in Kurdistan has reached a stage where one can now talk of a \u2018double power\u2019. \u00d6calan has mentioned in his writings an orientation towards the \u2018formation of a Government-State\u2019 in the Botan-Behdinan region. Are there any signs of what the future interventions of the PKK will be in Kurdistan and in Turkish politics?", "A: \u2026 The Turkish State has already withdrawn its soldiers and evacuated police stations in some regions such as Botan. ... This could be perceived as the beginning of the formation of a State ...\u201d", "10. In an indictment dated 23 March 1992 the public prosecutor at the Istanbul National Security Court (\u0130stanbul Devlet G\u00fcvenlik Mahkemesi) charged the applicants with having disseminated propaganda against the indivisibility of the State by publishing the above interview. The charges were brought under section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 (hereinafter \u201cthe 1991 Act\u201d \u2013 see paragraph 19 below).", "11. In the proceedings before the National Security Court, the applicants denied the charges. They pleaded that the incriminated interview was a mere transcript of Dr. \u0130.B.\u2019s statements. They maintained that the publication of an interview could not constitute an offence and that similar views had been expressed by the highest authorities in Turkey.", "12. In a judgment dated 12 August 1993 the Istanbul National Security Court found the applicants guilty of offences under section 8 of the 1991 Act. The first applicant was sentenced under the second paragraph of section 8 to five months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of 41,666,666 Turkish liras (TRL). The second applicant was sentenced under the first paragraph of section 8 to one year and eight months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of TRL 41,666,666.", "13. In its reasoning, the court relied on certain extracts from the interviewee\u2019s statements as published. It held that the following phrases amounted to propaganda against the indivisibility of the State: \u201c... the government is forced to accept certain facts now that there is armed resistance in Kurdistan ...\u201d; \u201c... Violence by the Turkish forces could not stop the escalation and progress of the PKK ...\u201d; \u201c... The essence of the ideas and action of the PKK ... can change the official ideology ...\u201d; \u201c... the influence of the Kurds and, in particular, that of the PKK, will grow further. The influence of the PKK in both the Kurdish and the Turkish societies will spread and deepen ...\u201d; \u201c... National awareness and desire for liberation will become stronger and will spread further. The idea and feelings for independence will develop ...\u201d; \u201c... the most important cause of these developments has been the armed combat which the PKK has been waging for almost eight years ...\u201d; \u201c... Who is illegal in Kurdistan? The guerrillas or the special team of the Turkish armed forces? ...\u201d; \u201c... Kurds are dying for their nation. What are the Turks dying for? What are they doing in Kurdistan? ...\u201d; \u201c... The Turkish State has already withdrawn its soldiers and evacuated police stations in some regions such as Botan ...\u201d; \u201c... This could be perceived as the beginning of the formation of a State ...\u201d.", "14. The applicants appealed against their conviction. On 1 February 1994 the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeals. It upheld the National Security Court\u2019s assessment of the evidence and its reasons for rejecting the applicants\u2019 defence. The judgment was served on the applicants on 21 February 1994.", "15. Following the amendments made by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995 to the 1991 Act (see paragraphs 19 and 20 below), the Istanbul National Security Court ex officio re-examined the applicants\u2019 cases.", "On 15 December 1995 the court sentenced the first applicant to five months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of TRL 41,666,666 and the second applicant to one year, one month and ten days\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of TRL 111,111,110. The court ordered that the execution of the sentences be suspended on probation.", "16. The applicants appealed against these sentences. On 7 April 1997 the Court of Cassation quashed the National Security Court\u2019s judgment. Concerning Mr Erdo\u011fdu, the Court of Cassation pointed out that he had been prosecuted in his capacity as responsible editor and, therefore, the prison sentence imposed on him should have been converted into a fine in default of which the sentence was unlawful. Concerning Mr \u0130nce, the Court of Cassation found that his lawyer had not been properly notified about the date of the hearing before the National Security Court.", "17. On 9 September 1997 the National Security Court held a hearing. Having regard to the provisions of Law no. 4304 which had entered into force on 14 August 1997, the court decided to defer the imposition of a final sentence on Mr Erdo\u011fdu, pursuant to section 1 of that Law. This decision remained subject to the conditions laid down under section 2 (see paragraph 21 below). The court maintained Mr \u0130nce\u2019s conviction and the sentence imposed on him, the execution of which was, however, suspended in the light of his good conduct during the trial.", "18.
