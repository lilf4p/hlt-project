On 7 November 1996 the Court of First Instance (Osnovni sud) in Bar ruled in favour of the applicant, ordering the debtor to pay 36,000 German Marks, statutory interest and specified legal costs. This judgment became final on 7 January 1997.", "14. On 18 March 1997 the High Court (Vi\u0161i sud) in Podgorica rejected the debtor\u2019s appeal as having been lodged out of time.", "15. On 16 April 1997 the Court of First Instance issued an enforcement order (rje\u0161enje o izvr\u0161enju) ordering the sale of the debtor\u2019s flat by means of a public auction.", "16. On 5 May 2000 the same court established the value of the flat at issue.", "17. The public auction, scheduled for 1 September 2000, was cancelled on account of the judge\u2019s absence. No further auctions have been scheduled thereafter.", "18.

He submitted that he did not know the names and the addresses of the debtor\u2019s heirs, and that it was impossible for him to find this out, especially within three days. He further maintained that the court should have acted pursuant to section 32 of the Enforcement Act and should have found the debtor\u2019s heirs, or, alternatively, should have appointed a temporary representative for them without delay (see paragraph 45 below).", "25.

At the same time, the applicant was informed that on 11 October 2011 another interim measure prohibiting the sale of the flat at issue had been deleted from the register of the Real Estate Office, thus creating the conditions for these enforcement proceedings to be concluded (see paragraph 34 below).", "32. There is no information in the case file that the notice on sale was published in the newspapers or that B.N. was served with the enforcement decision of 21 January 2010.

The Court of First Instance in Cetinje submitted the data only for the period between 1 May 2011 and 15 May 2012, and the Court of First Instance in \u017dabljak for the period between January 2011 and June 2012. Also, the Court of First Instance in Danilovgrad and the Court of First Instance in Kola\u0161in did not provide the exact number of the requests for review that had been dealt with by these two courts. All the other courts dealt with 121 requests for review in total.", "68. In forty-six cases the courts issued notifications specifying the concrete actions that would be undertaken in each case within four months with a view of expediting the proceedings (see paragraph 62 above). In thirty cases of these forty-six the relevant actions were undertaken within the set time-limit (a main hearing concluded, a decision or a judgment rendered etc.). In fourteen cases the relevant actions were undertaken within periods ranging between 4 months and 12 months. In two cases the relevant action specified in the notification would not appear to have been undertaken even after a period of 12 months.", "69. In thirty-three cases the requests for review were dismissed as unfounded. In twenty-one cases of these thirty-three the relevant domestic proceedings would appear to have been pending before the first-instance courts between 5 months, and 1 year and nine months at most. In one case the relevant civil proceedings in respect of which the request for review was dismissed as unfounded had already been pending for at least 4 years and 5 months before a first-instance court. In eleven cases it is unclear how long the relevant domestic proceedings had lasted.", "70. It is unclear how the additional thirty-three requests for review had been dealt with. However, it would appear that in eighteen cases out of these thirty-three the relevant domestic proceedings ended soon thereafter. The status of the remaining fifteen proceedings is not known.", "71. Lastly, in five cases the appellants were informed that the relevant decisions had been rendered in the meantime and in four cases the requests for review were withdrawn."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
