Statements taken from the applicants\u2019 fellow villagers established that the security forces had not forced the applicants to leave their village. The applicants had left their village, taking their all belongings with them, two months before the burning of their houses.

Many villagers had already been awarded compensation for the damage they had sustained.", "A description of the relevant domestic law can be found in the Court\u2019s decision of \u0130\u00e7yer v.
