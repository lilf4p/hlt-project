However, in the school situated in the applicant's district Centar \u017dupa no classes in Turkish were available.", "Between September and 18 December 1996 the applicant's older daughter attended the primary school in the village of Ko\u0111a\u0111ik in a different district where education in Turkish was provided. However, according to the applicant, on 19 December 1996 classes were allegedly interrupted by the police and the school director announced that pupils from other villages were no longer allowed to attend classes in the Ko\u0111a\u0111ik school.", "On 11 June 1997 the Ministry of Education and Sport (\u201cthe Ministry\u201d) refused the applicant's request of April 1997 to provide education in Turkish in Centar \u017dupa. It stated, inter alia, the following:", "\u201c... we inform you that the Council of Ministers ... [on] 2 September 1996 decided the following:", "1. The Ministry of Education and Sport is responsible for providing education in the primary schools in the Municipality of Debar - Centar \u017dupa in accordance with the Constitution and the Primary Education Act.", "2. ... [education in] Macedonian cannot be replaced by [education in] Turkish [in Centar \u017dupa], as the children have not been speaking Turkish before they started attending the school.", "3. The Ministry ... is instructed to inform the parents of the pupils who boycotted the classes ... and request the [pupils] to return to the school [in Centar \u017dupa] where special courses will be given so that [they could] catch up with the rest ...", "The Ministry of Education and Sport urges that your children attend the courses in the [primary school]... in Centar \u017dupa in accordance with the Primary Education Act.\u201d", "On 31 August 1999 the Ministry decided to provide education in Turkish in the school in Centar \u017dupa for the pupils whose mother tongue was Turkish in accordance with the Council of Ministers' decision of 10 August 1999 to that effect.", "On 17 May 2000 the political party 'Liga za Demokratija' and the associations of citizens \u201cThe World Macedonian Congress\u201d and \u201cthe Association of the Macedonians with Muslim Religion in Macedonia\u201d asked the Constitutional Court to examine the constitutionality of the Council of Minister's decision of 10 August 1999 and the respective Ministry's decision of 31 August 1999. On 5 July 2000 the Constitutional Court declared the decisions null and void on the following grounds:", "\u201c...", "... it, inter alia, appears that (1) the impugned acts determined that Turkish was the mother tongue of all the pupils [residing in] the municipality of Centar \u017dupa ...", "5.

In the schools where the education is in the languages of the minorities, the Macedonian language shall be studied as well.", "It follows that the members of the minorities are educated in the primary and secondary schools in their language, and that is, according to the court, the language of their choice [which they use] in their everyday life. Therefore, the provision of the Constitution established objective criteria for the fulfilment of the right to education of the national minorities in their language [which] does not depend on the subjective will of the State bodies ...", "The impugned acts provide education in Turkish for the pupils in the municipality of Centar \u017dupa who use the Macedonian language of their choice in their everyday communications and, thereby, express their national identity, and who do not use the Turkish language in their everyday communications and of their choice. Thus, [the acts] exceeded the boundaries of the Constitutional framework setting out the rights of the national minorities to education in their language (Article 48 \u00a7 4 of the Constitution) and inhibited the achievement of the purpose of education - to provide knowledge, and impinged upon the very content of the right to education, i.e. the [right to] education is being manipulated with the purpose of changing the national identity of a number of pupils in the municipality. Therefore, the court finds that the impugned acts are not in conformity with the aforementioned Constitutional provision.", "...\u201d", "On 22 February 1997 the applicant asked the Ko\u0111a\u0111ik school to admit his older daughter.
