He was represented before the Court by Mr M. Ramu\u0161\u0107ak, a lawyer practising in Vara\u017edin. The Croatian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mrs \u0160. Sta\u017enik.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "On 30 December 2004 the Vara\u017edin State Attorney\u2019s Office (Op\u0107insko dr\u017eavno odvjetni\u0161tvo Vara\u017edin) indicted the applicant before the Vara\u017edin Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Vara\u017edinu) for threatening behaviour. The applicant chose to defend himself in person and had no legal representation in the proceedings before the trial court. At the first hearing, held on 11 July 2005, the applicant and one witness gave evidence.", "At the beginning of a hearing scheduled for 8 September 2005 at 12.30 p.m., the applicant\u2019s wife approached the presiding judge asking on the applicant\u2019s behalf for an adjournment of the hearing. She presented medical evidence showing that on 4 September 2005 the applicant had been injured and could not walk. The judge, however, continued with the hearing at which three witnesses, all of whom were called on behalf of the prosecution, gave evidence. The prosecution also gave their closing arguments and the trial was concluded. The applicant was found guilty as charged and sentenced to three months\u2019 imprisonment.", "On 4 October 2005 the applicant, now legally represented, lodged an appeal whereby he argued that the impugned judgment had not been adequately reasoned, that the reasons given by the trial court had been contradictory and that the facts had been wrongly established. The appeal was dismissed and the first-instance judgment upheld by the Vara\u017edin County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Vara\u017edinu) on 2 November 2005.", "On 30 December 2005 the applicant lodged a request for an extraordinary review of a final judgment (zahtjev za izvanredno preispitivanje pravomo\u0107ne presude). It was dismissed by the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Repbulike Hrvatske) on 9 March 2006 on the ground that the applicant had failed to specify any ground for lodging his request under the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Instead, he had challenged only the findings of the lower courts as to the facts of the case, which was not a ground for a request for extraordinary review of a final judgment.", "On 16 October 2006 the applicant asked the Vara\u017edin State Attorney\u2019s Office to lodge a request for the protection of legality with the Supreme Court. This was denied on 11 July 2007.", "The relevant part of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Zakon o kaznenom postupku, Official Gazette nos. 110/1997, 27/1998, 58/1999, 112/1999, 58/2002, 143/2002 and 62/2003) provides as follows:", "\u201c(1) Where a law has been infringed, the State Attorney of the Republic of Croatia may lodge a request for the protection of legality against final court decisions and against the court proceedings preceding such decisions.", "(2) The State Attorney of the Republic of Croatia shall lodge a request for the protection of legality against a court decision adopted in proceedings which violated fundamental human rights and freedoms guaranteed under the Constitution, laws or international law.", "...\u201d", "Article 419 of the Serbian Criminal Procedure Code (Zakonik o krivi\u010dnom postupku, published in Official Gazette nos. 70/01 and 68/02) reads:", "\u201cWhere a law has been infringed, the competent State Attorney may lodge a request for the protection of legality against final court decisions and against the court proceedings preceding such decisions.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
