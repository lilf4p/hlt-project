The applicants, who were born in 1954, 1961, 1955, 1957, 1955, 1961, 1942, 1951, 1956, 1946, 1961, 1959 and 1948 respectively, are Turkish nationals. They were members of the Turkish Grand National Assembly and the DEP (Democracy Party \u2013 Demokrasi Partisi), a political party which was dissolved by the Constitutional Court on 16 June 1994.", "12. On 7 May 1993 the DEP was founded and the appropriate declaration submitted to the Ministry of the Interior.", "13. On 2 November 1993 Principal State Counsel at the Court of Cassation (\u201cPrincipal State Counsel\u201d) applied to the Constitutional Court for the DEP to be dissolved. In his application he accused the DEP of having infringed the principles of the Constitution and the law on political parties. He considered that declarations made by various members of the DEP's central committee and its former chairman during two meetings held abroad (at Erbil in Iraq and Bonn in Germany) were likely to undermine the integrity of the State and national unity.", "14. On 1 March 1994 the Constitutional Court decided of its own motion to obtain the oral submissions of certain interested parties. Thus, on 22 March 1994 it took evidence from the applicant Mr Kartal, in his capacity as the vice-chairman of the DEP, and from Mr Kaplan, in his capacity as the party's legal representative.", "15. On 2 March 1994 the Grand National Assembly lifted the parliamentary immunity of some of the DEP's MPs, including that of the applicants, in response to a series of applications made by the public prosecutor at the Ankara National Security Court.", "16. On the same day Mr Dicle and Mr Do\u011fan were arrested as they were leaving parliament, and taken into police custody. On 4 March 1994 the same thing happened to Mr Sak\u0131k, Mr T\u00fcrk and Mrs Zana. The arrest of Mr Yurtta\u015f and Mr Sadak, who had remained inside the parliament building, was prevented by the Speaker of the National Assembly on the ground that they were still members of parliament.", "17. On 16 June 1994 the Constitutional Court ordered the dissolution of the DEP on the ground that it had undermined the territorial integrity of the State and national unity.", "18. The Constitutional Court also declared that the parliamentary seats of all the applicants were forfeited as a secondary measure attending the decision to dissolve the DEP. The measure was not applied to four MPs who had recently left the party.", "19. On the same day, fearful of the consequences of the criminal proceedings brought against them, Mr Togu\u00e7, Mr G\u00fcne\u015f, Mr K\u0131l\u0131n\u00e7, Mr Aydar, Mr Yi\u011fit and Mr Kartal went abroad (to Brussels).", "20. On 1 July 1994 Mr Sadak and Mr Yurtta\u015f went to the public prosecutor's office with their lawyer and were placed in custody.", "21. On a later date Principal State Counsel filed submissions in which he accused the applicants of separatism and undermining the integrity of the State, both of these being capital offences under Article 125 of the Criminal Code.", "22. The Ankara National Security Court gave judgment on 8 December 1994. Applying section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713), it sentenced Mr Sak\u0131k to three years' imprisonment for separatist propaganda. Mr T\u00fcrk, Mr Dicle, Mr Do\u011fan, Mr Sadak and Mrs Zana were each sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment for membership of an armed gang pursuant to Article 168 of the Criminal Code and Mr Yurtta\u015f was sentenced to seven and a half years' imprisonment for assisting and supporting an armed gang, an offence under Article 169 of the Criminal Code.", "23. On an appeal on points of law by the applicants and Principal State Counsel on 26 October 1995, the Court of Cassation quashed Mr T\u00fcrk's and Mr Yurtta\u015f's convictions and ordered their release on the ground that they had contravened only section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The Court upheld the other applicants' convictions.", "24.
