On 14 March 2000 an investigator from the Koptevo district prosecutor\u2019s office closed the criminal proceedings, finding that there was no case of ill-treatment to answer. The relevant part of the decision read as follows:", "\u201cIn the course of the investigation it was established that on 14 December 1999, at 1.45 p.m., Kh. and V., on-duty officers from the Koptevo district police department, stopped two persons near house no. ... who resembled persons wanted in connection with telephone message no. 12316. The persons concerned refused to present identity documents and were brought to Koptevo police station for an identity check. At the station one of them identified himself as Mr Dmitriy Aleksandrovich Belousov, a third-year student at a military academy; the other introduced himself as Mr Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Konstantinov. Following a check though the Central Data System the identity of Mr D.A. Belousov was confirmed, and at 4 p.m. he was handed over to a representative of the military commander\u2019s office. The second person (Mr I.A. Belousov, as it was established later) was placed in a cell for administrative arrestees; later he felt sick and an ambulance was called for him. At 5.45 p.m. he was handed over to an emergency team which took him to the Botkin clinical hospital.", "According to a statement by [the applicant], on 5 December 1999 he and his brother Dmitriy were on their way to Koptevo market.

[The applicant] showed his \u201cLukoil-City\u201d company work pass, and [his brother] showed his military ID card. At that moment another police officer, wearing badge no. 4461, approached them and pushed [the applicant]; [the latter] screamed and the police officer then twisted his arm. Consequently [the applicant] asked to be taken to a police station for an explanation. An on-duty patrol which had arrived at the scene took [the applicant] and [his brother] to Koptevo district police station. At the police station [the applicant] went into the lobby to smoke a cigarette. An on-duty sergeant, wearing badge no. 4491, said that arrestees could not smoke there; [the applicant] responded that he had not been arrested, and the sergeant then called a captain who was standing on the steps of the police station. The captain started hitting [the applicant]; when, responding to [the applicant\u2019s] screams, [his brother] ran from the duty room, the captain hit [his brother] with a machine gun and dragged him back to the duty room. The sergeant wearing badge no. 4491 and another sergeant, wearing badge no. 4488, continued beating [the applicant] up. Then [the applicant] crawled to the duty room and asked the police officers who were there to call an ambulance. [The applicant] and [his brother] were placed in a cell for administrative arrestees; the police officers dismissed all their requests to place a call to their house or to call an ambulance. During his detention at the station [the applicant] was twice submitted to a bodily search without any record being taken ... At 5.20 p.m. a major from the military academy arrived to pick up [his brother]. Subsequently a district police officer arrived at the station and, after forcing [the applicant] to strip to the waist, he and the captain present at the station made [the applicant] lift his clothes and move them from one place to another, following which [the applicant] lost consciousness. [The applicant] regained consciousness in a room where it was extremely hot; the police officers took him to a shower room where an officer on duty provided him with medical assistance.

At approximately 1.40 p.m. they noticed two men who looked similar to criminals wanted in connection with telephone message no. 12316. In response to a request for identity documents, a man ([the applicant], as it was subsequently established) started screaming obscenities at the police officers. The two men refused to show identity documents. In response to the officers\u2019 request that they go to Koptevo police station, [the applicant] said that he would not follow the officers and that he would not speak to a police officer below the rank of major; he also demanded that they call a car. A group on patrol was called to the scene to bring the two men to the police station. Physical force was not used against the two men.", "Mr Kh.\u2019s statements are fully corroborated by a statement from Mr V.", "Mr D., who was questioned as a witness, stated that on 5 December 1999, in response to a call from an on-duty officer he, as a member of a group on patrol, together with Mr L. and Mr K., had arrived to render assistance to the on-duty officers.

One of the arrestees introduced himself as Mr Dmitriy Aleksandrovich Belousov, a student at the military academy, and showed his military ID card...; the other person introduced himself as Mr Aleksandr Alekseyevich Konstantinov and did not have any documents on him. Following a check through ... databases which produced a negative response, [the applicant] was asked to state his real name. Subsequently [the applicant] attempted to leave the station and started smoking. An officer on duty, Mr P., made a remark, following which [the applicant] fell to the floor and started screaming that he was being beaten up. When [Mr Do.] asked him what was going on, [the applicant] said that he had undergone surgery and showed scars on his stomach. The arrestee was reprimanded and placed behind bars. Subsequently [the applicant] continued behaving provocatively, used obscene language, threatened the police officers and tore up roubles and dollars. At 5.30 p.m. he complained that he did not feel well and emergency doctors were called, who transferred him to the Botkin clinical hospital. The police officers behaved properly towards [the applicant]; no physical force was used.", "Mr Do.\u2019s statements were confirmed by statements from police officers Mr R., Mr P., Mr Ka. and Mr S.", "According to the statements given by a witness, Mr F., on 5 December he and a group of emergency doctors arrived at Koptevo police station.

The patient was taken to the Botkin clinical hospital.", "Mr Vu., an emergency team medical assistant, who was questioned as a witness, testified that on 5 December 1999 he and the emergency team had arrived at Koptevo police station. A man (the applicant, as was later established) was sitting on a couch behind bars with his hand on his stomach. [The applicant] said that he had been beaten up by the police. Other arrestees held at the station said that [the applicant] was lying. In the car [the applicant] talked, saying that he had undergone surgery. He stated that when he had been approached by police officers in the street and had been asked to show some identity documents he had used obscene language.", "Ms S., who was questioned as a witness, stated that on 5 December 1999 she had been in a room for administrative arrestees. Three more persons were being held there; one of them ([the applicant], as it transpired later) behaved provocatively, screaming and threatening the police officers. The police officers behaved properly towards all the arrested persons; they did not use physical force.", "During an additional interview [the applicant] stated that a captain had begun hitting him in the lobby. At first [the captain] had hit him with his right hand on the upper part of the left shoulder; after that blow [the applicant] slipped down by the wall and fell near a rubbish bin. Then the captain kicked [the applicant] twice: once in the stomach and once in the back near the kidneys. The first kick in the stomach was particularly hard. After that the sergeants approached [the applicant] and hit him approximately six times in the stomach and back. The applicant then crawled into the duty room where he was hit several times in the buttocks...", "According to a report issued in the Botkin clinical hospital [the applicant] had an injury to the abdominal wall, an injury to the right kidney, bruises on the forehead and left hand, a craniocerebral injury and concussion; his state of health was satisfactory. Following ultrasound examinations of the abdominal cavity and kidneys no pathology was detected.", "A forensic medical examination of [the applicant] was performed in the case. According to the expert report, [the applicant] had sustained concussion and an injury to the forehead, which constituted elements of a single trauma and belonged to the category of injuries causing mild damage to health, that is, a short-term deterioration in health lasting less than three weeks... The diagnosis of \u201can injury to a kidney\u201d indicated in the medical documents was not confirmed by objective clinical data and the results of the special examinations... The diagnosis \u201ctraumatic encephalopathy\u201d indicated in the medical documents could not be examined by the expert, because there was insufficient objective data for analysis... At present [the applicant is suffering] from psycho-vegetative syndrome and depression, and needs psychiatric treatment. There is no mention of an injury to the post-surgical sutures in the medical documents presented for expert examination. Differences in the scar tissue along the line of the postsurgical sutures do not exclude a possible partial opening of the sutures in the upper part.", "Taking into account the fact that the arguments raised by [the applicant] were not objectively confirmed in the course of the pre-trial investigation ..., [the investigator] orders the closure of the criminal proceedings instituted pursuant to Article 286 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation...\u201d", "18. The applicant complained to the Moscow city prosecutor and the Koptevo District Court of Moscow that the criminal proceedings against the policemen had been closed.", "19.

No copy of that decision was submitted to the Court.", "20. On 27 April 2000 an investigator from the Koptevo district prosecutor\u2019s office again discontinued the criminal proceedings, finding that there was no case of ill-treatment to answer. The decision of 27 April 2000 was identical in its wording to the decision of 14 March 2000, save for two additional paragraphs in which the investigator recounted the testimonies of two witnesses, Mr Ch. and Mr Ku., who had been detained at the police station together with the applicant. Both witnesses stated that they had not seen the alleged beatings and that the applicant had behaved \u201cprovocatively\u201d. According to the applicant, the decision of 27 April 2000 was not served on him.", "21. In the meantime, on 18 April 2000, the Koptevo District Court of Moscow disallowed the applicant\u2019s complaint against the decision of 14 March 2000. The District Court held as follows:", "\u201cThe plaintiff challenges the decision issued in criminal case no. 268869.", "A complaint concerning a decision issued in the course of criminal proceedings cannot be examined in civil court proceedings. Complaints concerning actions of the prosecution authorities cannot be examined by courts of general jurisdiction, as special laws exist relating to the prosecution\u201d.", "The Government, relying on a report issued by the President of the Koptevo District Court in March 2006, submitted that the District Court had refused to examine the applicant\u2019s complaint because the decision of 14 March 2000 had been quashed by a prosecutor and the investigation had been reopened.", "22. On 12 May 2000 the applicant received a copy of the decision of 18 April 2000. The applicant\u2019s representative asked the District Court to restore the time-limit for lodging an appeal against that decision. A copy of the statement of appeal was attached to the request. No response followed. On 27 November 2001 the applicant\u2019s representative complained to the President of the Koptevo District Court that her request had not been examined. The stamp on the letter of 27 November 2001 shows that the District Court received the letter the same day. The applicant did not receive any response.", "23. On 20 March 2006 the Moscow city deputy prosecutor quashed the decision of 27 April 2000 and reopened the investigation into the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment complaint, finding as follows:", "\u201cThe decision [of 27 April 2000] on the closing of a criminal case was issued unlawfully and without any grounds and should be quashed, because in this case it is necessary to question [the applicant\u2019s mother]; to identify and question all the individuals detained in the cell for administrative arrestees when [the applicant] and [his brother] were at the police station; to question further [the applicant\u2019s brother] about his and [the applicant\u2019s] injuries and about material evidence showing that those injuries were sustained; to question further the emergency doctors who arrived at the police station and took [the applicant] to the Botkin clinical hospital in Moscow about the visible injuries; to question thoroughly the doctor who performed the initial examination of [the applicant] in the Botkin hospital; to organise, if necessary, confrontation interviews between the doctors; to carry out a legal evaluation of the [the applicant\u2019s] injuries discovered during the forensic medical examination (concussion, an injury to the forehead, an injury to the left hand and an injury to the right shoulder) and to perform other investigative actions aimed at establishing the truth in the case.\u201d", "24. On 29 October 2006 an investigator from the Koptevo district prosecutor\u2019s office discontinued the criminal proceedings against the police officers, concluding that no criminal conduct had occurred (Article 24 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). The investigator copied the wording of the decision of 27 April 2000, merely adding that the forensic medical examination had established that the applicant\u2019s injuries could have been caused by blows administered with a blunt firm object, possibly on 5 December 1999. He also included additional statements by the two witnesses Ms S. and Mr Ku., who had been unable to recall further details of their stay at the police station in December 1999 owing to the length of time since the events, and had merely confirmed their statements given to the investigator in 2000. The investigator did not question the applicant\u2019s mother and brother because he could not establish their place of residence. He was also unable to identify all the individuals who had been detained at the police station together with the applicant, because the registration logs bearing the names of persons detained at Koptevo police station had been destroyed.", "25. On 19 January 2007 the Moscow city deputy prosecutor quashed the decision of 29 October 2006, reopened the investigation into the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment complaints and ordered that investigators should \u201ctake procedural decisions concerning the fact that injuries were inflicted on [the applicant], question [police officers] Mr Sh. and Mr V. and take other investigative actions necessary in the course of the investigation\u201d. It appears that the proceedings are now pending.", "26. The RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure (in force until 1 July 2002, \u201cthe CCrP\u201d) established that a criminal investigation could be initiated by an investigator on a complaint by an individual or on the investigative authorities\u2019 own initiative, where there were reasons to believe that a crime had been committed (Articles 108 and 125). A prosecutor was responsible for overall supervision of the investigation (Articles 210 and 211). He could order specific investigative actions, transfer the case from one investigator to another or order an additional investigation. If there were no grounds to initiate or continue a criminal investigation, the prosecutor or investigator issued a reasoned decision to that effect which had to be notified to the interested party. The decision was amenable to appeal to a higher prosecutor or to a court of general jurisdiction (Articles 113 and 209).", "27. On 1 July 2002 the old Code was replaced by the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation (\u201cthe new CCP\u201d). Article 125 of the new CCP provides for judicial review of decisions by investigators and prosecutors that might infringe the constitutional rights of participants in proceedings or prevent access to a court.", "28.

No one may be detained longer than 48 hours before the court decision is taken.\u201d", "Section 239 of the Administrative Code (in force until 1 July 2002) provided that the police could subject a person to an administrative arrest to prevent an administrative offence, to establish a person\u2019s identity, to issue a document certifying that an administrative offence had been committed, if it was necessary and could not be done on the spot, and to ensure effective proceedings or the enforcement of administrative sanctions. Section 242 provided, in particular, that the term of administrative arrest should not exceed three hours, except for certain categories of offenders including those who had committed a minor disorderly act, who could be detained as long as necessary until their case was considered by a district (town) judge or a high-ranking police officer. Section 240 set out the requirements with regard to arrest reports. By virtue of section 240 an arrest report was to be signed by the official enforcing the arrest and the arrestee. Section 246 of the Administrative Code provided for appeal against administrative arrest to a prosecutor or a high-ranking police officer.", "29.
