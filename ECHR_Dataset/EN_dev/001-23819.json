On 1 March 1999 the police informed the court that the representative had moved and that his address was unknown. The District Court then unsuccessfully tried to have the above documents delivered at the registered address of the defendant company. The representative of the defendant company appeared at the District Court and was served with the documents on 18 May 1999. On 1 July 1999 the case file was transmitted to the Pre\u0161ov Regional Court.", "On 17 November 1999 the Regional Court quashed the District Court's decision of 27 October 1998.

On 5 April 2001 the applicant replied that the bank account number of the District Court had not been notified to her. On 23 April 2001 the applicant paid the sum due after she had received the relevant money transfer document from the District Court.", "On 19 July 2001 the case was adjourned as the applicant's representative did not appear and the applicant was not in a position to comment on the expert opinion as the lawyer had not transmitted it to her.", "The applicant submitted her written comments on the expert opinion on 11 September 2001.", "Following the applicant's complaint about the conduct of the proceedings the file was sent to the Regional Court on 24 October 2001.

The decision stated that the case was not complex from the legal point of view. However, certain difficulties arose due to the fact that the contract between the applicant and the defendant concerning the repair of the applicant's house had been concluded orally and that its contents were disputed between the parties. This required extensive evidence to be taken including an expert opinion.", "The Constitutional Court held that the applicant and her representative had contributed to a certain extent to the length of the proceedings in that the lawyer had not transmitted the expert opinion to the applicant who was therefore not able to comment on it at the hearing held on 19 July 2001 at which her lawyer did not appear.

The Ministry refused to satisfy the claim and the applicant sought redress before the Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Nov\u00e1 Ves District Court.", "The District Court dismissed the action on 18 February 1997. The decision stated that the relevant judicial decisions concerning the applicant's dismissal had not been quashed in a separate set of proceedings as required by Section 4(1) of the State Liability Act, and that that the applicant had no right to compensation under Section 22(6) of the Extra-Judicial Rehabilitations Act.", "On 17 June 1999 the Ko\u0161ice Regional Court upheld the first instance judgment. The decision stated that in the applicant's case the Extra-Judicial Rehabilitations Act was a lex specialis with respect to the State Liability Act of 1969.", "Extra-Judicial Rehabilitations Act of 1991", "The aim of the Extra-Judicial Rehabilitations Act (Z\u00e1kon o mimos\u00fadnych rehabilit\u00e1ci\u00e1ch, in force as from 1 April 1991) is to redress certain infringements of property and social rights which occurred between 25 February 1948 and 1 January 1989.
