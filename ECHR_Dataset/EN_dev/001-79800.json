On 8 August 2001 the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Karachaevo-Cherkessiya Republic, by way of supervisory-review proceedings, quashed the judgment of 11 March 2001 and remitted the case for a fresh examination.

On 27 September 2001 the Cherkessk Town Court found that the applicant's detention had been unlawful but reduced compensation to RUR 5,000 (EUR 184). The reasoning in the judgment of 27 September 2001 repeated word by word that of the judgment of 11 March 2001, save for the amount in the penultimate paragraph where 190,000 was replaced with 5,000. The judgment of 27 September 2001 was upheld on appeal on 16 October 2001."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
