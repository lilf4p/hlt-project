SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 11;No violation of Art. 14+11", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["8. The applicants are Swedish citizens. Mr. Folke Schmidt is a professor of law at the University of Stockholm and Mr. Hans Dahlstr\u00f6m is an officer in the Swedish Army.", "9. The applicants are members of trade unions affiliated to two of the main federations representing Swedish State employees, namely the Swedish Confederation of Professional Associations (Sveriges Akademikers Centralorganisation, abbreviated to SACO) in the case of Mr. Schmidt and the National Federation of State Employees (Statstj\u00e4nstem\u00e4nnens Riksf\u00f6rbund, abbreviated to SR) in the case of Mr. Dahlstr\u00f6m.", "In 1971, after expiry of one collective agreement and during negotiations for a new agreement, the applicants\u2019 unions called selective strikes not affecting the sectors in which worked the applicants, who thus did not come out on strike. Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Dahlstr\u00f6m complain that on conclusion of the new agreement, they, as members of the \"belligerent\" unions, were denied certain retroactive benefits paid to members of other trade unions and to non-union employees who had not participated in the strikes.", "General background", "10. For more than a hundred years, workers and employers in the private sector in Sweden have traditionally enjoyed the right to form and join trade unions and associations and to take action in defence of their occupational interests without interference by the State.", "Certain principles of labour law which had evolved in practice were codified in 1928 and 1936 by the following legislation:", "(i) the 1928 Collective Agreements Act (lag om kollektivavtal);", "(ii) the 1928 Labour Court Act (lag om arbetsdomstol); and", "(iii) the 1936 Act on the Right to Organise and Negotiate (lag om f\u00f6renings-och f\u00f6rhandlingsr\u00e4tt).", "11. The 1928 Collective Agreement Act deals with collective labour agreements between employers or employers\u2019 associations and trade unions. It specifies in particular the legal effects of such agreements. For example, the parties may not take strike or lock-out action in regard to an issue regulated by a collective agreement in force between them.", "12. The 1928 Labour Court Act contained rules governing the composition, jurisdiction and procedure of the Labour Court. The Labour Court was competent to hear cases of alleged violation of the 1936 Act on the Right to Organise and Negotiate. It also had jurisdiction in disputes relating to the interpretation or application of collective agreements, but proceedings could only be brought by a party to the agreement in issue. Unions or non-union employees to whom such an agreement had been made applicable (paragraph 17 below) were obliged to bring their disputes before the ordinary courts or administrative courts, as the case might be.", "13. The above-mentioned Act of 1936 guarantees two distinct rights to the parties on the labour market, namely the right to organise and the right to negotiate.", "The right to organise is defined in Section 3 of the Act as being the right of employers and employees to belong to an employers\u2019 organisation or a trade union, to exercise their rights as members of that organisation or union, and to work for an organisation or a union or for the formation of an organisation or a union, without interference or pressure by the other party. The Act specifies that the right to organise shall be considered as being violated \"if measures are taken either by employers or by employees to constrain any employee or employer, as the case may be, to refrain from becoming a member of, or to resign from, an association, to refrain from exercising his rights as a member of an association, or to refrain from working for an association or for the formation of an association, and likewise if measures are taken either by employers or by employees calculated to cause prejudice to an employee or employer, as the case may be, on the ground that such employee or employer is a member of an association, exercises his rights as a member of an association or works for an association or for the formation of an association\".", "The only way in which such associations enjoy the protection of the Act is that they may be awarded damages if the other party violates the right to organise of an individual member in such a way that the violation is to be regarded as intervention in the affairs of the association.", "The right to negotiate is defined in Section 4 of the 1936 Act as being \"the right to institute negotiations regarding conditions of employment or relations between employers and employees in general\". It imposes on the other party an obligation to enter into negotiations, to attend meetings for negotiations and, where necessary, to make proposals for the settlement of the issues involved. This provision is applicable to all trade unions.", "14. Prior to 1966, the State determined the wages and conditions of employment of its employees in the event of a breakdown of the negotiations between the State and the employees.", "As from 1 January 1966, the 1965 State Officials Act (statstj\u00e4nstemannalag) has virtually assimilated State employees to employees in the private sector as regards trade union rights, strikes, lock-outs, etc. The Act made the 1928 Collective Agreement Act, the 1928 Labour Court Act and the 1936 Act on the Right to Organise and Negotiate applicable in the public sector. Furthermore, the Act provided for collective agreements to be concluded, subject to certain exceptions, between the National Collective Bargaining Office (Statens Avtalsverk, hereinafter referred to as \"the Office\"), representing the State as employer, and the organisations of State employees. The Ministry of Finance has a nominee on the governing board of the Office.", "15. The 1965 legislative reform was facilitated by the centralised structure of the Swedish trade union movement; one factor which greatly contributed to its adoption was the conclusion in December 1965 of a Basic Agreement on Negotiations\u2019 Procedure (slottsbacksavtalet) between the Office and the four main trade union organisations of State employees, namely:", "(i) the State Employees\u2019 Union (Statsanst\u00e4lldas F\u00f6rbund, abbreviated to SF and known prior to 1 July 1970 as Statstj\u00e4narkartellen),", "(ii) the National Federation of State Employees (SR),", "(iii) the Swedish Confederation of Professional Associations (SACO),", "(iv) the Civil Servants Section of the Central Organisation of Salaried Employees (Tj\u00e4nstem\u00e4nnens Centralorganisations Statstj\u00e4nstemannasektion, abbreviated to TCO-S).", "According to the information at the disposal of the Court, these federations represent the large majority of Swedish State employees: more than 450,000 out of the 500,000 whose terms of employment are negotiated by the Office. About forty trade unions are affiliated to these organisations. The few independent trade unions represent only about 2,000 State employees in all.", "Insofar as they are union members at all, university teachers and army officers generally belong to SACO and SR respectively. These two organisations, which are respectively open to staff possessing a university degree or the school leaving certificate (the equivalent of the baccalaur\u00e9at), recently merged after the case had been brought before the Commission.", "According to the trade unions\u2019 own published figures, the number of SACO members in respect of whom the Office conducts collective negotiations was about 48,800 in 1971 and 1972; it rose to 51,800 in 1973 and was between 53,600 and 53,700 at the end of 1974. The university teachers\u2019 union affiliated to SACO had between 1,800 and 1,900 members in 1971, between 1,900 and 2,000 in 1972, between 2,100 and 2,200 in 1973 and between 2,300 and 2,400 at the end of 1974. SR had 19,200 members in 1971, 19,800 in 1972 and about 20,000 at the end of 1973. The army officers\u2019 union affiliated to SR had between 6,900 and 7,000 members in 1971, 7,300 in 1972 and between 7,400 and 7,500 at the end of 1973; it would appear that in August 1975 its membership had fallen to about 7,100 or 7,200.", "16. Clause 4 of the above-mentioned Basic Agreement provides that negotiations with a view to concluding a collective agreement shall be conducted on the employees\u2019 behalf by the \"main organisation\" concerned, unless the Office and the \"main organisation\" agree otherwise.", "17. The Royal Order of 30 June 1965 relating to Certain Public Collective Agreements (KK om vissa statliga kollektivavtal m.m.) includes the following provisions:", "\"Collective agreements as to such conditions of employment or service as are determined by the King-in-Council or by Parliament shall be concluded conditionally on the agreement being sanctioned by the King-in-Council.\"", "\"An Authority which is bound by a collective agreement shall apply the provisions of the agreement to any employee within the occupational group and region to which the agreement refers, notwithstanding that the employee is not covered by the agreement or by any other applicable collective agreement.\"", "18. Collective agreements in Sweden are normally concluded for a period of two or three years. For various reasons, however, the new collective agreement is often concluded some time after the previous agreement has expired. In such cases, the new agreement has often specifically provided that its terms shall apply retroactively as from the date of expiry of the previous agreement. In the case of a strike during the bargaining period, on the other hand, employers - both in the public and private sector - have customarily refused to grant retroactive benefits in order to deter unions from taking industrial action in the future (application of the principle that \"a strike destroys retroactivity\").", "19. Negotiations in the public sector of the labour market are centralised in that they are conducted by the federations on behalf of their member unions. Moreover, strikes and other collective action may not be taken by the different trade unions independently but rather on the basis of a decision by, or after receiving the approval of, the federation concerned, which chooses and designates in accordance with its pre-arranged policy or tactics those of its members who are to take part in the action. According to the present practice, the negotiations between the Office and the federations result in one single agreement which regulates the increase in salaries, the grading of different categories of employees, working hours, various salary allowances, etc., and which applies, as a result of Article 4 of the Order referred to above (paragraph 17), to all categories of State employees, including those who are not represented by the federations. The agreement is normally signed by all the federations.", "The question whether an individual employee has any means of challenging his union\u2019s decision to go on strike is a matter exclusively governed by the internal rules of the union concerned. These may provide for a right to ask for a secret ballot or for other rights to object to the union\u2019s decisions to take industrial action.", "20. The law described above at paragraphs 10 to 17 has in recent years undergone various changes which, being subsequent to the facts at issue, are not relevant for the present case.", "Facts of the particular case", "21. In 1969 a global agreement for the years 1969 and 1970 was concluded by the Office and the four federations. When this period expired on 31 December 1970, the parties were still engaged in negotiations regarding the new global agreement. No agreement was reached and a Commission of Conciliation was appointed, but negotiations before it broke down as well. Consequently, SACO and SR proclaimed selective strikes which became effective on 5 February 1971 and involved about 4,000 members. This resort to strike action, which was quite lawful (see paragraphs 11 and 14 above), did not apply to university teachers or the Army so that neither Mr. Schmidt nor Mr. Dahlstr\u00f6m took any part in the strikes.", "The Office retaliated and, on 19 February 1971, about 30,000 members of SACO and SR were locked out. This affected all university teachers belonging to SACO, including Mr. Schmidt, and some officers belonging to SR, but not Mr. Dahlstr\u00f6m. New strikes and lock-outs were proclaimed, but did not become effective. On 12 March 1971, an Act was promulgated which gave the King-in-Council power to order the prolongation of certain collective agreements for a period of six weeks, but not extending beyond 25 April 1971, provided that collective industrial action threatened vital public interests. By virtue of this Act the previous collective agreement was reinstated on 13 March 1971 for a period of six weeks and all strikes and lock-outs terminated forthwith.", "22. Subsequent negotiations before the Commission of Conciliation resulted in June 1971 in a new global agreement for the years 1971 to 1973. According to this agreement, certain posts were upgraded and the salary scales were generally increased retroactively as from 1 January 1971. Clause 18, however, provided for an exception in this respect:", "\"Officials who were members between 1 January and 12 March 1971 (or any part of this period) of organisations that organised industrial action for any part of this period, shall not be entitled from 1 January to 12 March 1971 to the increased wage benefits applicable under the agreement, unless the Collective Bargaining Office decides otherwise. This declaration also concerns other officials if they took part in any such industrial action.\"", "23. The agreement was only signed by TCO-S and SF. SACO and SR refused since they considered the terms unacceptable. The agreement, and in particular clause 18, was nevertheless applied to their members by virtue of Article 4 of the above-mentioned Royal Order (paragraph 17).", "According to the applicants, during the negotiations SF and TCO-S had urged that the non-retroactivity clause should not be included in the agreement and expressed the opinion that it properly belonged to an agreement between the State and the two organisations concerned, SACO and SR. SF and TCO-S declared this expressly and inserted a reservation in the record before putting their signatures to the agreement. TCO-S had, however, attempted to entice to itself some members of SACO, which was in its opinion a purposeless organisation, and had in fact written to the applicant Schmidt in this vein.", "24. As a result of the agreement, members of SACO and SR, insofar as they were upgraded, did not receive the higher salary for the period from 1 January 1971 to 12 March 1971, nor did they benefit from the general increase in the salary scales during the same period, regardless of whether or not they had been on strike. State employees who were not members of SACO or SR but who had all the same participated in the strike, were also refused the benefit of retroactivity.", "The exception clause applied to both applicants as members of SACO and SR, even though they themselves had not gone on strike at all. Mr. Schmidt was affected for the period from 1 January to 19 February 1971, being the date when he was locked out and thus deprived of his salary. Mr. Dahlstr\u00f6m, who was upgraded under the new agreement, was affected for the whole period up to 12 March 1971. During these periods the applicants performed work for a lower salary than that paid to other employees who were in the same salary brackets but not members of SACO or SR. Their financial losses amounted to Kr. 300 and Kr. 1,000 respectively.", "25. Mr. Schmidt, following the conclusion of the collective agreement, gave notice to the Office that, through his special treatment in regard to wages, his right to organise had been violated. When the Office nevertheless refused him the benefit of retroactivity, SACO and SR brought an action against the State before the Labour Court under the 1936 Act on the Right to Organise and Negotiate, seeking on behalf of the applicants (and a third person who was also a member of SR), inter alia:", "(i) a declaration that the measures taken by the Office constituted a violation of the applicants\u2019 right to organise and that this involved an interference with the affairs of SACO and SR;", "(ii) a declaration that clause 18 of the agreement of June 1971 was of no effect in regard to the applicants;", "(iii) an order that the State pay compensation to the applicants for financial loss and infringement of their right to organise.", "SACO and SR asserted that the State had infringed their members\u2019 right to organise as guaranteed in Section 3 of the 1936 Act since, with regard to retroactive wage benefits, they were subjected to special treatment in comparison with members of TCO-S and SF and non-union officials. The Office denied any such infringement since members of SACO and SR had been refused the benefit of retroactivity only for the reason that the State wanted to maintain the principle that \"a strike destroys retroactivity\". A comparison between SACO and SR members, on the one side, and members of TCO-S and SF and non-union officials, on the other, did not provide any basis for the conclusion that the State acted on such a basis or with such a purpose as was envisaged by Section 3 of the 1936 Act.", "26. In its judgment of 22 December 1971, the Labour Court unanimously rejected the claim of the applicants\u2019 unions. The Court first confirmed the parties\u2019 common view that the right to organise did not exclude the possibility for the State to enforce the principle that a strike destroys retroactivity. The adoption of such a position, and its enforcement after a conflict, were not to be regarded in themselves as an attack on the right to organise. Furthermore, the employer\u2019s duty to respect this right did not include any obligation in principle to pay equal wages to union and non-union employees or to members of different organisations. The mere fact that different wages were accorded to different groups of employees did not by itself lead to the conclusion that a measure violating Section 3 had been employed. However, any favouring either of members of the organisation which reached agreement or of non-union employees, with the aim of exercising against the members of the other organisation the type of pressure envisaged in Section 3, would constitute a violation of that provision.", "The Court then found that no such purpose on the part of the State could be established. In particular, no support had appeared for the idea that the State intended to induce members of SACO and SR to switch over to TCO-S and SF. In this context, the Court assumed that the latter organisations would also have been refused retroactivity if they had organised industrial action during the process of negotiations.", "With respect to non-union employees the Court found that the reason why they were granted a special benefit had nothing to do with their position as being non-union. Any procedure designed to refuse the benefit of retroactivity generally to non-union employees in sectors where SACO and SR were dominant or representative obviously could have become very complicated and time-consuming. Moreover, no recognised norms existed for determining such sectors, and the concept of representation was ambiguous and disputed. The Court then referred to the State\u2019s failure to negotiate an agreement which would exclude retroactivity to all non-union employees within the sectors in which SACO and SR were representative. In this respect the Court considered that the facts of the case did not support the conclusion that this failure showed any intention on the part of the State to violate the right to organise. Otherwise, the State would, as soon as one federation organised industrial action, be barred from upholding the principle that a strike destroys retroactivity in any other way than by refusing retroactive validity for agreements concluded with respect to all employee organisations. Such a general limitation of the State\u2019s possibilities of upholding the principle could not be based on Section 3 of the 1936 Act.", "In the case before it, the Court did not consider the granting of retroactive benefits to non-union employees who had not been on strike as proof of any purpose to violate the right to organise. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the parties had not been able to present anything more than quite uncertain information on the total number of non-union officials or on their field of employment. The Court indicated that the plaintiffs\u2019 view concerning the State\u2019s purpose in its treatment of non-union officials might have appeared more reasonable if it had been possible to show that the large majority of non-union officials were active within the main field of activity of SACO and SR. Conversely, it would be less reasonable to take notice of the treatment of the group of non-union officials if these could primarily be classified within the field of recruitment of SF and TCO-S. The uncertainty in regard to these circumstances argued, in the Court\u2019s conclusion, in favour of the States declaration that its purpose did not extend beyond upholding the principle that a strike destroys retroactivity.", "27. In their application, lodged with the Commission on 9 June 1972, the applicants complained that in the particular circumstances the implementation of the Government\u2019s policy regarding payment of retroactive benefits had amounted to preferential treatment, in particular in comparison with non-union employees, and had consequently violated Article 11 (art. 11) of the Convention.", "The Commission declared the application admissible by a decision of 18 October 1972.", "During the examination of the merits, the applicants relied on Article 11 (art. 11) and also Article 14, read in conjunction with Article 11 (art. 14+11).", "28. In its report of 17 July 1974, the Commission:", "(i) confirmed its opinion, previously expressed in the report in the Swedish Engine Drivers\u2019 Union case, that Article 11 para. 1 (art. 11-1) may legitimately extend to cover State responsibility in the field of labour-management relations and thus to provide some protection for unions against interference by employers;", "(ii) expressed the opinion:", "- by nine votes to one with one abstention, that the Government\u2019s policy of denying retroactive benefits to non-striking members of belligerent unions did not in the circumstances infringe the applicants\u2019 right, under Article 11 para. 1 (art. 11-1), to form and join the trade unions;", "- that in view of the preceding finding, the Commission was not called upon to examine whether the action complained of was justified under Article 11 para. 2 (art. 11-2);", "- by eight votes to one with two abstentions, that the differential treatment complained of was in the circumstances justified as an industrial relations policy and that there had been no violation of Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 11 para. 1 (art. 14+11-1).", "The report contains a separate concurring opinion."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["11", "14"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
