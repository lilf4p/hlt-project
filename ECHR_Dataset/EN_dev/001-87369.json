The applicants were crew members on a merchant ship named the Winner, flying the Cambodian flag.", "7. As part of the international effort to combat drug trafficking, the French authorities were informed that the ship might be carrying large quantities of drugs.", "8. By diplomatic telegram dated 7 June 2002, the French embassy in Phnom Penh informed the Ministry of Defence in Paris that, in response to a request from the Central Office for the Repression of Drug Trafficking (\u201cOCRTIS\u201d) for authorisation to intercept the Winner, and at the embassy's request, the Cambodian Minister of Foreign Affairs had personally given his Government's agreement.", "The Government produced a diplomatic note dated 7 June 2002, addressed by the Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the French Embassy in Phnom Penh, stating:", "\u201cThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (...), referring to its note no. 507/2002 dated 7 June 2002, has the honour formally to confirm that the Royal Government of Cambodia authorises the French authorities to intercept, inspect and take legal action against the ship Winner, flying the Cambodian flag (...) belonging (...) to the Marshall islands. (...) \u00bb", "9. The commander of the frigate Lieutenant de Vaisseau Le Henaff was instructed by the French naval authorities to intercept the Winner.", "10. On 13 June 2002, at 6 a.m., the frigate spotted a merchant ship travelling at slow speed through the waters off Cape Verde. It was not flying a flag, but was identified as the Winner. Its nationality was verified in accordance with international law and, as a security measure, a speedboat was lowered into the water. The merchant ship suddenly changed course, in an attempt to evade the frigate. When attempts were made to contact it on the international radio frequency, it remained silent. At the same time, the crew jettisoned packages over the stern into the sea. The frigate then identified itself and asked the Winner to stop, while signalling the international code SQ (\u201cstop or I shall open fire\u201d) ; no answer came and the ship was still not flying a flag, so a warning shot was fired, followed by further shots to stop it. At the same time the speedboat was ordered to recover the parcels that had been jettisoned. It only managed to recover one. Upon subsequent verification it was found to contain 80 to 100 kg of a narcotic substance resembling cocaine.", "11. Three more parcels were thrown overboard. As the freighter had still not stopped and was manoeuvring to prevent the speedboat from pulling alongside, France's Maritime Prefect for the Atlantic ordered the frigate to fire directly at the Winner's bow. This caused the Winner to stop, and an armed commando team boarded it and took control of it by armed force. One of the crew members, who sustained a bullet wound, was evacuated onto the frigate, where he was treated by the ship's doctor before being transferred to Brest hospital, where he died a week later. The rest of the crew were confined to their quarters on board the Winner under military guard. A tug was sent out from Brest, under orders from the Maritime Prefect and at the request of the public prosecutor in Brest, to tow the Winner into Brest harbour, escorted by the frigate Commandant Bouan.", "12. On 13 June 2002, at 11 a.m., the Brest public prosecutor referred the case to OCRTIS for examination under the flagrante delicto procedure. It emerged that the Greek coastguard had had the Winner under observation in connection with international drug trafficking in which Greek nationals were involved.", "13. On 24 June 2002, the Brest prosecutor's office opened an investigation into charges, against persons unknown, of leading a group with the aim of producing, making, importing, exporting, transporting, holding, supplying, selling, acquiring or illegally using drugs and conspiring to import and export drugs illegally. Two investigating judges were appointed.", "14. On 26 June 2002, at 8.45 a.m., the Winner entered Brest harbour under escort. The crew and cargo were handed over to the police, acting under instructions from one of the investigating judges, who immediately notified the persons concerned that they were being placed in police custody and informed them of their rights.", "15. The Government submitted that the two investigating judges went to see each of the detainees after twenty-four hours and after forty-eight hours to inform them that their police custody was being extended.", "16. On 28 June 2002, Mr Viorel Petcu, Mr Puiu Dodica, Mr Nicolae Balaban and Mr Nicu Stelian Manolache were charged and remanded in custody pending trial. On 29 June 2002 so were Mr Oleksandr Medvedyev, Mr Bory Bilenikin, Mr Georgios Boreas, Mr Sergio Cabrera Leon, Mr Guillermo Luis Eduar Sage Mart\u00ednez and two other crew members (Mr Oleksandor Litetski and Mr Symeon Theophanous).", "17. The above eleven persons applied to the Investigation Division of the Rennes Court of Appeal to have the evidence disallowed; relying in particular on Article 5 of the Convention, they complained that the Winner had been arrested illegally and that their detention on board for thirteen days had also been illegal. In a judgment of 3 October 2002, the court dismissed their appeal and held that there were no grounds for disallowing the evidence.", "18. In its judgment the Investigation Division pointed out that the international effort to combat drug trafficking was governed by the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 30 March 1961, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, signed at Montego Bay on 10 December 1982, and the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, signed in Vienna on 20 December 1988, all of which had been ratified by France. It considered that although Cambodia had not signed the Vienna Convention, Article 17.3 of which provided for derogations from the traditional principle of the \u201claw of the flag State\u201d, that did not prevent the French authorities from \u201crequesting Cambodia's cooperation to obtain authorisation to intercept the Winner in order to put a stop to the drug trafficking in which all or part of its crew were suspected of engaging\u201d, based on Article 108 of the Montego Bay Convention and \u201cwith reference\u201d to the Convention of 30 March 1961. According to the Investigation Division, as the provisions of the Vienna Convention did not apply to Cambodia, it was for that State's authorities to ask the French authorities for the information they needed in order to determine, as they alone were entitled to do, whether the request for assistance was well founded. The court then held that the diplomatic telegram of 7 June 2002 from the French Embassy established the existence of \u201can agreement given without restrictions or reservations by the Government of Cambodia for the planned interception and all its consequences, and was authoritative until proven otherwise\u201d.", "19. However, the Investigation Division considered that the agreement in question did not dispense the French authorities from abiding by the rules of procedure set forth in the Vienna Convention and in Articles 12 et seq. of the Law of 15 July 1994 as amended. Nor, it pointed out, had the French authorities failed in that obligation in the circumstances. In the light of the reports drawn up by the commander of the Lieutenant de Vaisseau Le Henaff, the Investigation Division found that when the frigate had drawn within sight of the Winner the latter \u201cwas flying no flag\u201d and its captain had \u201cnot only failed to answer the requests to identify the ship, in breach of the rules of international law, and failed to stop the ship, but [had] responded aggressively with a series of dangerous manoeuvres that jeopardised the safety of the French frigate and the lives of the sailors on the speedboat\u201d, and the crew of the Winner had thrown parcels containing large quantities of cocaine into the sea. There had therefore been \u201creasonable grounds\u201d, in the Investigation Division's view, to suspect the Winner of drug trafficking, so that \u201cin using force to stop the Winner and taking appropriate measures to control and restrain the crew, who were confined to their quarters, and to take over and steer the ship\u201d, the commander of the frigate had \u201cstrictly observed\u201d the provisions of Article 17.4 of the Vienna Convention (under which he is authorised, when a ship is boarded and searched, \u201cIf evidence of involvement in illicit traffic is found, [to] take appropriate action with respect to the vessel, persons and cargo on board\u201d) and the provisions of the Law of 15 July 1994 as amended, regulating the use of coercion measures, including, if necessary, the use of force in the event of refusal by a ship to submit to inspection (Articles 1 to 10), and providing for the implementation of the inspection and coercion measures provided for in international law in the particular case of drug trafficking (Articles 12 to 14).", "20. The Investigation Division went on to dismiss the applicants' argument that Article 13 of the Law of 15 July 1994 as amended provided only for assistance measures of an administrative nature, which excluded any form of coercion in respect of people, as the Article mentioned in general terms that the competent maritime authorities had the power to carry out or have carried out \u201cthe inspection and coercion measures provided for in international law\u201d and Article 17.4 c) of the Vienna Convention concerning drug trafficking expressly mentioned taking \u201cappropriate action with respect to the vessel, persons and cargo on board\u201d. Although it accepted that the exact nature of that action was not specified, the Investigation Division considered that the text concerned provided \u201cat least for the competent naval authorities to limit, if necessary, the freedom of the boarded ship's crew to come and go; otherwise the provision would be meaningless and the safety of the men taking over control of the ship would be seriously jeopardised\u201d. In respect of this last point, it considered that \u201cit cannot be ruled out in the course of such operations against international drug traffickers on the high seas that the crew might have weapons hidden away and might seek to regain control of the ship by force\u201d. It concluded that \u201cthe fact that the Winner's crew were confined to their quarters (...) under military guard so that the ship could be safely taken over and rerouted fell within the appropriate action provided for in Article 17.4 c) of the Vienna Convention\u201d.", "21. Lastly, the Investigation Division considered that the Law of 15 July 1994 \u201cnecessarily required some departure from ordinary criminal procedure to allow for the specific needs of the effort to combat drug trafficking by ships on the high seas, in keeping with the rules of international law, and for the fact that it was impossible in practice, bearing in mind the time needed to sail to the new port of destination, to apply the ordinary rules governing detention and the right to be brought promptly before a judge\u201d. Accordingly, the restrictions placed on the movements of a boarded ship's crew, as authorised in such cases by the United Nations Convention signed in Vienna on 20 December 1988, were not at variance with Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention and did not amount to unlawful detention. It also noted that in this particular case, as soon as the Winner had docked, its crew had been handed over to the police, immediately informed of their rights and placed in custody, then brought before the investigating judge.", "22. An appeal on points of law lodged by the applicants (complaining in particular of a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention) was dismissed in a judgment of the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation of 15 January 2003. According to that court, \u201cin ruling as it did, in so far as Cambodia, the flag State, [had] expressly and without restriction authorised the French authorities to stop the Winner and, in keeping with Article 17 of the Vienna Convention, only appropriate action had been taken against the persons on board, who [had been] lawfully taken into police custody as soon as they landed on French soil, the Investigation Division [had] justified its decision\u201d.", "23. In a judgment of 28 May 2005 the Ille-et-Vilaine Special Assize Court found Mr Georgios Boreas, Mr Symeon Theophanous, Mr Guillermo Sage Mart\u00ednez and Mr Sergio Cabrera Leon guilty of conspiracy to illegally attempt to import narcotics and sentenced them respectively to twenty years', eighteen years', ten years' and three years' imprisonment; it acquitted the other applicants of the charges against them. The parties have not said what the outcome of a subsequent appeal was.", "24. France is party to the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances signed in Vienna on 20 December 1988, Article 17 of which reads as follows:", "\u201cILLICIT TRAFFIC BY SEA", "1. The Parties shall co-operate to the fullest extent possible to suppress illicit traffic by sea, in conformity with the international law of the sea.", "2. A Party which has reasonable grounds to suspect that a vessel flying its flag or not displaying a flag or marks of registry is engaged in illicit traffic may request the assistance of other Parties in suppressing its use for that purpose. The Parties so requested shall render such assistance within the means available to them.", "3. A Party which has reasonable grounds to suspect that a vessel exercising freedom of navigation in accordance with international law, and flying the flag or displaying marks of registry of another Party is engaged in illicit traffic may so notify the flag State, request confirmation of registry and, if confirmed, request authorization from the flag State to take appropriate measures in regard to that vessel.", "4.
