The applicant was born in 1941 and now lives in the Moscow Region.", "5. In 1987 the applicant\u2019s employer, the State-owned construction and industrial holding \u201cMosenergostroy\u201d, seconded him for participation in the clean-up works at the site of the Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster. As a consequence of exposure to radioactive emissions, on 15 September 1989 the applicant was assigned to the second disability category.", "6. Until March 1996 the applicant\u2019s former employer had paid him monthly compensation for health damage. In November 1994 the holding was privatised and re-organised into a public company OAO \u201cSPK Mosenergostroy\u201d.", "7. Between 2 March 1996 and 1 February 2002 the compensation was paid by the Stupino Department of the Pension Fund (now renamed as Department no. 25 of the Pension Fund, hereinafter \u201cthe Stupino Pensions Department\u201d).", "8. Since 1 February 2002 the compensation has been paid by the Social Security Committee of the Stupino District Council in the Moscow Region.", "9. In 1997 the applicant brought a civil action against his former employer, \u201cMosenergostroy\u201d, claiming that the amount of the compensation paid had been incorrectly calculated in the period from 1989 to 2 March 1996.", "10. On 15 April 1997 the Korenovskiy District Court of the Krasnodar Region granted his claim in part.", "11. On 7 July 1997 the Krasnodar Regional Court quashed the judgment of 15 April 1997 and remitted the matter for a new examination on the ground that the obligation to pay compensation for health damage had been transferred to the social security authorities.", "12. On 8 September 1997 the Korenovskiy District Court joined the Stupino Pensions Department as a co-defendant to the proceedings.", "13. On 18 December 1997 the Korenovskiy District Court of the Krasnodar Region granted the applicant\u2019s claims against his former employer and established that the applicant had been entitled to monthly payments of RUR 15,035. No award against the Stupino Pensions Department was made because the applicant apparently objected to its being joined as a co-defendant. By interim decision (opredelenie) of 9 December 2000, an arithmetical error in the judgment was corrected.", "14. In 2002 the applicant asked the Korenovskiy District Court to supplement the operative part of the judgment of 18 December 1997 with a reference to the fact that from 2 March 1996 the Stupino Pensions Department should have been the legal successor to his former employer in respect of payment of compensation for the health damage. The Stupino Pensions Department objected to the applicant\u2019s request, claiming that it had been lodged outside the time-limit and that its granting would determine a matter that fell outside the scope of the judgment of 18 December 1997, namely the issue of its succession to the obligations of the applicant\u2019s former employer.", "15. By judgment (reshenie) of 5 April 2002, the Korenovskiy District Court amended the judgment of 18 December 1997. It established that from 2 March 1996 the Stupino Pensions Department should have paid compensation to the applicant in lieu of his applicant\u2019s former employer, in the same amount (RUR 15,035), with subsequent adjustment for increases in the minimum monthly wage. The judgment of 5 April 2002 was not appealed against.", "16. It appears that the Stupino Pensions Department continued to underpay the applicant. He asked the Korenovskiy District Court to clarify the procedure for enforcement of the judgment of 5 April 2002 and to issue him with a writ of execution.", "17. On 14 October 2002 the Korenovskiy District Court, noting that the defendant had been duly notified of the hearing but failed to appear, found that the Stupino Pensions Department had not complied with the judgment of 5 April 2002 and continued to pay the applicant significantly smaller amounts. By decision (opredelenie) of that date, the court ordered that the Stupino Pensions Department pay the applicant, at the expense of the Treasury, the amounts outstanding for the period from 2 March 1996 to 1 July 2002 to the total of RUR 5,412,251.81 and issued him with a writ of execution. The decision of 14 October 2002 was not appealed against.", "18. The applicant submitted the writ to the Ministry of Finance.", "19. On 5 February 2003 the Ministry of Finance forwarded the writ to the Ministry of Labour and Social Development, which, in turn, forwarded it to the Moscow Regional Social Security Committee.", "20. On 13 February 2003 the Moscow Regional Social Security Committee advised the applicant that his writ of execution had been accepted for enforcement. However, enforcement was only possible \u201cwithin the funding limits and budgetary constraints\u201d and \u201cin the chronological order as [writs of execution] had been issued by courts\u201d.", "21.

It has been established that the deferred instalments shall be guaranteed against inflation in accordance with the Russian laws...\u201d", "23. On 1 September 2003 the Korenovskiy District Court clarified its decision of 13 August 2003, indicating that the instalments should be equal and that the decision had immediate effect.", "24. According to the Government, on 28 October 2003 the Krasnodar Regional Court quashed the decision of 13 August 2003 and remitted the matter for a new examination. On 10 December 2003 the Korenovskiy District Court refused the application by the Stupino Pensions Department for a change of the debtor and stay of enforcement. Copies of these decisions have not been made available to the Court and their precise contents are not known.", "25. On 2 February 2004 the Stupino Pensions Department asked the Moscow Pensions Fund for the resources necessary to pay the debt to the applicant. On 5 February 2004, in response to an inquiry by a bailiff into the progress of the request, the Moscow Pensions Fund replied that they had asked the Ministry of Labour and Social Development to allocate the necessary amount (RUR 5,412,251.81).", "26.

The Supreme Court accepted as meritorious Ms L.\u2019s argument that that the Korenovskiy District Court had not been competent to issue the judgment of 5 April 2002.

On 13 September 2004 the Korenovskiy District Court determined that it had issued the judgment of 5 April 2002 in excess of jurisdiction because the Code of Civil Procedure had not provided for issuing of judgments in such situations.", "31.
