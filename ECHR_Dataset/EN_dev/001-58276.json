The applicants, Mr Fikret Ba\u015fkaya and Mr Mehemet Selim Ok\u00e7uo\u011flu, are Turkish citizens. The first applicant was born in 1940 and lives in Ankara. He is a professor of economics and a journalist. The second applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Istanbul. He is the owner of a publishing house, Doz Basin Yayin Ltd Sti.", "10. In April 1991 Doz Basin Yayin Ltd Sti published a book written by the first applicant and entitled Bat\u0131l\u0131la\u015fma, \u00c7a\u011fda\u015fla\u015fma, Kalk\u0131nma \u2013 Paradigman\u0131n \u0130flas\u0131/Resmi \u0130deolojinin Ele\u015ftirisine Giri\u015f (\u201cWesternisation, Modernisation, Development \u2013 Collapse of a Paradigm/An Introduction to the Critique of the Official Ideology\u201d).", "The book was an academic essay of 219 pages, containing 370 references, which involved a description of the socio-economic evolution of Turkey since the 1920s and the analysis and criticism of the \u201cofficial ideology\u201d of the State. According to the titles listed in the table of contents, the author dealt with the following topics: Intelligentsia and Official Ideology; The Characteristics of the National Struggle; The Question of the National Character of the National Struggle; The Comintern and whether the National Struggle was Anti-Imperialist; Mustafa Kemal and the Individual\u2019s Role in History; The Characteristics of the Kemalist Regime: an Original Form of Bonapartism; Productive Forces and Economic Policies; Bonapartist Regime and Accumulation of Capital; A Classless, Privilegeless, Populist Dictatorship; The Evolution of Socio-Economic Formation in the Neo-Colonialist Era; The Eighties: Strengthening of the Satellitisation Process; The Collapse of the Paradigm and the Science of Economics: Means to Legitimise Existing Tendencies.", "11. The impugned chapter of the book included the following passages:", "\u201cThe Kurdish problem plays a significant role in the analysis of the evolution of Milli M\u00fccadele [Turkish National Independence War (1919-1922)] and Turkish social formation. The Kurdish problem and the process of the colonisation of Kurdistan are indeed very important and, as such, should be the subject-matter of another book. Moreover, the problem is not only related to Turkey. The formation of the domestic politics of four States in the region (Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Syria) (type of political regimes) as well as the \u2018unique\u2019 nature of relationships between these four neighbouring States make it a complicated issue.", "We have two reasons why we wish to discuss the problem, even if in limited form, within the plan and scope of this book. These are to indicate the \u2018irrationality\u2019 of official ideology and the real nature of Milli M\u00fccadele. In other words, [we wish] to discuss whether what is presented as \u2018Kurtulu\u015f Sava\u015f\u0131\u2019 [Independence War] is in reality an \u2018Independence Movement\u2019 or not. Without any doubt, the imprisonment of Kurdistan (if the small area within the borders of the Soviet Union is omitted) within the borders of four different States gives the imperialists too easily \u2018control\u2019 over these four States. Although the Kurdish problem is of great importance with regard to the protection of the imperialist status quo in the region, we shall not here go into an analysis of this aspect of the problem. [page 51]", "...", "On the other hand, the racist policy of denial which has been followed with regard to the Kurds since the foundation of the Republic [1923] has also been an important factor in the development of the fascist movement in Turkey. As a contradiction, even though \u2018the assumption of non-existence\u2019 of the Kurdish Nation constitutes an important element of the official ideology, this is at the same time the weakest point of the ideology in question. It is not possible \u2018to eliminate with the mind\u2019 a nation which exists and the objective reality continues to exist regardless of the nonsense and unfounded suspicions of the people. Of course, this does not mean that the nonsense, unfounded suspicions have no effect! There is never a lack of those who profit from it, acquire bureaucratic, academic careers, receive high salaries, go up the step ladder of the political arena ... [page 52]", "...", "It was believed that colonialism would come to an end with the abolishment of direct political-military-police control in the colonies. Today, however, the [natural] resources of the Third World are carried to imperialist countries in volumes which are much higher than those of the colonial period. Therefore, the relationship between the Turkish State and Kurdistan is not of an imperialist devouring category. One can speak of a situation which also directly embodies a political, military, cultural, ideological oppression. Thus, a direct colony status is in force. [page 59]\u201d", "12. It appears that the publication of the book came to the notice of the prosecution authorities on 3 May 1991.", "13. On 2 August 1991 the public prosecutor at the Istanbul National Security Court (\u0130stanbul Devlet G\u00fcvenlik Mahkemesi), having regard to the contents of the book in question, issued an indictment against the applicants. The first applicant, as the author of the book, was charged under section 8(1) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 (\u201cthe 1991 Act\u201d) with disseminating propaganda against the indivisibility of the State. The second applicant, as the owner of the publishing company, was charged under section 8(2) of the 1991 Act. In the bill of indictment, the public prosecutor quoted extracts from the chapter of the book reproduced at paragraph 11 above.", "14. In the proceedings before the National Security Court, the applicants denied the charges and sought their acquittal.", "The first applicant submitted that his book had been an academic work that could not be viewed as propaganda. Being a professor he had had the duty to conduct research and publish his conclusions and could not be forced to accept the \u201cofficial version of reality\u201d. His book might be judged by academics, but not by the courts. It could not be permissible to try and convict someone for the expression of his or her opinion.", "The second applicant submitted, inter alia, that it was not possible to make an assessment of the book as a whole solely on the basis of extracts from a single chapter. He alleged that section 8 of the 1991 Act was inconsistent with the Turkish Constitution and Turkey\u2019s international obligations. There was a \u201cKurdish problem\u201d in Turkey and commenting or expressing ideas on this problem could not constitute an offence.", "15. In a final statement dated 18 March 1992, the public prosecutor requested the conviction of the first applicant under section 8(1) of the 1991 Act and that of the second applicant under section 8(2), as well as the confiscation of all copies of the book. The public prosecutor considered that the offence had been committed on 3 May 1991.", "16. On 14 October 1992 the court acquitted the applicants. It held that the book as a whole was an academic work containing no elements of propaganda.", "17. The public prosecutor appealed. He submitted that the book alleged that a certain part of Turkish territory had belonged to \u201cKurdistan\u201d which the Turks had annexed and colonised. Concluding that the book did indeed disseminate propaganda against the indivisibility of the State, he requested that the verdict be set aside.", "18. On 4 February 1993 the Court of Cassation quashed the decision of the trial court and referred the case back for retrial. It gave the following reasons:", "\u201cIn the writings on pages 51 to 59 of the book \u2026 it is stated that a part of the territory within the borders of the Turkish Republic is a part of Kurdistan which belongs to the Kurdish nation, and that this territory has been annexed by the Turks and is subject to colony status. The Istanbul National Security Court, without considering that [the above] statement, as such, exceeds the limits of criticism and constitutes dissemination of propaganda against the indivisible integrity of the State of the Turkish Republic with its territory and nation, found [both] accused \u2018not guilty\u2019.", "The judgment \u2026 is contrary to the law and thus, the public prosecutor\u2019s grounds of appeal are upheld. Accordingly, it is unanimously decided that the judgment be reversed \u2026\u201d", "19. In a judgment dated 5 August 1993, the Istanbul National Security Court found the applicants guilty of the offences with which they had been charged. It sentenced the first applicant to two years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of 50,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL) and the second applicant to six months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of TRL 50,000,000. Considering the applicants\u2019 good conduct during the trial, the court reduced the first applicant\u2019s sentence to one year and eight months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of TRL 41,666,666 and the second applicant\u2019s sentence to five months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of TRL 41,666,666. On the other hand, the court dismissed the public prosecutor\u2019s request for an order of confiscation of the book.", "In its reasoning supporting the convictions, the court stated:", "\u201cAfter the examination of the book which is the subject of the offence, it is understood that the [following] statements", "on page 51 that \u2018The Kurdish problem plays a significant role in the analysis of the evolution of Milli M\u00fccadele [Turkish National Independence War (1919-1922)] and Turkish social formation.

Therefore, the following sentence shall be drafted under the provisions of Law no. 3713 which is applicable to the proven acts of the accused.\u201d", "20. The applicants appealed to the Court of Cassation, which held a hearing in the case. The applicants, while reiterating the defence made before the National Security Court, emphasised that the latter had failed to consider the book as a whole and had erroneously based its decision on an assessment of one chapter. The first applicant maintained that section 8 of the 1991 Act was inconsistent with the Turkish Constitution and the Convention, and he could not therefore be tried and convicted under that provision. He also referred to his previous arguments concerning the lack of clarity of the relevant provisions of the 1991 Act. The second applicant asserted that his sentence to imprisonment had been unlawful in that section 8(2) only authorised the imposition of a fine.", "21. In its decision of 16 December 1993, delivered on 22 December 1993, the Court of Cassation upheld the National Security Court\u2019s findings and dismissed the appeals.", "22. As of 18 March 1994 the first applicant was dismissed, under section 98(2) of the Civil Servants Act (Law no. 367), from his post as lecturer at the University of Ankara. The relevant decision referred to his conviction under the 1991 Act and to his being sentenced to twenty months\u2019 imprisonment.", "23. On 3 October 1997 the National Security Court granted a request by the prosecution for an order of seizure in respect of the sixth edition of the impugned book.", "24. The applicants served their sentences in prison and paid the fines. After the amendments made by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995 to the 1991 Act, the Istanbul National Security Court re-examined the second applicant\u2019s case. On 19 April 1996 the court held that these amendments could not be applied to his case as he had already served his sentence.", "25.
