On 22 July 1999 the Supreme Court rejected the appeal because such a remedy was not provided in the applicant\u2019s case since his claim was below the PLN 5,000 threshold set by the legislation for cassation appeals. In addition, the court observed that the cassation appeal had been lodged by the applicant instead of qualified counsel.", "On 31 December 1999 the applicant lodged with the Supreme Court a further appeal challenging the decision rejecting his cassation appeal.
