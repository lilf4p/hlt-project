The applicant was born 1961 and is now serving a custodial sentence in the town of Yemva in the Komi Republic.", "7. On 11 April 1991 the Kochubeyevskiy People's Court of the Stavropol Region convicted the applicant of aggravated robbery (Article 146 \u00a7 2 of the RSFSR Criminal Code) and the involvement of minors in criminal activities (Article 210 of the RSFSR Criminal Code). It sentenced him to eight years' imprisonment in a correctional colony. On 29 May 1991 the Stavropol Regional Court upheld the judgment on appeal.", "8. The applicant was sent to a correctional colony to serve his sentence. On 14 March 1994 the colony director granted him home leave and he travelled to his native village in the Dagestan Republic. He was due back at the colony on 1 April 1994.", "9. According to the applicant, he found his wife and children in a precarious situation and decided not to return to the colony but to start working to support his family. The applicant and his family moved to the town of Gubkinskiy in the Tyumen Region.", "10.

On 16 November 2000 the Pechora Town Court of the Komi Republic convicted the applicant of evading punishment (Article 188.1 of the RSFSR Criminal Code) and sentenced him to six months' imprisonment to run consecutively to the time left to serve under the judgment of 11 April 1991 (four years and seven months in total).", "12.

It established that Article 162 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation provided for a more lenient punishment for aggravated robbery than Article 146 \u00a7 2 of the RSFSR Criminal Code. As the provisions providing for lighter sentences could be applied retrospectively to convicted prisoners, the court considered it necessary to recharacterise the offence committed by the applicant in accordance with the new Criminal Code. It also deleted from the original judgment a reference to the applicant's inebriated state at the time of the offence as the new Code no longer classified inebriated as an aggravating circumstance. However, that did not result in a reduction of the applicant's sentence because the original sentence remained within the limits of Article 146 \u00a7 2 of the new Code.", "15.

I was told right away that the new ruling would be identical to the ruling of 28 June 2002, the only difference being that it would be made in my presence. I asked to appoint prisoner S. as my representative but was told, 'Prisoner S. is now restricted in his movements and cannot attend the court hearing'. I asked for the refusal to be certified in writing, but this was refused. I asked those present at the 'court hearing' to give their names, but was told, 'you will find out from the ruling'.", "I considered my further participation in this farce inappropriate and asked that my refusal to participate further in the hearing ... be entered in the record and left the room.
