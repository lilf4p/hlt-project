His claim for widows\u2019 benefits was made on 28 February 2001 and was rejected on 1 March 2001 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows\u2019 benefits because he was not a woman. On 6 March 2001 the applicant appealed and reconsideration took place on 8 March 2001 whereby the previous decision was upheld. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under United Kingdom law.", "The applicant was not in receipt of child benefit at the time of his claim.", "The domestic law relevant to this application is set out in Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, \u00a7\u00a7 1426, ECHR 2002-IV and Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, no. 42949/98, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41, 25 July 2007."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
