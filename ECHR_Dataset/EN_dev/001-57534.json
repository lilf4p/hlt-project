BELGIUM", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 8;Violation of Art. 14+8;Violation of Art. 14+P1-1;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["8. Alexandra Marckx was born on 16 October 1973 at Wilrijk, near Antwerp; she is the daughter of Paula Marckx, a Belgian national, who is unmarried and a journalist by profession.", "Paula Marckx duly reported Alexandra\u2019s birth to the Wilrijk registration officer who informed the District Judge (juge de paix) as is required by Article 57 bis of the Belgian Civil Code (\"the Civil Code\") in the case of \"illegitimate\" children.", "9. On 26 October 1973, the District Judge of the first district of Antwerp summoned Paula Marckx to appear before him (Article 405) so as to obtain from her the information required to make arrangements for Alexandra\u2019s guardianship; at the same time, he informed her of the methods available for recognising her daughter and of the consequences in law of any such recognition (see paragraph 14 below). He also drew her attention to certain provisions of the Civil Code, including Article 756 which concerns \"exceptional\" forms of inheritance (successions \"irr\u00e9guli\u00e8res\").", "10. On 29 October 1973, Paula Marckx recognised her child in accordance with Article 334 of the Code. She thereby automatically became Alexandra\u2019s guardian (Article 396 bis); the family council, on which the sister and certain other relatives of Paula Marckx sat under the chairmanship of the District Judge, was empowered to take in Alexandra\u2019s interests various measures provided for by law.", "11. On 30 October 1974, Paula Marckx adopted her daughter pursuant to Article 349 of the Civil Code. The procedure, which was that laid down by Articles 350 to 356, entailed certain enquiries and involved some expenses. It concluded on 18 April 1975 with a judgment confirming the adoption, the effect whereof was retroactive to the date of the instrument of adoption, namely 30 October 1974.", "12. At the time of her application to the Commission, Ms. Paula Marckx\u2019s family included, besides Alexandra, her own mother, Mrs. Victorine Libot, who died in August 1974, and a sister, Mrs. Blanche Marckx.", "13. The applicants complain of the Civil Code provisions on the manner of establishing the maternal affiliation of an \"illegitimate\" child and on the effects of establishing such affiliation as regards both the extent of the child\u2019s family relationships and the patrimonial rights of the child and of his mother. The applicants also put in issue the necessity for the mother to adopt the child if she wishes to increase his rights.", "14. Under Belgian law, no legal bond between an unmarried mother and her child results from the mere fact of birth: whilst the birth certificate recorded at the registry office suffices to prove the maternal affiliation of a married woman\u2019s children (Article 319 of the Civil Code), the maternal affiliation of an \"illegitimate\" child is established by means either of a voluntary recognition by the mother or of legal proceedings taken for the purpose (action en recherche de maternit\u00e9).", "Nevertheless, an unrecognised \"illegitimate\" child bears his mother\u2019s name which must appear on the birth certificate (Article 57). The appointment of his guardian is a matter for the family council which is presided over by the District Judge.", "Under Article 334, recognition, \"if not inserted in the birth certificate, shall be effected by a formal deed\". Recognition is declaratory and not attributive: it does not create but records the child\u2019s status and is retroactive to the date of birth. However, it does not necessarily follow that the person effecting recognition is actually the child\u2019s mother; on the contrary, any interested party may claim that the recognition does not correspond to the truth (Article 339). Many unmarried mothers - about 25 % according to the Government, although the applicants consider this an exaggerated figure - do not recognise their child.", "Proceedings to establish maternal affiliation (action en recherche de maternit\u00e9) may be instituted by the child within five years from his attainment of majority or, whilst he is still a minor, by his legal representative with the consent of the family council (Articles 341a-341c of the Civil Code).", "15. The establishment of the maternal affiliation of an \"illegitimate\" child has limited effects as regards both the extent of his family relationships and the rights of the child and his mother in the matter of inheritance on intestacy and voluntary dispositions.", "16. In the context of the maternal affiliation of an \"illegitimate\" child, Belgian legislation does not employ the concepts of \"family\" and \"relative\". Even once such affiliation has been established, it in principle creates a legal bond with the mother alone. The child does not become a member of his mother\u2019s family. The law excludes it from that family as regards inheritance rights on intestacy (see paragraph 17 below). Furthermore, if the child\u2019s parents are dead or under an incapacity, he cannot marry, before attaining the age of twenty-one, without consent which has to be given by his guardian (Article 159 of the Civil Code) and not, as is the case for a \"legitimate\" child, by his grandparents (Article 150); the law does not expressly create any maintenance obligations, etc., between the child and his grandparents. However, certain texts make provision for exceptions, for example as regards the impediments to marriage (Articles 161 and 162). According to a judgment of 22 September 1966 of the Belgian Court of Cassation (Pasicrisie I, 1967, pp 78-79), these texts \"place the bonds existing between an illegitimate child and his grandparents on a legal footing based on the affection, respect and devotion that are the consequence of consanguinity ... (which) creates an obligation for the ascendants to take an interest in their descendants and, as a corollary, gives them the right, whenever this is not excluded by the law, to know and protect them and exercise over them the influence dictated by affection and devotion\". The Court of Cassation deduced from this that grandparents were entitled to a right of access to the child.", "17. A recognised \"illegitimate\" child\u2019s rights of inheritance on intestacy are less than those of a \"legitimate\" child. As appears from Articles 338, 724, 756 to 758, 760, 761, 769 to 773 and 913 of the Civil Code, a recognised \"illegitimate\" child does not have, in the estate of his parent who dies intestate, the status of heir but solely that of \"exceptional heir\" (\"successeur irr\u00e9gulier\"): he has to seek a court order putting him in possession of the estate (envoi en possession). He is the sole beneficiary of his deceased mother\u2019s estate only if she leaves no relatives entitled to inherit (Article 758); otherwise, its maximum entitlement - which arises when his mother leaves no descendants, ascendants, brothers or sisters \u2013 is three-quarters of the share which he would have taken if \"legitimate\" (Article 757). Furthermore, his mother may, during her lifetime, reduce that entitlement by one-half. Finally, Article 756 denies to the \"illegitimate\" child any rights on intestacy in the estates of his mother\u2019s relatives.", "18. Recognised \"illegitimate\" children are also at a disadvantage as regards voluntary dispositions, since Article 908 provides that they \"may receive by disposition inter vivos or by will no more than their entitlement under the title \u2018Inheritance on Intestacy\u2019\".", "Conversely, the mother of such a child, unless she has no relatives entitled to inherit, may give in her lifetime or bequeath to him only part of her property. On the other hand, if the child\u2019s affiliation has not been established, the mother may so give or bequeath to him the whole of her property, provided that there are no heirs entitled to a reserved portion of her estate (h\u00e9ritiers r\u00e9servataires). The mother is thus faced with the following alternative: either she recognises the child and loses the possibility of leaving all her estate to him; or she renounces establishing with him a family relationship in the eyes of the law, in order to retain the possibility of leaving all her estate to him just as she might to a stranger.", "19. If the mother of a recognised \"illegitimate\" child remains unmarried, she has but one means of improving his status, namely, \"simple\" adoption. In such cases, the age requirements for this form of adoption are eased by Article 345 para. 2, sub-paragraph 2, of the Civil Code. The adopted child acquires over the adopter\u2019s estate the rights of a \"legitimate\" child but, unlike the latter, has no rights on intestacy in the estates of his mother\u2019s relatives (Article 365).", "Only legitimation (Articles 331-333) and legitimation by adoption (Articles 368-370) place an \"illegitimate\" child on exactly the same footing as a \"legitimate\" child; both of these measures presuppose the mother\u2019s marriage.", "20. Belgium has signed, but not yet ratified, the Brussels Convention of 12 September 1962 on the Establishment of Maternal Affiliation of Natural Children, which was prepared by the International Commission on Civil Status and entered into force on 23 April 1964. Neither has Belgium yet ratified, nor even signed, the Convention of 15 October 1975 on the Legal Status of Children born out of Wedlock, which was concluded within the Council of Europe and entered into force on 11 August 1978. Both of these instruments are based on the principle \"mater semper certa est\"; the second of them also regulates such questions as maintenance obligations, parental authority and rights of succession.", "21. However, the Belgian Government submitted to the Senate on 15 February 1978 a Bill to which they referred the Court in their memorial of 3 July 1978 and subsequently at the hearings on 24 October. The official statement of reasons accompanying the Bill, which mentions, inter alia, the Conventions of 1962 and 1975 cited above, states that the Bill \"seeks to institute equality in law between all children\". In particular, maternal affiliation would be established on the mother\u2019s name being entered on the birth certificate, which would introduce into Belgian law the principle \"mater semper certa est\". Recognition by an unmarried mother would accordingly no longer be necessary, unless there were no such entry. Furthermore, the Civil Code would confer on children born out of wedlock rights identical to those presently enjoyed by children born in wedlock in the matter of inheritance on intestacy and voluntary dispositions."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
