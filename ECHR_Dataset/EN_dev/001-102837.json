The applicant association, which was set up in 1977, is a non-profit association registered in Rennaz (Canton of Vaud). It is the national branch of the Raelian Movement, an organisation based in Geneva and founded in 1976 by Claude Vorilhon, known as \u201cRa\u00ebl\u201d. According to its constitution, its aim is to make the first contacts and establish good relations with extraterrestrials.", "7. On 7 March 2001 the applicant association requested authorisation from the police administration for the city of Neuch\u00e2tel (the \u201cpolice administration\u201d) to conduct a poster advertising campaign in the period between 2 and 13 April 2001. The poster in question, measuring 97x69 cm, featured in the upper part the following wording in large yellow characters on a dark blue background: \u201cThe Message from Extraterrestrials\u201d; in the lower part of the poster, in characters of the same size but in bolder type, the address of the Raelian Movement\u2019s website, together with a telephone number in France, could be seen; at the very bottom was the phrase \u201cScience at last replaces religion\u201d. The middle of the poster was taken up by pictures of extraterrestrials\u2019 faces and a pyramid, together with a flying saucer and the Earth.", "8. On 29 March 2001 the police administration denied authorisation, referring to two previous refusals. It had been indicated in a French parliamentary report on sects, dating from 1995, and in a judgment of the president of the Civil Court for the district of La Sarine (Canton of Fribourg), that the Raelian Movement engaged in activities that were contrary to public order (ordre public) and immoral.", "9. In a decision of 19 December 2001 the municipal council of the city of Neuch\u00e2tel dismissed an appeal from the applicant association, finding that it could not rely on the protection of religious freedom because it was to be regarded as a dangerous sect. The interference with freedom of expression had been based on Article 19 of the Administrative Regulations for the City of Neuch\u00e2tel (the \u201cRegulations\u201d); its purpose was to protect the public interest and it was proportionate, since the organisation advocated, among other things, human cloning, \u201cgeniocracy\u201d and \u201csensual meditation\u201d.", "10. On 27 October 2003 the Neuch\u00e2tel Land Management Directorate upheld that decision. It noted that, for the Raelian Movement, life on earth had been created by extraterrestrials, who were also the founders of the various religions and were capable of saving the world, and accepted that this amounted to a religious conviction protected by freedom of conscience and belief. It further accepted that the Neuch\u00e2tel Regulations constituted a sufficient legal basis in such matters. The Directorate observed that there was nothing offensive in the text and picture on the poster, or in the allusion to extraterrestrials. However, it pointed to the fact that the Raelian Movement advocated \u201cgeniocracy\u201d (a political model based on intelligence), and human cloning. Moreover, in a judgment of 13 February 1998, concerning a right of reply, the Fribourg Cantonal Court had found that the movement also \u201ctheoretically\u201d advocated paedophilia and incest, especially in the works of Ra\u00ebl himself. The practice of \u201csensual meditation\u201d could also easily lead to abuse. In addition, the website of Clonaid, to which the Raelian Movement\u2019s site had a link, proposed specific services in the area of cloning, and eugenism was contrary to the principle of non-discrimination. The poster advertising campaign was prejudicial to morals and to the rights of others. In any event, the Raelian Movement had other means to disseminate its ideas.", "11. The applicant association appealed to the Administrative Court for the Canton of Neuch\u00e2tel. It claimed, among other things, that the mere defence of \u201cgeniocracy\u201d, cloning and sensual meditation were not offensive opinions. Moreover, it argued that the movement denounced paedophilia through its association Nopedo. The refusal to authorise its poster thus amounted purely and simply to censorship, especially as the applicant association\u2019s website was, in any event, accessible through a search engine.", "12. In a judgment of 22 April 2005 the Administrative Court dismissed the appeal, after acknowledging, however, that the applicant association defended a global vision of the world and was entitled to both freedom of opinion and religious freedom. It found first that the impugned measure was based on the Administrative Regulations, which constituted a law in the substantive sense, and that the poster had to be assessed in relation to the message conveyed by the books and websites that could be accessed from the movement\u2019s website. The services proposed by Clonaid were manifestly contrary to Swiss public order. The court further observed that criminal complaints had been filed against the Raelian Movement alleging the existence of sexual practices that were intended to systematically corrupt young teenagers. The content of the works on \u201cgeniocracy\u201d and \u201csensual meditation\u201d could lead certain adults to sexually abuse children, the child being described in certain works as a \u201cprivileged sexual object\u201d. The comments on \u201cgeniocracy\u201d and the criticisms of contemporary democracies were likely to undermine public order, safety and morality. For those reasons the Administrative Court concluded that it was not justifiable to authorise the dissemination of such ideas on the public highway.", "13. The applicant association lodged a public-law appeal against that judgment with the Federal Court, requesting that it be set aside and that the case be referred back to the respondent authority for a new decision.", "14. In a judgment of 20 September 2005, served on the applicant association on 10 October 2005, the Federal Court dismissed the appeal. The relevant passages read as follows:", "\u201cThe Directorate, then the Administrative Court, acknowledged that the [applicant] association could rely on the right to freedom of religion (Art. 15 of the Constitution, Art. 9 ECHR and Art. 18 UN Covenant II), in so far as it defended a global vision of the world, especially as regards its creation and the origin of the various religions. The City of Neuch\u00e2tel disputes this, noting that the aim of the [applicant] association as defined in Article 2 of its Constitution, is not religious in nature. According to a report on \u2018sects\u2019 produced in 1995 for the French National Assembly, the Raelian Movement is classified among the movements that present dangers for the individual, especially on account of the excessive financial demands made of its members and practices that cause bodily harm, and also dangers for the community, in particular through an antisocial discourse. Many of the movement\u2019s publications contain passages described as offensive.", "There is no need to ascertain whether a religious movement may, on account of the dangers it represents, be precluded from relying on the right to freedom of religion, or whether the [applicant] association presents such dangers. Indeed, the parties agree that the applicant is entitled to rely on the right to freedom of opinion. As to the conditions in which such freedom may be restricted, as laid down in Article 36 of the Constitution, it makes little difference whether Article 15 or Article 16 of the Constitution is relied on (see also Articles 9 \u00a7 2 and 10 \u00a7 2 ECHR). The applicant association does not argue that the impugned measure impairs the very essence of its religious freedom, or that the restrictions . On the contrary, the applicant association relies on the principles of proportionality and public interest, without distinction as to the constitutional right invoked.", "...", "5.2 According to case-law, citizens do not have an unconditional right to an extended use of public space, in particular when a means of advertising on the public highway involves activity of a certain scale and duration, and excludes any similar use by third parties (Federal Court judgment 128 I 295 point 3c/aa p. 300 and the judgments cited therein). When it wishes to grant authorisation for extended or private use of public space, or when it supervises the conditions under which a licence is used, the State must nevertheless take into account, in balancing the interests at stake, the substantive content of the right to freedom of expression (Federal Court judgment 100 Ia 392 point 5 p. 402).", "5.3 In the present case, the grounds given by the Cantonal Court to confirm the refusal by the City of Neuch\u00e2tel relate to respect for morality and the Swiss legal order. The Administrative Court took the view that it was necessary to take into account not only the content of the poster but also the ideas conveyed by the Raelian Movement, together with the works and websites that could be accessed from the movement\u2019s website. Three different criticisms are thus directed against the [applicant] association. Firstly, the [applicant] association\u2019s website contains a link to that of Clonaid, via which this company offers specific cloning-related services to the general public and announced, in early 2003, the birth of cloned babies. Cloning is prohibited under Swiss law, pursuant to Art. 119 of the Constitution and to the Medically-Assisted Reproduction Act (RS 814.90). Secondly, the Administrative Court referred to a judgment of the District Court of La Sarine, which mentioned possible sexual abuse of children. Numerous members of the movement had, moreover, been investigated by the police because of their sexual practices. Thirdly, the promotion of \u2018geniocracy\u2019, a doctrine according to which power should be given to the most intelligent individuals, and the criticism consequently directed at contemporary democracies, was likely to undermine the maintaining of public order, safety and morality.", "5.4 The applicant no longer contests, at this stage, the existence of a sufficient legal basis, namely, in this case, Article 19 of the Regulations. A municipal by-law offers the same guarantees, in terms of democratic legitimacy, as a Cantonal law, and thus constitutes a sufficient legal basis (judgment 1P.293/2004 of 31 May 2005 point 4.3 Federal Court judgment 131 I xxx; Federal Court judgment 122 I 305 point 5a p. 312; 120 Ia 265 point 2a p. 266/267 and the references cited therein). The applicant invokes, however, the principle of public interest and criticises the respondent authorities for going beyond the content of the poster and engaging in an assessment of the [applicant] association\u2019s activities. It argues that if it had generally engaged in conduct that was immoral or in breach of public order, it would have been dissolved by the courts pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil Code. If no decision had been taken to that effect, it would not be possible to prohibit it from publicising its philosophy and world vision.", "5.5 The poster in itself does not contain anything, either in its text or in its illustrations, that was unlawful or likely to offend the general public. Above the central drawing representing extra-terrestrials appears the text \u2018The Message from Extraterrestrials\u2019, without any explanation. Below that, the [applicant] association\u2019s website address and a telephone number are printed in bolder type. The phrase \u2018Science at last replaces religion\u2019 is admittedly capable of offending the religious beliefs of certain persons, but it is merely the expression of the movement\u2019s doctrine and cannot be described as particularly provocative.", "The poster as a whole can thus clearly be seen as an invitation to visit the website of the [applicant] association or to contact it by telephone. Faced with such advertising, the authority must examine not only the admissibility of the advertisement\u2019s message as such, but also that of its content. It is therefore legitimate to ascertain whether the website in question might contain information, data or links capable of offending people or of infringing the law.", "Moreover, contrary to the applicant\u2019s allegation, an association may be criticised for opinions or activities which, without constituting grounds for dissolution within the meaning of Article 78 of the Civil Code, nevertheless justify a restriction on advertising.", "5.5.1 As regards cloning, it was not the opinions expressed by the [applicant] association in favour of such practices (particularly in the book Yes to Human Cloning, published in 2001 and available via the applicant\u2019s website) that were penalised, but the link with the company Clonaid, set up by the association itself, which proposes various practical services in this area for payment. The issue is thus not simply, contrary to what the applicant has argued, the expression of a favourable opinion of cloning, protected by Article 16 of the Constitution, but the practice of that activity, in breach of its prohibition under Article 119 \u00a7 2 (a) of the Constitution. That provision, accepted in 1992 by the majority of the population and of the Swiss Cantons (in the form of Article 24novies (a) of the Constitution), falls in particular within a policy of protection of human dignity, according to the conception thereof that is generally shared in this country (FF 1996 III 278; see also the response of the Federal Council to a question from R. Gonseth of 9 June 1997). The applicant does not contest the unlawfulness of human cloning, especially if it is carried out for commercial gain (Section 36 \u00a7 Medically-Assisted Reproduction Act; Art. 119 \u00a7 2 (e) of the Constitution). Nor can it seriously contest the fact that the link to the Clonaid website contributes to the promotion of an unlawful activity, and goes further than the mere expression of an opinion. On that first point, which already justifies the decision under appeal, the applicant has not put forward any real relevant argument within the meaning of Art. 90 \u00a7 1 (b) of the Judicial Organisation Act.", "5.5.2 On 15 October 2003 the Intercantonal Beliefs Information Centre provided information on the Raelian Movement. This information shows, among other things, that the movement apparently has a political mission. Virulently attacking democracies, which are referred to as \u2018mediocracies\u2019, it defends the notion of \u2018geniocracy\u2019, a political model based on individuals\u2019 level of intelligence. A world government would consist of geniuses, elected by individuals whose intelligence is 10% higher than average. Admittedly, \u201cgeniocracy\u201d is presented as a utopia and not as a genuine political project; contrary to the finding of the Administrative Court, this doctrine does not appear likely to undermine public order or safety.", "However, apart from the fact that the doctrine appears to be largely inspired by eugenism, it is manifestly capable of offending the democratic and anti-discriminatory convictions that underpin the rule of law (see, in particular, the wording of the preamble to the Federal Constitution of 18 April 1999, together with Article 8 of the Constitution concerning equality and the prohibition of discrimination).", "5.5.3 Lastly, according to the judgment under appeal, it cannot be considered that the Raelian Movement advocates paedophilia. However, numerous members have apparently been investigated by the police on account of their sexual practices. According to a judgment delivered on 28 November 1997 by the District Court of La Sarine, concerning a right of reply requested by the Mouvement ra\u00eblien suisse, the remarks made by Ra\u00ebl in his works could lead certain adults to commit acts of sexual abuse against children. The judgment quotes extracts from works by Ra\u00ebl that can be downloaded from the website of the [applicant] association, according to which the sexual education of children should not only be theoretical but should consist of a sensual education aimed at showing them how to derive pleasure from it. That judgment further indicates that, notwithstanding the denial subsequently issued on this point, certain articles published in the quarterly newsletter Apocalypse described the child as a \u2018privileged sexual object\u2019. Lastly, it is stated that a friend and a member of the Raelian Movement were convicted by the Vaucluse Assize Court and sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment for sexually assaulting a 12-year-old girl. The judgment was upheld on 13 February 1998 by the Fribourg Cantonal Court. An ordinary appeal and a public-law appeal by the Mouvement ra\u00eblien were dismissed on 24 August 1998 by the Federal Court, having regard in particular to the equivocal writings of the movement\u2019s founder or members (judgments 5P.172/1998 and 5C.104/1998).", "The case-file, moreover, contains various documents concerning criminal proceedings brought against members of the [applicant] association for sexual assault. A judgment of 24 January 2002 of the Lyon Court of Appeal clearly shows that acts of sexual abuse were committed by leaders of the movement against minors. The movement\u2019s leaders are thus said to have advocated \u2018a broad sexual freedom strongly encouraging commission of the act\u2019; they had thus corrupted young teenagers by supposedly philosophical discourse, by increasingly specific sexual fondling and by inciting them more and more forcefully, in order to satisfy \u2018their sexual needs and fantasies with young girls who had just turned fifteen, and who were changing partners very quickly\u2019.", "The fact that the impugned articles date from the 1980s and that there has been no conviction in Switzerland does not negate the involvement of members of the [applicant] association in acts leading to criminal sanctions. The applicant association does not dispute the fact that certain passages in the books available via its website could lead adults to abuse children. On that point also, the applicant\u2019s arguments do not address the grounds set out in the decision under appeal. Since acts of abuse have indeed been recorded on the part of certain members of the Raelian Movement, the argument that paedophilia is strongly condemned by the movement\u2019s official doctrine is not decisive.", "5.6 Having regard to the foregoing, the refusal issued to the applicant association appears to be justified by sufficient public-interest grounds, because it is necessary to prevent the commission of acts constituting criminal offences under Swiss law (reproductive cloning and sexual acts with children). Moreover, certain passages in the works available via the applicant\u2019s website (in particular about the \u2018sensual awakening\u2019 of children, and \u2018geniocracy\u2019) are likely to be seriously offensive to readers.", "5.7 The applicant association invokes the principle of proportionality. It points out that the poster itself contains nothing that is contrary to public order, and maintains that the measure is not appropriate to the aim pursued.", "5.7.1 In accordance with Article 36 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution., any restriction on a fundamental right must be proportionate to the aim pursued. It must be appropriate to the fulfilment of that aim and any damage to private interests must be kept to a minimum (Federal Court judgment 125 I 474 point 3 p. 482 and the references cited therein).", "5.7.2 In the present case, the public interest does not only consist in limiting the publicity given to the [applicant] association\u2019s website, in view of the reservations expressed above about public order and morality; it is even more important to ensure that the State does not provide any support for such publicity by making public space available for it, which might suggest that it endorses or tolerates the opinions or conduct in question. From that perspective, the prohibition of the posters is appropriate to the aim pursued. Furthermore, the measure criticised by the applicant is confined to the display of posters in public spaces. The [applicant] association remains free to express its beliefs by many other means of communication at its disposal (see the Murphy judgment of 10 July 2003, ECHR 2003-IX, p. 33, \u00a7 74).", "5.7.3 The applicant takes the view that the authority should have suggested that it make changes to the poster in order to make the content admissible. However, even though it was aware of the objections raised against its poster campaign, the applicant itself never proposed a version of the poster that was likely to be authorised. The Administrative Court, for its part, found that the poster should be prohibited even without the reference to the website, but this seems questionable; there is no doubt, however, that the removal of the address in question would deprive the poster campaign of its object, which, as has been shown, is essentially to advertise the website itself. It is therefore difficult to see what comprehensible meaning the poster could have had without that reference to the website and to the telephone number.", "5.7.4 The impugned measure therefore respects the principle of proportionality, in all its aspects. It constitutes, for the same reasons, a restriction that is necessary \u2018in a democratic society\u2019, in particular for the protection of morals, within the meaning of Articles 9 \u00a7 2 and 10 \u00a7 2 of the ECHR.\u201d", "15. Article 119 of the Federal Constitution concerns reproductive medicine and gene technology involving human beings. That provision reads as follows:", "\u201cHuman beings shall be protected against the misuse of reproductive medicine and gene technology.", "The Confederation shall legislate on the use of human reproductive and genetic material. In doing so, it shall ensure the protection of human dignity, privacy and the family and shall adhere in particular to the following principles:", "(a) All forms of cloning and interference with the genetic material of human reproductive cells and embryos are unlawful.", "(b) Non-human reproductive and genetic material may neither be introduced into nor combined with human reproductive material.", "(c) Methods of medically-assisted reproduction may be used only if infertility or the risk of transmitting a serious illness cannot otherwise be overcome, but not in order to conceive a child with specific characteristics or for research purposes; the fertilisation of human egg cells outside a woman\u2019s body is permitted only under the conditions laid down by the law; no more human egg cells may be developed into embryos outside a woman\u2019s body than are capable of being immediately implanted.", "(d) The donation of embryos and all forms of surrogate motherhood are unlawful.", "(e) Trade in human reproductive material and in products obtained from embryos is prohibited.", "(f) The genetic material of a person may be analysed, registered or made public only with the consent of the person concerned or if the law so provides.", "(g) Everyone shall have access to data relating to their ancestry.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
