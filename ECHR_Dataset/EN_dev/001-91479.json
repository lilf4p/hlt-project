The applicant, Dacia S.R.L., is a company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Moldova.", "6. In 1997 the Moldovan Parliament enacted legislation for the privatisation of certain items of State property, including the \u201cDacia\u201d hotel. On 29 January 1999 the applicant company was declared the successful bidder in the auction held for the sale of the hotel. It paid 20,150,000 Moldovan lei (MDL) (2,305,043 United States dollars at the time). On 13 September 1999 the applicant company purchased from the Chi\u015fin\u0103u municipality the 0.21 hectares of land on which the hotel was situated, for MDL 50,840 (4,395 euros (EUR) at the time).", "7. According to the applicant company, in the years following the purchase of the hotel large sums of money were spent on its renovation and the purchase of new furnishings and equipment.", "8. On 11 January 2003 the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office initiated court proceedings, seeking the annulment of the hotel\u2019s privatisation and repayment to the applicant company of the price paid. On 6 June 2003 the Economic Court of Moldova accepted the Prosecutor General\u2019s request and annulled the privatisation of the hotel. The court ordered the return of MDL 20,150,000 to the applicant company and the return of the hotel to the State.", "9. The applicant company\u2019s appeal was left without examination by the Supreme Court of Justice on 8 July 2003 because of a failure to pay court fees in full.", "10. In separate proceedings, which ended with a judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice on 19 February 2004, the sale of the land underlying the hotel was also annulled.", "11. The judgment of 6 June 2003 was fully enforced in instalments in the period between 13 April and 27 October 2004. The sum of MDL 20,150,000 was the equivalent of approximately EUR 1,342,590 in October 2004.", "12. The applicant company initiated court proceedings against the Government, claiming compensation for damage caused to it as a bona fide buyer of the hotel. It paid MDL 484,733 in court fees. On 10 March 2005 the Appellate Chamber of the Economic Court of Moldova rejected these claims. On 4 May 2005 the Supreme Court of Justice dismissed the applicant company\u2019s request for a court fee waiver owing to its inability to pay. It informed the applicant company that the appeal could not be examined on account of the failure to pay the court fees in full. The new time-limit for paying the court fees was 25 May 2005; the applicant company did not meet this deadline.", "13. The applicant company hired an expert to make a valuation of the current market price of the hotel and underlying land. The expert explained that he was able to make the valuation only if he had access to the hotel itself and all its documents, including documents from the State-controlled real-estate register. Since the hotel is currently owned by the State, on 9 April 2008 the applicant company sought the assistance of the Government Agent\u2019s office in ensuring the expert\u2019s access to the hotel and the relevant documents. In a letter dated 23 April 2008 the Government Agent informed the applicant company that it should contact the hotel\u2019s administration and the real-estate registry.", "14. On 29 April 2008 the applicant company asked the hotel\u2019s administration to allow the expert access to the hotel.

In a letter dated 5 May 2008 the hotel\u2019s administration informed the applicant company that permission from the Government was necessary in order to ensure access to the hotel. In a letter dated 15 May 2008 the real-estate registry informed the applicant company that it was not authorised to grant access to the requested documents, since it \u201cdid not offer such a service\u201d.", "15. On 8 May 2008 the Supreme Court of Justice made an attachment order, prohibiting the disposal of the hotel. On the same day, the applicant company asked the Government to allow its expert access to the hotel. It received no answer. On 11 May 2008 the applicant company informed the Government Agent about the situation and asked for his assistance in obtaining access to the hotel and the relevant documents. It also noted that the refusal to grant such access might be considered as a violation of its rights guaranteed by Article 34 of the Convention. The applicant company did not receive a reply to this letter.", "16. On 29 April 2008 the applicant company lodged with the Supreme Court of Justice a request for the annulment of the judgment of 6 June 2003 and subsequent related judgments against it, referring to the principal judgment as a ground for its request.

Before the hearing of 3 July 2008, one of the judges on the bench of the Supreme Court of Justice examining the case was replaced by another judge. During that hearing the Government (plaintiff in the original domestic proceedings and current owner of the \u201cDacia\u201d hotel) submitted its response to the applicant company\u2019s request of 29 April 2008. They considered, in particular, that awarding the applicant company compensation in the amount of EUR 962,660.70 would constitute sufficient just satisfaction within the meaning of Article 41 of the Convention.", "19. Before the next hearing on 17 July 2008 two judges on the bench of the Supreme Court of Justice examining the case were replaced by other judges. The examination of the case started anew. On 21 July 2008 the applicant company\u2019s lawyer examined the case file in order to determine the reasons for the three replacements of judges in the case. He found no such explanation.", "20. On 24 July 2008 the Supreme Court of Justice annulled the judgments of 6 June and 27 October 2003 and of 19 February 2004 against the applicant company (see the facts of the principal judgment for more details), and ordered a full re-hearing by the Appeals Chamber of the Economic Court. The proceedings are still pending before that court.", "21. On 5 November 2008 the Court asked the parties to submit additional observations by 26 November 2008, limited to the issue of the value of the Dacia hotel, and directed the Government to allow the applicant company access to the hotel and its documents.

The final value of the hotel (MDL 98,700,000, approximately EUR 7,612,000) was calculated by using three separate methods of valuation.", "On 26 November 2008 the Government asked for an extension until 2 December 2008 of the time-limit for submitting their valuation. However, they did not submit any observations by that date. They sent a \u201cpreliminary report\u201d on 5 December 2008 on the value of the Dacia hotel. According to that \u201cpreliminary report\u201d, made on 1 December 2008, the hotel was worth MDL 29,124,000 (EUR 2,219,191). The \u201cpreliminary report\u201d included five pages, three of which were copies of licences held by the valuer, one page listed the \u201cconditions and disclaimers\u201d concerning the limits of the valuer\u2019s liability and another described the name and address of the Dacia hotel and the amount at which it had been valued. No calculations were included. At the date adoption of its judgment, the Court had not received the final report of the valuer hired by the Government.", "22.
