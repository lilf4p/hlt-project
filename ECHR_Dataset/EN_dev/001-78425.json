On 15 December 2003 the applicant initiated criminal proceedings against A.C., a Civil Status Office employee.

Articles 2, 3, 23 and 24 of the Agreement provide for the possibility for the Ministries of Justice of both Contracting Parties to cooperate in the recognition and execution in their territories of final judicial decisions given by the authorities of the other Party in civil, family and commercial matters.", "34. The Code of Civil Procedure, which governs, inter alia, execution of final judgments, does not contain any provisions specifically applicable to the transfer of custody of children. As a result, the general procedural rules on the execution of judgments are applicable mutatis mutandis.", "35. In cases where a parent\u2019s refusal to comply constitutes a criminal offence, the matter should be referred to the prosecuting authorities.", "36. Failure to abide by a final decision concerning custody of children may be punishable under Article 127 of the Criminal Code."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
