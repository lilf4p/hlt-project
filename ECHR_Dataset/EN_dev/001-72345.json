The judge heard the applicant and dictated his replies to the court clerk, who was taking minutes of the hearing. As the judge\u2019s instructions to the clerk differed considerably from what the applicant was saying and as the judge repeatedly interrupted the applicant in his statements, the applicant expressed his objections. However, this was to no avail. Eventually the applicant said:", "\u201cI should reply, not the court\u201d.", "The judge became angry and warned the applicant that a fine could be imposed on him.", "The records of the hearing first relate the applicant\u2019s statements concerning the subject matter of the case. Then it reads as follows:", "\u201cThe presiding judge warned the [applicant] not to make any comments to the court and warned him that a fine would be imposed on him if he continued to do so.", "Thereupon the [applicant] says: \u201cIf it is necessary, I will pay\u201d.", "The court holds that a fine of PLN 500 be imposed on the [applicant]. \u201c", "On 12 September 2000 the applicant appealed to the Ostrowiec \u015awi\u0119tokrzyski Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) against the imposition of the fine. On 12 October 2000 the Ostrowiec \u015awi\u0119tokrzyski District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy), invoking the Act of 20 June 1985, rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal, considering that the domestic law did not provide for a possibility to appeal against such a decision. On 9 November 2000 the applicant lodged an interim appeal against this decision. On 10 November 2000 the District Court rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal as lodged outside the prescribed time limit. On 29 November 2000 the applicant applied for leave to file an appeal out of time. His motion was dismissed on 24 April 2001.", "On 14 September 2000 the applicant lodged a request with the Ostrowiec \u015awi\u0119tokrzyski District Court to rectify the minutes of the hearing of 6 September 2000. He submitted that during that hearing he had said, reacting to the court\u2019s interruptions and interference with the contents of his statements:", "\u201cI should reply, not the court.\u201d", "This statement had not been recorded in the minutes of the hearing. Consequently, the actual circumstances in which the presiding judge decided to impose a fine on the applicant were not reflected in the minutes, as required by Article 158 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure.", "On 13 October 2000 the court refused to rectify the minutes. The court considered it to be sufficient that the court\u2019s reaction to the applicant\u2019s conduct was reflected in the minutes of the hearing, and that therefore the minutes were exact.", "On 9 November 2000 the applicant appealed against this decision. He reiterated that the minutes of the hearing did not reflect the actual conduct of the hearing in that his statement was not noted. As a result, they contained the presiding judge\u2019s warning about the imposition of a fine, but no information as to the reason which had prompted this reaction on the part of the judge. The applicant stated that this was illogical. He further stressed that he had not said anything that could have been construed as either insulting to the court, or not linked to the subject-matter of the civil case. The court\u2019s failure to dictate the parties\u2019 statements so that the minutes reflected exactly what was said amounted to a procedural breach, which could negatively affect the substantive outcome of the case.", "On 22 December 2000 the Ostrowiec \u015awi\u0119tokrzyski District Court dismissed his appeal. The court reiterated the reasons invoked in the first-instance decision of 13 October 2000. It was further stated that according to the case-law of the Supreme Court, the court was not obliged to include in the minutes of a hearing all the statements of the parties, in particular those which were not related to the subject-matter of the proceedings.", "On 7 February 2003 the Ostrowiec \u015awi\u0119tokrzyski District Court of its own motion gave a decision and quashed its decision of 12 October 2000. The court held that on 1 October 2001 the new act on the legal structure of the courts entered into force. According to Section 50 of the new act it was possible to file an appeal against a decision imposing a fine for contempt of court. The court considered that the change of law was of such importance that it justified quashing the decision of 12 October 2000 even though it had been delivered under the 1985 Act.", "On 22 July 2003 the Ostrowiec \u015awietokrzyski District Court ordered the return to the applicant of the fine paid by him.

According to Section 50 of the new act it is possible to file an appeal against a decision to impose a penalty for contempt of court.", "On 3 July 2002 the Constitutional Court gave judgment (No. SK 31/01) and declared unconstitutional Section 44 \u00a7 1 of the 1985 Act.
