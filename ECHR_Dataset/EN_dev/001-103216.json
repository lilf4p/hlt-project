In October 2001 the child\u2019s father was sentenced by the court of Krefeld to five years\u2019 imprisonment for drug trafficking.

On 27 October 2005 the German public prosecution service sent a request to the Portuguese authorities to obtain the child\u2019s return, alleging that the child had been wrongfully removed from Portugal in breach of Article 3 of the Hague Convention.", "15. The request was served on the child\u2019s father, who opposed the return. A. denied, in particular, that the child\u2019s removal had been wrongful and stated that the decision for the child\u2019s trip had been taken by both parents. He explained that the child\u2019s movement had been decided by both parents because the child\u2019s mother had envisaged settling in Portugal.", "16. On 24 January 2006 the Braga Family Court gave a judgment to the effect that the child should not be returned to Germany, finding that the child\u2019s retention in Portugal was not wrongful within the meaning of Article 3 of the Hague Convention or of Article 11 of Council Regulation (EC) no. 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility (\u201cCouncil Regulation no. 2201/2003\u201d).", "17. On 2 February 2006 the applicant appealed against the judgment before the Guimar\u00e3es Court of Appeal arguing, among other things, that she had not been heard by the Braga Family Court.", "18. In a judgment of 21 June 2006, the Guimar\u00e3es Court of Appeal granted the applicant\u2019s request. Annulling the judgment of the Braga Family Court, the Court of Appeal referred the case back to it, directing in particular that it should hear the child\u2019s mother.", "19. The child\u2019s father appealed against the judgment of the Guimar\u00e3es Court of Appeal before the Supreme Court, which dismissed his appeal on 7 November 2006.", "20. On 15 August 2007, pursuant to an international letter of request from the Braga Family Court dated 14 February 2007, the mother was heard by the Krefeld court.", "21.

In a judgment of 21 May 2008, the Braga Family Court again rejected the request for the child\u2019s return, finding that the child\u2019s removal had not been wrongful as it had been agreed between the two parents.", "23. On 12 June 2008 the applicant lodged an appeal before the Guimar\u00e3es Court of Appeal. Her appeal was dismissed by a judgment of 9 January 2009.", "24. In its judgment, the Court of Appeal stated:", "\u201c... it must be concluded that from the time when the mother of L. returned to Germany without her son, he began to be wrongfully retained in Portugal. Her return request showed, categorically, that she did not wish her son to remain in Portugal.\u201d", "25. Even though the Court of Appeal recognised that the case concerned a situation of wrongful retention of a child, under the terms of Council Regulation no. 2201/2003, it found it preferable for the child to remain in Portugal for the following reasons:", "\u201cThe facts of the case show that the child, who has been looked after by his great-grandmother since March 2008, has a particular emotional attachment to her, seeing in her a mother figure, to the point of almost forgetting the image of his mother. His great-grandmother is the person who takes care of him day-to-day, with tenderness ... The mother very rarely calls her child, and when she does so, the child does not consider it very important. The child sees his great-grandmother, at the current stage of his development, as a figure of authority who brings him security and tranquillity, as shown in his behaviour at school and in his relationships with others. He is content in the environment in which he lives and has been very successful at school. Accordingly, to change his environment and take him away from the person to whom he relates would risk causing him psychological harm ...", "All the conditions are thus met for the respondent State to prevent the child\u2019s return, in the light of the child\u2019s best interests, which must take precedence over the free movement of children \u2013 even if this is done safely \u2013 in accordance with Article 13 (b) of the Hague Convention [on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction] of 1980. Taking the view that a return to Germany would be harmful for the child, the respondent State has acted in accordance with Article 13 of the Hague Convention.\u201d", "26. On 2 March 2005 the public prosecutor at the Braga court opened proceedings in respect of parental responsibilities (regula\u00e7\u00e3o do poder paternal) vis-\u00e0-vis the child. Custody was provisionally awarded to the father.", "27. On 3 October 2005 the Braga Family Court held its first conciliation hearing. As they failed to reach an agreement, the parents were requested to submit pleadings.", "28. On 19 October 2005 the applicant filed her pleadings. Submitting that the child\u2019s retention in Portugal was wrongful, the applicant argued that the Braga Family Court lacked territorial jurisdiction, as in her view the German courts had jurisdiction in accordance with Council Regulation no. 2201/2003.", "29. The child\u2019s father, in his pleadings of 21 October 2005, requested the court to award him custody.", "30. On 27 October 2005 the public prosecutor at the Braga Family Court submitted that the decision should be deferred until the completion of the proceedings before the German courts concerning the child\u2019s return.", "31. In a decision of 31 July 2006, the Braga Family Court amended the provisional allocation of parental authority in respect of the child, transferring it to the child\u2019s great-grandmother.", "32.

On 10 March 2008 the applicant reiterated her request to the Braga Family Court to obtain parental authority of the child. In a decision of 4 April 2008, the court dismissed the applicant\u2019s request, indicating that the proceedings had been stayed.", "36. On 15 May 2008 the child\u2019s great-grandmother requested the court to grant her permanent custody of the child.", "37.

To date, the proceedings are still pending before the Braga Family Court.", "42. On 2 April 2008 the applicant filed a complaint with the European Commission alleging an infringement of Council Regulation no. 2201/2003.

On 15 September 2008 the applicant sent various documents in support of her application to the European Commission.", "44. On 7 May 2009 the Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Justice, Freedom and Security asked the applicant for additional information concerning the proceedings for the return of the child on grounds of wrongful removal and retention. On 15 June 2009 the applicant sent that information to the Directorate-General, submitting a copy of the Guimar\u00e3es Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment of 9 January 2009.", "45.
