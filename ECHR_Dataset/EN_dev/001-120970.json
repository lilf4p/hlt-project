The applicant was born in 1970 and lives in Goyty, Urus-Martan District, Chechnya.", "7. The applicant is a widow, whose husband died in 1994. She lived with her son, Sayd-Salekh Ibragimov, born in 1990, who at the relevant time was in his second year of studies at the Grozny Oil Institute. The applicant also has a daughter. The family lived in the village of Goyty, Urus-Martan District, Chechnya. Their household at 117 Gonchayeva (previously Sovetskaya) Street consisted of three houses sharing a common courtyard. One house belonged to the applicant and her children, and the other two to her husband\u2019s brothers. According to the applicant, one of them had left Chechnya with his family and in 2009 that house was uninhabited.", "8. On 21 October 2009 the applicant was in Grozny. At about midday on that day she received a phone call from a relative, who told her that a special operation was taking place at their household and that soldiers were going to burn the house down. The applicant called her son, who was in Grozny, and told him not to come home but to stay at his uncle\u2019s place.", "9. In the meantime, the applicant and her brother-in-law Adnan I. went to Goyty by car. As soon as they arrived the car was surrounded by armed men in military uniforms, who they understood to be servicemen of the Ministry of the Interior. The servicemen showed them a body and told them that this man had been hiding in their household since the previous day, in the attic of Adnan I.\u2019s house. The body was that of a young man, aged 1719, with long hair. His shirt was pulled up to the neck and his hands were raised behind the head; there was one wound in the heart area. Adnan I. then went to see his paralysed mother, who had been taken to the neighbours.", "10. Police officers then took the applicant and her brother-in-law to the Urus-Martan district department of the interior (\u201cthe ROVD\u201d) and questioned them. Both denied all knowledge of fighters\u2019 presence in the attic of a house situated in their household.", "11. The applicant and her brother-in-law were released at about 9 p.m. that day. They returned to Goyty and found that their houses had been burned down. Firefighters told them that the houses had been set on fire deliberately. Then the applicant\u2019s brother-in-law returned to Grozny.", "12. Adnan I.\u2019s daughter M. later told her father that Sayd-Salekh Ibragimov had come to their home in Grozny at about 3 p.m. that day. Soon afterwards he had called a taxi and left, heading towards the city centre. M. told her father that a group of armed men had arrived at their house almost as soon as the applicant\u2019s son had left and demanded that she tell them where he had gone or take them there. As M. did not know where he had gone, they left.", "13. At about 10 p.m. on the same day Adnan I. received a call from the head of the Urus-Martan ROVD, who requested that he return to that office. When he arrived there three soldiers took him to Grozny in their car. He was taken to the office of Mr Sherip Delimkhanov, head of the external guards regiment of the Ministry of the Interior of Chechnya (\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043a \u043c\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0423\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0412\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u044b \u041c\u0412\u0414 \u0427\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0438), also known as the \u201coil regiment\u201d, as one of their main tasks was to secure oil pipes and installations.", "14. Adnan I. was taken into a room where there were about a dozen members of the police force who had participated in the operation in Goyty earlier that day. They told Adnan I. that two police officers had been wounded and one had been killed. Adnan I. denied that any members of illegal groups had ever lived in their household, and stressed that the house in question was uninhabited. He was given to understand that the \u201cblood feud\u201d for the police officer who had been killed would fall on him and his family.", "15. After about twenty minutes another soldier brought Sayd-Salekh Ibragimov into the room. Adnan I. saw signs of beatings on his nephew\u2019s face: his right cheek was discoloured, there was blood in the right corner of his mouth and nose, and he had difficulty standing up without assistance. He also remarked that his nephew was shaking, looked frightened and spoke fast, without looking at anyone. The policemen told them that Sayd-Salekh Ibragimov could save his life by cooperating; otherwise they would kill him in retribution for the death of their colleague. Adnan I. was allowed to talk to his nephew. The latter admitted that he had maintained contacts with members of illegal armed groups through the Internet and his mobile phone and promised that he would cooperate with the police. Adnan I. pleaded with him to do anything to save his life.", "16. Soon after midnight Adnan I. and his son Magomed, who had also been brought to the regiment\u2019s headquarters, were released. The family had no news of Sayd-Salekh Ibragimov after that date.", "17. In support of her submissions the applicant presented written statements drawn up by her and by her brother-in-law, Adnan I., in December 2009 and July 2011.", "18. The special operation in Goyty on 21 October 2009 was officially reported by the Ministry of the Interior of Chechnya as follows:", "\u201c21 October 2009", "Policeman killed saving elderly woman", "Two illegal fighters were killed in Goyty in the Urus-Martan district as a result of a special operation.", "\u2018\u201cThe operation aimed at locating and exterminating members of illegal armed groups has just been completed. It took place in Sovetskaya Street, where members of illegal armed groups had been spotted in one of the houses,\u2019 stated the Chechnya Minister of the Interior Mr Ruslan Alkhanov.", "One of the fighters was identified as Abdul Dzhumayev from Shatoy district. The Minister also said that a member of the police force had been killed while saving an elderly woman from a house seized by terrorists there. \u2018Unfortunately, one of our comrades died. He was a member of the external guards\u2019 regiment of the Ministry of the Interior of Chechnya. Two other policemen were wounded,\u2019 said Mr Alkhanov. He stressed that the officers had received injuries while trying to save the life of an 80-year-old woman. They evacuated her through the window and were shot at by the bandits. One police officer lost his life. The operation was carried out by the Sever (Northern) regiment of the internal troops of the Ministry of the Interior, the Special Police Force (\u201cthe OMON\u201d) and the external guards regiment of the Ministry of the Interior of Chechnya under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel of the Ministry of the Interior Sherip Delimkhanov.\u201d", "19. The Government, in a memorandum of 26 January 2011, acknowledged the basic facts as submitted by the applicant. They confirmed that a special operation had been carried out in Goyty, in Sovetskaya Street, on 21 October 2009, during which one soldier of the external guards regiment had been killed and two others wounded. Two members of illegal armed groups had been killed and a third had escaped. As a result of this conflict, the houses at 117 Sovetskaya Street had burned down. In connection with this incident, at about midnight on 21 October 2009 the servicemen of the external guards regiment had taken Sayd-Salekh Ibragimov to the regiment\u2019s headquarters in Grozny. He had an oral exchange about these events in room 13 of the building and was released at about 12.30 a.m. on 22 October 2009.", "20. In the days immediately following 21 October 2009 the applicant expected to be informed about the whereabouts of her son, and did not apply to any authorities. On 1 November 2009 she and her brother-in-law Adnan I. were called to the office of the Achkhoy-Martan District Prosecutor. The applicant submitted that the investigator had asked them about the events of 21 October 2009. However, the investigator had refused to note Adnan I.\u2019s statements about the meeting at Mr Delimkhanov\u2019s office. According to the applicant, the investigator told them that if they wanted to pursue complaints against the \u201coil regiment\u201d, they would be forced to change their statements. The applicant and Adnan I. did not insist on noting their statements.", "21. The applicant submitted that she continued to seek information about her son from various officials.", "22. On 2 December 2009 she submitted a complaint to the Investigating Committee at the Prosecutor\u2019s Office in the Achkhoy-Martan district (hereinafter \u201cthe district investigating committee\u201d). She described the events of 21 October 2009 and asked to be informed about the whereabouts of her son. She also asked for him to be allowed to meet with a lawyer and to be given medical assistance if needed.", "23. Upon this written application, the district investigating committee initiated a check, under Articles 144-45 of the Criminal Procedural Code. By 8 December 2009 the investigator in charge of the case had collected personal information about Sayd-Salekh Ibragimov from the local village administration, and requested all the district and regional police and investigating departments in Chechnya to check whether they had any information about the young man. The letters mentioned that on 21 October 2009 he had been delivered by unidentified police officers to the headquarters of the external guards\u2019 regiment of the Ministry of the Interior of Chechnya and that there had been no news of him after that.", "24. On 9 December 2009 an investigator took a statement from Adnan I. The latter explained that he had come to Goyty on 21 October 2009 at the applicant\u2019s request; that he had seen a large group of Ministry of the Interior soldiers and the body of a young man with long hair; that his paralysed mother had been taken to the neighbours; that he and the applicant had been taken to the Urus-Martan ROVD for questioning; that they had been released on the same day and had seen their houses in Goyty burned down; that he had been called late at night to return to the Urus-Martan ROVD and that from there he had been brought back to Grozny, to the \u201coil regiment\u201d headquarters in Mayakovskaya Street. The witness then went on to describe in detail the interior of the building and the office where he had been questioned, and where he had last seen Sayd-Salekh Ibragimov. He recognised Mr Delimkhanov among the soldiers. He also stated that his nephew had been questioned by a soldier called Valid, who had earlier told him that he was the commander of the sixth platoon of the regiment and was a native of Goyty. Valid showed a mobile phone to Sayd-Salekh and showed him something on the phone, asking whether he knew these people, to which Sayd-Salekh gave a positive answer. Valid told Sayd-Salekh that they had been following him for about a month. He also asked him where he had met these people, to which the Adnan I.\u2019s nephew responded \u201cIn a chat room\u201d. Adnan I. stressed that his nephew had looked scared and had signs of beatings on his face. The nephew also stated that the police officers had told him that they would pursue him for the death of their colleague and that he felt threatened and had asked for protection. Adnan I. had not seen his nephew after that.", "25. On 10 December 2009 the investigator took a statement from the applicant. She gave similar statements about the events of 21 October 2009; she also stated that the house where she lived had burnt down and she and her family (herself, her daughter and her son) had lost their property, including gold jewellery, and documents. The applicant submitted that she had had no news of her son since 21 October 2009, and gave the police two GSM phone numbers used by her son.", "26. On 10 December 2009 the same investigator wrote down explanations submitted by Ms Aminat O., Sayd-Salekh\u2019s girlfriend, who lived with him at his house. She was an eyewitness to the events of 21 October 2009. She stated that at about 2 p.m. a group of armed servicemen had arrived at their house and searched part of the household. There was an exchange of fire in the courtyard and she had asked police officers who were there to take \u201cgranny\u201d out of the house, which they did, bringing her out through the window on a mattress. She thought that the house had been set on fire by the police officers. She had not seen SaydSalekh Ibragomov after 21 October 2009 and had no news of his whereabouts.", "27. On 11 December 2009 the investigator of the Achkhoy-Martan district investigating committee asked the ROVD to take action to find out Sayd-Salekh\u2019s whereabouts, in particular to obtain information from the GSM operator about his movements and calls received since 1 September 2009 and to find and question the driver of the bus which took the students of the Grozny Oil Institute to and from classes.", "28. Between 11 and 12 December 2009 the investigator sought information about Sayd-Salekh Ibragimov from the management of the Grozny Oil Institute, from the Public Health department of Chechnya, from the Chechnya Prison Department, and from a number of other lawenforcement bodies. In particular, on 12 December 2009 the investigator requested the commander of the external guards regiment to identify and send for questioning the servicemen who had been on duty on the night of 21 to 22 October 2009 and to send a copy of the regiment\u2019s registration log to the district investigating committee.", "29. On 15 December 2009 the Grozny Oil Institute informed the investigator that Sayd-Salekh Ibragimov had not attended classes since 19 October 2009. One of his classmates and a professor confirmed that they had not seen him at the Institute since 19 October 2009; a copy of the class record was acquired.", "30. On 15 December 2009 the investigator, together with Adnan I. and the applicant\u2019s representative from NGO Committee Against Torture, inspected the headquarters of the \u201coil regiment\u201d in Grozny. Adnan I. showed the office where he had last seen his nephew, at about midnight on 21 October 2009, and specified that about a dozen police officers had been there at the time, including Mr Sherip Delimkhanov.", "31. On 17 December 2009 the district investigating committee ruled that criminal proceedings would not be opened. It concluded that there was no reason to suspect that murder had been committed, and that therefore there was no evidence of a crime. On the same day the applicant\u2019s representative was forwarded a copy of the decision and informed of the appeal procedure.", "32. It appears that the applicant complained about the above decision. As a result, the documents collected during the investigation were sent to the Leninsky district investigating committee in Grozny, the location of the headquarters of the \u201coil regiment\u201d. On 28 December 2009 that office opened criminal investigation file 66102 in respect of a suspected murder (Article 105 of the Criminal Code). The document considered it established that on 21 October 2009 Sayd-Salekh Ibragimov had been taken to the headquarters of the regiment by unidentified servicemen of the Ministry of the Interior. There he was questioned orally in room 13 about the incident which had occurred earlier that day in Goyty. Sayd-Salekh Ibragimov was released and left the premises of the regiment at about 12.30 a.m. on 22 October 2009. His whereabouts remained unknown. On the same day the applicant was informed about this development.", "33. On 15 January 2010 the investigator responsible for the case drew up a detailed plan of the necessary actions which should be taken.", "34. On 2 February 2010 the applicant was granted the status of victim in the proceedings.", "35. On 2 and 10 February 2010 the applicant was questioned as a victim of the crime. On the same day Aminat O. was questioned. They reiterated their previous statements and stated that their jewellery had disappeared after the special operation.", "36. On 24 March 2010 Adnan I. was questioned as a witness. He gave detailed submissions about the events of 21 October 2009, in line with his statement of 9 December 2009 (see paragraph 24 above). He described in detail the encounter with Sherip Delimkhanov, Valid A. and about fifteen servicemen of the regiment at its headquarters on the night of 22 October 2009. The witness stressed that the police officers had referred to a blood feud which would now fall on his family, in retribution for the death of their colleague in his house. He then described how Valid A. had led SaydSalekh into and out of the room by holding him by the neck from behind and forcing him to bend forward. The witness described the signs of beatings and blood on his nephew\u2019s face, the fact that he was frightened and was shaking, and that he spoke fast and without looking at anyone. His nephew had admitted that he had maintained contacts with illegal fighters by \u201cInternet chat\u201d. After that admission Mr Delimkhanov had said that \u201cwe shall kill this dog and avenge our colleague\u201d, but that he could be spared if he cooperated. Adnan I. then pleaded with Sayd-Salekh to do so to save his life. His nephew said that he could establish contact with illegal fighters on the Internet, but only during the daytime. After that, at about 12.30 a.m. on 22 October 2009, the witness was released from the regiment headquarters and returned home. He had not seen his nephew after that.", "37. Adnan I. described the threats directed at him and his son Magomed. He stated that in early December [2009] he had been invited, under threat, to talk to Mr Delimkhanov, who had told him that he had two days to prove that he had seen Sayd-Salekh at Mr Delimkhanov\u2019s office. Then, at about 6.45 a.m. on 29 December 2009, a group of about fifteen armed men wearing black uniforms and masks burst into his house looking for his son Magomed. After that Magomed I. left Russia, and the witness was not prepared to disclose his place of residence, out of fear for his life.", "38. At some point the investigation found out that the headquarters of the \u201coil regiment\u201d was equipped with CCTV cameras, but that their contents were erased within ten days.", "39. In September 2010 the investigation sought to establish a complete list of servicemen from various security and police detachments who had taken part in the operation on 21 October 2009.", "40. On various dates during 2010 the investigators questioned a number of police officers from the external guards regiment and from the UrusMartan ROVD who had taken part in the special operation in question and who had been present at the offices when the applicant and her relatives had been there.", "41. The servicemen from the Urus-Martan ROVD confirmed that they had taken part in the operation, and also that two suspects had been killed and that there had been police casualties. They also confirmed that the applicant\u2019s house had been burned down. They were not aware that the applicant and her brother-in-law had been questioned at the ROVD.", "42. Mr Delimkhanov was questioned as a witness on 23 June 2010. He confirmed that after the operation of 21 October 2009 he had orally instructed his subordinates to bring Sayd-Salekh Ibragimov, his uncle and cousin to the regiment\u2019s headquarters. During a conversation Sayd-Salekh Ibragimov had confirmed that he had information about members of illegal armed groups, and promised to cooperate. He also promised to return in order to submit further information. He and his relatives had then left the regiment\u2019s headquarters. Since that date neither Sayd-Salekh Ibragimov nor his relatives had been to the regiment\u2019s headquarters.", "43. Another serviceman of the regiment, Valid A., on 23 June 2010 gave similar statements about the three men being brought to the regiment headquarters at about midnight on 21 October 2009, the ensuing discussion and the fact that they had left the premises.", "44. Several other servicemen of the external guards regiment were also questioned. Some of them denied any knowledge that Sayd-Salekh Ibragimov or his relatives had been to the regiment\u2019s headquarters in the evening of 21 October 2009. However, one serviceman, Shamsudy A., who had been on duty on the night in question, stated on 18 December 2009 and again on 4 March 2010, that Sayd-Salekh \u201chad come to see the commander of the regiment\u201d. Soon afterwards, two other men \u2013 Adnan I. and his son Magomed I. \u2013 also arrived to meet Mr Delimkhanov. About thirty minutes later the three men had left. No records were made of their visit or questioning. Another serviceman of the regiment, Usman D., stated on 18 December 2009, referring to Shamsudy A., that Sayd-Salekh and his relatives \u201chave been invited to see Sherip Delimkhanov at about 11 p.m. on 21 October 2009\u201d.", "45. It appears from the exchange of letters between the Investigating Committee and the Ministry of the Interior that the investigation on several occasions tried to secure further participation of Mr Delimkhanov and two other high-ranking servicemen of the Ministry in the investigation, by means such as questioning and confrontation with other witnesses. On 28 September 2010 the investigator in charge of the case wrote a report to his superior, the head of the second serious crimes department of the Chechnya Investigating Committee. He described his attempts to obtain a confrontation between Adnan I. and Mr Delimkhanov. The investigator wrote that he had finally been invited to Mr Delimkhanov\u2019s office, where the latter first refused to participate in the confrontation due to his heavy workload, and then insisted that the confrontation should take place immediately and in his office. The investigator\u2019s attempts to arrange for a confrontation within a reasonable time and on the premises of the Investigating Committee have been unsuccessful.", "46. From the subsequent documents it follows that on 4 October 2010 the investigator terminated his work with the Investigating Committee and the file was transferred to another investigator.", "47. At 4.30 p.m. on 21 October 2009 investigators of the AchkhoyMartan district department of the investigating committee examined the buildings at 117 Gonchayeva Street. They described two male bodies, two machine guns, two improvised explosive devices, and a number of new and empty ammunition cartridges. They also noted the effects of fire in the houses and outbuildings. Both bodies bore gunshot wounds. An additional inspection of the site took place on 22 October 2009.", "48. On 19 December 2009 the Achkhoy-Martan district department of the investigating committee opened a separate criminal investigation of the events of 21 October 2009, on suspicion of violence directed at state officials, membership of an illegal armed group, wilful damage to property and unlawful handling of arms and explosives. A number of police officers who had taken part in the operation were questioned. Firefighters who had attended the scene were also questioned. It does not appear that the cause of the fire at the applicant\u2019s address has been established.", "49. It appears that this investigation, directed at unknown persons, is still pending.", "50. In response to the Court\u2019s request, the Government submitted a complete copy of the criminal investigation file no. 66102 (five volumes, over 1,100 pages). The investigation was adjourned on one occasion and reopened. In the latest documents the investigator summarised the findings as follows (the passage quoted below is taken from the decision of 6 September 2010 to extend the term for investigation):", "\u201cOn 21 October 2009 a special operation aimed at discovering members of illegal armed groups was carried out at 117 Gonchayeva Street. The operation was carried out jointly by servicemen from [five different units of the Ministry of the Interior of Chechnya, including the external guards regiment], [the Argun Town Department of the Federal Security Service (FSB)] and servicemen of the Urus-Martan ROVD. In the course of the operation unidentified servicemen of the Urus-Martan ROVD detained [the applicant] and [Adnan I.]. At about midnight on 21 October 2009 SaydSalekh Ibragimov arrived voluntarily at the headquarters of the [external guards regiment] situated in Grozny at the following address ... where he was orally questioned in room 13 about the incident which had taken place on 21 October 2009 ... At about 12.30 a.m. on 22 October 2009 S.-S. Ibragimov left the headquarters of the [regiment] and his whereabouts remain unknown\u201d.", "51. In addition to the measures described above, the investigation has sent out dozens of requests to various law-enforcement bodies, detention centres, hospitals and travel agencies, but has not received any additional relevant information about the whereabouts of Sayd-Salekh Ibragimov.", "52. It appears that by the end of 2010 the investigation was still pending, without any tangible results as to the fate of the applicant\u2019s son. No-one has been charged with any crime.", "53. The applicant submitted that on 14 December 2009 Adnan I. had been invited to meet with the commander of the \u201coil regiment\u201d, Mr Sherip Delimkhanov. Adnan I. and his representative went to Mr Delimkhanov\u2019s home, situated next to the regiment\u2019s headquarters. Adnan I. claimed that he had covertly made an audio recording of the conversation, which was partly in Chechen and partly in Russian; a copy of that recording has been submitted to the Court by the applicant. According to the applicant, Mr Delimkhanov told Adnan I. that as the oldest man in the house he was to be held responsible for what had happened there. Accordingly, the blood feud resulting from the death of the policeman should fall on him. Mr Delimkahnov alleged that he had protected Adnan I. from revenge attacks by other servicemen, but now since he had accused Mr Delimkhanov of the torture and murder of his nephew, he would no longer do so. Mr Delimkhanov also stated that he could obtain plenty of statements which would show that Sayd-Salekh Ibragimov was released from the headquarters of the regiment. He suggested that Sayd-Salekh had \u201cgone to the forest\u201d to fight, and that his family had staged the story of kidnapping.", "54. The applicant submitted further that on 29 December 2009 a group of armed men had burst into Adnan I.\u2019s house and searched it, without presenting any documents or identifying themselves. The applicant submitted that her brother-in-law had complained to the prosecutors\u2019 office about this incident, but did not present any documents.", "55. On 7 February 2010 three lawyers of the Committee Against Torture NGO involved in representing the applicant and other individuals complaining of human rights violations in Chechnya were detained overnight by officers of the Shali District Department of the Interior. On 10 February 2010 the Committee issued a public statement denouncing the detention as unlawful, and referred to previous instances of pressure on the applicant and her relative.", "56. Articles 20, 21 and 20 of the Constitution provide that everyone has the right to life and the right to liberty and personal security, which are guaranteed and protected by the State. No one shall be subjected to cruel or degrading treatment or punishment.", "57. Articles 45 and 46 of the Constitution guarantee judicial protection of rights under the Constitution.", "58. Articles 52 and 53 of the Constitution protect the rights of victims of crimes. The State guarantees victims access to justice and compensation for damage. Everyone is entitled to compensation for damage caused by unlawful actions of State officials.", "59. Articles 126 and 127 of the Russian Criminal Code stipulate that kidnapping and unlawful deprivation of liberty, respectively, are crimes punishable by up to fifteen and eight years of imprisonment respectively. Article 105 provides that murder is punishable by six to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment.

In January 2013 the CPT, for the first time, published a report to the Russian Government drawn up after its visit to the North Caucasian region of the Russian Federation from 27 April to 6 May 2011. The report focussed on the allegations of ill-treatment and reported allegations of unrecorded detentions and detentions in unlawful locations. It raised the problems of impunity of the law-enforcement personnel for such crimes and recommended to implement measures aimed at safeguarding the interests of the detainees as of first moments of detention, including proper record-keeping of detention, notification of relatives, access to a lawyer and to medical council, providing full information about their rights.", "68. On 4 June 2010 the PACE Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights presented a report entitled \u201cLegal remedies for human rights violations in the North-Caucasus Region\u201d. On the basis of that report, on 22 June 2010 PACE adopted Resolution no. 1738 and Recommendation no. 1922 deploring the absence of an effective investigation and prosecution of serious human rights violation in the region, including disappearances.

A report dated 6 September 2011 by Thomas Hammarberg, Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, following his visit to the Russian Federation from 12 to 21 May 2011, found a number of positive developments aiming to improve daily life in the republics visited. Despite those positive steps, the Commissioner defined as some of the most serious issues counter-terrorism measures, abductions, disappearances and ill-treatment, combatting impunity and the situation of human rights defenders. The report included the Commissioner\u2019s observations and recommendations in relation to those topics.", "71. In particular, the Commissioner was deeply concerned by the persistence of allegations and other information relating to abductions, disappearances and ill-treatment of people deprived of their liberty in the Northern Caucasus. While the number of abductions and disappearances in Chechnya might have decreased recently compared with 2009, the situation remained far from normal. Referring to the far-reaching effects of disappearances on a society as a whole, he supported the proposal of the Presidential Council for Civil Society Institutions and Human Rights to create an interdepartmental federal commission to determine the fate of individuals who had gone missing during the entire period of counter-terrorism operations in the Northern Caucasus. The Commissioner further emphasised the importance of systematic application of rules prohibiting the wearing of masks or non-standard uniforms without badges, as well as the use of unmarked vehicles in the course of investigative activities.", "72. The Commissioner went on to state that the persistent patterns of impunity for serious human rights violations were among the most intractable problems and remained a source of major concern to him. There had certainly been a number of positive steps, such as the establishment of Investigating Committee structures, increased support for victim participation in criminal proceedings, and the promulgation of various directives regarding the conduct of investigations. Despite those measures of a systemic, legislative and regulatory nature, the information gathered during the visit had led the Commissioner to conclude that the situation had remained essentially unchanged in practice since his previous visit in September 2009. He called on the Russian leadership to help in creating the requisite determination on the part of the investigators concerned by delivering the unequivocal message that impunity would no longer be tolerated.", "73.
