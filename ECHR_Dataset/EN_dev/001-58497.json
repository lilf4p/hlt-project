The applicant, who was born in 1940, is a businessman living in Switzerland. In the early 1980s he imported depilatory appliances into Switzerland which he advertised in magazines.", "8. On 12 October 1981 a woman telephoned the applicant from the former Soviet embassy in Berne to order a \u201cPerma Tweez\u201d depilatory appliance.", "9. That telephone call was intercepted by the Federal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office (Bundesanwaltschaft \u2013 \u201cthe Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office\u201d), which then requested the Intelligence Service of the police of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich to carry out an investigation into the applicant and the goods he sold.", "10. The report drawn up by the police of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich in December 1981 stated that the applicant, who had been registered in the Commercial Registry since 1973, was in the aerosols business. It stated that \u201cPerma Tweez\u201d was a battery-operated depilatory appliance; a leaflet describing the appliance was appended to the report.", "11. On 24 December 1981 the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office drew up a card on the applicant for its national security card index on the basis of the particulars provided by the police of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich.", "12. In 1990 the public learned of the existence of the card index being kept by the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office and many people, including the applicant, asked to consult their card.", "13. Various laws on accessing and processing the Confederation\u2019s documents were then enacted.", "14. On 12 September 1990 the special officer in charge of the Confederation\u2019s national security documents (\u201cthe special officer\u201d) sent the applicant, at his request, a photocopy of his card.", "15. The applicant\u2019s card, which was numbered (1153 : 0) 614 and on which two passages had been blue-pencilled ..., contained the following information:", "\u201cfrom the Z\u00fcrich Intelligence Service: A. identified as a contact with the Russian embassy according to ... . A. does business of various kinds with the [A.] company. Appendices: extract from the Commercial Registry and leaflet. ...\u201d", "16. As soon as he received his card, the applicant asked the Ombudsman at the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office to disclose the blue-pencilled passages.", "17. On 9 October 1990 the Ombudsman replied that the censored passage at the end of the card rightly concealed the initials of the federal police officers who had obtained the information on the card. The other censored passage related to a technical surveillance measure ordered against a third party; the Ombudsman stated that he would be recommending that the special officer disclose that information, since \u2013 in his view \u2013 the applicant\u2019s interest prevailed over the public interest in keeping it secret.", "18. On 19 April 1991 the special officer decided, on the basis of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Order of 5 March 1990 on the Processing of Federal National Security Documents, that the initials at the end of the card could not be disclosed. He also considered that the other censored passage contained counter-intelligence which, pursuant to Article 5 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Order, should not be disclosed. On the basis of those considerations, the disclosure of the applicant\u2019s card was extended to one word (\u201creport\u201d):", "\u201cfrom the Z\u00fcrich Intelligence Service: A. identified as a contact with the Russian embassy according to report ... A. does business of various kinds with the [A.] company. Appendices: extract from the Commercial Registry and leaflet. ...\u201d", "19. On 26 October 1991 the applicant filed a request for compensation with the Federal Department of Finance. His request was refused on 28 January 1992.", "20. On 9 March 1992 the applicant filed an administrative-law action with the Federal Court claiming compensation from the Confederation of 5,000 Swiss francs for the unlawful entry of his particulars in the card index kept by the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office. He also requested that his file and card be sent immediately to the Federal Archives with a prohibition on making any copies and that they be ordered to store the information under lock and key and not disclose any of it without his agreement.", "21. On being invited to submit its written observations, the Confederation stated, in its memorial of 26 May 1992, that according to the information provided by the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office and the special officer the record of the surveillance was no longer in the federal police\u2019s files. It pointed out in that connection that, pursuant to section 66(1 ter) of the Federal Criminal Procedure Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), documents which were no longer necessary had to be destroyed (\u201cDas Protokoll der technischen Ueberwachung ist gem\u00e4ss Auskunft der Bundesanwaltschaft und des Sonderbeauftragten ... in den Akten der Bundespolizei nicht mehr vorhanden. In diesem Zusammenhang ist anzumerken, dass nicht mehr ben\u00f6tigte Akten gem\u00e4ss Art. 66 Abs. 1ter BStP ... vernichtet werden m\u00fcssen\u201d).", "22. The Federal Court held hearings on 27 October 1993 and 14 September 1994.", "The applicant\u2019s lawyer pointed out that the case number of the card, namely (1153 : 0) 614, was a code meaning \u201ccommunist country\u201d (1), \u201cSoviet Union\u201d (153), \u201cespionage established\u201d (0) and \u201cvarious contacts with the Eastern bloc\u201d (614).", "The Confederation\u2019s representative stated that where someone (jemand) at the former Soviet embassy was under surveillance, on every telephone call both parties to the conversation were identified, a card drawn up on them and a telephone monitoring report (Telefon-Abh\u00f6r-Bericht) made. In that connection she stated that most of the reports had been destroyed and that those which had not been were now stored in bags; the intention had been to destroy them as well, but when the post of special officer had been instituted everything had had to be maintained \u201cin its present state\u201d. She went on to state that she did not know whether the telephone monitoring report in respect of the applicant had or had not been destroyed. According to information she had received from the special officer, the reports had not been sorted and it would require about five people and one year\u2019s work to examine the contents of all the bags still in existence.", "23. In a judgment of 14 September 1994, which was served on 25 January 1995, the Federal Court dismissed all the applicant\u2019s claims.", "24. Regarding the issue whether there was a legal basis for the measures complained of, the Federal Court referred first to section 17(3) FCPA and Article 1 of the Federal Council\u2019s Decree of 29 April 1958 on the Police Service of the Federal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office. However, it considered it unnecessary to examine whether those provisions could have provided a lawful basis for the alleged infringement of the applicant\u2019s personality rights, since one of the conditions for awarding compensation had not been met.", "25. The court then referred to sections 66 et seq., and particularly section 72 FCPA on the monitoring of telephone communications and postal correspondence, and to Articles 265 et seq. of the Criminal Code, which govern \u201ccrimes or major offences against the State,\u201d and reiterated that information could lawfully be gathered \u2013 even before a prosecution was brought \u2013 in order to prevent an offence being committed against the State or national security if there was evidence that such an offence was being prepared.", "26. In that connection the Federal Court found:", "\u201c... a card was drawn up on the plaintiff in connection with the then monitoring of telephone communications with the Soviet embassy for counter-intelligence reasons. As he had contacts with a male or female employee of the Soviet embassy and it was not immediately clear that the \u2018Perma Tweez\u2019 appliance which he sold was a harmless depilatory instrument, the authorities acted correctly in investigating his identity, his circumstances and the \u2018Perma Tweez\u2019 appliance in question and recording the result.\u201d", "27. The Federal Court held, however, that it did not have to rule on whether those provisions, particularly section 66(1 ter) FCPA, allowed the information thus obtained to be kept after it had become apparent that no criminal offence was being prepared (\u201cFraglich ist, ob die Aufzeichnungen weiter aufbewahrt werden durften, nachdem sich offenbar herausgestellt hatte, dass keine strafbare Handlung vorbereitet wurde\u201d), since the applicant had not suffered a serious infringement of his personality rights.", "28", "29. Lastly, the Federal Court held that the applicant\u2019s administrative-law action, which he had filed with it on 9 March 1992, was an \u201ceffective remedy\u201d within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention. It also pointed out that the applicant could have instituted proceedings challenging certain data in the Public Prosecutor\u2019s card index and requesting that they be amended. In that connection the Federal Court referred to, inter alia, the Federal Council\u2019s Directives of 16 March 1981 applicable to the Processing of Personal Data in the Federal Administration (section 44), to the Federal Decree of 9 October 1992 on the Consultation of Documents of the Federal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office (Article 7 \u00a7 1) and to the Federal Council\u2019s Order of 20 January 1993 on the Consultation of Documents of the Federal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office (Article 11 \u00a7 1).", "30. In 1996 the applicant\u2019s card was removed from the card index and transferred to the Federal Archives where it cannot be consulted for fifty years.", "31. The relevant provisions of the Federal Constitution in force at the material time were worded as follows:", "\u201cThe powers and duties of the Federal Council, as referred to in the present Constitution, are the following, among others:", "...", "9.
