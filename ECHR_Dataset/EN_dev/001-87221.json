The applicant, Ms Tibor Ipolyn\u00e9 Dar\u00f3czy, is a Hungarian national who was born in 1933 and lives in Budapest.", "6. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "7. In 1950 the applicant married Mr Tibor Ipoly Dar\u00f3czy. According to birth certificate no. 1786/1927 Mr Dar\u00f3czy was entitled to bear the two above-mentioned forenames from the very moment of his birth. Her husband signed the marriage certificate as \u201cTibor Dar\u00f3czy\u201d. The applicant chose to bear her husband\u2019s name by putting the suffix \u201c-n\u00e9\u201d referring to the marriage (h\u00e1zass\u00e1gra utal\u00f3 told\u00e1s) after the first given name (Tibor) of her husband. In accordance with the widespread custom in Hungary, the latter only used his first given name even in official contexts. The applicant\u2019s married name was registered as Tiborn\u00e9 Dar\u00f3czy on the marriage certificate.", "8. The official before whom the marriage took place did not observe that the name chosen was against the law since, at the material time, a woman could only choose to bear the whole name of her husband, including all the given names. In the present case, the applicant\u2019s correct married name should have been Tibor Ipolyn\u00e9 Dar\u00f3czy.", "9. The mistake was not revealed in 1954 when identity cards were introduced in Hungary. The applicant\u2019s renewed identity card issued in 1974 also contained the name Tiborn\u00e9 Dar\u00f3czy. The applicant used this name in all official and private business. In particular, her social security card and tax identification certificate were issued in the name Tiborn\u00e9 Dar\u00f3czy.", "10. In 1984 Hungary introduced electronic data recording. In the new State Registry (\u00c1llami N\u00e9pess\u00e9gnyilv\u00e1ntart\u00f3) the applicant\u2019s name was automatically entered in the manner prescribed by law, as Tibor Ipolyn\u00e9 Dar\u00f3czy. However, she did not receive any official notification of this fact. In 1994 she and her husband were entered on the electoral register (v\u00e1laszt\u00f3i n\u00e9vjegyz\u00e9k) under the names Tibor Dar\u00f3czy and Tiborn\u00e9 Dar\u00f3czy. This database relied on the general State Registry.", "11. In 1996 the applicant\u2019s husband died. The applicant then used the name Tiborn\u00e9 Dar\u00f3czy with the prefix \u201c\u00f6zv.\u201d indicating that she was a widow.", "12. In 2004 the applicant lost her identity card. Based on the State Registry, the Registry Office issued a new card which indicated her name as the widow of Tibor Ipoly Dar\u00f3czy (\u00f6zv. Tibor Ipolyn\u00e9 Dar\u00f3czy). On 13 January 2005 the applicant obtained an official certificate containing this name. The certificate\u2019s only function was to enable her to access her bank account since her new identity card contained a name that was different from the one she had used when opening the account. The text of the certificate expressly stated that it had been issued for one-time use.", "13. The applicant lodged a complaint with the Ministry of the Interior, seeking permission to bear the name Tiborn\u00e9 Dar\u00f3czy. In November 2004 the Ministry informed her that, since her husband\u2019s official name was Tibor Ipoly Dar\u00f3czy, she was entitled and obliged to bear that name in its entirety as a widow, and that it was not possible to change it to another form. Her name is at present registered as Tibor Ipolyn\u00e9 Dar\u00f3czy.", "\u201c(3) As a general rule, women should be entered in the registry under their family name (birth name) and forename.
