The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Pan\u010devo, Serbia.", "7. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "8. On 16 November 2003, the applicant was stopped and searched by a police officer at the main bus station in Belgrade and a packet containing 4.13 grams of cannabis was found on his person.", "9. He was then taken to a police station but was released after a short period of time. Whilst in custody, an on-duty police officer issued a receipt confirming seizure of the cannabis in question (potvrda o privremeno oduzetim predmetima). This receipt was signed by the applicant and the officer and contained the applicant\u2019s registered home address \u2013 M.K. Street no. 32, Pan\u010devo.", "10. In a subsequent incident report of the same date, however, the officer appears to have made a mistake by stating that the applicant\u2019s address was M.K. Street no. 30 rather than no. 32. This report was neither seen nor signed by the applicant.", "11. Having found his number in a telephone directory, on 6 July 2004 the police contacted the applicant\u2019s father by telephone. He in turn informed the applicant that the police were looking for him. The applicant subsequently called the police and was told that he needed to come to the station in order to pick up the court summons. Upon arrival at the station, he was arrested and placed in detention.", "12. It subsequently became clear that a detention order had been issued by the District Court (Okru\u017eni sud) in Belgrade on 29 June 2004, as part of the criminal proceedings brought against the applicant regarding the cannabis seizure of 16 November 2003. In its reasoning, the court first explained that the applicant had not appeared at the hearing scheduled for 17 March 2004 and noted that the return receipt attached to its summons had stated that he \u201cwas unknown at M.K. Street no. 30\u201d. Secondly, the applicant had failed to appear at the following hearing scheduled for 20 May 2004 and the police, who had been ordered to serve the summons, had reported on 20 April 2004 that a neighbour had confirmed that the applicant had not been living at the address in question since 1999. Thirdly, on 20 April 2004 the police had also run a search in their database and had made additional inquiries, confirming that, as of 1986, the applicant\u2019s registered residence was indeed M.K. Street no. 30, but could not discover any information concerning his current whereabouts. Finally, the court concluded that there was a sufficient factual basis to indicate that the applicant was hiding and/or in flight and had therefore ordered his detention. (It must, however, be noted that the neighbour\u2019s statement and the original police report of 20 April 2004 were cited erroneously by the District Court and that in fact both had referred to M.K. Street no. 32 only, as the applicant\u2019s registered residence, there being no mention of M.K. Street no. 30.)", "13. On 29 June 2004 the District Court had also adopted a separate decision requesting the police to issue a wanted notice (poternica) and arrest the applicant. Therein the applicant\u2019s address had again been stated as M.K. Street no. 30.", "14. Various other documents successively referred to both addresses. Thus the District Court\u2019s letter sent to the police on 20 May 2004 referred to M.K. Street no. 32 while all court summonses, the criminal complaint of 11 December 2003 (krivi\u010dna prijava) and the indictment (optu\u017eni predlog) of 26 December 2003 consistently stated the applicant\u2019s address as M.K. Street no. 30.", "15. Throughout this time the applicant\u2019s identity card, issued by the police on 30 August 2000, and his residence registration remained unchanged, stating his address as M.K. Street no. 32, Pan\u010devo.", "16. On 7 July 2004 the applicant\u2019s lawyer filed an appeal by telegram against the District Court\u2019s detention order of 29 June 2004. Therein he stated that the applicant had never lived at M.K. Street no. 30 and pointed out that his registered residence was in fact M.K. Street no. 32. The applicant consequently had no knowledge of the criminal proceedings against him; nor could he have deliberately avoided receiving the court summons.", "17. On 8 July 2004 the applicant\u2019s lawyer supplemented this appeal with additional written arguments requesting that the impugned detention order be revoked and his client released. In particular, he noted that the applicant had gone to the police station \u201cof his own free will\u201d as soon as he had found out that they were looking for him. Upon arrival at the police station, he had been arrested and it was then that he had first found out about the criminal charges against him.", "18. On 12 July 2004 the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Srbije) rejected the appeal. It did so without an oral hearing. In its ruling the Supreme Court affirmed the reasons for detention given by the District Court and further held that there was no evidence in the case file that the applicant\u2019s correct address was indeed M.K. Street no. 32. On the contrary, police reports suggested that \u201cthe applicant\u2019s residence throughout the proceedings had remained unknown\u201d.", "19. On 14 July 2004 this decision was received by the applicant\u2019s lawyer.", "20. On 16 July 2004 he filed a motion with the District Court, seeking the applicant\u2019s release on bail or, alternatively, that his detention be replaced with a prohibition on leaving his place of residence until the conclusion of the criminal proceedings. The lawyer further noted that the applicant\u2019s detention had been ordered due to the court\u2019s error in the establishment of his true home address and concluded by requesting that a hearing in the case be scheduled urgently.", "21. The District Court appears not to have considered this motion.", "22. Following a hearing on 26 July 2004, the District Court found the applicant guilty of illicit possession of narcotics and fined him in the amount of 10,000 Serbian dinars (at the time approximately 128 euros).", "23. In a separate decision of the same date the District Court released the applicant from detention. It held, inter alia, that \u201cthe current phase of the criminal proceedings had been completed\u201d and that \u201cthe defendant had provided correct information about his present address\u201d.", "24. On 24 September 2004 the applicant filed a complaint with the Court of Serbia and Montenegro (Sud Srbije i Crne Gore).", "25. Following the communication of the present application to the respondent State, the Government produced two signed witness statements, taken by the police on 23 January 2006, wherein the applicant\u2019s neighbours, both residing at M.K. Street no. 32, confirmed that the applicant had indeed not been living there for years. One of them further specified that he had already told the police as much in April 2004, while the other recalled that the applicant had not been living at the address in question since 1999.", "26. Articles 10 and 16, taken together, stated that the \u201cprovisions of international treaties on human and minority rights applicable in ... [the State Union of] ... Serbia and Montenegro shall be directly enforceable\u201d and, further, that \u201cthe ratified international treaties\u201d shall \u201chave precedence\u201d over domestic legislation.", "27.
