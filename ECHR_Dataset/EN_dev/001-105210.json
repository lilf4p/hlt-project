At the material time the Urus-Martan district and the town of Grozny were under the full control of the Russian federal forces. Military checkpoints manned by Russian servicemen were located on all roads leading to and from the area, which was under a strict curfew. A checkpoint manned by policemen from the Special Task Unit of the Yaroslavl region (\u201cthe OMON\u201d) was located on the road between the town of Urus-Martan and the village of Gekhi. The applicants and Adam Makharbiyev lived in Gekhi, in Urus-Martan district. In March 2001 Adam Makharbiyev was trying to get a job at the Zavodskoy district department of the interior (the Zavodskoy ROVD) in Grozny.", "7. In the afternoon of 24 March 2001, on his way from Grozny to Gekhi, Adam Makharbiyev stopped at his cousins\u2019 house in Chernorechye village on the outskirts of Grozny. On the same evening he drove back to Gekhi with his cousins, Mr I.M. and Mr L.M., in the latter\u2019s black VAZ-2106 car. At the time Mr L.M. was a police officer at the Oktyabrskiy ROVD in Grozny. On their way Adam Makharbiyev, Mr I.M. and Mr L.M. passed through a number of checkpoints; Mr L.M. showed his police identity card and the car was allowed to pass through. The road to Gekhi went through the checkpoint manned by the OMON from the Yaroslavl region; the servicemen had previously seen Mr L.M. crossing the roadblock on a regular basis and knew that he was a police officer.", "8. At about 5 p.m. the car with the three men was stopped for yet another identity check at the checkpoint manned by the OMON from Yaroslavl. The servicemen looked at the police identity card provided by Mr L.M. and asked for the passports of Adam Makharbiyev and Mr I.M. After the two men had produced their documents the servicemen surrounded them, blocked the passage through the checkpoint, handcuffed all three men and dragged Adam Makharbiyev inside the checkpoint building, while Mr I.M. and Mr L.M. remained outside. The servicemen also took away Mr L.M.\u2019s service gun. Immediately after this the servicemen called someone on a portable radio and requested that representatives of the military commander\u2019s office come to the checkpoint.", "9. The detention of Adam Makharbiyev and his cousins was witnessed by two residents of Gekhi who happened to cross the checkpoint at the same time as the detained men. One of them went to the applicants\u2019 house straight away and informed them about the incident. The first and second applicants immediately got into their car and drove to the checkpoint.", "10. About fifteen minutes after the servicemen had called for representatives of the military commander\u2019s office to attend, an armoured URAL lorry, two black VAZ-2109 cars with military registration numbers of the \u201811\u2019 region and a white VAZ-2121 (\u2018\u041d\u0438\u0432\u0430\u2019) car arrived at the checkpoint. Adam Makharbiyev was forced into one of the VAZ-2109 cars; Mr I.M. and Mr L.M. were placed in the URAL lorry; black sacks were put over their heads. Mr L.M.\u2019s black VAZ-2106 car was driven away by one of the abductors, who was in military uniform.", "11. When the vehicles with the detained men were leaving the checkpoint, the first and second applicants pulled up at the scene. They followed the convoy of military cars, which went to the centre of UrusMartan. The applicants\u2019 car was stopped at a checkpoint located on the bridge, in the vicinity of the town administration and the military commander\u2019s office. The first applicant got out of the car and ran after the convoy, which drove into the yard of the Urus-Martan district military commander\u2019s office (\u201cthe district military commander\u2019s office\u201d). The soldiers on duty stopped the first applicant from entering the building. Several minutes later the second applicant also arrived at the military commander\u2019s office. The applicants asked the soldiers to let them speak with the district military commander. The servicemen refused and demanded that the applicants leave the premises, as curfew was just starting.", "12. After the arrival at the district military commander\u2019s office, Mr I.M. and Mr L.M. were taken to the third floor, where they were questioned for about two or three hours about involvement in the activities of illegal armed groups.

After the questioning Mr L.M. was taken outside and placed in an UAZ minivan (\u2018\u0422\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043a\u0430\u2019). He recognised the model of the car by its engine sound and layout. His brother, Mr I.M., was also put into the vehicle which took them to the building of the Urus-Martan temporary district department of the interior (\u201cthe Urus-Martan VOVD\u201d) located only a few hundred metres from the military commander\u2019s office.", "14. In the VOVD Mr L.M. was taken to an investigator\u2019s office and the sack was removed from his head. Mr L.M. asked about his brother, Mr I.M., and his cousin, Adam Makharbiyev. The investigator told him that he and his brother had been brought over from the military commander\u2019s office and that he did not know the whereabouts of Adam Makharbiyev. After that Mr L.M. and Mr I.M. were taken to a cell in which there were two other detainees.", "15. On the following morning, 25 March 2001, the head of the Oktyabrskiy ROVD arrived in Urus-Martan and spoke with the head of the VOVD. As a result, Mr L.M. was released on the same day; during his release the VOVD officers mistakenly gave him Adam Makharbiyev\u2019s official registration card. Mr I.M. was released a day later, on 26 March 2001. About eight days later Mr L.M. picked up his VAZ-2106 car, which had been taken away by the abductors, from the district military commander\u2019s office.", "16. On 27 March 2001 the first applicant managed to meet the district military commander, General G., and asked him whether his servicemen had taken away her son. He responded: \u201cYes, there is a detainee named Makharbiyev. We will question him and then release him.\u201d A few days later the first applicant again spoke to the General and asked about her son. The latter told her that Adam Makharbiyev had absconded, taking a pistol from the district military commander\u2019s office.", "17. On an unspecified date in 2002 the first applicant lodged a claim with the Urus-Martan Town Court, requesting that Adam Makharbiyev be declared a missing person.

The Government neither challenged the version of events presented by the applicants nor provided their own version of the events.", "20. On 25 March 2001 the applicants complained to the VOVD about the abduction of Adam Makharbiyev. They did not retain a copy of this complaint.", "21. On 28 March 2001 the first applicant again complained to the VOVD about her son\u2019s abduction. She stated that her son and his two cousins had been abducted by Russian military servicemen at the checkpoint located on the road between Urus-Martan and Gekhi, and that some time later Adam Makharbiyev\u2019s cousins had been released, but he had remained in detention. She stressed that she could provide the authorities with a detailed description of the abductors\u2019 vehicles and the names of witnesses to the abduction, and stated that at some point after the abduction her son had been taken to the Urus-Martan district department of the Federal Security Service (\u201cthe FSB\u201d).", "22. On 30 March 2001 the second applicant wrote to the Urus-Martan district prosecutor\u2019s office (the district prosecutor\u2019s office) about his son\u2019s abduction, and on 4 April 2001 to the district military commander, General G. He stated that at about 5 p.m. on 24 March 2001 his son had been abducted by Russian military servicemen at the checkpoint located on the road between Urus-Martan and Gekhi. The applicant further provided a detailed description of the vehicles involved in the abduction and stated that there were witnesses to the events who could provide statements to the authorities. He stated that he had learnt that at some point after the abduction his son had been detained in the Urus-Martan FSB, and stated that his attempts to establish the whereabouts of his son by lodging complaints with the VOVD, the ROVD, the FSB and the local administration had been futile.", "23. On 14 April 2001 the district prosecutor\u2019s office instituted an investigation into the abduction of Adam Makharbiyev under Article 126 of the Criminal Code (kidnapping). The case file was given the number 25042. The applicants were informed of this on 12 July 2001.", "24.

He stated, amongst other things, that his two relatives, who had been abducted with his son, had later been released from the VOVD and that one of them had been given Adam Makharbiyev\u2019s registration card by mistake. The applicant further stated that he had applied to various authorities with numerous requests for an investigation to be initiated into his son\u2019s abduction by the OMON officers who had been manning the checkpoint on 24 March 2001 and for them to be questioned about his son\u2019s whereabouts. Finally, the applicant complained of a lack of information from the district prosecutor\u2019s office and asked to be provided with an update.", "25. On 18 June 2001 the second applicant wrote to the Chechnya prosecutor and the Russian Prosecutor General. He stated that his son and two of his cousins had been detained by Russian federal servicemen at a military checkpoint; that his cousins had been released later on from the VOVD and that one of them had mistakenly been given his son\u2019s documents during the release. He further stated that his numerous complaints to various authorities had not produced any results and that the investigation of his son\u2019s abduction had been ineffective. In particular, he pointed out that the investigators had failed to question the OMON officers who had been manning the checkpoint and taken away his son and that in spite of numerous witness statements the investigators had failed to establish the circumstances of his subsequent detention in the military prosecutor\u2019s office and the VOVD. According to the applicant, with this information and evidence at hand the investigators could have solved the crime and established his son\u2019s whereabouts shortly after the abduction and that such procrastination in the investigation demonstrated their lack of desire to identify and prosecute the perpetrators. The applicant requested that the authorities establish his son\u2019s whereabouts, inform him of any charges pending against his son and identify the culprits.", "26. On three occasions between July and August 2001 the district prosecutor\u2019s office informed the applicants about the opening of criminal case no. 25042.", "27.

The applicant stated that the investigator had failed to summon and question both the OMON officers who had been manning the checkpoint and the witnesses to the abduction; that the investigator had failed to include in the investigation file the witness statements given by him and the first applicant to the authorities; that during a conversation with the first applicant the investigator had told her: \u201cit is not my fault that your son got killed\u201d. The applicant requested that due to this statement demonstrating the investigator\u2019s awareness of Adam Makharbiyev\u2019s possible fate, the investigator should be held responsible for covering up his son\u2019s murder.", "29. On 16 February 2002 the district prosecutor\u2019s office informed the applicants that they had suspended the investigation in the criminal case for failure to identify the perpetrators.", "30.

The applicant further complained that the investigation had had all the necessary information to identify the perpetrators, but that in spite of that they had failed to take even basic steps. In her opinion, the investigators were trying to cover up her son\u2019s abduction by military servicemen. Finally, she requested that the Prosecutor General assist her in her search for Adam Makharbiyev.", "33. On 1 July 2002 the first applicant complained to a number of State authorities, including the head of the Chechnya FSB, the Russian Defence Minister and the district prosecutor.
