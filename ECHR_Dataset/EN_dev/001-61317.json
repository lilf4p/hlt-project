The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in the Paris area.", "10. The applicant has been physically disabled since the age of seven. He was adopted by Mr Bernard Poirrez, a French national, under the terms of a judgment of 28 July 1987 of the Bouak\u00e9 Court of First Instance. On 11 December 1987 the Bobigny tribunal de grande instance granted authority for the judgment to be executed.", "11. In December 1987 the applicant applied for a declaration of French nationality. His application was found inadmissible on the ground that he was over 18 years old when it was submitted. He appealed to the Bobigny tribunal de grande instance, which gave judgment on 15 January 1988 declaring the application inadmissible. That judgment was upheld by the Paris Court of Appeal on 24 June 1993.", "12. In the meantime, the Seine-Saint-Denis Occupational Counselling and Rehabilitation Board (commission technique d'orientation et de reclassement professionnel \u2013 \u201cCOTOREP\u201d) registered the applicant as 80% disabled and issued him with an invalids' card. In May 1990 he applied to the Family Allowances Office (caisse d'allocations familiales \u2013 \u201cCAF\u201d) for the Paris area for an \u201callowance for disabled adults\u201d (allocation aux adultes handicap\u00e9s \u2013 \u201cAAH\u201d). In support of his application, he stated that he was a French resident of Ivory Coast nationality and the adopted son of a French national residing and working in France. His application was rejected on the ground that, as he was neither a French national nor a national of a country which had entered into a reciprocity agreement with France in respect of the AAH, he did not satisfy the relevant conditions laid down in Article L. 821-1 of the Social Security Code (see paragraph 24 below).", "13. On 13 June 1990 the applicant brought his case before the Friendly Settlements Board of the Family Allowances Office.", "14. In a decision of 6 September 1990, the Board confirmed the CAF's decision on the ground that the applicant did not satisfy the conditions laid down in Article L. 821-1 of the Social Security Code. The authorities noted that the Ivory Coast, of which the applicant was a national, had not signed a reciprocity agreement with France in respect of the AAH.", "15. On 26 February 1991 the applicant lodged an application with the Bobigny Social Security Tribunal for judicial review of the decision rejecting his claim. The applicant and the CAF lodged their pleadings on 26 February and 25 April 1991 respectively.", "16. In a judgment of 12 June 1991, the court decided to stay the proceedings pending the referral of a question to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for a preliminary ruling. The question was whether the decision not to award the allowance for disabled adults to the applicant, a member of the family (adopted son) of a European Community national resident in the country of which the head of household (the adoptive parent) had the nationality (in accordance with French legislation) was compatible with the European provisions contained in the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community (\u201cthe EEC Treaty\u201d). In a judgment of 16 December 1992 the ECJ replied to the question with a ruling that the refusal to award the benefit to the applicant was not incompatible with the relevant Articles of the EEC Treaty. It pointed out that the applicant's adoptive father could not claim to be a \u201cmigrant worker\u201d, which was the category to which the European provisions in question applied. It based that finding on the fact that the applicant's adoptive father, being French, had always lived and worked in France. The ECJ accordingly concluded that the applicant could not \u201crely on Community law in support of his application for a social security benefit awarded to migrant workers and members of the family\u201d. In doing so, it did not examine the question whether the refusal to award the applicant the allowance was, in general, compatible with Community law or not.", "17. The applicant started receiving the minimum welfare benefit (revenu minimum d'insertion \u2013 \u201cRMI\u201d) on 17 December 1991.", "18. On 31 March 1993, on the strength of the reply from the ECJ, the Bobigny Social Security Tribunal rejected the application as ill-founded. The applicant appealed against that decision on 27 July 1993. He applied for legal aid on 23 November 1993.", "19. On 14 January 1994 the Legal Aid Office at the Paris tribunal de grande instance rejected the application for legal aid to fund the applicant's appeal on the ground that the request was manifestly ill-founded. On 21 February 1994 the applicant appealed against that decision. In a decision of 5 May 1994 the President of the Legal Aid Office allowed the appeal.", "20. In a judgment of 19 June 1995, the Paris Court of Appeal upheld the decision of 31 March 1993. It referred to the provisions of Article L. 821-1 of the Social Security Code in the wording then applicable and to the lack of a reciprocity agreement between France and the country of the applicant's nationality in respect of the allowance.", "21. On 2 May 1996 the applicant appealed to the Court of Cassation on points of law. The applicant and the CAF lodged their pleadings on 1 August and 21 October 1996 respectively. On 2 June 1997 a reporting judge was appointed. He filed his report on 10 October 1997. A hearing before the Court of Cassation took place on 27 November 1997. In a judgment of 22 January 1998, the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal lodged by the applicant and worded as follows:", "\u201cWith regard to the applicant's ground of appeal that '... Article 26 of the Covenant of New York prohibits any discrimination, including on grounds of national origin; that, in refusing to award Mr Koua Poirrez an allowance for disabled adults on grounds of his nationality, the Court of Appeal disregarded the binding nature of that provision, which it subsequently breached by refusing to apply ...' \u201d", "22. The Court of Cassation ruled as follows:", "\u201cArticle 26 of the International Covenant of New York of 19 December 1966, which prohibits any discrimination on grounds of national origin, cannot be construed as forbidding all nationality criteria on which domestic law makes the availability of a right conditional.", "After reiterating the terms of Article L. 821-1 of the Social Security Code, which restricts the right to an award of the allowance for disabled adults to French nationals and nationals of a country that has signed a reciprocity agreement, the Court of Appeal properly decided that Mr Koua Poirrez, an Ivory Coast national, could not claim that allowance in the absence of a reciprocity agreement between France and the Ivory Coast. ...\u201d", "23. Following the enactment of the Act of 11 May 1998, which lifted the nationality condition for awards of non-contributory allowances, the applicant reapplied for an allowance for disabled adults from 1 June 1998. His application was rejected by the CAF, whereupon he applied to the Social Security Tribunal again. In a judgment of 11 June 1999 that court declared his application ill-founded on the ground that the applicant had not complied with the formal conditions governing the submission of his application for the allowance because he had not submitted to the CAF all the documentary evidence of his financial situation. The applicant appealed. According to information provided by the Government and undisputed by the applicant, the COTOREP re-examined the applicant's claim, at the request of the CAF, and awarded him the allowance for the period from June 1998 to November 2000. It is not apparent from the file whether the applicant continued to receive the benefit after that date. In any event, the applicant has not made any complaint regarding the current period and has not alleged that the allowance has been withdrawn.", "", "24. The Disabled Persons Act of 30 June 1975 (Law no. 75-534) provides for the benefit of an allowance for disabled adults. Article L. 821-1 of the Social Security Code, as worded prior to the entry into force of the Act of 11 May 1998, provided for the award of this minimum income to any disabled person, subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions:", "\u201cAny French national or national of a country that has signed a reciprocity agreement in respect of benefits payable to disabled adults resident in metropolitan France ... who is over the age of entitlement to the special education allowance provided for in Article L. 541-1 and whose permanent disability is at least equal to the percentage determined by decree, shall receive an allowance for disabled adults if they are not eligible for an old-age or invalidity or employment-injury benefit under a social security or retirement pension scheme or special legislation of an amount at least equal to that of the allowance.\u201d", "25. The Aliens (Conditions of Entry, Residence and Asylum) Act of 11 May 1998 (Law no. 98-349) abolished the nationality condition. Since that Act was passed, any foreign national lawfully resident in France may claim the allowance.", "26. With regard to another benefit, namely the supplementary allowance paid by the National Solidarity Fund, the Court of Cassation has ruled that the refusal to award the benefit solely on the ground of their foreign nationality to claimants resident in France who received an invalidity pension under the French scheme breached Article 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (Social Division, judgment of 14 January 1999, published in the Bulletin).", "27.

In order to avoid or at least to alleviate difficult situations, sidelining and discrimination, to guarantee equal opportunity for people with disabilities, and to develop personal autonomy, economic independence and social integration, they should have the right to economic and social security and to a decent living standard by:", "\u2013 a minimum livelihood;", "\u2013 specific allowances; and", "\u2013 a system of social protection.", "1.2. If there is a global system of economic and social protection for the population as a whole, people with disabilities should be able to benefit fully from it, and their specific needs must be taken into consideration. In so far as this does not exist, a specific system must be established for continuous provision for people with disabilities.", "1.3. Socio-economic protection must be ensured by financial benefits and social services. This protection must be based on a precise assessment of the needs and the situation of people with disabilities which must be periodically reviewed in order to take into account any changes in personal circumstances which had been the reason for such protection.", "1.4. Economic protection measures must be considered as one of the elements of the integration process for people with disabilities.", "2. Economic and social security", "2.1. In addition to social benefits granted to people with disabilities as well as to other people (for example unemployment benefits), the economic and social security system should grant:", "\u2013 special benefits in cash or in kind, for people with disabilities, covering rehabilitation and other special needs, such as medical treatment, vocational training, technical aids, access to and adaptation of housing, transport and communication facilities;", "\u2013 special financial support for families who have a child with a disability;", "\u2013 adequate assistance, for example installation allowances or investment loans for people with disabilities wishing to become self-employed;", "\u2013 a minimum livelihood covering their and their families' basic needs and requirements for people with a degree of disablement which prevents them from working;", "\u2013 benefits for people who need the continuous assistance of another person because of their disablement;", "\u2013 benefits to people who are unable to seek employment because of care provided to a person with a disability;", "\u2013 where financial assistance is given up in order to take up employment, this financial assistance should be protected and guaranteed if employment proves unfeasible;", "...\u201d", "28. This recommendation also states that \u201cthe exercise of basic legal rights of people with disabilities should be protected, including being free from discrimination\u201d.", "29.
