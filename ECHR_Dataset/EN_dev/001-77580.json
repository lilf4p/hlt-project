The applicants were born in 1928, 1955, 1980, 1982, 1984, 1987 and 1994 respectively. The first applicant lives in Diyarbak\u0131r and the remainder of the applicants live in Istanbul. The first applicant is the father, the second applicant is the wife and the remainder of the applicants are the children of Adnan Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, who was killed on 3 June 1994.", "9. On 3 June 1994 at about 4.30 a.m. while Adnan Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m was leaving the casino at the \u00c7\u0131nar Hotel in the Ye\u015filyurt area of Istanbul with his two friends Sava\u015f Buldan and Hac\u0131 Karay, seven or eight people wearing bullet-proof vests and carrying firearms approached them. They introduced themselves as police officers and forced the three men into three cars.", "10. The applicants were informed of the incident on that same day. They immediately contacted the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y public prosecutor and the Ye\u015filk\u00f6y police headquarters to find out more about the kidnapping. They were informed that the three persons had not been taken into custody. The same day, the brother of Sava\u015f Buldan filed a complaint with the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y public prosecutor and complained that his brother and his two friends, Adnan Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m and Hac\u0131 Karay, had been abducted by people who had introduced themselves as police officers.", "11. On 3 June 1994 at about 9 p.m. \u0130smail Ta\u015fcan contacted the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca gendarmerie station within the district of Bolu. He informed the gendarmes that he had seen three bodies in an area near the river where he had gone to fish. At about 9.15 p.m. the gendarmerie arrived at the scene. The positions of the bodies were recorded. No documents or other property were found on the bodies which might establish their identities. The corpses were taken to the Health Centre in Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca for further examination.", "12. On 4 June 1994 a post mortem examination of Adnan Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m's body was carried out by two doctors in the presence of the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor. In the body examination report, it was noted that there was an ecchymosis measuring 1x1 cm and an abrasion on the surface of the knee cap of the second body that was later identified as that of Adnan Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m. It was further recorded that cyanosis was noted on the front part of the body, left leg upper part, left knee, genitals and the head. It was perceived that rigor mortis was fading. According to the report, when the body was touched, the skin peeled - which was most probably due to its damp condition. One bullet entrance hole on right occipital area and burnt hair caused by a close-range shot and a bullet exit hole behind the right ear (which damaged the tissue, internal tissue and bones) were noted. A wide haematoma on the left eye due to trauma caused by a blunt object, fracture of the nose, and blood from the nostrils to the moustache area were also noticed. No other signs or abnormalities were observed either on the back of the body or the genital area. There were no documents to prove identification, nor were there any valuables or money. On the surface of the right hand and wrist a further ecchymosis measuring 1 cm. in width was noted, which was probably caused when the hands were tied with a rope. The doctors further concluded that as the cause of death was clearly cerebral haemorrhage, there was no need to conduct a classical autopsy. The estimated time of death was given as 10 hours before the autopsy was carried out.", "13. The bullets recovered from the bodies were sent for ballistic examination to the Central Police Forensic Laboratory, which prepared two forensic reports dated 6 and 14 June 1994 respectively. The report dated 14 June 1994 showed that the five spent bullet cases found at the scene of the killing had been discharged by three different pistols. The report concluded that comparisons of the five spent bullet cases with other bullet cases recovered from the scenes of other unknown perpetrator killings since 1985 did not reveal any similarities.", "14. The bullets were then sent to the Gendarmerie Forensic Laboratory which prepared its own report on 17 June 1994. The report stated that comparisons of the five spent bullet cases found at the scene of the killing with other bullet cases recovered from the scenes of other unknown perpetrator killings did not reveal any similarities.", "15. On 4 June 1994 the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor conducted a search of the scene of the crime in the presence of \u0130smail Ta\u015fcan, who had found the bodies. During the examination, a person named Ms Ay\u015fe Ara\u00e7 told the public prosecutor that she had heard a gun shot in the morning of 3 June 1994.", "16. From 4 to 7 June 1994 the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca gendarmerie took statements from twenty-six persons.", "17. On 4 June 1994 the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y public prosecutor took a statement from Sebahattin Uz, the doorman at the \u00c7\u0131nar Hotel. In his statement, Mr Uz explained that when Adnan Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, Sava\u015f Buldan and Hac\u0131 Karay, who were regular customers at the hotel casino, left the hotel around 5 a.m. on 3 June 1994, six or seven persons, who had arrived in two cars, approached them and conducted body searches holding them against the wall. The three persons were then put into a dark-coloured Mercedes car with registration number 34 CK 420. The doorman stated that he had overheard one of the men saying that they were police officers and that they would release the three persons as soon as their statements were taken. The Mercedes was followed by a sports car. The doorman was unable to describe any of the men, since it was dark and he had seen them from a distance.", "18. Also on 4 June 1994 the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y public prosecutor took the statement of H\u00fcseyin K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7, a security guard at the \u00c7\u0131nar Hotel. He stated that seven or eight men, wearing waistcoats and carrying weapons, had approached the three men as they walked out the door. They forced the three men into the waiting cars, after having conducted body searches. This witness stated that one of the cars was a sports car.", "19. On 5 June 1994 Serdar \u00d6zdemir, a taxi driver waiting at the taxi rank outside the \u00c7\u0131nar Hotel, gave his statement to the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y public prosecutor. He stated that while waiting for customers, he had noticed three persons coming out of the casino. At that very moment, seven or eight men walked towards them, made the three persons face the wall and then searched them. Afterwards, the three were put into the waiting cars. One of the cars was a black-coloured Mercedes 300 SEL. The second car was a cherry-red Hyundai. The witness also recalled that he had seen a third car, a sports car, which was driven away by one of the men wearing a waistcoat. The witness had been unable to see the licence plates of the cars or the faces of these men.", "20. Again on 5 June 1994 the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y public prosecutor took a statement from another taxi driver, H\u00fcsn\u00fc Durmazer. He stated that as he approached the taxi rank outside the hotel, he saw some people forcing three men into a black car.", "21. On 9 June 1994 the Istanbul Security Department established that the car with registration number 34 CK 420 was a burgundy coloured 1987 model BMW and that it belonged to a certain C.P., who resided in Istanbul.", "22. On 18 June 1994 the first applicant, Selim Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, gave a statement to the police. He stated that his son, Adnan Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, had been abducted from the \u00c7\u0131nar Hotel. He explained that when the Bolu Gendarmerie informed him about the three dead bodies that had been found in Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca, he had identified his son's body in the Bolu State Hospital. He asked the authorities to find the perpetrators of this crime.", "23. The preliminary enquiries led the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y public prosecutor to issue a continuous search warrant on 23 June 1994, which was valid for ten years. The investigation file was forwarded to the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor on 17 March 1995 since the bodies were found within his area of jurisdiction.", "24. As it had not been possible to establish the identities of the perpetrators, on 31 August 1995 the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor issued a permanent search warrant for the perpetrators of the killings, which would remain valid for twenty years pursuant to Article 102 of the Criminal Code. The prosecutor further stated in his report that no evidence had been found during the investigation. Copies of this search warrant were distributed to the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca gendarmerie and the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca police as well as to the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y public prosecutor in Istanbul so that they could inform the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor if they found the perpetrators. The prosecutor also instructed these authorities to continue carrying out meticulous searches for the perpetrators.", "25. After the Susurluk incident, Hanefi Avc\u0131, who was the Head of Intelligence Branch of Istanbul Police Headquarters at the time, gave a statement to the public prosecutor in connection with the Susurluk incident. In his statement, he referred to the killings of Sava\u015f Buldan, Adnan Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m and Hac\u0131 Karay as the work of an illegal group. He further stated that, as that information was based on secret intelligence, he did not have any documents to prove the allegations. He was, however, of the opinion that, if an investigation was carried out into certain sources, it would be possible to find documents to verify the accuracy of these allegations. He was prepared to indicate those issues in respect of which it might be possible to find documents. Among his submissions, which were recorded in a seven-page statement, Mr Avc\u0131 stated, inter alia, the following:", "\u201cThe Gendarmerie and the National Intelligence Service (Milli \u0130stihbarat Te\u015fkilat\u0131, hereinafter MIT) became concerned about the financial assistance being provided to the PKK from certain members of the Kurdish community, which they felt accounted for its increased activity between 1991 and 1993. They did not feel that they had enough evidence to bring charges and consequently some officers from the Police, Gendarmerie and MIT started talking about using different methods of dealing with certain members of the Kurdish community. A special team was formed for this purpose by, inter alia, the Chief of Police, Mehmet A\u011far and the Chief of Special Forces, Korkut Eken. This team consisted both of members of the Special Forces and certain civilians, including Ya\u015far \u00d6z. The activities of this special team were known to other members of the MIT and the Intelligence Branch of the Gendarmerie (the J\u0130TEM). The kidnapping and the killing of Sava\u015f Buldan and his friends formed part of such activities. It was established that these persons were helping the PKK financially. The way they were kidnapped and killed did not bear any resemblance to the activities of a Mafia or other underground organisation known to us. Police identity cards and policing methods were used during the kidnapping of Sava\u015f Buldan and his friends, otherwise it would not have been possible to kidnap them and to kill them as there are checkpoints on the roads along which they would have been stopped. To go through these checkpoints could only have been possible by making use of an official title\u201d.", "On 24 March 1997 Hanefi Avc\u0131 was interrogated once again in Ankara at the request of the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor. In his statement, he stated that he did not know how and by whom the killings were carried out.", "26. On 11 March 1997 the police officers Ercan Ersoy, O\u011fuz Yorumaz and Ayhan \u00c7ark\u0131n, who were in detention in connection with an investigation into the Susurluk incident, were shown to the eyewitnesses to the abduction, H\u00fcsn\u00fc Durmazel and Sabahhattin Uz. However, the eyewitnesses stated that they had not seen these persons before.", "27. The photo-fit drawings of the three abductors made on the basis of the statements of the witnesses were compared with the photographs of Ercan Ersoy, O\u011fuz Yorulmaz and Ayhan \u00c7ark\u0131n at the Criminal Police Laboratory. In the laboratory report, dated 19 March 1997, it was stated that the photo-fits did not have the necessary facial characteristics to make a positive comparison.", "28. The photo-fits were also compared with the photograph of Ya\u015far \u00d6z, another suspect detained in connection with the Susurluk investigation. The report of the criminal laboratory dated 27 March 1998 concluded that one of the photo-fits bore resemblances to the photograph and that the person in the photo-fit could be Ya\u015far \u00d6z. Accordingly, on 20 April 1998 the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca Magistrates' Court issued an arrest warrant for Ya\u015far \u00d6z. On 7 May 1998 Ya\u015far \u00d6z gave a statement to the public prosecutor. He stated that he was not in Istanbul between 1 April 1994 and October 1994 and that he did not know who had carried out the kidnapping on 3 June 1994. He further stated that he did not fit the description of any of the abductors as he had had a beard at the time of the kidnapping. He explained that this fact could be easily verified because he had given an interview to a local television channel in Milas at around the time of the kidnapping.", "29. On 14 May 1998 the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca Criminal Court rejected the appeal of Ya\u015far \u00d6z against the decision ordering his arrest for the kidnapping and killing of the applicants' relative and the other two persons. On 29 May 1998 an identity parade was held in the prison where Ya\u015far \u00d6z was being detained on remand. Both Sebahattin Uz, the doorman at the \u00c7\u0131nar Hotel, and H\u00fcsn\u00fc Durmazer, the taxi driver who had witnessed the kidnapping on 3 June 1994, stated that Ya\u015far \u00d6z, who was included in a line-up of ten persons, was not one of the men who had carried out the kidnapping. On 14 July 1998 Ali Osman Sivri was questioned by the public prosecutor. Mr Sivri was a watchman working at the Karadere Forest, which was on the road to the Yedig\u00f6ller National Park. He referred to his previous statement which he had given on 7 June 1994 and stated that he had only seen a red car stop outside his office in the forest at around 10.30 a.m. on 3 June 1994. One person had left the car and filled a container with water from a fountain. When he was shown pictures of Ya\u015far \u00d6z, the witness stated that the person he had seen did not look like Ya\u015far \u00d6z.", "30. On 24 July 1998 the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor took a decision of non-jurisdiction in respect of Ya\u015far \u00d6z. The prosecutor sent the investigation file to the Ankara State Security Court which, in the prosecutor's opinion, was the competent court to prosecute Mr \u00d6z.", "31. In the meantime, on 29 September 1998, the Istanbul Security Department wrote to the management of the \u00c7\u0131nar Hotel Casino and requested that the video recordings of the security camera for the night of 3 June 1994 be transmitted to them. In reply, on 2 October 1998 the casino management informed the security department that the video recordings were kept for one month and then erased. They further stated that as the casino was closed as of 12 February 1998, all video recordings were deleted.", "32. On 7 October 1998 the public prosecutor attached to the Ankara State Security took a decision of non-jurisdiction in respect of Ya\u015far \u00d6z. The prosecutor concluded that there was insufficient evidence to suggest that the killings had been carried out by or on behalf of an illegal organisation. He therefore concluded that the State Security Court did not have jurisdiction in this matter. The file was sent to the D\u00fczce public prosecutor, who later transferred the file to the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor.", "33. On 2 November 1998 the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor, noting that Ya\u015far \u00d6z had been arrested and put on trial for the killings, decided to continue the search for the other perpetrators. The prosecutor also asked the D\u00fczce public prosecutor to charge Ya\u015far \u00d6z, who, according to the evidence gathered by the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor, was one of the perpetrators of the kidnappings and subsequent killings.", "34. On 16 November 1998 the D\u00fczce public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the D\u00fczce Assize Court. The prosecutor alleged that the evidence justified the prosecution of Ya\u015far \u00d6z for the murder of the applicant's brother and his two friends.", "35. During the proceedings before the D\u00fczce Assize Court, the court took into consideration the indictment which had been submitted to the Istanbul State Security Court on 29 April 1997 and which dealt with Ya\u015far \u00d6z's role in the Susurluk affair. The D\u00fczce Assize Court noted that, according to this indictment, Mr \u00d6z was a notorious international drugs trafficker who held three official service passports, two of which were in the names of Tar\u0131k \u00dcmit and E\u015fref \u00c7u\u011fdar.", "36. The D\u00fczce Assize Court finally noted that Ya\u015far \u00d6z's name had been implicated in the Susurluk Report which had concluded that the fight against terrorism had gained momentum in 1993 when Mehmet A\u011far was appointed head of the General Police Headquarters in Ankara. According to this Report, there had been a number of unknown perpetrator murders in the area between Izmit, Adapazar\u0131 and Bolu after the then prime minister declared publicly that she had in her possession a list containing the names of those businessmen who were supporting the PKK. The Report further stated that the killings of Sava\u015f Buldan, Beh\u00e7et Cant\u00fcrk, Vedat Ayd\u0131n, Medet Serhat Y\u00f6\u015f and Metin Can formed part of such activities.", "37. Recalling that Sava\u015f Buldan, Adnan Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m and Hac\u0131 Karay had been kidnapped by seven persons and then killed in the area between Izmit, Adapazar\u0131 and Bolu, the D\u00fczce Assize Court held that these killings resembled the above-mentioned killings in the same area. Considering that the defendant was already facing prosecution before another court for membership of an organisation which was allegedly responsible for killing persons who had much in common with the deceased persons in the present case and as there was no other evidence to suggest that these killings were carried out for personal reasons, the D\u00fczce Assize Court concluded on 24 November 1998 that it was precluded from examining the merits of the case for reasons of jurisdiction.", "38. The case file was transferred to the Ankara State Security Court which had jurisdiction to deal with cases involving organised crime. On 16 December 1998 the court concluded that it too did not have jurisdiction to deal with the case. It held that, according to the D\u00fczce public prosecutor's indictment of 16 November 1998, Ya\u015far \u00d6z was charged with multiple murders. The indictment had made no reference to organised crime and the court did not have jurisdiction to examine this allegation ex officio. The case file was sent to the Court of Cassation in order to resolve the dispute over jurisdiction.", "39. On 25 February 1999 the Fifth Criminal Chamber of the Court of Cassation, upholding the decision of the Ankara State Security Court, ruled that the D\u00fczce Assize Court had jurisdiction to deal with the case.", "40. Seven hearings were held before the D\u00fczce Assize Court in the course of the criminal proceedings against Ya\u015far \u00d6z. The applicants joined the proceedings as a civil party. Ya\u015far \u00d6z told the court that there was no evidence to link him to the killings and that the only reason for putting him on trial was to prove to the European courts that the killings were being investigated. Nineteen eyewitnesses, who had either seen the three men being put into the cars outside the hotel in Istanbul or had seen the three cars near the spot where these persons were killed, stated during the hearings that they had never seen Ya\u015far \u00d6z before.", "41. On 18 November 1999 the D\u00fczce Assize Court acquitted Ya\u015far \u00d6z of the charge of multiple murders due to lack of evidence. On 25 May 2001 the Court of Cassation upheld this decision.", "42. The parties submitted various documents with a view to substantiating their claims. These documents, in so far as they are relevant, may be listed as follows.", "(i) Scene of incident report, dated 3 June 1994, prepared by the District Gendarme Commander.", "(ii) Second scene of incident report, dated 4 June 1994, prepared by the District Gendarme Commander.", "(iii) Sketch of the scene of incident drawn by District Gendarme Commander, dated 4 June 1994.", "(iv) Decision of

In the Report, reference is made to the killing of the applicant's brother:", "\u201cAll the relevant State bodies were aware of these activities and operations. ... When the characteristics of the individuals killed in the operations in question are examined, the difference between those Kurdish supporters who were killed in the region in which a state of emergency had been declared and those who were not lay in the financial strength the latter represented in economic terms. These factors also operated in the murder of Sava\u015f Buldan, a smuggler and pro-PKK activist. (page 74).\u201d", "46.
