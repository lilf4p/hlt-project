The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Split. She is unemployed and unwaged.", "6. From October 1996 the applicant occupied a room and common premises of a privately owned flat in Split together with other tenants. On 2 August 1999 the applicant found that the lock of the entrance door to the flat had been changed and that her belongings had been removed from the flat. The applicant called the police, who drew up a report. On 3 August 1999 the applicant brought a civil action in the Split Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Splitu) against two individuals, M.P. and I.P., seeking protection against the disturbance of her occupation of a room and common premises in the flat.", "7. After a first-instance judgment by default of 16 September 1999 had been quashed at a hearing held on 9 November 1999 before the Split Municipal Court, subsequent hearings were held on 21 December 1999, 22 February, 28 March, 3 May and 7 June 2000, when a fresh judgment, allowing the applicant\u2019s claim, was adopted. It was, however, quashed by the Split County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Splitu) on 17 August 2000 and the case was remitted to the Municipal Court.", "8. In the fresh proceedings the Municipal Court held hearings on 7 June, 5 September and 22 November 2001 and 22 January, 26 February, 3 April and 14 May 2002. On this latter date a judgment ordering that the applicant was to regain her co-occupation of the flat in question was adopted. A subsequent appeal by the defendants was declared inadmissible in a decision of the Split Municipal Court, adopted on 24 May 2002, which was upheld by the Split County Court on 7 March 2003.", "9. Since the defendants in the civil proceedings had failed to comply with the judgment of 14 May 2002, the applicant applied to the Split Municipal Court on 31 March 2003, seeking an enforcement order. The order was issued on 10 April 2003. The defendants lodged an appeal. The execution of the order was scheduled for 5 June 2003. It was duly carried out. However, on 6 June 2003 the applicant was thrown out of the flat (see paragraph 13 below). Accordingly, on 2 July 2003 she requested the Split Municipal Court to resume the enforcement proceedings.", "10. On 26 August 2004 the Split County Court allowed the defendants\u2019 appeal, quashed the enforcement order of 10 April 2003 and remitted the case to the Split Municipal Court. The latter, on 18 March 2005, invited the applicant to amend her request. The applicant submitted an amended request on 26 April 2005. On 29 March 2007 the Municipal Court again invited the applicant to amend her request. The applicant submitted the amended request on 13 April 2007. On 24 April 2007 the Municipal Court invited the applicant to adjust her request within eight days. On 8 January 2008 the Split Municipal Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s request for the enforcement proceedings to be resumed.", "11. On 9 August 2002 the applicant complained to the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Repbulike Hrvatske) about the length of the civil proceedings described above. In a decision of 18 March 2005 the Constitutional Court dismissed the complaint as ill-founded, finding that the proceedings had been concluded within a reasonable time.", "12. On 10 April 2007 the applicant lodged a complaint about the length of the enforcement proceedings with the Split County Court. On 31 March 2008 the County Court allowed the complaint, found a violation of the applicant\u2019s right to a hearing within a reasonable time, awarded her 5,000 Croatian kunas (HRK) in compensation and ordered the Municipal Court to complete the enforcement proceedings within three months, although in fact those proceedings had already ended with the Split Municipal Court\u2019s decision of 8 January 2008. The County Court examined the length of the enforcement proceedings with reference to the period from 31 March 2003 until 31 March 2008.", "13. On 6 June 2003, the day after the applicant had regained possession of the flat in question, she was attacked by three individuals, two women and a man, upon her arrival in front of the flat. During the incident of 6 June 2003 the police were called and arrived on the scene. They interviewed the applicant and drew up a report. The relevant part of the report reads as follows:", "\u201c[The applicant] stated that at about 8 p.m. she had been verbally and physically attacked by three individuals when she had attempted to enter a flat ... The attackers had pulled her hair, hands and clothes and thrown her down the stairs from the first floor. They had also insulted her by shouting obscenities ... She further stated that they had threatened to kill her if she came back.", "...", "There were visible bruises and contusions on Sandra\u2019s right hand and her shirt was torn at the back. She asked for medical assistance after the interview.", "...\u201d", "14. On 10 June 2003 the police lodged a complaint with the Split Minor-Offences Court against three individuals, including J.M., for disturbance of public peace and order, alleging that they had physically attacked the applicant, kicked her entire body, pulled her by the hair and pushed her down the stairs, all the while shouting obscenities at her. The first hearing in the proceedings was held on 4 February 2005.", "15. In a decision of 11 May 2005 the Split Minor-Offences Court found all three defendants guilty of insulting the applicant with defamatory expressions and sentenced them to a fine in the amount of HRK 375. As to allegations of the physical assault on the applicant they found that there were insufficient evidence in that respect.", "16. However, this decision did not become final since the applicant lodged an appeal, complaining that the Minor-Offences Court had not addressed her allegations of physical assault. On 8 June 2005 the same Minor-Offences Court terminated the proceedings on the ground that the prosecution in respect of the offences with which the defendants were charged had meanwhile become time-barred. The applicant lodged an appeal. Both appeals lodged by the applicant were dismissed on 12 February 2007 by the High Minor-Offences Court.", "17. In a detailed criminal complaint of 2 October 2003 filed against seven individuals with the Split Municipality State Attorney\u2019s Office (Op\u0107insko dr\u017eavno odvjetni\u0161tvo Split) the applicant alleged, inter alia, that on 6 June 2003 at about 8 p.m., when she had arrived in front of the flat in question, three individuals, J.M., N.M and J.M.L., had come out of the flat, shouting at her and preventing her from entering the flat. They had attacked her physically, insulted her and threatened her, telling her not to come back or she would disappear and \u201cbe disposed of\u201d. The applicant also submitted medical evidence showing that she had sustained blows to her elbow and tailbone.", "18. In a decision of 11 November 2003 the State Attorney\u2019s Office decided not to open an official investigation on the ground that the act in question qualified as a criminal offence of inflicting bodily injuries of a lesser nature and that a prosecution for that offence had to be brought privately by the victim. The decision, inter alia, stated:", "\u201cIn her criminal complaints [the applicant] stated that on 6 June 2003 about 8 p.m. in front of a flat in Split ..., the suspects had verbally attacked her and insulted her, kicked her with their hands and legs all over her body, pulled her hair and pushed her down the stairs while J.M. had also threatened her not to come back to the flat or otherwise she would disappear.", "...\u201d", "The applicant was also instructed to proceed accordingly and to lodge within eight days a request for an investigation with a Split County Court investigation judge.", "19. The applicant complied with the said instruction on 3 December 2003 and submitted a request to a Split County Court investigation judge seeking to have an investigation opened in connection with the above event. She sought an investigation in respect of seven individuals, including J.M., N.M. and J.M.L., listing their names and addresses. She proceeded to describe the event in question in detail, specifying the acts carried out by her three attackers. She made a list of evidence in support of her allegations, including medical documentation about the injuries she had sustained and the police report issued on 6 June 2003. She further alleged that these acts constituted, inter alia, the criminal offence of making threats under Article 129 of the Criminal Code and the criminal offence of violent behaviour under Article 331 of the same Code. She specified her allegations in respect of each of the individuals concerned.", "20. On 5 January 2005 the Municipal Court invited the applicant to amend her request within eight days so as to include a description of the offence, the legal classification of the offence and circumstances showing that there was a well-founded suspicion that the individuals in question had committed criminal offences, as well as evidence supporting her allegations. On 26 January 2005 the applicant submitted an amended request, repeating in essence the same allegations as in her initial request. In her further submissions of 30 May 2005 the applicant submitted some documents from the minor-offences proceedings.", "21. On 19 September 2005 the Split County Court investigation judge declared the applicant\u2019s request for an investigation (ista\u017eni zahtjev o\u0161te\u0107ene kao tu\u017eiteljice) inadmissible. The relevant part of this decision reads:", "\u201cThe injured party, acting as subsidiary prosecutor (o\u0161te\u0107ena kao tu\u017eitelj), has lodged with this court a request for an investigation in respect of J.M. and others ...", "Pursuant to Article 71, paragraph 3, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, this court invited the injured party acting as subsidiary prosecutor on 5 January 2005 and once again orally, to amend her request and warned her that it would be declared inadmissible if she did not comply with the instruction within the set time-limit. The injured party acting as subsidiary prosecutor answered both calls but has failed to amend her request for an investigation in accordance with the court\u2019s instruction. The court considers the injured party\u2019s submission incomprehensible and incomplete. Therefore, it has to be declared inadmissible pursuant to Article 71, paragraph 3, of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\u201d", "22. On 16 January 2006 the applicant lodged an appeal against the above decision with the Split County Court. She claimed that she had fully complied with the instructions given in the court\u2019s letter of 5 January 2005 amending her initial request for an investigation so that it contained all the necessary information. She further contended that she had never received an oral invitation. On 9 February 2006 the Split County Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal, finding that \u201cthe submissions lodged by the subsidiary prosecutor are incomprehensible and incomplete\u201d. The applicant lodged a further appeal against that decision.", "23. On 23 April 2007 the applicant also complained to the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) about the length of the criminal proceedings. On 20 September 2007 the applicant\u2019s complaint was dismissed and she was instructed to lodge such a complaint with the Constitutional Court. On 21 November 2007 the applicant lodged a complaint about the length of proceedings with the Constitutional Court, before which it is still pending.", "24. The applicant\u2019s appeal was declared inadmissible by the Split County Court on 17 June 2008. On 23 June 2008 the applicant lodged a fresh appeal, which is still pending.", "25. The relevant parts of the Criminal Code (Kazneni zakon, Official Gazette no. 110/1997) read as follows:", "\u201c(1) Criminal proceedings in respect of criminal offences shall be instituted by the State Attorney\u2019s Office in the interest of the Republic of Croatia and its citizens.", "(2) It may be exceptionally provided by law that criminal proceedings in respect of certain criminal offences should be instituted upon a private prosecution or that the State Attorney\u2019s Office should institute criminal proceedings upon [a private] application.\u201d", "\u201cWhoever inflicts bodily injury to another person or impairs another person\u2019s health shall be fined or sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year.\u201d", "\u201cCriminal proceedings for the offence of inflicting bodily injury (Article 98) shall be instituted by means of private prosecution.\u201d", "\u201c(1) Whoever threatens another person with harm in order to intimidate or disturb that person shall be fined up to one hundred and fifty monthly wages or sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.", "(2) Whoever seriously threatens to kill another person ... shall be fined or sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year.", "...", "(4) Criminal proceedings for the criminal offences defined in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall be instituted upon [a private] application.\u201d", "\u201cA public official, or another person acting at the instigation or with the explicit or tacit acquiescence of a public official, who inflicts on another person pain or grave suffering, whether physical or mental, for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term from one to eight years.\u201d", "\u201cWhoever for such purposes as violent abuse, ill-treatment or particularly insolent behaviour in public submits another person into a degrading position shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term from three months to three years.\u201d", "26.

The Criminal Code distinguishes between these two roles. A private prosecutor (privatni tu\u017eitelj) is the injured party who brings a private prosecution in respect of criminal offences for which such prosecution is expressly prescribed by the Criminal Code (these are offences of a lesser degree). The injured party as a subsidiary prosecutor (o\u0161te\u0107eni kao tu\u017eitelj) takes over criminal proceedings in respect of criminal offences subject to public prosecution where the relevant prosecuting authorities for whatever reason have decided not to prosecute.", "\u201c(1) A request to prosecute shall be lodged with the competent State Attorney\u2019s Office and a private prosecution with the competent court.", "(2) Where the injured party has lodged a criminal complaint ... it shall be considered that he or she has also thereby lodged a request to prosecute.", "(3) Where the injured party has lodged a criminal complaint or a request to prosecute but the [competent authorities] establish that the criminal offence in question should be prosecuted upon a private prosecution, the criminal complaint or the request to prosecute shall be treated as a timely private prosecution if they have been submitted within the time-limit prescribed for [bringing] a private prosecution...\u201d", "Pursuant to Article 55(1), the State Attorney is under a duty to inform the injured party within eight days of a decision not to prosecute and of the party\u2019s right to take over the proceedings, as well as to instruct that party on the steps to be taken.", "\u201c...", "(2) Where the criminal proceedings are conducted upon a request by the injured party acting as a subsidiary prosecutor in respect of a criminal offence punishable with more than three years\u2019 imprisonment, he or she may ask to have legal counsel appointed free of charge where this is in the interests of the proceedings and where the injured party lacks the means to bear the expenses of legal representation ...\u201d", "\u201c(1) Private prosecutions, bills of indictment, requests to prosecute, legal remedies and other statements and information shall be submitted in writing unless otherwise provided by law.", "(2) The submissions referred to in paragraph 1 shall be comprehensible and contain the necessary information for the authorities to act upon them.", "(3) Unless otherwise provided in this Act, the court conducting the proceedings shall invite a person who has made submissions which do not contain the necessary information or are incomprehensible to supplement them.
