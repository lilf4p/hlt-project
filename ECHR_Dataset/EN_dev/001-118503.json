The applicant, Mr Kalevi Ensio Nieminen, is a Finnish national who was born in 1952 and lives in Nokia. He was represented before the Court by Mr Jaakko Tuutti, a lawyer practising in Tampere.", "2. The Finnish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr Arto Kosonen of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.", "3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "4. On 21 July 2009, in his own apartment, the applicant stabbed another person with a knife. The victim called the police. When the police patrol arrived, they found a person with a deep, bleeding wound in front of the applicant\u2019s home who told them that he had been stabbed in the applicant\u2019s home by the applicant. As it was not known whether other persons were in danger, the police officers entered the applicant\u2019s home in order to prevent any possible further act or event which might seriously threaten another person\u2019s life, personal liberty or health. In the apartment they found nobody but the applicant. He was severely intoxicated, a breathalyser showed a result of 4.00 per mill, and he was not able to give a statement. He was taken to the local police station. The police officers found and seized a knife with a 17 cm blade covered in blood.", "5.

On 26 November 2009 the Tampere District Court (k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus, tingsr\u00e4tten) dismissed all charges against the applicant.

No motive for the act could be established. The applicant and the victim were still good friends and had even come to the oral hearing together.", "8. No appeal was made against this judgment and it thus became final.", "9. According to Article 10 of the Finnish Constitution (perustuslaki, grundlagen, Act no. 731/1999), the sanctity of everyone\u2019s home is guaranteed.

A further precondition is that the measure is essential to prevent danger or to search and take possession of explosives, weapons or other dangerous substances or objects.\u201d", "11.

A civil servant having the power to arrest a person may decide to conduct a search at a person\u2019s home. A police officer may conduct a search even without a warrant if it is intended, inter alia, to locate a person to be apprehended, arrested or detained or for seizure of an object that has been used immediately before in a crime. A police officer may conduct a search without a warrant also on other occasions if the matter cannot wait (Chapter 5, section 3).", "14. At the time of the events there was no access to a court as concerned a search but only in respect of a seizure (Chapter 4, section 16, subsection 1).", "15. According to Chapter 21, section 6, subsection 1, of the Penal Code (rikoslaki, strafflagen, Act no. 578/1995 as modified by Act no. 654/2001), a person can be sentenced for aggravated assault to imprisonment for a minimum term of one year and a maximum of ten years."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
