The applicant, who acted as a court-appointed liquidator, a judge and two other liquidators were accused of collaborating to the detriment of other liquidators and creditors.", "7. On 31 January 2000 the Magdeburg Public Prosecutor opened preliminary investigations against the applicant and six other persons. The applicant was suspected of having granted an undue benefit (Vorteilsgew\u00e4hrung) and of embezzlement (Unterschlagung). The investigations concerned, inter alia, the judge's alleged free stay at the applicant's ski lodge and benefits in connection with the purchase of two cars and two computers. By a letter dated 7 February 2000 the applicant was informed of the investigations.", "8. In the following months, the Magdeburg Public Prosecutor (and also the Sachsen-Anhalt State Office of Criminal Investigations) questioned numerous witnesses and public officials of the court \u2013 partly, moreover, with the help of Vienna Interpol \u2013, and searched, inter alia, the applicant's business premises, seized documents and computers and requested information from the Credit Control Company. The applicant and his co-defendants, on their part, including after the submission of an interim report by the Sachsen-Anhalt State Office of Criminal Investigations in August 2000, made rather extensive submissions and repeatedly requested access to the files. The Magdeburg District Court also decided on an appeal against the search of premises; proceedings against one of the co-defendants were stayed.", "9.

In April 2001 the Magdeburg Public Prosecutor challenged one of the judges on the grounds of bias. In May 2001 the Magdeburg Regional Court rejected this request. In June 2001 the Naumburg Court of Appeal quashed that decision and found that the judge was biased. In July 2001 two more judges indicated that there were grounds for bias on their part. In August 2001 the Magdeburg Regional Court decided that one of the judges was to be excluded on the grounds of bias.", "14. In August 2001 it decided to obtain an expert opinion and heard other witnesses. On 3 September 2001 it commissioned the expert. In October 2001 it further amended its decision.

The written judgment, comprising 59 pages, was sent to the parties in July 2003.", "23. On 18 August 2003 the Magdeburg Public Prosecutor appealed. In October, following submissions by the accused, the files were transferred to the Federal Court of Justice.", "24.

On 19 January 2005 the Dessau Regional Court convicted the applicant of two counts of granting undue benefit and the judge of two counts of taking a bribe.

On 2 March 2005 the Dessau Regional Court submitted the written judgment.", "28. On 6 April 2005 the applicant, as one of his co-defendants had already done, lodged an appeal on points of law (comprising more than a hundred pages); he also appointed another legal counsel; proceedings against one of his co-defendants were stayed.", "29. In May 2005 the Magdeburg Public Prosecutor decided not to file further submissions and transferred the files to the Naumburg Regional Court.

On 13 December 2006, following submissions by all the parties, the Halle Regional Court rejected this request as unfounded.", "34. By a letter dated 16 January 2007 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the refusal. The same day, the Halle Regional Court decided that another chamber should decide on the case.", "35. On 6 February 2007 the Federal Constitutional Court refused to admit the case for adjudication as being inadmissible on the ground that the decision under section 206 (a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure was an interlocutory decision which could not be challenged.", "36. On 4 April 2007, following further submissions, the Halle Regional Court rejected the applicant's objection (Gegenvorstellung) against the refusal to stay the proceedings.", "37. In June 2007 \u2013 the applicant had twice requested the court to schedule a hearing \u2013 it turned out that hearings could only be scheduled as of 12 September 2007.
