In July 1997 he made a study visit to the Commission of the European Union in Brussels. The Federal Ministry of Justice paid his travel expenses and granted the applicant two weeks\u2019 special leave, in addition to which he took two weeks of his annual leave.", "6. On 9 July 1997 the Federal Minister of Justice informed the applicant on his return that it would not reimburse any of the additional expenses he had claimed in the meantime on 20 June 1997.", "7. On 5 September 1997 the applicant formally requested the reimbursement of further costs, incurred during the study visit, in particular the costs for his accommodation in the amount of Austrian schillings 17,699.75 (ATS - 1,284.11 euros (EUR)), and submitted additional records.", "8. On 20 March 1998 the Federal Minister dismissed the applicant\u2019s request on the grounds that the trip had not been an official journey \u2013 this having been made clear by the fact that the applicant had taken some annual leave during that period.", "9. On 3 June 1998 the applicant filed a complaint with the Administrative Court. He submitted that the Federal Minister had interpreted the relevant law incorrectly and that if he had properly assessed the evidence he would have concluded that the study visit to Brussels had to be treated as an official journey.", "10. On 30 January 2002 the Administrative Court quashed the Federal Minister\u2019s decision finding that the President of the Vienna Court of Appeal had been the authority competent to decide on the request for reimbursement at first instance, rather than the Federal Minister.", "11.

On 29 November 2002 the President of the Vienna Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s request for reimbursement of the costs of his accommodation in Brussels on the grounds that the applicant had not been given instructions for an official journey and had not performed any official duties during his stay in Brussels.

The applicant did not ask for a hearing before the Administrative Court.", "18. On 24 February 2006 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint, finding that the Minister had correctly assessed the evidence before him and had correctly concluded that the applicant\u2019s study trip had not been treated as an official journey.", "19. Civil servants are entitled under the Rules on Expenses for Official Journeys (Reisegeb\u00fchrenvorschrift) to reimbursement of their expenses for official journeys.

The time-limit can be extended once if the administrative authority can show that there are relevant reasons why it is impossible to reach a decision within the prescribed time-limit. If a decision is made within the prescribed time-limit, the proceedings in respect of the application against the administration\u2019s failure to decide shall be stayed.\u201d", "Section 42", "\u201c(1) Subject to any contrary provision of this Federal Act, the Administrative Court shall give a judgment in all cases.", "...", "(4) In respect of applications under Article 132 of the Federal Constitution, the Administrative Court may initially limit its judgment to a decision on specific relevant points of law and order the authority to make a decision consistent with the determined points of law within a specified time-limit which must not exceed eight weeks. If the Administrative Court does not use that possibility or the authority in question fails to comply with the order, the Administrative Court shall rule on the application against the administration\u2019s failure to decide by giving a judgment on the merits, for which it shall have full discretion in the administrative authority\u2019s stead.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
