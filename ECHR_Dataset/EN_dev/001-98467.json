He was represented before the Court by Mr T. Vuki\u010devi\u0107, an advocate practising in Split. The Croatian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mrs \u0160. Sta\u017enik.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "On 6 April 1984 the police authorities seized, from a Mr Z.K., 160,000 former Yugoslav dinars (YUD) that belonged to the applicant, under suspicion that the two of them had received it as a bribe. The applicant submits that he wanted to use the money to buy 4,870 kg of pickled (metal) sheet (dekapirani lim), which he intended to use in his recently opened locksmith's business.", "On 12 November 1989 the competent State Attorney indicted the applicant and Z.K. before the Zagreb Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Zagrebu), charging them with the criminal offence of accepting a bribe. On 20 February 1995 the Zagreb Municipal Court discontinued the criminal proceedings, the State Attorney having dropped the charges against the accused. However, the sum seized was not returned to the applicant.", "For that reason, on 28 November 1995, the applicant brought a civil action against the State in the Zagreb Municipal Court. In the period between 1984 and 1995 there were several changes to and denominations of domestic currency (see below under Relevant domestic law). So, the applicant initially sought the amount of 0.016 Croatian kunas (HRK) together with the statutory default interest accruable since 6 April 1984.", "During the proceedings, on 7 November 1997, a court-appointed financial expert prepared a report according to which, taking into account the inflation rate, the value of YUD 160,000 in 1984 was equal to the value of HRK 22,170.50 at the time that he had prepared his report.", "On the basis of that report, the applicant amended his claim and sought HRK 22,170.50 together with the statutory default interest accruable since 6 April 1984.", "On 15 December 1997 the Municipal Court ruled in part for the applicant. It held that, by seizing and not returning to the applicant YUD 160,000, the State had enriched itself without cause, and awarded him HRK 22,170.50 together with the statutory default interest accruable since 7 November 1997. The remainder of the applicant's claim, concerning the statutory default interest accrued between 6 April 1984 and 7 November 1997, was dismissed.", "Following appeals by both parties, on 15 February 2000, the Zagreb County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Zagrebu) quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case. It held that the first-instance court had erred when it had adjusted the applicant's claim and awarded him the contemporary value of YUD 160,000, because, under the relevant legislation, he was entitled only to the nominal amount.", "In the resumed proceedings, on 31 May 2001, the Zagreb Municipal Court awarded the applicant HRK 0.01 (as the amount awarded \u2013 HRK 0.016 \u2013 could be expressed to only two decimal places), together with the statutory default interest accruable since 28 November 1995. The remainder of the applicant's claim was dismissed and he was ordered to pay the respondent HRK 2,900 for the costs of the proceedings. In the applicant's submission, the sum he was awarded, including the accrued statutory default interest, was HRK 0.03.", "On 16 December 2003 the Zagreb County Court dismissed the applicant's appeal and upheld the first-instance judgment.", "On 19 February 2004 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the second-instance judgment alleging a violation of his constitutional right to equality before the courts.", "The Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) dismissed the applicant's constitutional complaint on 5 June 2007 and served its decision on his representative on 9 July 2007.", "The Act on the Change of the Value of the Dinar (Zakon o promjeni vrijednosti dinara, Official Gazette of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia no. 83/89) of 21 December 1989 established the new value of the Yugoslav dinar (YUD) so that one new dinar corresponded to 10,000 old dinars.", "By the Decision on the Introduction of the Croatian Dinar as the Currency on the Territory of the Republic of Croatia (Odluka o uvo\u0111enju hrvatskog dinara kao sredstva pla\u0107anja na teritoriju Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette of the Republic of Croatia no. 71/1991), which entered into force on 23 December 1991, the Republic of Croatia introduced its own currency, Croatian dinar (HRD). The Yugoslav dinar (YUD) was replaced by the Croatian dinar at an exchange rate of YUD 1 to HRD 1.", "On 13 May 1994 the Decision on the Termination of the Validity of the Decision on the Introduction of the Croatian Dinar as the Currency on the Territory of the Republic of Croatia and on the Manner and Time of Calculation of Sums Expressed in Croatian Dinars into Kunas and Lipas (Odluka o prestanku va\u017eenja Odluke o uvo\u0111enju hrvatskog dinara kao sredstva pla\u0107anja na teritoriju Republike Hrvatske, te o na\u010dinu i vremenu prera\u010dunavanja iznosa izra\u017eenih u hrvatskim dinarima u kune i lipe, Official Gazette of the Republic of Croatia no. 37/1994) entered into force, introducing the Croatian kuna (HRK) as the currency of the Republic of Croatia.
