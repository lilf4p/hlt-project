At about 5.15 a.m. on 21 December 2004 someone knocked at the entrance door of the applicants\u2019 house. Alis Zubirayev opened the door.

They did not identify themselves but the first applicant inferred that they belonged to the Russian military. At some point three other servicemen entered the house.", "9.

The servicemen asked Alis\u2019s family name, examined his identity papers and said that it was \u201chim\u201d. Two of the servicemen twisted the young man\u2019s arms behind his back and dragged him to the entrance door. The applicants asked them where they intended to take their son. The servicemen replied that the applicants had no reasons to worry. One of them told the first applicant to give him Alis\u2019s jacket and shoes but did not allow Alis to dress.", "11. The six servicemen left the house and took Alis to the street. The applicants followed them and saw an all-terrain UAZ vehicle without a registration number parked next to their gates.
