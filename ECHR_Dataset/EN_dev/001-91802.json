The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Poprad.", "5. On 14 April 1993 the District Court in Poprad restricted the applicant\u2019s legal capacity in that she was not allowed to act on her own before public authorities. The court relied on the opinion of several experts concluding that the applicant suffered from a mental disorder as a result of paranoid development of her personality. The applicant suffered from the delusion that she was being persecuted and on that ground she had made a considerable number of complaints and other submissions. The applicant\u2019s mother was appointed guardian for the purpose of the proceedings concerning the limitation of the applicant\u2019s legal capacity.", "6. On 18 April 1994 the Regional Court in Ko\u0161ice upheld the first-instance judgment, which became final on 26 July 1994.", "7. On 1 August 1994 the District Court in Poprad brought proceedings on its own initiative with a view to appointing a guardian for the applicant, whose legal capacity had been restricted by the above decisions. On 12 September 1994 the file was transmitted to the Regional Court in Ko\u0161ice for decision on an objection to the judges of the District Court.", "8. On 30 December 1994 the Regional Court excluded the judges of the District Court in Poprad and transferred the case to the District Court in Pre\u0161ov. The file was returned to the District Court in Poprad on 9 March 1995. The decision was served on the applicant on 20 March 1995. On 6 April 1995 the file was sent to the District Court in Pre\u0161ov where the case was registered under number P 81/95.", "9. On 12 July 1995 and 30 August 1995 the District Court asked the applicant\u2019s husband to inform it about persons who could act as the applicant\u2019s guardian. The mail was returned to the court with the explanation that the addressee was in hospital. On 19 September 1995 the Town Office in Poprad submitted information at the District Court\u2019s request of 30 August 1995.", "10. On 29 September 1995 the District Court asked the applicant\u2019s mother whether she was willing to act as her daughter\u2019s guardian. The mother replied in the negative.", "11.

On 18 October 1995 the applicant\u2019s brother refused to act as guardian.", "13. On 31 October 1995 the Town Office in Poprad informed the District Court that its employees were unable to identify a person willing to act as the applicant\u2019s guardian. On 14 and 16 November 1995 the applicant\u2019s sisters refused to assume that duty.", "14. At a hearing held on 4 December 1995 the Poprad Municipality proposed that its employee Mrs Ch. be appointed as the applicant\u2019s guardian. That person stated that the applicant had no confidence in her. The case was adjourned and the court asked the municipality to indicate an employee of the Town Office who would act as the applicant\u2019s guardian. On 18 December 1995 the Poprad Municipality again proposed that Mrs Ch. should be charged with that responsibility. In a letter of 15 January 1996 the applicant replied that she disagreed.", "15. On 29 January 1996 Mrs Ch. informed the court that she had been unable to find any person willing to assume the duty in question. The District Court decided that Mrs K., a person who had represented the town of Poprad at the previous hearing, should act as the guardian. Both Mrs K. and the applicant appealed in March 1996. On 1 April 1996 Mrs K.\u2019s appeal was sent to the District Prosecutor\u2019s Office.", "16. On 20 June 1996 the Regional Court in Ko\u0161ice quashed the District Court\u2019s decision of 29 January 1996.", "17.

On 5 September 1996 the District Court decided that the Town Office in Poprad should act as the applicant\u2019s guardian. The decision was served on the applicant, after several unsuccessful attempts, on 3 December 1996. On 11 December 1996 the applicant appealed.", "19. The file was sent to the Regional Court in Ko\u0161ice on 20 January 1997. On 13 March 1997 it was transmitted to the Regional Court in Pre\u0161ov, due to a change in the jurisdiction of the courts of appeal.", "20. On 21 March 1997 the Regional Court in Pre\u0161ov quashed the first-instance decision on the ground that the Town Office lacked legal capacity and therefore could not act as the applicant\u2019s guardian.", "21. On 6 May 1997 the District Court appointed the Poprad Municipality as the applicant\u2019s guardian in respect of all actions involving the applicant\u2019s relations with public authorities.", "22. On 10 July 1997 the applicant appealed. She also challenged the District Court judges.", "23. Between 17 July 1997 and 28 August 1997 the file was submitted to the Regional Court in Ko\u0161ice for consultation.", "24. On 24 September 1997 the file was submitted to the Regional Court in Pre\u0161ov for a decision on the applicant\u2019s appeal. The Regional Court returned the file to the first-instance court with the instruction that the District Court judge should first comment on the request for her exclusion and that a mistake in the decision of 6 May 1997 should be rectified.", "25. The District Court delivered a rectified decision on 24 October 1997. The court had difficulties in serving the rectified decision on the applicant, who received it on 8 December 1997.", "26. On 26 January 1998 the Regional Court in Pre\u0161ov upheld the decision on the appointment of a guardian and dismissed the applicant\u2019s request for the withdrawal of the first-instance court judge. The decision became final on 14 April 1998.", "27. On 21 October 1998 the Poprad Municipality proposed to the Pre\u0161ov District Court that legal capacity should be restored to the applicant.", "28. On 18 January 1999 the District Court appointed an expert with a view to assessing the applicant\u2019s health. On 22 January 1999 it asked a local authority to submit a report on the applicant.", "29. On 2 February 1999 the applicant challenged the expert, alleging that drugs had been forcibly administered to her in the hospital department where the expert worked. On 28 April 1999 the District Court appointed a different expert, who was requested to submit an opinion within sixty days.", "30. On 16 July 1999 the expert appointed by the court proposed that an expert in psychology should assist him. He also asked for an extension of the time-limit within which the opinion was to be submitted.", "31. After they had examined the applicant as an outpatient on 7 and 10 August 1999 the experts submitted an opinion to the District Court on 29 August 1999. It comprised twenty-three pages. According to the opinion, the applicant had been suffering from a chronic disorder resulting in a querulous type of paranoia for many years. She had no critical approach to the disorder and she remained persuaded that her actions were correct. The applicant understood judicial proceedings only within the frame of her mental disorder, in that she remained convinced that courts and other authorities were doing harm to her. The illness was of a lasting character and had developed in a slow and latent manner. It had advanced as compared with 1993, when the applicant\u2019s legal capacity had first been restricted. The experts did not recommend that the applicant be heard in person by a court or that judgments should be served on her, as she was unable to understand the scope of the proceedings and the judicial decisions correctly.", "32. On 9 November 1999 the Pre\u0161ov District Court heard the expert appointed and the representative of the authority acting as the applicant\u2019s guardian. The latter stated that the proposal to restore full legal capacity to the applicant had been submitted as she had appeared well balanced at that time. However, officials of the Poprad Municipality had encountered serious difficulties with the applicant during the subsequent period. The representative confirmed that the applicant had reacted in an inappropriate manner whenever authorities had failed to act in accordance with her wishes.", "33. The District Court also heard a guardian whom it had appointed to represent the applicant in the proceedings. The guardian did not propose restoring full legal capacity to the applicant as her health had not improved.", "34. Relying on the expert opinion the District Court decided not to hear the applicant. Reference was made to Article 187 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure.", "35. In its judgment of 9 November 1999 the District Court referred in detail to the applicant\u2019s situation and behaviour. With reference to the experts\u2019 conclusion it held that numerous abusive complaints, submissions and appeals which the applicant had made proved that her personality disorder persisted, resulting in her querulous behaviour. The court therefore decided not to restore full legal capacity to the applicant.", "36. As the applicant\u2019s mental disorder was chronic and since it could not be expected that her health would improve, the court decided that the applicant was not to be allowed to make a fresh request for full legal capacity to be restored to her for three years from the date of the judgment. Reference was made to Article 186 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure.", "37. Following the explicit recommendation of the experts, the District Court decided not to serve the judgment on the applicant. It became final on 11 December 1999.", "38. On 5 December 2000 the General Prosecutor lodged an extraordinary appeal on points of law on the applicant\u2019s behalf, in which he contested the decision that the applicant was not entitled to make a fresh claim concerning her legal capacity for three years. The General Prosecutor objected that the District Court had decided exclusively at the request of the applicant\u2019s guardian and that it had failed to decide on the applicant\u2019s requests seeking restoration of full legal capacity, which were included in the file.", "39. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal on points of law on 19 December 2000. It held that the first-instance court had considered all relevant facts, including the applicant\u2019s submissions.", "40. The applicant married Mr B. on 22 January 1977. Two children were born to the couple, in 1979 and 1981 respectively. The spouses were divorced at the applicant\u2019s petition on 1 July 1991.", "41.

On 4 May 1994 the applicant\u2019s husband informed the court that he had agreed to a divorce.", "45. On 26 May 1994 the file was submitted to the Regional Court in Ko\u0161ice as the judges of the District Court in Poprad considered themselves biased. On 9 June 1994 the Regional Court decided that the case was to be dealt with by the District Court in Pre\u0161ov. The file was transmitted to the latter court on 10 August 1994.", "46.

A guardian was appointed to represent the applicant in the divorce proceedings. The decision to stay the proceedings was served on that guardian on 21 June 1995.", "47. On 6 July 1995 the applicant appealed against the decision to stay the divorce proceedings. The file was transmitted to the Regional Court of Ko\u0161ice on 25 July 1995. On 22 December 1995 the Regional Court dismissed the appeal on the ground that the applicant lacked the standing to file it, as her legal capacity had been restricted on 14 April 1993.", "48. The judge made inquiries as regards the progress of proceedings no. P 81/95 on 3 May 1995, 5 June 1997, 3 March 1998 and 27 April 1998.", "49. On 15 May 1998 the District Court asked the Poprad Municipality to inform it, as the applicant\u2019s guardian, whether it was seeking determination of the applicant\u2019s petition for divorce. The court reiterated that request on 19 August 1998 and 17 November 1998. On 7 December 1998 the Poprad Municipality replied in the affirmative. On 19 January 1999 the Poprad Municipality submitted further documents and information at the court\u2019s request of 22 December 1998.", "50. On 25 January 1999 the Poprad Municipality proposed that the divorce proceedings should be stayed pending the determination of its proposal that full legal capacity be restored to the applicant, which had been made in October 1998.

The judge decided to wait for the outcome of the proceedings on the applicant\u2019s legal capacity, which were then pending before the court of appeal.", "58. As the Poprad District Court judges considered themselves biased, due to the applicant\u2019s past statements about them, the file was submitted to the Regional Court in Ko\u0161ice. On 30 June 1994 the Regional Court excluded the judges of the District Court in Poprad and transferred the case to the District Court in Pre\u0161ov. The file was transmitted to that court on 10 August 1994.", "59. On 6 June 1995 the proceedings were stayed pending the outcome of proceedings no. P 81/95, relating to the appointment of a guardian for the applicant.

The case was submitted to the Regional Court in Ko\u0161ice on 1 February 1996. On 12 February 1997, 4 April 1997 and 14 May 1997 the Regional Court asked the District Courts in Poprad and Pre\u0161ov for files concerning the applicant\u2019s legal capacity.

Article 10 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 entitles courts to restrict the legal capacity of individuals who, inter alia, are suffering from a lasting mental disorder and who are therefore capable of taking only certain legal actions. A restriction on a person\u2019s legal capacity or his or her deprivation thereof has to be cancelled or its scope modified when the underlying grounds change or fall away.", "108. Article 58 \u00a7 1 entitles courts to exempt a party from the obligation to respect a time-limit which that party has failed to respect for a justifiable reason. A request to that effect has to be made within fifteen days from the date the obstacle preventing the party from taking the relevant legal action has fallen away.", "109. Under Article 186 \u00a7 3, as in force at the relevant time, a person who was deprived of legal capacity could claim that it should be restored to him or her. However, where a court dismissed such a request and where it could not be expected that the condition of the person concerned would improve, courts were entitled to prevent that person from making a similar request for an appropriate period, the length of which could not exceed three years.", "110. With effect from 1 October 2004 Article 186 \u00a7 3 has been amended in that the period during which a person can be prevented from claiming restoration of his or her legal capacity was reduced to a maximum of one year.", "111. In a commentary on the above amendment the view was expressed that the original three-year period had been excessively long and capable of seriously affecting a person\u2019s human rights. In view of the progress of medical science, reduction of that period to a maximum of one year was considered appropriate (see Ob\u010diansky s\u00fadny poriadok, Nov\u00e1 pr\u00e1ca, spol. s r.o., 2006, p. 265).", "112. Article 187 \u00a7 2 provides that a court can refrain from hearing a person whose legal capacity is to be restricted where it is not possible to hear such a person at all or where a hearing would impair that person\u2019s health.", "113. Under Article 189 \u00a7 2, courts can refrain from serving a decision concerning a person\u2019s legal capacity where its service can have a negative impact on that person because of his or her mental disorder or where the person concerned is not capable of understanding the meaning of the decision."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "6", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
