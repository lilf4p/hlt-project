It stated, in particular, that specific administrative bodies had been designated by law to determine whether or not a person was entitled to a Chernobyl identity card, and that the courts were not competent to determine such issues. It further pointed out that decisions taken by such an administrative body could be appealed before the courts under the terms of Article 124 of the Constitution.
