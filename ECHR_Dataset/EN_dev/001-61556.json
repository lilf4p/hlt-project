The applicants, Volkan \u00dck\u00fcn\u00e7 and Deniz G\u00fcne\u015f, are Turkish nationals. They were both born in 1980 and live in Edirne, Turkey.", "10. On 8 February 1996 the applicants were taken into custody by the Edirne Anti-Terror Branch on suspicion of being members of an illegal organisation, namely, the DHKP-C (Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front). The applicants were kept in custody until 12 February 1996. They were interrogated by the police on 10 February 1996 in the absence of their lawyers.", "11. On 12 February 1996 the applicants were brought before the Public Prosecutor and then before a judge. On both occasions they repeated their statements of 10 February 1996. The applicants were released on the same day. They were not represented by lawyers.", "12. On 11 March 1996 the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed an indictment with the court and accused the applicants and three other co-accused of aiding and abetting an illegal terrorist organisation and requested the court to apply Article 169 of the Turkish Criminal Code and section 5 of Law No. 3713 (the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 as amended).", "13. On 17 April 1996 the Edirne Assize Court requested the applicants' observations on the charges against them for submission to the Istanbul State Security Court. According to the minutes of the hearing which took place before the Edirne Assize Court, the applicants did not want to be represented by lawyers. They challenged for the first time the authenticity of the statements which they gave to the police, to the public prosecutor and to the judge.", "14. On 21 May 1996 the applicants requested the Istanbul State Security Court not to require them to appear at any of the hearings since they had to attend school. This request was upheld by the court and the applicants were legally represented by four lawyers in their absence in subsequent hearings.", "15. On 8 April 1997 the Istanbul State Security Court found the applicants guilty of aiding and abetting the DHKP-C, and sentenced them to two years and six months' imprisonment. The court pointed out that the applicants' defence statement to the Edirne Assize Court alleging that they had been forced to repeat the prepared confession statements when brought before the public prosecutor and the judge on 12 February 1996 was unconvincing. The court concluded that the applicants aided and abetted the DHKP-C by painting a slogan on a wall, distributing publications supporting DHKP-C and putting up a placard in the entrance of a shop.", "16. The applicants appealed on the ground that they were convicted on the basis of the statements they had given under duress and that there was, therefore, no concrete evidence on which they could be convicted.", "17. On 9 December 1997 the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal lodged by the applicants and upheld the State Security Court's decision. The Cassation Court noted in its decision that the applicants' lawyers, despite having requested the Cassation Court to hold an appeal hearing, did not attend the hearing.", "18. In accordance with established practice, the judgment of the Court of Cassation of 9 December 1997 was sent to the Istanbul State Security Court and deposited with that court's Registry on 5 January 1998.", "19. The applicants claim that they became aware of the decision on 4 March 1998.", "20. On 9 March 1998 the applicants applied for rectification of the Court of Cassation's decision on the ground that the preliminary investigation was unlawful having been conducted without their lawyer being present and given that they were minors at the date of the offences. The applicants' rectification request was rejected on 22 May 1998.", "21. The Court refers to the overview of the domestic law derived from previous submissions in other cases, in particular \u00d6zel v. Turkey (no. 42739/98, \u00a7\u00a7 20-21, 7 November 2002) and Gen\u00e7el v. Turkey (no. 53431/99, \u00a7\u00a7 11-12, 23 October 2003)."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
