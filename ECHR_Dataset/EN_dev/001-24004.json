RUSSIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant, Mrs Galina Ivanovna Chernysheva, is a Russian national, who was born in 1961 and lives in Kaliningrad. The applicant is a journalist writing for the Citizen (\u00ab\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d\u00bb) newspaper published by the Kaliningrad town administration. The applicant is represented before the Court by Mr Yu. Shitikov, a lawyer practising in Kaliningrad. The respondent Government are represented by Mr P. Laptev, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "On 27 April 2000 the applicant published an article under the headline \u201cEvil Flat of Prosecutor Tkach\u201d (\u00ab\u041d\u0435\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0422\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0430\u00bb) in the Citizen. The article concerned a civil dispute between Mrs Tkach, the spouse of the prosecutor of the Moskovskiy district of Kaliningrad Mr Tkach, and Mr and Mrs Sh., her neighbours who lived in the attic, right above Mrs Tkach\u2019s flat. In 1998 Mrs Tkach and Mr T., another neighbour, had sued Mr and Mrs Sh. for an injunction to stop unauthorised construction works in the attic. The first-instance court had dismissed the suit. However, the applicant continued, the appeal court quashed the judgment in the part concerning the claims of Mrs Tkach, but not the claims of Mr T., notwithstanding the fact that their claims had been identical. The applicant alleged that this was only possible after Mr M., a colleague of Mr Tkach and prosecutor of the Tsentralniy district, intervened in the proceedings. In the article the applicant critically described the new hearing on Mrs Tkach\u2019s claims on 27 March 2000 and strongly disagreed with the court judgment made in favour of Mrs Tkach. The article implied that the parties to the dispute were not equal before the law precisely because the plaintiff\u2019s husband was a prosecutor.", "On 3 May 2000 the prosecutor Tkach filed an action against the applicant and the Citizen for the protection of his honour, dignity and professional reputation and compensation for non-pecuniary damage. The statement of claim was printed on the letterhead of the prosecutor\u2019s office of the Moskovskiy district of Kaliningrad and signed \u201cthe prosecutor of the Moskovskiy district, senior justice advisor, V.N. Tkach\u201d. It also bore the outgoing registration number of the prosecutor\u2019s office.", "Mr Tkach argued as follows:", "\u201c1. The said article puts a special emphasis on my actions, allegedly unworthy of a prosecutor; however, my professional activities and my position are in no way related to the essence of the judicial dispute in question: I was not a plaintiff in the dispute, [neither] as an individual nor as a prosecutor.", "...No journalist should be allowed to make [the living conditions] of a prosecutor the subject of a public discussion. No one has the right to invade my private life, I did not break the law living in my flat \u2013 neither as a prosecutor nor as an individual.\u201d", "Mr Tkach also submitted:", "\u201cIn accordance with Article 43 of the Federal Law on Prosecutors in the Russian Federation verification of information on a violation allegedly committed by a prosecutor shall be the exclusive competence of prosecutors\u2019 offices. This law applies to all citizens without exception, including journalists, who have no right to collect information on private lives of prosecutors and investigators and even more so to publish it in the media without consent of a prosecutor\u2019s hierarchical superior.\u201d", "Mr Tkach explained that the action against the neighbours had been lodged by his wife who was also the owner of the flat. He denied that he or his wife had ever wanted to improve their living conditions at the expense of their neighbours. On this ground he requested the court to declare that the following extracts from the applicant\u2019s article had damaged his honour and his professional reputation of a prosecutor:", "\u201c\u2018Every prosecutor has an evil flat of his own\u2019. These words are not mine. This is what people say. You can think anything you want. But in our case the issue is that Mr and Mrs Tkach are dissatisfied with their housing conditions. They want an improvement. At the expense of their neighbours, Mr and Mrs Sh.\u201d", "\u201cMake way! The prosecutors\u2019 couple comes.\u201d", "\u201cIn order to satisfy [the claim of] Mr and Mrs Tkach and grant them [the right to use a part of the attic]... the administration of the Tsentralniy district will apparently have to:", "- build a new entrance into the flat of Mr and Mrs Sh., which had already existed when they moved in;", "- brick in the two doors leading into their rooms and cover the resulting wall with stucco and wallpaper;", "- convert two separate rooms into one with the only one entrance-exit through the kitchen.\u201d", "\u201cP.S.

The statement of claim bore an outgoing registration number of the prosecutor\u2019s office. In the new version of the statement Mr Tkach referred to the results of an internal inquiry carried out by the prosecutor\u2019s office of the Kaliningrad Region on 6 July 2000 in connection with the applicant\u2019s article. According to Mr Tkach, the inquiry did not establish any violations or unethical behaviour on the part of Mr Tkach and found that the facts described in the articles were untrue. Mr Tkach submitted that the applicant had failed in her professional duty to publish only accurate information and abused her rights as a journalist because she had allegedly defamed him exclusively on the ground of his occupation, place of residence and professional position. Mr Tkach asked for compensation for non-pecuniary damage to be transferred to the bank account of the prosecutor\u2019s office of the Kaliningrad Region. As to the remainder, Mr Tkach repeated his initial claims, but he also added that the title of the article in question be declared untrue and damaging to his reputation.", "On 16 November 2000 the applicant published a new article under the title \u201cProsecutor Tkach and freedom of expression \u2013 4 (the story continues)\u201d (\u00ab\u041f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0440 \u0422\u043a\u0430\u0447 \u0438 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u2013 4 (\u044d\u043f\u043e\u043f\u0435\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f)\u00bb). The article related once again the story about the civil action brought by Mrs Tkach against her neighbours and alleged that only Mr Tkach\u2019s intervention in his professional capacity had secured an award in favour of his spouse. The article also criticised Mr Chulkov\u2019s decision to issue an official power of attorney to Mr Tkach for the protection of the latter\u2019s personal interests.", "On 4 December 2000 Mr Tkach filed a new action against the applicant and her newspaper. The statement of claim was drafted on plain paper and contained no reference to Mr Tkach\u2019s position or professional affiliation.

The applicant submitted that Mr Tkach\u2019s statement \u201cNo journalist should be allowed to make [the living conditions] of a prosecutor the subject of a public discussion\u201d had violated her right to freedom of expression and claimed compensation for non-pecuniary damage.", "On 24 January 2001 Mr Tkach asked the court to leave the statements of claim lodged on behalf of the prosecutor\u2019s office without examination because he had already brought identical claims on his own behalf.", "On 26 January 2001 the Tsentralniy District Court of Kaliningrad, by an interim decision (\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435), granted Mr Tkach\u2019s request.

It scrutinised the judgments made in the civil action lodged by Mrs Tkach and the results of the inquiry of the prosecutor\u2019s office (of 6 July 2000) and came to the conclusion that the facts related in the article were untrue. The court found no evidence that Mr Tkach, in his professional capacity, had exercised any undue influence on the courts. The court held:", "\u201cTherefore, having examined the evidence and assessed the contents of the article as a whole, including its title \u2018Evil Flat of Prosecutor Tkach\u2019, and having regard to the fact how a reasonable member of the society would perceive this message, the court comes to the conclusion that the author\u2019s account of the essence of the civil dispute and the author\u2019s expressed opinion do not reflect the actual situation.", "The word sequences and semantic units in the text, designated by the plaintiff V.N.Tkach, fall within the ambit of the concept of \u2018untrue information\u2019. The substantial and semantic contents of the texts in question also infringe the legally protected rights and interests of the plaintiff, in particular, his professional reputation.", "Under these circumstances the court considers that the claims lodged by Mr Tkach shall be granted.\u201d", "The court pointed out that the principle of equality of arms would prevent a prosecutor from resorting in the civil proceedings to the special powers conferred on the prosecutor\u2019s office. For this reason the court approved Mr Tkach\u2019s decision to withdraw the four actions which he had lodged on behalf of the prosecutor\u2019s office.", "The court also accepted the applicant\u2019s counterclaim and held that Mr Tkach\u2019s statement challenged by the applicant encroached on the applicant\u2019s protected journalistic rights.", "The court did not award compensation for non-pecuniary damage to either party.", "On 2 March 2001 the applicant appealed against the judgment.

In substance, the court followed the reasoning of the judgment of 19 February 2001. The court noted that the judgment made by the district court on Mrs Tkach\u2019s claim had been subsequently upheld by the Kaliningrad Regional Court on 7 July 2000 and also scrutinised by the prosecutor in charge of supervision over the lawfulness of court decisions in civil cases who reported on 4 July 2000 that no violation had taken place. The Kaliningrad Regional prosecutor\u2019s office and the Presidium of the Kaliningrad Regional Court refused to lodge applications for supervisory review as no breaches were found and a request for review was therefore unsubstantiated. The court observed that Mr Tkach\u2019s official position was in no way related to the substance of the civil dispute in question; he was not a plaintiff or a party to the dispute and there were no evidence that he had exercised pressure on the court. Moreover, the first deputy mayor of Kaliningrad and the head of the Tsentralniy district administration confirmed that neither Mr Tkach nor his spouse had ever applied for permission to reconstruct their flat or otherwise improve their living conditions at the expense of neighbours Sh. On the other hand, the court had regard to the overwhelming evidence showing that neighbours Sh. maintained the attic in a dilapidated state, flooded Mrs Tkach\u2019s flat and refused access to the attic to housing maintenance workers.", "The court held that the information in the articles of 27 April and 16 November 2000 was untrue and damaging to the plaintiff\u2019s honour and professional reputation and caused him non-pecuniary damage. It awarded Mr Tkach RUR 3,000 (EUR 114) payable jointly by the applicant and her newspaper.", "Having examined the applicant\u2019s counterclaim against Mr Tkach, the court found that the statement of claim of 3 May 2000 had been indeed submitted on the prosecutor\u2019s office stationary, yet it did not specifically mention that the claim had been lodged in the State or public interests. The court held that the contested statement should be interpreted as a private person\u2019s position rather than as a prosecutor\u2019s injunction. An application to a court for the protection of one\u2019s rights containing arguments in support of the plaintiff\u2019s cause cannot be held to infringe rights of others. Moreover, the court had regard to the decision of the district court of 26 January 2001 whereby the contested statement of claim had been left without examination. The applicant\u2019s counterclaim was therefore dismissed.", "The court noted in the judgment that the representatives of the applicant, Messrs Stepanov and Zinovyev, did not attend after a break, on the second day of the hearing, despite having been duly informed of the time and place of the hearing agreed between the parties. The court observed that they failed to show any valid reasons for their absence, the documents on the file were sufficient for examination of the merits and that the other party did not object to continuing the examination in their absence.", "On 30 August 2001 the applicant appealed against the judgment. In her appeal the applicant submitted, in particular, that the judgment had been given without her or her representatives being present. She explained that the hearing had begun on Thursday, 23 August. At 5.45 p.m. the judge had announced a break. The applicant alleged that she had not been informed when the hearing would resume. On Monday, 27 August, the applicant\u2019s representative arrived at the courtroom only to find that the judgment had been delivered on 24 August. In her appeal the applicant also challenged the merits of the judgment.", "On 10 October 2001 the Kaliningrad Regional Court upheld in substance the judgment of 24 August 2001. However, the court reduced the amount of the award to RUR 250 (EUR 9) for the applicant and to RUR 500 (EUR 18) for the Citizen. The court reasoned its decision to reduce the award as follows:", "\u201c... the extent of the applicants\u2019 liability for dissemination of untrue information is insignificant because the judicial dispute with Mr and Mrs Sh. concerning the attic had indeed taken place, and the dissemination of damaging and inaccurate information is a result of incorrect, erroneous evaluation of the circumstances of that dispute.\u201d", "The court also found that the applicant and her representative had been duly notified that the hearing would resume at 10.30 a.m. on 24 August and their consent had been noted in the transcript of the hearing on 23 August.", "On 1 November 2001 and 6 February 2002 Mr Tkach sent a request to the Head of the Town Council (\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432) to impose a disciplinary sanction on the editor-in-chief of the Citizen and the applicant herself with a view of their future dismissal.

They submitted that at the oral hearing on 23 August 2001 in the Tsentralniy District Court of Kaliningrad and in his written submissions to that court Mr Tkach referred to them as \u201cslanderers\u201d who \u201cbadgered\u201d him by publishing \u201cravings\u201d about a non-existent problem and wrote letters to the authorities insisting that the applicant and the editor be dismissed.", "On 17 April 2002 the Tsentralniy District Court of Kaliningrad granted the defamation action lodged by the applicant and her colleagues and ordered Mr Tkach to pay RUR 250 (EUR 9) to each of the applicant and Mr Stepanov. On 5 June 2002 the Kaliningrad Regional Court upheld, on Mr Tkach\u2019s appeal, the judgment of 17 April 2002. On 25 November 2002 the Presidium of the Kaliningrad Regional Court refused the application for supervisory review lodged by the acting prosecutor of the Kaliningrad Region against the judgment of 17 April 2002.", "On 12 November 2002 the Tsentralniy District Court of Kaliningrad granted yet another defamation action lodged by the applicant against Mr Tkach in connection with the letters which Mr Tkach had sent to the Mayor of Kaliningrad and to the Head of the Town Council. In these letters Mr Tkach requested that the municipal officials stop the publication of \u201cslanderous\u201d articles in the newspaper owned by the town administration. The court ordered Mr Tkach to pay RUR 250 to the applicant.", "Article 29 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation guarantees freedom of ideas and expression, as well as freedom of mass media.", "Article 152 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation provides that an individual may seize a court with a request for refutation of information (\u0441\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f) damaging his or her honour, dignity or professional reputation unless the person who disseminated such information proves its accuracy.
