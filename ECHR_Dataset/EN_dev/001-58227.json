In 1929 K.N. inherited three-quarters of a tract of land known as the \u201cKarras estate\u201d from his adoptive father. In 1938 K.N.\u2019s adoptive mother sold him the remaining quarter of the \u201cKarras estate\u201d, which she had inherited from her husband. The contract of sale gave the surface area of the \u201cKarras estate\u201d as 12,000,000 sq. m.", "7. In 1950, having obtained the necessary permit from the authorities, K.N. built an open-air cinema \u2013 the \u201cIlioupolis\u201d cinema \u2013 on part of this land.", "8. In 1953 the Minister of Agriculture refused to recognise K.N. as owner of the whole \u201cKarras estate\u201d, taking the view that K.N.\u2019s adoptive father had owned only part of the land, namely an area of between 320,000 and 520,000 sq. m, which did not include the part on which the \u201cIlioupolis\u201d cinema had later been built. The rest of the area was public forest and was not included in the title deeds submitted by K.N. Thereupon K.N applied to the Supreme Administrative Court to set aside the decision of the Minister of Agriculture but his application was dismissed. On 8 February 1955 a royal decree designated the area in dispute as land to be reafforested. K.N. applied to the Supreme Administrative Court to set aside the royal decree but the court dismissed the application, holding that the disputed area was forest land belonging to the State.", "9. By means of Cabinet decisions of 10 February 1965 and 11 March 1966, which were published in the Official Gazette (E\u03c6\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u039a\u03c5\u03b2\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2) and entered in the Ilioupolis municipal register, the State transferred a 220,000 sq. m area of the \u201cKarras estate\u201d to the Police Officers\u2019 Housing Cooperative. This area did not include the land on which the \u201cIlioupolis\u201d cinema had been built.", "10. On 28 July 1965 a royal decree ordering the reafforestation of land in Ilioupolis was promulgated. According to the Government, this decree covered an unspecified part of the \u201cKarras estate\u201d. On 2 December 1966 the decree was amended by a further decree, which was published in the Official Gazette.", "11. On 3 April 1967 K.N. brought an action against the Police Officers\u2019 Housing Cooperative to establish his title to the land which had been transferred to it. The State, as transferor, intervened in the proceedings in favour of the Cooperative. This action was entered in the Ilioupolis mortgage register. In the margin of the relevant page, the subsequent judgments of the Athens Court of First Instance (no. 16992/1973) and the Court of Appeal (no. 4910/1977 \u2013 see paragraph 13 below) dismissing the action and acknowledging the State\u2019s ownership of the disputed area were noted.", "12. In 1976 K.N. died and his heirs received an inheritance-tax demand in respect of the land on which the cinema had been built. The State took a mortgage on the land as security for the tax debt. The mortgage was paid off in 1982.", "13. K.N.\u2019s heirs continued the proceedings brought on 3 April 1967. On 21 June 1977 the Athens Court of Appeal held that the tract of land transferred to the Police Cooperative belonged to the State. In the reasons for its judgment the court agreed with the Minister of Agriculture, holding that K.N.\u2019s adoptive father had owned only a part of the \u201cKarras estate\u201d, which had not included the part on which the \u201cIlioupolis\u201d cinema had been built or the part which had been transferred to the Cooperative. The Court of Appeal based this conclusion on, inter alia, the fact that in 1905 the \u201cKarras estate\u201d had been entered in the national forest register as forest land and that the State had since, in good faith, had possession and use of it as owner.", "14. Following a decision taken by the Deputy Minister of Finance on 19 September 1984, part of the \u201cKarras estate\u201d, including the part on which the cinema had been built, was entered in the register of State property on 27 June 1985. On 9 July 1985 this fact was noted in the Ilioupolis mortgage register. In 1987 K.N.\u2019s heirs brought proceedings to establish their title to the land that had been entered in the register of State property. In 1988 the Athens Court of First Instance dismissed their application on the ground that on 21 June 1977 the Athens Court of Appeal had held that K.N.\u2019s adoptive father had owned only a part of the \u201cKarras estate\u201d, covering an area of between 320,000 and 520,000 sq. m. K.N.\u2019s heirs appealed against that decision.", "15. On 9 February 1989 the Athens Court of Appeal held that in its judgment of 21 June 1977 it had resolved only the matter of ownership of the 220,000 sq. m which had been transferred to the Police Officers\u2019 Housing Cooperative. The other dicta in the grounds of the judgment were not binding on K.N.\u2019s heirs. The Court of Appeal consequently set aside the 1988 decision of the Court of First Instance and ordered that court to deal with the merits of the case.", "16. On 29 May 1996 K.N.\u2019s heirs applied to State Counsel at the Athens Court of First Instance for interim measures against the State and Ilioupolis Town Council. State Counsel refused their application on an unspecified date. K.N.\u2019s heirs appealed against this decision. On 30 May 1997 Deputy State Counsel at the Athens Court of Appeal dismissed their appeal.", "17. In 1978 K.N.\u2019s heirs leased the \u201cIlioupolis\u201d open-air cinema to the applicant, who completely restored it.", "On 4 July 1985 the Attica prefecture informed the applicant that with effect from 27 June 1985 the land on which the cinema had been built was considered to be State property, and that his retention of it was wrongful. The State would consequently be claiming compensation from him in accordance with Article 115 of the Presidential Decree of 11/12 November 1929, without prejudice to its right to evict him under Law no. 1539/1938 on the protection of State land.", "On 16 November 1988 the State Lands Authority (K\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03c5) assigned the cinema to Ilioupolis Town Council. On 24 November 1988 the Attica prefecture notified the applicant of this and ordered him to vacate the cinema within five days, failing which Law no. 1539/1938 would be applied.", "18. On 9 February 1989 the Lands Department (K\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a5\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03af\u03b1) of the Attica prefecture ordered the applicant to be evicted, under Law no. 1539/1938 as amended by Law no. 263/1968. The order was \u201cserved\u201d on the applicant on 16 March 1989 by being posted on the door of the cinema. The following day, when the members of the Bar were on strike and the applicant was absent, officials from Ilioupolis Town Council executed the order, forcing an entry into the cinema. An inventory was drawn up of a number of items of movable property belonging to the applicant (projectors, chairs, billboards and bar equipment). A Mr G.L., who was professionally connected with the applicant but was not acting as his representative, signed the inventory and asked the Council officials to store the goods.", "19. The applicant challenged the eviction order in the Athens District Court, which dealt with the matter under summary procedure and found for the State. The applicant appealed to the Athens Court of First Instance sitting with a single judge, which on 23 October 1989, having heard the appeal under summary procedure, quashed the eviction order. The court ruled that the Lands Department could issue an eviction order only if the property in question belonged to the State, if the State\u2019s title to the property was not in dispute, and if the property was being unjustifiably occupied by a third party.", "The court held, further, that these conditions had not been satisfied in the case before it, since the applicant had established the following facts with a fair degree of certainty: proceedings were pending before the courts in an action brought in a dispute between K.N.\u2019s heirs and the State over the land on which the cinema had been built; K.N.\u2019s heirs had considered themselves to be the owners of the land and the cinema for a very long time and had exercised all the rights and performed all the duties associated with ownership; and, lastly, the applicant had occupied the cinema under a lease since 1978.", "20. Following that decision, the applicant made several approaches to the appropriate authorities to challenge the continued occupation of the cinema by Ilioupolis Town Council. On 2 April 1990 the Ministry of Finance stated that, since the eviction order had been quashed, the land should be returned to the applicant and the assignment of the cinema to Ilioupolis Town Council revoked. However, if the Council insisted on retaining the cinema, the matter of who was to compensate the applicant would have to be determined in accordance with the law on business tenancies.", "21. On 11 July 1991 the State Legal Council (N\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039a\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2), in answer to a question put to it by the Ministry of Finance, expressed the view that the cinema had to be returned to the applicant. The applicant\u2019s claims in respect of the loss he had sustained owing to the eviction could be entertained only if he applied to the State Legal Council or brought proceedings. Furthermore, the State could assert its claim to be the owner of the land by bringing an action against K.N.\u2019s heirs or by expediting the proceedings in the litigation between it and them, which had been pending before the courts since 1987.", "On 15 May 1994 the applicant applied to the State Lands Authority to have the cinema returned to him.", "22. On 21 December 1994 the applicant sued the State and Ilioupolis Town Council in tort in the Athens Administrative Court for the loss he had sustained as a result of the failure to return the cinema to him. He claimed compensation in the amount of 32,300,000 drachmas (GRD), plus interest for loss of income from 1989 to 1994 and for the loss of his business equipment.", "23. On 5 April 1995 the applicant applied to the mayor of Ilioupolis to have the cinema returned to him. On 5 May 1995 he lodged a criminal complaint against the mayor. On an unspecified date he also lodged a criminal complaint against the chairman of the State Lands Authority.", "24. On 26 July 1995 the applicant filed an application in the Athens Court of First Instance for registration of a mortgage against Ilioupolis Town Council as security for lost income amounting to GRD 30,000,000. The court dismissed the application on the ground that there was no obligation to return the property, seeing that no application to that end had been made to the court and that there had been no final court decision in the matter.", "25. On 31 July 1995 the State Lands Authority, following a further request from the applicant, recommended that the assignment of the cinema to Ilioupolis Town Council should be revoked and the cinema returned to the applicant, who was to be reinstated as tenant by the Ministry of Finance. That recommendation had to be approved by the Ministry of Finance pursuant to Law no. 973/1979.", "The applicant, who had not been notified of the recommendation, applied to the Minister of Finance on 4 October 1995. On 13 October 1995 he asked the Athens Court of First Instance to order interim measures against the mayor of Ilioupolis in the tort proceedings. On 16 October 1995 he applied to the Minister of Finance again.", "On 25 October 1995 the Court of First Instance held that there were no grounds for ordering interim measures, since there could be no liability on the part of the mayor. On 7 November 1995, following the intervention of State Counsel, the applicant was notified of the State Lands Authority\u2019s decision of 31 July 1995. On 15 November 1995 the applicant requested the Deputy Minister of Finance to approve that decision.", "26. On 7 August 1996 the State Legal Council expressed the view that the cinema should not be returned to the applicant, for the following reasons. Although the Athens Court of First Instance had set aside the eviction order of 23 October 1989, it had not ordered the cinema to be returned to the applicant. In its decision of 25 October 1995 the Court of First Instance had held that there was no obligation to return the cinema. Furthermore, under special case-law relating to State-owned property, the lease between K.N.\u2019s heirs and the applicant was not valid. Consequently, the Ministry of Finance would be acting unlawfully if it revoked the assignment of the cinema to Ilioupolis Town Council. On 3 September 1996 the Deputy Minister of Finance approved the opinion of the State Legal Council.", "27. On 31 October 1996 the Athens Administrative Court dismissed the action commenced by the applicant on 21 December 1994 on the ground that it should have been brought in the civil courts.", "On 17 December 1996 the applicant brought the action in the Athens Court of First Instance, seeking GRD 140,000,000 in damages for the loss of income he had suffered in 1995 and 1996 as a result of being unable to operate his cinema and for non-pecuniary loss. The action was due to be tried on 13 November 1997 but it was still pending on the day of the hearing before the Court.", "28. On 7 January 1997 the Committals Division of the Athens Criminal Court decided to commence criminal proceedings against the mayor of Ilioupolis for dereliction of duty.", "29. On 27 January 1998 the applicant brought an action against the State and Ilioupolis Town Council in which he sought payment of GRD 32,000,000 plus interest for loss of income during 1997 and for non-pecuniary damage. This action was still pending on the day of the hearing before the Court.", "30. The cinema is still being operated by Ilioupolis Town Council and has not been returned to the applicant.", "The applicant has not set up an open-air cinema anywhere else.", "31. The immovable property of the State is protected against third parties by Law no. 263/1968 amending and supplementing the provisions on State property.", "Section 2(2) and (3) of the Law provides:", "\u201c\u2026 The relevant tax inspector shall issue an administrative eviction order against any person wrongfully taking over public property. An application to set aside such an order may be filed with the appropriate District Court within thirty days of its being served \u2026 An appeal against the decision of the District Court may be brought within thirty days before the President of the Court of First Instance, who shall hear it under the special procedure provided for in Article 634 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

Where an administrative eviction order is quashed and it is desired that the decision make provision for the reinstatement of the evicted appellant, an application for reinstatement must be lodged either at the same time as the application to set aside \u2013 in which case a consequential order will be made if the application is allowed \u2013 or separately with the appropriate court (action for regulation of possession). An application for reinstatement is not subject to the time-limits laid down by section 2 of Law no. 263/1968 for applying to set aside an eviction order, since there is no provision to that effect (Athens Court of Appeal judgment no. 6802/89, Reports 1990, pp. 778-79, Athens Court of First Instance judgment no. 25950/1995, State Legal Council opinion no. 464/96, Annexes 14a and b and 13c).", "33.
