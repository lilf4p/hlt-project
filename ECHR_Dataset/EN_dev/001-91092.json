The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Oxford.", "6. His wife died on 12 October 1996 leaving dependent children. His claim for widows\u2019 benefits was made in March 2001 and on 2 May 2001 it was determined that he was entitled to Widowed Parent\u2019s Allowance as from 10 April 2001. The applicant however requested that the claim be treated as from the date of his wife\u2019s death, or alternatively that he be allowed to claim the equivalent widow\u2019s benefit. On 22 October he made a formal application for widow\u2019s benefit which was rejected on 27 February 2002 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows\u2019 benefits because he was not a woman. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under United Kingdom law.", "7.
