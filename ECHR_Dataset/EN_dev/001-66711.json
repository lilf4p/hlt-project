The respondent Government were represented by Ms S. Jaczewska, Acting Government Agent, and subsequently by Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz, Agent.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "On 22 February 1995 W.P., M.M. and H.M. informed the Kalisz Regional Office (Urz\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki) that they had decided to form an ordinary association (stowarzyszenie zwyk\u0142e) called the Association of Persecuted Functionaries of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Stowarzyszenie Represjonowanych Funkcjonariuszy Resortu Spraw Wewn\u0119trznych).

Identification of a phenomenon of persecution, repression, harassment and discrimination in the Ministry of Internal Affairs.", "3.

He submitted that its name was misleading as it suggested that persecution was taking place in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Poland was governed by the rule of law and since 1989 numerous regulations had been introduced to protect the rights of police officers. Finally, the Governor agreed with the opinion of the Kalisz Regional Police Commissioner (Komendant Wojew\u00f3dzki Policji) that the association\u2019s name defamed the Ministry of Internal Affairs.", "On 19 September 1995 the Kalisz Regional Court allowed the application and prohibited the formation of the association. It considered that the applicants had not complied with section 45 of the Associations Act 1989, which required them to agree with the Minister of Internal Affairs the association\u2019s objectives concerning the protection of public order.", "The applicants appealed to the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) but on 20 February 1997 it dismissed their appeal. The appellate court agreed with the Regional Court\u2019s conclusion that the applicants had breached section 45 of the Associations Act since they had not agreed with the Minister of Internal Affairs the association\u2019s objectives concerning the protection of public order. In addition, the association\u2019s name suggested the existence of persecution in the Ministry of Internal Affairs and therefore defamed a public institution.", "On 25 June 1996 W.P., M.M., H.M., J.F. and D.F. informed the Kalisz Regional Office that they had decided to form an ordinary association called the National and Patriotic Association of Persecuted Police Officers and Teachers (Stowarzyszenie Narodowo-Patriotyczne Represjonowanych Policjant\u00f3w i Nauczycieli).", "On 10 July 1996 the Kalisz Governor applied to the Kalisz Regional Court for a decision prohibiting the formation of the association.", "On 9 October 1996 the applicants requested that the proceedings be conducted by a judge who had in the past been persecuted by the authorities.", "On 15 October 1996 the Kalisz Regional Court held a hearing. The applicants failed to attend it despite the fact that they had been served with summonses. The court asked the applicants to clarify whether their request of 9 October 1996 had been filed in order to challenge the presiding judge for bias.", "On 20 October 1996 the applicants repeated their request of 9 October 1996.", "On 14 April 1997 the Regional Court dismissed the requests lodged on 9 and 20 October 1997.", "The court scheduled a hearing for 25 April 1997. The applicants submitted that as a result of \u201cJewish and Bolshevik reforms\u201d they could not afford to attend the hearing.", "On 29 April 1997 the applicants asked the Regional Court \u201cto serve them with a reasoned decision taken by the court on 25 April 1997\u201d.", "On 30 April 1997 the Kalisz Regional Court gave a decision prohibiting the formation of the association.", "On 30 March 1998 the Regional Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 request of 29 April 1997. It pointed out that they had requested a copy of a non-existent decision, as the court had prohibited the formation of the association by a decision taken on 30 April 1997. Moreover, the applicants had failed to lodge a request for a reasoned decision within one week after that date, i.e. within the time allowed by the Code of Civil Procedure.", "On 20 April 1998 the applicants received a copy of the Regional Court\u2019s decision of 30 April 1997 prohibiting the formation of the association.", "On 27 April 1998 the applicants challenged the decision of 30 March 1998 and on 4 May 1998 they appealed against the decision of 30 April 1997. However, their application of 27 April 1998 was dismissed on 3 September 1998.", "On 20 January 1998 W.P., K.K., M.M., H.M., J.F. and D.F. informed the Kalisz Regional Office that they had decided to form an ordinary association called the National and Patriotic Association of Polish Victims of Bolshevism and Zionism (Stowarzyszenie Narodowo-Patriotyczne Polak\u00f3w Poszkodowanych przez Bolszewizm i Syjonizm).

The court considered that the memorandum of association did not comply with the law. The applicants intended to form an ordinary association which did not have legal personality. Only point 1 of the memorandum setting out the association\u2019s objectives could be approved. The remaining objectives were either unlawful or unrealistic and could not be pursued by an ordinary association. In particular, points 2, 3, and 4 referred to objectives already realised by other institutions. Point 6 introduced a notion of inequality between citizens which did not exist. Moreover, point 8 amounted to defamation of judges and prosecutors.", "The applicants appealed to the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Court of Appeal but on 24 July 1998 it dismissed their appeal.", "Article 12 of the Constitution, which was adopted by the National Assembly on 2 April 1997 and entered into force on 17 October 1997, states:", "\u201cThe Republic of Poland shall ensure freedom for the creation and functioning of trade unions, socio-occupational farmers\u2019 organisations, societies, citizens\u2019 movements, other voluntary associations and foundations.\u201d", "Article 13 reads:", "\u201cPolitical parties and other organisations whose programmes are based upon totalitarian methods or the models of nazism, fascism or communism, or whose programmes or activities foster racial or national hatred, recourse to violence for the purposes of obtaining power or to influence State policy, or which provide for their structure or membership to be secret, shall be forbidden.\u201d", "Section 1 of the Associations Act, in so far as relevant, reads:", "\u201c1.
