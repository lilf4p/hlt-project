He ran for parliament in 1990 and in several later elections, unsuccessfully. Apparently he was also a presidential candidate in later elections on that party\u2019s ballot.", "10. At a meeting held on 10 November 1996 in Varna the applicant and fortynine other persons formed a party named Communist Party of Bulgaria (\u201e\u041a\u043e\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f\u201c). They adopted its constitution and elected its management organs. The applicant was elected the party\u2019s chairman. The party\u2019s aims, set out in the preamble to its constitution, were as follows:", "\u201c...", "The main aim of the Communist Party shall be the revolutionary change of the Bulgarian society \u2013 democratisation of the society as a road to true power of the people. The primary goal of the party shall be the practical improvement of the socialist democracy \u2013 broadening of the direct participation of the people in the government of the state; economic freedom of the enterprises within the framework of an economy changed and armed with the new philosophy of central planning; active shift towards selfgovernment of the municipalities and the economic units as a transition towards selfgoverning communities within a society of social homogeneity.", "...", "The Communist Party is convinced of the need for the union of the political parties, movements and eminent personalities into one political coalition \u2013 \u2018Union for National Cooperation \u2018Civic Forum\u2019\u2019, as the most proper way out of the societal antagonisms and divisions.", "...", "The Party shall advocate a policy of rapprochement between peoples which are at different sociopolitical stages of development; of deepening of the economic, political and cultural ties between them. The Communist Party\u2019s ultimate aim is the \u2018constant improvement of society\u2019.", "The Communist Party is a party of a new type. It shall struggle for political power and shall work dedicatedly for the triumph of the communist ideal \u2013 building of a civil society with the economic nature of a society ruled by the principles of scientific socialism and the political nature of a society free of class divisions, political parties and movements: a society in which the vehicle of development shall be the Man \u2013 a universally developed and harmonious personality.\u201d", "11. Articles 1 \u2013 8 of the party\u2019s constitution dealt with membership in the party and the members\u2019 rights and obligations. Article 8 set out, inter alia, the grounds for expelling members.", "12. Articles 9 \u2013 26 of the constitution set out the organisational structure of the party and the powers of its organs.", "13. Article 28 of the constitution, which described the party\u2019s symbols, stated, inter alia, that they stood for the \u201cidea of a revolutionary sociopolitical order\u201d.", "14. On 3 December 1996 the applicant, in his capacity of chairman of the party, applied to the Sofia City Court to have it registered.", "15. The court held a hearing on 18 December 1996. It noted that the manner of liquidation of the party had not been provided for in its constitution, that the declarations submitted by the founders were incomplete, and that there were certain other irregularities. Accordingly, it adjourned the case for 26 February 1997 with a view to allowing the party to remedy the deficiencies it had spotted.", "16. In order to rectify the deficiencies noted by the court, the applicant and the other founders held another meeting on 26 January 1997 and decided to amend the party\u2019s constitution. On 17 February 1997 they submitted the amendments and updated declarations to the court, which admitted them in evidence.", "17. A second hearing took place on 26 February 1997.", "18. In a decision of 6 March 1997 the Sofia City Court refused to register the party, holding:", "\u201cIn the course of the proceedings the court found that the applicants have failed to comply with the requirements of sections 7, 8 and 9(2) of the Political Parties Act [of 1990], in order to make the entering of the party in the register possible. [The case-file contains] minutes from the general meeting of the [party] held on 26 January 1997, which are not duly signed. The introduction to the party\u2019s constitution contains aims which are identical to the aims of other, already registered parties. The party\u2019s structure is not fully and clearly set out [in its constitution]; the powers of its different organs are not clearly described, are repeated in the different provisions of the party\u2019s constitution and thus the powers [of the party\u2019s organs] are not clearly spelled out. The party\u2019s constitution does not specify the manner of termination of membership in the party.\u201d", "19. On 14 March 1997 the applicant appealed to a threemember panel of the Supreme Court.", "20. The court held a hearing on 4 June 1997.", "21. On 9 June 1997 the threemember panel of the Supreme Court upheld the lower court\u2019s decision. It opined:", "\u201cThe name of the Communist Party of Bulgaria formally does not already exist in the register [of political parties], but it does not set it apart from an already registered party \u2013 [the Bulgarian Communist Party], as required by section 8(1) of the [Political Parties Act of 1990], because in fact it contains the same words; their rearranging does not change the purport and the essence of the political party. This name does not individualise it and does not clearly set it apart from another, already registered party.", "[The party\u2019s] aims, as indicated in part I of its constitution ... are contrary to section 3(2) of the [Political Parties Act of 1990].", "The manner of termination of membership in the party is not set out [in its constitution], contrary to section 8(1) of the [Political Parties Act of 1990].\u201d", "22. On 1 August 1997 the applicant lodged a petition for review with a fivemember panel of the Supreme Court.", "23. A hearing was held on 4 March 1998.", "24. In a final decision of 19 March 1998 the fivemember panel of the Supreme Court dismissed the petition in the following terms:", "\u201cThe impugned decisions should not be quashed first and foremost because the name of the party \u2013 Communist Party of Bulgaria \u2013 does not set it apart from other parties, in violation of section 8(1) of the [Political Parties Act of 1990], as correctly found by the two courts below. The name is an individualising feature of the party and for that reason it should not duplicate [the names of] other parties, organisations and movements, which may ... engage in political activities. The rule of section 8(1) of the [Political Parties Act of 1990] concerning the party\u2019s name sets the bounds of the founders\u2019 autonomy and initiative in choosing the name. [The founders] must see to it that from a grammatical and a logical point of view there is no duplication of the purport and the essence [of the name] with the name of another party.", "In the case at hand the separate words which constitute the party\u2019s name, on the one hand, and the particular wording used, on the other, although not identical to those used in other existing parties\u2019 names, convey a similar meaning. The name \u201cCommunist Party of Bulgaria\u201d uses the ideological term \u201ccommunist\u201d, which term, viewed in a historical context, resembles a party from the not so distant past \u2013 the Bulgarian Communist Party \u2013 and also resembles the Bulgarian Communist Party ... even though there is a rearrangement of the words...", "Regarding the contents of the party\u2019s constitution, as required by section 8(1) of the [Political Parties Act of 1990], the courts [below] have correctly found that the constitution does not indicate the manner of termination of membership in the party. [The constitution sets forth] rules about the admission [of new members], about the members\u2019 rights and the obligations and the [penalties which may be imposed on them], but there are no rules regarding the termination of the membership. Likewise, the powers of the [party\u2019s] organs and its organisational structure are chaotically scattered throughout its constitution.", "The [courts below] have correctly found that the aims of the party are contrary to section 3(2) of the [Political Parties Act of 1990]. Part I of the constitution indicates that the main aim of the party [is] the \u2018revolutionary change of Bulgarian society\u2019 and the support for the idea of a revolutionary sociopolitical order \u2013 part V of the constitution.\u201d", "25.
