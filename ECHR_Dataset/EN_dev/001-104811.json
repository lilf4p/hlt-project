GREECE", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Flogaitis;George Nicolaou;Julia Laffranque;Khanlar Hajiyev;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen;Spyridon Flogaitis", "TEXT": ["The applicants, Mr Ioannis Anastassakos, Mr Spyridon Zavitsanos and Mr Stavros Leoussis are Greek nationals who were born in 1955, 1957 and 1944 respectively. They live in Athens. They are represented before the Court by Mr N. Alivizatos and Mr Y. Ktistakis, both lawyers practising in Athens. The Greek Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) are represented by their Agent, Mr M. Apessos, Senior Adviser at the State Legal Council, Mrs U. Patsopoulou, Adviser at the State Legal Council and Mrs S. Trekli, Legal Assistant at the State Legal Council.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "The applicants have a direct or indirect involvement in the operation of AGB, a company under Greek law, which specialises in providing television audience measurement services. In particular, the first applicant was the first managing director of AGB, currently holds 5% of that company\u2019s shares and is the chairman of the board of directors. The second applicant has been the managing director of AGB since 2003. The third applicant was one of the co-founders of AGB and today holds 18% of the company\u2019s shares.", "AGB was founded in 1987 and has remained the sole provider of TV audience data to the present day. The applicants state that it has been noticed worldwide that the relevant national markets prefer to share a common source of television audience data. This is due to the fact that commonly accepted television data in the context of national markets form a decisive parameter in the decision-making process, as regards advertising investment strategies. The applicants submit that Greece is a unique case in the field of terrestrial television broadcasting owing to the fact that, under the successive laws that have been enacted since 1989, when the State monopoly was abolished, there are today at least five private, fifty regional and sixty local television channels, none of which has a proper operating licence. It is submitted that in this context of institutional anarchy AGB\u2019s role has become more crucial than in other countries. The applicants claim that, for this reason, AGB has occasionally been the target of campaigns in which its professionalism and reputation have been attacked.", "In 2002 a high-ranking executive of Alpha TV drafted and made public a report on AGB\u2019s activities suggesting that AGB and its executives had committed irregularities with regard to the choice of sample and the subsequent processing of television data. The Television Audience Measurement Committee, an independent committee created by virtue of section 11(4) of Law no. 2328/1995, conducted a special investigation and cleared AGB of all charges.", "In autumn 2004 Alpha TV, which at the time was allegedly facing major financial difficulties and low ratings, again drew attention to the above-mentioned report. The latter gained widespread publicity, and on 14 December 2004 a preliminary examination was ordered in respect of AGB\u2019s managers by the Athens Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office. In February 2006 all three applicants were summoned to the prosecutor\u2019s office to answer rather general questions, without being bound by oath (\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03c9\u03c4\u03af). On 30 March 2006 the public prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against the applicants for the concurrent offences of fraud, fraud committed against the State and filing of false statements before an administrative authority. On the same date, the case file was transmitted to the investigating judge.", "The applicants submit that, on 30 March 2006, during the regular off-the-record meeting of the senior prosecuting authority with the media held on the premises of the Court of Cassation, journalists were briefed that criminal proceedings were to be initiated against the three applicants in relation to AGB\u2019s alleged irregularities. Long excerpts and explicit details about the allegations were read from the unofficial prosecutor\u2019s report (\u03c0\u03cc\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1). This report is only an internal document and Greek law does not provide for such a report. It is only by way of a working practice that such reports are drafted by the prosecutor in charge as an informal description and assessment of the facts for the sole purpose of briefing the supervising prosecutor on the case. Moreover, the accused had not yet been notified of the report, and therefore the applicants had no official knowledge of its content.", "On the same day, M.T., a journalist hosting a popular television show, \u0397 \u0396\u03bf\u03cd\u03b3\u03ba\u03bb\u03b1 (\u201cThe Jungle\u201d), appeared before a large panel of guests, holding a copy of the prosecutor\u2019s confidential report. While showing the report on camera with frequent close-ups, he went on to read out extensive parts of it. Quoting selected extracts from the report, he stated that AGB was an integral part of a \u201cnetwork of conspiracy\u201d and the \u201creal centre of power\u201d in Greece, both at political and at economic level. Other guests participating in the panel stated that AGB not only built or destroyed TV careers but also distributed millions and constituted a \u201cspider\u2019s web\u201d and a \u201cfraudulent trap\u201d.", "The following day\u2019s newspapers contained extensive articles on the case. Three Athens dailies quoted parts of the prosecutor\u2019s confidential report, and one of them published photographs of the first two applicants and another three pages of the original report. The story caused such interest throughout Greece that, on the evening of 31 March 2006, the first and third applicants were forced to answer pressing questions by journalists live on two of the most popular evening television broadcasts.", "The applicants submit that both their private and professional lives have dramatically changed. After the disclosure of the prosecutor\u2019s report and the ensuing publicity, they are allegedly looked upon with distrust and disapproval and are in a state of uncertainty as to their future careers. They state that the impact on their private lives has also been considerable. In particular, the first applicant started receiving anonymous hostile telephone calls and letters, which forced him to seek protection for his premises from private security guards. After the television reports, the first and second applicants\u2019 children started using their mothers\u2019 maiden name at school, so as to avoid further abuse. The second applicant, having already had health problems with his vocal cords, suffered a relapse, which required a second operation, after the above-mentioned events took place.", "On 26 June 2009 the Indictment Division of the Athens Court of Appeal dismissed all the charges against the applicants (decision no. 1294/2009). It stated, inter alia, that there were no grounds to commit the applicants for trial.", "1. The relevant provisions of the Constitution provide as follows:", "\u201c1.
