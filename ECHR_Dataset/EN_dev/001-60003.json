On an unknown date the applicants (who all describe themselves as \u201cSilesians\u201d), together with one hundred and ninety other persons, decided to form an association (stowarzyszenie) entitled \u201cUnion of People of Silesian Nationality\u201d (Zwi\u0105zek Ludno\u015bci Narodowo\u015bci \u015al\u0105skiej). The founders subsequently adopted a memorandum of association. The applicants were elected to the provisional management committee (Komitet Za\u0142o\u017cycielski) and were authorised to proceed with the registration of the association.", "9. On 11 December 1996 the applicants, acting on behalf of the provisional management committee of the \u201cUnion of People of Silesian Nationality\u201d, lodged an application for the registration of their association with the Katowice Regional Court (S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki). They relied on, inter alia, section 8(2) of the Law of 7 April 1989 on Associations (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cLaw on Associations\u201d). They submitted the memorandum of association along with the other documents required by the Law on Associations. The relevant parts of the memorandum of association read:", "\u201c1. The present association shall be called the \u201cUnion of People of Silesian Nationality\u201d (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cUnion\u201d).", "2. The Union shall conduct its activity within the territory of the Republic of Poland; it may establish local branches.", "...", "6 (1). The Union may join other domestic or international organisations if the aims pursued by [the latter] correspond to the aims pursued by the Union.", "...", "7. The aims of the Union are:", "(1) to awaken and strengthen the national consciousness of Silesians;", "(2) to restore Silesian culture;", "(3) to promote knowledge of Silesia;", "(4) to protect the ethnic rights of persons of Silesian nationality; [and]", "(5) to provide social care for members of the Union.", "8. The Union shall accomplish its aims by the following means:", "(1) organising lectures, seminars, training courses and meetings, establishing libraries and clubs, and carrying out scientific research;", "(2) organising cultural and educational activities for members of the Union and other persons;", "(3) carrying out promotional and publishing activities;", "(4) promoting the emblems and colours of Silesia and Upper Silesia;", "(5) organising demonstrations or [other] protest actions;", "(6) organising sporting events ... and other forms of leisure activities;", "(7) setting up schools and other educational establishments;", "(8) cooperating with other organisations;", "(9) conducting business activities for the purpose of financing the aims of the Union \u2013 this may include establishing commercial entities and co-operating with other [commercial] entities;", "(10) establishing other entities or [legal] persons with a view to achieving the aims of the Union; and", "(11) any other activities.", "9. There shall be two categories of members of the Union, namely ordinary members and supporting members.", "10. Any person of Silesian nationality may become an ordinary member of the Union.", "...\u201d", "Paragraph 15 read, in so far as relevant:", "\u201cA person shall cease to be a member of the Union if:", "\u2026", "2. (a) on a reasoned motion by the board of auditors, the management board decides to deprive him of his membership;", "(b) the relevant motion of the board of auditors may be based on such reasons as the fact that the member in question has not fulfilled the requirements set out in the memorandum of association for becoming a member or has failed to perform the duties of members as specified in paragraph 14.", "... \u201c", "Paragraph 30 provided:", "\u201cThe Union is an organisation of the Silesian national minority.\u201d", "10. On an unknown later date the Katowice Regional Court, pursuant to section 13 (2) of the Law on Associations, served a copy of the applicants\u2019 application, together with copies of the relevant enclosures, on the Katowice Governor (Wojewoda).", "11. On 27 January 1997 the Katowice Governor, acting through the Department of Civic Affairs (Wydzia\u0142 Obywatelski), submitted his comments on the application to the court. These comments contain lengthy arguments against allowing the association to be registered, the main thrust of which is as follows:", "\u201c(i) It cannot be said that there is a \u2018Silesian\u2019 (\u015al\u0105zak), in the sense of a representative of a distinct \u2018Silesian nationality\u2019. \u2018Silesian\u2019 is a word denoting a representative of a local ethnic group, not a nation. This is confirmed by paragraph 7 (1) of the memorandum of association, which aims merely to \u2018awake and strengthen the national consciousness of Silesians\u2019. \u2026", "(ii) Social research relied on by the applicants to demonstrate the existence of a \u2018Silesian nationality\u2019 does not accord with numerous other scientific publications. Polish sociology distinguishes between two concepts of \u2018homeland\u2019, i.e. a \u2018local homeland\u2019 and a \u2018ideological homeland\u2019. In German, this distinction is expressed by the terms Heimat (local homeland) and Vaterland (ideological homeland). The research relied on by the applicants merely refers to the self-identification of the inhabitants of Silesia, indicating that their local self-identification takes precedence over their national self-identification. \u2026", "(iii) Paragraph 10 of the memorandum of association states that any person of Silesian nationality may become an ordinary member of the association, but does not clearly specify the criteria for establishing whether or not a given person fulfils this requirement. This absence of unambiguous criteria is contrary to section 10 (1) and (4) of the Law on Associations. Moreover, it renders paragraph 15 (2) (b) of the memorandum unlawful, for that provision allows the board of management to deprive a person of his membership in the event of failure to satisfy the conditions set out in the memorandum of association. \u2026", "(iv) Paragraph 30 of the memorandum of association, which calls the Union an \u201corganisation of the Silesian national minority\u201d, is misleading and does not correspond to the facts. There is no basis for regarding the Silesians as a national minority. Recognising them as such would have been in breach of Articles 67 \u00a7 2 and 81 \u00a7 1 of the [old] Constitution, which guarantee Polish citizens equal rights. In particular, under the relevant provisions of the Law of 28 May 1993 on Parliamentary Elections (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cLaw on Parliamentary Elections\u201d) (Ordynacja wyborcza do Sejmu Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej), registration of the Union would give it a privileged position in respect of the distribution of seats in Parliament. The Union would obtain privileges and rights guaranteed to national minorities in respect of education in their native language and access to the media. Registration of the association would have been to the detriment of other ethnic groups in Poland, such as Cracovians (Krakowiacy), Highlanders (G\u00f3rale) and Mazurians (Mazurzy); this would have amounted to a return to the tribalism (podzia\u0142y plemienne) which had existed prior to the formation of the Polish State. \u2026", "(v) We therefore propose that the memorandum of association should be amended so as to reflect the above observations. In particular, the misleading name of the association should be changed, the criteria for membership should be set out in an unambiguous manner and paragraph 30 should be deleted. In our opinion, these are the conditions for registration of the association.\u201d", "12. On 13 March 1997 the applicants filed a pleading in reply to those arguments. They asserted that the fact that the majority of Poles failed to recognise the existence of a Silesian nation did not mean that there was no such nation. They cited various scientific publications and went on to explain that the fact that the Silesians formed a distinct group had already been acknowledged at the end of the First World War; moreover, the Silesians had always sought to preserve their identity and had always formed a distinct group, regardless of whether Upper Silesia had belonged to Germany or to Poland. Consequently, any comparison between them and the Cracovians or Highlanders was totally unjustified because the latter groups neither regarded themselves as a national minority, nor had they ever been perceived as such in the past. Finally, the applicants cited certain letters of the Ministry of the Interior, which had been published by the press and which explained that the National and Ethnic Minorities Bill had explicitly stated that a \u201cdeclaration that a person belongs to a minority shall not be questioned or verified by the public authorities\u201d.", "13. On 9 April 1997 the Katowice Governor filed a pleading with the court. He maintained his previous position. On 14 April 1997 he produced two letters from the Ministry of the Interior (dated 4 February and 10 April 1997 respectively, and addressed to the Department of Civic Affairs of the Office of the Katowice Governor). The relevant parts of the letter of 4 February 1997 read:", "\u201cWe share your doubts as to whether certain inhabitants of Silesia should be deemed to be a national minority. We therefore propose that you submit your observations to the court, indicating those doubts, and that you ask the court to grant you leave to join the proceedings as a party.", "We propose that you rely on the fact that the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities has not been ratified by Poland, so that its provisions [do not apply in the domestic legal system]. ...", "In our view, neither historical nor ethnographical circumstances justify the opinion that the inhabitants of Silesia can be recognised as a national minority.\u201d", "The relevant parts of the letter of 10 April 1997 read as follows:", "\u201c... The arguments advanced by the provisional management committee of the association [in their pleading of 13 March 1997] do not contain any new elements; [in particular] ... the Framework Convention does not constitute the law applicable in Poland.", "Likewise, the letters of the Ministry of the Interior [on the interpretation of the National and Ethnic Minorities Bill] do not change the situation.", "The sense of belonging to a nation falls within the realm of personal liberties; it does not in itself entail any legal consequences. [By contrast,] the formation of an organisation of a national minority is a legal fact which entails legal consequences such as, for instance, those referred to in the Law on Parliamentary Elections.", "In the circumstances, the registration of the association called the \u201cUnion of People of Silesian Nationality\u201d could be allowed provided that the existence of such a nation had been established.\u201d", "14. On 28 April 1997 the applicants submitted a further pleading to the court. They criticised the arguments of the Ministry of the Interior, pointing out that the latter had failed to indicate any legal basis for rejecting their application. In particular, the authorities had not shown that any provision of the memorandum of association was contrary to the law whereas, under section 1 (2) of the Law on Associations, \u201cthe exercise of the right to association may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by statute and are necessary for ensuring the interests of national security or public order and for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others\u201d. Lastly, the applicants stated that they would not to amend the memorandum of association in the manner proposed by the authorities, in particular in respect of the name of the association and the content of paragraph 30. They agreed, however, to amend paragraph 10 of the memorandum and phrased it as follows:", "\u201cEveryone who is a Polish citizen and who has submitted a written declaration stating that he is of Silesian nationality may become an ordinary member [of the Union].\u201d", "15. On 23 May 1997 the Katowice Regional Court held an \u201cexplanatory session\u201d (posiedzenie wyja\u015bniaj\u0105ce) aimed at obtaining comments and clarifications from the parties and settling the matters in dispute.", "16. On 27 May 1997 the applicants lodged a pleading with the court, maintaining that in the course of the above-mentioned session the authorities had \u201cde facto acknowledged that a Silesian nation exists\u201d, in particular by accepting the name of the association and certain provisions of the memorandum (i.e. paragraph 7 (1) and (4) and paragraph 10)\u201d. They stressed however that the authorities\u2019 insistence on deleting paragraph 30 was \u201cunjustified and illogical\u201d and, consequently, refused to alter or delete that provision.", "Later, on 16 June 1997, the Katowice Governor submitted his final pleading to the court, opposing the registration of the association.", "17. On 24 June 1997 a single judge, sitting in camera as the Katowice Regional Court, granted the applicants\u2019 application and registered their association under the name of the \u201cUnion of People of Silesian Nationality\u201d. The reasons for that decision read, in so far as relevant:", "\u201c... There was a dispute between [the parties] over the concepts \u2018nation\u2019 and \u2018national minority\u2019. Finally [the authorities concerned] pleaded that the application for registration of the association should be dismissed.", "This court has found that the application is well-founded [and as such should be granted].", "In the Preamble to the Law on Associations, the legislature guarantees [everyone] a cardinal right, the right to freedom of association, which enables citizens, regardless of their convictions, to participate actively in public life and to express different opinions, and to achieve individual interests.", "Freedom of association is one of the natural rights of a human being. [For this reason,] section 1(1) of the Law on Associations does not establish the right to freedom of association but merely sets out the manner and limits of its exercise, thus reflecting Poland\u2019s international obligations.", "Under section 1(2) of the Law on Associations, the right to form an association may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by statute either in the interests of national security or public safety, or in the interests of public order, or for the protection of health and morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. No other restrictions may be placed on the exercise of the right to associate with others.", "As recently as 16 June 1997, in their pleading, the authorities advanced the argument that the registration of the present association would infringe the rights and freedoms of others because it would result in an unequal treatment of other local communities and would diminish their rights.", "This argument is unconvincing since it does not emerge from the content of the memorandum of association that the future activities of the association are aimed at [diminishing] the rights and freedoms of others.", "Pursuant to paragraph 7 of the memorandum of association, the aims of the association are [, for example,] to awaken and strengthen the national consciousness of Silesians, to restore Silesian culture, to promote knowledge of Silesia and to provide social care for members of the association. None whatsoever of these aims is directed against the rights and freedoms of others. The means to be used for accomplishing these aims are not directed against the rights and freedoms of others either. Those means include organising lectures and seminars, carrying out scientific research, establishing libraries, organising cultural and educational activities for members and other persons, carrying out promotional and publishing activities, promoting the emblems and colours of Silesia and Upper Silesia, organising demonstrations and protest actions, organising sporting events, setting up schools and other educational establishments, conducting business activities and co-operating with other organisations.", "In sum, the argument that the association would infringe the rights and freedoms of others must definitely be rejected. Moreover, it should be noted that this argument refers to [a mere possibility] because only practical action taken by the association could possibly demonstrate whether, and if so to what extent, the [future] activities of the association would necessitate the use of measures aimed at protecting the rights of others.", "As regards the terms \u2018Silesian nationality\u2019 or \u2018Silesian national minority\u2019, the problems involved in the determination of their proper meaning cannot be examined by this court in detail.", "This court must, pursuant section 13(1) of the Law on Associations, rule on the present application within a period not exceeding three months from the date on which it was lodged. It is therefore not possible [in the course of the present proceedings] to determine such complicated issues (which involve problems falling within the sphere of international relations).", "It is, however, possible to assume, for the purposes of making a ruling in these proceedings, that the nationality of an individual is a matter of choice for him; moreover, it is a matter of common knowledge that the original inhabitants of Silesia constitute a minority in Upper Silesia \u2013 at least for anyone who has ever spent some time in this region and has been willing to perceive this fact. After all, the authorities, although they rend their garments [sic], complaining that the applicants dared to establish an association, do not contest the fact that [the Silesians] are an ethnic minority.", "In view of the foregoing this court, finding that the provisional management committee complied with the requirements laid down in sections 8(4), 12 and 16, read in conjunction with section 13 (2) of the Law on Associations and Article 516 of the Code of Civil Procedure, holds as in the operative part of the decision\u201d.", "18. On 2 July 1997 the Katowice Governor lodged an appeal with the Katowice Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny), asking that the first-instance decision be quashed, that the case be remitted to the court of first instance, and that expert evidence be obtained in order to determine the meaning of the terms \u201cnation\u201d and \u201cnational minority\u201d. In his appeal, he alleged that the court of first instance had violated sections 1(1) and 2 of the Law on Associations and unspecified provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. The reasons for the appeal read, in so far as relevant:", "\u201c[The court of first instance] formally recognised and legally sanctioned the existence of a distinct Silesian nation constituting a \u2018Silesian national minority\u2019.", "In our opinion, such an important and unprecedented ruling, which is of international significance, could not and should not be given without defining the concepts of \u2018nation\u2019 and \u2018national minority\u2019. The Regional Court, leaving this issue aside \u2013 merely because of certain statutory time-limits \u2013simplified the proceedings in an unacceptable manner. This led, in itself, to a failure on the part of the court to establish all the circumstances relevant to the outcome of the case and, furthermore, provided a sufficient basis for this appeal.", "The appellant admits that Polish law does not define the terms \u2018nation\u2019 and \u2018national minority\u2019. This, however, does not justify the conclusion of the Regional Court that \u2018the nationality of an individual is a matter of choice for him\u2019.", "The appellant does not contest the right of a person to decide freely to belong to a national minority; however, a precondition for making such a choice is the existence of a \u2018nation\u2019 with which that person identifies himself.", "The decision appealed against proclaims the opinion that the subjective feelings of the person concerned suffice for the purposes of creating a \u2018nation\u2019 or a \u2018nationality. Having regard to the potential social repercussions of such an approach, it is not possible to agree with it.", "In these circumstances, prior to making any decision on the registration of the \u2018Union of People of Silesian Nationality\u2019, it is necessary to determine whether a \u2018Silesian nation\u2019 exists \u2013 a distinct, non-Polish nation \u2013 and whether it is admissible in law to create a \u2018Silesian national minority\u2019.", "In the appellant\u2019s opinion, there are no objective arguments in favour of the finding that a distinct Silesian nation exists. In case of doubt, ... this question should be resolved by obtaining evidence from experts.", "In the contested decision, the lower court in principle focused on determining whether the aims of the association and the means of accomplishing those aims were lawful. \u2026 The appellant does not contest the majority of these aims; it must be said that such activities as restoring Silesian culture, promoting knowledge of Silesia or providing social care for members of the association are worthy of respect and support. However, these aims can fully be accomplished without the contested provision of the memorandum of association, i.e. paragraph 30 ... . In addition, the applicants were not prevented from incorporating the above-mentioned aims into the memorandum of an existing association called the \u2018Movement for the Autonomy of Silesia\u2019 (Ruch Autonomii \u015al\u0105ska), the more so as the applicants belong to influential circles of the latter organisation.", "The fact that the applicants have failed to do so but [instead] are creating a new association, and are describing themselves as a \u2018Silesian national minority\u2019, clearly demonstrates what their real objective is. In fact, their objective is to circumvent the provisions of the Law of 28 May 1993 on Parliamentary Elections, under which parties or other organisations standing in elections must reach a threshold of 5% or 7% of the vote in order to obtain seats in the Parliament. ...", "Legal acts \u2013 including the act of adopting a memorandum of association \u2013 are null and void under Article 58 \u00a7 1 of the Civil Code if they aim at evading or circumventing the law. Legal theory formulates the opinion that defects in legal acts, as defined in Article 58 of the Civil Code, may constitute a basis for refusing to register an association.", "Sanctioning the rights of the \u2018Silesian national minority\u2019 amounts to discrimination against other regional and ethnic groups or societies. This will be the case at least as regards electoral law and will be contrary to Article 67 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution. \u2026\u201d", "19. The Katowice Court of Appeal heard the appeal on 24 September 1997. The Katowice Prosecutor of Appeal (Prokurator Apelacyjny) appeared at the hearing and asked the court to grant him leave to join the proceedings as a party intervening on behalf of the Katowice Governor. The leave was granted. The court next heard addresses by the appellant, the prosecutor (who requested the court to set aside the first-instance decision and dismiss the applicants\u2019 application) and the representative of the applicants. On the same day the court set aside the first-instance decision and dismissed the applicants\u2019 application for their association to be registered. The reasons for that decision read, in so far as relevant:", "\u201c... The lower court, by registering the association entitled \u2018Union of People of Silesian Nationality\u2019, approved paragraph 30 of the memorandum of association, which states that the Union is an organisation of the Silesian national minority. We therefore agree with the appellant that the Union, on the basis of the above-mentioned paragraph, would have the right to benefit from the statutory privileges laid down in section 5 of the Law on Parliamentary Elections. ...", "Furthermore, recognising the Silesians as a national minority may also result in further claims on their part [for privileges] granted to national minorities by other statutes. ...", "Contrary to the opinion expressed by the lower court, it is possible to determine whether or not the Silesians constitute a national minority in Poland; it is not necessary to obtain expert evidence in that connection.", "Under Article 228 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, facts that are a matter of common knowledge, i.e. those which every sensible and experienced citizen should know, do not need to be proved. Common knowledge includes historical, economical, political and social phenomena and events.", "It is therefore clear that at present no legal definition of \u2018nation\u2019 and \u2018national minority\u2019 is commonly accepted in international relations,. ...", "On the other hand, an \u2018ethnic group\u2019 is understood as a group which has a distinct language, a specific culture and a sense of social ties, is aware of the fact that it differs from other groups, and has its own name.", "Polish ethnographic science of the 19th and 20th centuries describes \u2018Silesians\u2019 as an autochthonous population of Polish origin residing in Silesia \u2013 a geographical and historical region. At present, as a result of political and social changes, the term \u2018Silesians\u2019 refers equally to immigrant inhabitants who have been residing in this territory for several generations and who have been identifying themselves with their new region of residence. It also refers to the German-speaking population, linked with Silesia by [such factors as] birth, residence and tradition (see the Encyclopaedia published by the Polish Scientific Publishers in 1996). ...", "The applicants derive the rights they claim from the principles set out in the [Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities], stating that every person belonging to a national minority has the right freely to choose to belong or not to belong to such a minority. ... In invoking European standards, they fail, however, to remember that a national minority with which a given person identifies himself must exist. There must be a society, established on the basis of objective criteria, with which this person wishes to identify. No one can determine his national identity in isolation from a fundamental element, which is the existence of a specific nation.", "It emerges from the above-mentioned definition of a \u2018nation\u2019 that a nation is formed in a historical process which may last for centuries and that the crucial element which forms a nation is its self-identification, that is to say its national awareness established on the basis of the existing culture by a society residing on a specific territory.", "Certainly, the Silesians belong to a regional group with a very deep sense of identity, including their cultural identity; no one can deny that they are distinct. This does not, however, suffice for them to be considered as a distinct nation. They have never commonly been perceived as a distinct nation and they have never tried to determine their identity in terms of [the criteria for a \u2018nation\u2019]. On the contrary, the history of Silesia unequivocally demonstrates that autochthonous inhabitants [of this region] have preserved their distinct culture and language (the latter having Polish roots from an ethnic point of view,), even though their territories were not within the borders of the Polish State and even though they were under strong German influence. They are therefore Silesians \u2013 in the sense of [inhabitants of the] region, not in the sense of [their] nationality. Thus, Upper Silesia, in its ethnic roots [sic], remained Polish; that was, without a doubt, demonstrated by three uprisings. The role played by the Silesians in building and preserving the Polish character of Silesia, even though they remained isolated from their homeland, is unquestionable.", "However, a given nation exists where a group of individuals, considering themselves a \u2018nation\u2019, is in addition accepted and perceived as such by others. In the common opinion of Polish citizens, both the Silesians and other regional groups or communities [e.g. Highlanders or Mazurians] are perceived merely in terms of local communities. In the international sphere Poland and, similarly, France and Germany, are perceived as single-nation States, regardless of the fact that there exist distinct ethnic groups (e.g. the inhabitants of Alsace or Lorraine in France, or the inhabitants of Bavaria in Germany).", "On the whole, sociologists agree that the Silesians constitute an ethnic group and that the autochthonous inhabitants [of Silesia] do have some features of a nation but that those features are not fully developed. That ... means that the awakening of their national identity is still at a very early stage. A nation exists only when there are no doubts as to its right to exist. ... In Poland national minorities do constitute only a small part of the society, that is to say about 3-4%. They comprise \u2013 and this has never been denied \u2013 Germans, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Lithuanians, Slovaks, Czechs, Jews, Roma, Armenians and Tatars.", "In the Polish tradition, national minorities are perceived as groups linked to a majority outside Poland; in other words, a minority is an ethnic group which has support amongst a majority [residing] abroad. Moreover, traditionally, our society has not considered that groups which preserve a distinct culture but which do not belong to any State can be deemed to be national minorities. Accordingly, for a long time the Roma people were regarded as an ethnic, not a national group. ...", "The applicants\u2019 opinion that the mere choice of the individual concerned is decisive for his nationality is reflected in paragraph 10 of the memorandum of association. Acceptance of this opinion would consequently lead to a situation in which the aims pursued by the association could be accomplished by groups of members who did not have any connection or links with Silesia and who had become members of the Union solely to gain an advantage for themselves. Undoubtedly, such groups of members cannot [be allowed] to accomplish the aims of an association of a national minority. ...", "The applicants have relied on the results of sociological research carried out in 1994 in Katowice Province. Indeed, the research demonstrates that 25% of persons requested to declare their ethnic and regional identity replied that they were Silesians. However, it transpires from [the material collected in the course of another piece of sociological research of 1996 which was submitted by the applicants during the appellate hearing] that two years later the number of persons considering themselves to be Silesians had decreased to 12.4% and that, moreover, the majority of inhabitants of Katowice Province considered themselves to be Poles (i.e. 81.9%, including 18.1% who stated that they were \u2018Polish Silesians\u2019; only 3.5% of inhabitants considered themselves to be Germans, including 2.4 % who stated that they were \u2018German Silesians\u2019).", "In the light of the above research it cannot be said that such a poorly established self-identity of a small (and decreasing) group of Silesians, as demonstrated by their refusal to declare that they belong to the [Polish] nation, provides a basis for recognising that all Silesians (who have lived in Silesia for generations and state that they belong to the Polish nation) constitute a separate nation. This would be contrary to the will of the majority, a will well known to the applicants.", "We therefore find that the appellant is right in submitting that granting the applicants\u2019 application for their association to be registered is unjustified because the memorandum of association is contrary to the law, i.e. Article 5 of the Civil Code. Thus, the application is aimed at registering an organisation of a minority which cannot be regarded as a national minority and at circumventing the provisions of the Law on Parliamentary Elections and other statutes conferring particular privileges on national minorities. Granting such a request could lead to granting unwarranted rights to the association in question. This would, moreover, place their organisation at an advantage in relation to other regional or ethnic organisations.", "In these circumstances, under section 14 of the Law on Associations and Article 58 of the Civil Code, read in conjunction with Articles 386 \u00a7 1 and 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure and section 8 of the Law on Associations, the appeal must be allowed ... .\u201d", "20. On 3 November 1997 the applicants lodged a cassation appeal (kasacja) with the Supreme Court (S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy). They alleged that the Katowice Court of Appeal had wrongly interpreted the relevant provisions of the Law on Associations and that the impugned decision had contravened Article 84 of the Constitution, Article 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article 11 of the Convention. Their arguments may be summarised as follows:", "\u201cThe principal issue to be determined by the Court of Appeal was whether the memorandum of the applicants\u2019 association complied with the statutory requirements. since a refusal to register an association could be justified only if an activity specified in the memorandum of association was banned by the law. That was clearly not the case and the court\u2019s fear that the registration of the applicants\u2019 association would in future lead to discrimination against other national or ethnic minorities was based on mere speculation. In any event, the Law on Associations [in sections 8(2), 25 et seq.] provided for various means whereby the activity of an association could be supervised by the competent State authorities or, in the event that its activity was unlawful, the association could be dissolved.", "However, the Court of Appeal, instead of assessing formal requirements of the registration, firstly decided that the core issue in the proceedings was to establish whether a Silesian nation existed. It consequently went on to lay down its own arbitrary and controversial definition of \u2018nation\u2019 and \u2018national minority\u2019 and finally concluded that there was no \u2018Silesian nation\u2019. It did so without any effort to obtain expert evidence in respect of such an important matter.\u201d", "21. On 27 November 1997 the Katowice Governor filed a pleading in reply to the applicants\u2019 cassation appeal. The relevant arguments may be summarised as follows:", "\u201cThe refusal to register the applicants\u2019 association was fully justified. In the course of the proceedings at first instance, the Governor eventually proposed that the applicants amend paragraph 30 of the memorandum of association and alter the name of their association by deleting the word \u2018nationality\u2019. Those arguments were based on section 10(1)(1) of the Law of Associations, which provides that a memorandum of association should enable the association in question to be differentiated from other associations. This means that the name of an association should not be misleading. Since the requirement set out in the above-mentioned section was not complied with, the refusal to register the applicants\u2019 association was justified under section 14(1).", "It must be stressed that even in the explanatory report to the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities it is clearly stated that the individual\u2019s subjective choice to belong to a national minority is inseparably linked to objective criteria relevant to the person\u2019s identity. That means that a given nation must exist prior to the individual making a decision to belong to this nation. That being so, the applicants\u2019 application for their association to be registered must be seen as a thoughtless and incomprehensible attempt to exploit the distinct characteristics [of the Silesians] with a view to achieving political aims.\u201d", "22. On 28 November 1997 the Katowice Prosecutor of Appeal filed a pleading in reply to the applicants\u2019 cassation appeal. He submitted, inter alia, that it was clear that the content of the memorandum of association was contrary to the law since it explicitly stated that the Union was an association of a national minority, and thus ignored the fact that the Silesians could not be regarded as a minority of that kind. The Silesians, being merely an ethnic group, could not exercise the rights conferred on national minorities, in particular those referred to in the Law on Parliamentary Elections.", "23. On 18 March 1998 a panel of three judges, sitting as the Administrative, Labour and Social Security Chamber of the Supreme Court, dismissed the applicants\u2019 cassation appeal. The relevant parts of the reasons for this decision read as follows:", "\u201c\u2026 [A] necessary prerequisite for the registration of an association is the conformity of its memorandum of association with the entire domestic legal order, including conformity with [the provisions of ] international treaties ratified by Poland.", "In the present case the Court of Appeal had no doubts as to the lawfulness of the aims pursued by [the applicants\u2019] association but refused to register the association for the sole reason that [the applicants], in the memorandum of association, used such terms as \u2018Silesian nation\u2019 and \u2018Silesian national minority\u2019.", "We agree with the opinion [of the Court of Appeal]. \u2018National minority\u2019 is a legal term (Article 35 of the Constitution of 2 February 1997) although it is not defined either in Polish law, or in the conventions relied on in the cassation appeal. However, the explanatory report to the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities states plainly that the individual\u2019s subjective choice of a nation is inseparably linked to objective criteria relevant to his national identity. That means that a subjective declaration of belonging to a specific national group implies prior social acceptance of the existence of the national group in question. \u2026", "An individual has the right to choose his nation but this, as the Court of Appeal rightly pointed out, does not in itself lead to the establishment of a new, distinct nation or national minority.", "There was, and still is, a common perception that an ethnic group of Silesians does exist; however, this group has never been regarded as a national group and it has not claimed to be regarded as such. \u2026", "Registration of the association, which in paragraph 30 of its memorandum of association states that it is an organisation of a [specific] national minority, would be in breach of the law because it would result in a non-existent \u2018national minority\u2019 taking advantage of privileges conferred on [genuine] national minorities. This concerns, in particular, the privileges granted by the Law on Parliamentary Elections ... such as an exemption from the requirement that a party or other organisation standing in elections should receive at least 5% of the vote, which is a prerequisite for obtaining seats in Parliament ... [or] ... privileges in respect of the registration of electoral lists; thus, it suffices for an organisation of a national minority to have registered its electoral lists in at least five electoral constituencies [whereas the general requirement is to register an electoral list in at least a half of the electoral constituencies in the whole of Poland].", "Pursuant to the relevant ruling of the Constitutional Court (Trybuna\u0142 Konstytucyjny) on the interpretation of the Law on Parliamentary Elections, ... the privileges [referred to above] are conferred on electoral committees of registered national minorities and, in the event of any doubt [as to whether or not an electoral committee represents a national minority], the State Electoral College may request evidence.", "The simplest means of proving the existence of a specific national minority is to present a memorandum of association confirming that fact. It is true that under the new Constitution resolutions of the Constitutional Court on the interpretation of statutes no longer have universally binding force; however, in view of the persuasiveness of the reasons given by the Constitutional Court and the requirements of practice, [we consider that] a memorandum of association still remains basic evidence demonstrating the existence of a national minority.", "[Furthermore,] conferring on the Silesians, an ethnic group, the rights of a national minority would be contrary to Article 32 of the Constitution, stating that all persons are equal before the law, [because] other ethnic minorities would not enjoy the same rights.", "The memorandum of association is contrary to section 10(1)(4) of the Law on Associations, which stipulates that a memorandum of association must set out rules concerning acquisition and loss of membership, and the rights and duties of members. Paragraph 10 of the memorandum provides that everyone who is a Polish citizen and has submitted a written declaration stating that he is of Silesian nationality, may become a member of the Union, whereas paragraph 15 states that a person ceases to be a member of the Union if, inter alia, he has not fulfilled the membership requirements set out in the memorandum of association. Since no Silesian nation exists, no one would, lawfully, be able to become a member of the Union because his declaration of Silesian nationality would be untrue. \u2026", "Furthermore, it must be pointed out that the refusal to register the association does not contravene Poland\u2019s international obligations. Both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ... and the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms allow [the State] to place restrictions on the freedom of association, [in particular such as] are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety or for the protection of health and morals or for the protection of the rights of others.", "It is contrary to the public order to create a non-existent nation that would be able to benefit from the privileges conferred solely on national minorities. Such a situation would also lead to the infringement of the rights of others, not only national minorities but also all other citizens of Poland. Granting privileges to a [specific] group of citizens means that the situation of the other members of society becomes correspondingly less favourable.", "This is particularly so in the sphere of election law: if certain persons may become members of Parliament [because of their privileged position], it means that other candidates must obtain a higher number of votes than what would be required in the absence of privileges [in that respect].", "It also has to be noted that the essential aims of the association can be accomplished without the contested provisions of the memorandum and without the [specific] name of the association. Under the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland national and ethnic minorities have equal rights as regards their freedom to preserve and develop their own language, to maintain their customs and traditions, to develop their culture, to establish educational institutions or institutions designed to protect their religious identity and to participate in the resolution of matters relating to their cultural identity (Article 35). \u2026\u201d", "24.
