AZERBAIJAN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant, Mr Dmitriy Ivanov, is an Azerbaijani national who was born in 1973 and lives in Kazi-Magomed. He was represented before the Court by Mr I. Aliyev, a lawyer practising in Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijani Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Asgarov.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "In December 1999 the applicant got married. He and his wife lived together until March 2000.", "After the applicant had moved out of his wife\u2019s house, he had an intention to commence divorce proceedings. However, approximately at this time, he found out that his wife was pregnant. Believing that he was not the father of the yet unborn child, in August 2000 he requested the AliBayramli Register of Civil Status Acts not to list him as the biological father in the birth certificate upon the child\u2019s birth.", "In October 2000 the applicant\u2019s wife gave birth to a daughter. Despite the applicant\u2019s earlier request, based on a statutory presumption of paternity, the Register of Civil Status Acts issued a birth certificate mentioning the applicant as the child\u2019s father. As the applicant and his wife were separated and no longer lived together as a family, on 27 November 2000 the AliBayramli District Court ordered the applicant to pay child support to his wife.", "The applicant then instituted civil proceedings, disputing his paternity and asking the court to strike out his name as the child\u2019s father from the relevant civil status documents. He claimed that, on the night after his wedding, he discovered that his wife was not a virgin as he expected. He was shocked by this and refused to continue the sexual intercourse with her. He further maintained that thereafter he had never had any sexual intercourse with his wife and that the child had been conceived in an adulterous relation with another person.", "After a preliminary hearing, on 22 February 2001 the Ali-Bayramli District Court ordered a biological expert examination to determine the paternity. On 29 November 2001, an expert of the Ministry of Health issued an opinion on the applicant\u2019s paternity. The expert performed an ABO blood group test by comparing the applicant\u2019s, the child\u2019s and the mother\u2019s blood types and, based on its results, concluded that the applicant \u201ccould be the child\u2019s father\u201d. The expert noted that a DNA test would yield a more precise conclusion, but the expert did not possess adequate medical inventory to perform such a test.", "Relying on the results of the ABO blood group test, the fact that the applicant and his wife lived together at the time of the child\u2019s conception, as well as the witness testimony concerning the relations between the applicant and his wife, on 10 January 2002 the Ali-Bayramli District Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim.", "The applicant filed an appeal, arguing that the District Court\u2019s judgment was arbitrary, because the expert opinion used by the court did not provide a definite conclusion and because the results of the ABO test could not be considered as a reliable source for identifying the child\u2019s biological father. He further argued that only the DNA test could provide a conclusive answer to the question of paternity.", "On 13 May 2002 the Court of Appeal upheld the first instance court\u2019s judgment, holding that the applicant failed to substantiate his arguments or present any new evidence proving that he was not the child\u2019s father. In its judgment, the court was silent about the applicant\u2019s request for a DNA test. Upon the applicant\u2019s appeal in cassation, on 29 January 2003 the Supreme Court upheld the lower courts\u2019 judgments dismissing the applicant\u2019s claim.", "In May 2003 the applicant filed an additional cassation complaint with the President of the Supreme Court, requesting that the proceedings be reopened. On 6 June 2003 the President rejected this request.", "However, in April 2005 the proceedings were reopened and the case was referred to the Plenum of the Supreme Court based on an application by the President of the Supreme Court. On 15 April 2005 the Plenum found that the Court of Appeal breached the procedural requirements by ignoring the applicant\u2019s request to order a DNA test. It further noted that such a test would constitute the \u201cprincipal type of evidence\u201d in this case. The Plenum quashed the decision of the Supreme Court of 29 January 2003 and the related judgment of the Court of Appeal of 13 May 2002 and remitted the case to the Court of Appeal.", "On 11 August 2005 the Court of Appeal instructed the Forensic Medicine and Pathologic Anatomy Department of the Ministry of Health to conduct a DNA test of the applicant, his former wife and her child. Despite having been notified about the time and place of the DNA testing, the applicant failed to appear for the test without any good reason. According to the Government, the applicant received several such notifications.", "Furthermore, although they had been informed about the time and place of the appeal hearing, neither the applicant nor his former wife appeared for the hearing. In such circumstances, on 8 December 2005 the Court of Appeal noted that it had been impossible to obtain DNA evidence due to the applicant\u2019s failure to cooperate. It therefore found that the parties (and in particular, the applicant) were not interested in obtaining new evidence that would enable the court to reach a different conclusion. For these reasons, the Court of Appeal again upheld the Ali-Bayramli District Court\u2019s original judgment of 10 January 2002.", "No cassation appeal was filed against the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment of 8 December 2005 within the statutory three-month period for filing cassation appeals.", "\u201c[T]he Supreme Court shall be the highest judicial authority with regard to civil ..., criminal, administrative and other disputes falling within the jurisdiction of the general and specialised courts.", "The Supreme Court [is] a court of cassation instance...\u201d", "\u201cThe Plenum of the Supreme Court shall be composed of the President, Vice Presidents and judges of the Supreme Court, the President of the Economic Court, the President of the Court of Appeal and the President of the Supreme Court of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. ...", "The Plenum of the Supreme Court ... shall, in the manner established by law, review cases under the procedure of additional cassation ..., on submission of the President of the Supreme Court, or pursuant to a protest by the Chief Prosecutor or appeal by the defendant ...\u201d", "\u201cThe President of the Supreme Court ... shall, in cases and under the procedure provided by law, submit cassation-instance decisions for the review of the Plenum of the Supreme Court...\u201d", "\u201c419.4.
