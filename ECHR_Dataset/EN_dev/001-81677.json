The Commissioner of Public Interest requested the court to conduct a public hearing and the applicant supported this motion.

Towards the end of the hearing, both the Commissioner and the applicant declared that they had no request for further evidence to be taken by the court. The court closed the hearing.", "11.

On 16 September 1999 the court sent the applicant the operative part of its judgment of 15 September 1999, by which it had found that the applicant had submitted an untrue lustration declaration because she had been an intentional, secret collaborator of the communist secret services after 1953. It further informed the applicant that the written grounds of the judgment had been prepared under Article 100 \u00a7 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that she could consult them in the office of its secret registry (kancelaria tajna).

Certain limited aspects of the Lustration Act 1997 have been examined by the Constitutional Court as to their compatibility with the Constitution. In a judgment of 10 November 1998, the Constitutional Court recalled the historical background to the Lustration Act and explained its purpose:", "\u201cAs can be seen from the legislative history, the main aim of the Act was to 'make it impossible to use a person's political past', the fact of cooperating with the secret services, 'for the purpose of blackmailing ... persons holding key decisionmaking functions in the Polish State'...", "The concept of lustration as adopted by the legislator, in respect of the subject of scrutiny, decision-making and possible sanction in lustration proceedings, is the truthfulness of the declaration submitted under Article 6 of the [Lustration Act]. Thus, as follows directly from the Act and from the Constitutional Court's judgment of 21 October 1998, the law does not associate criminal or quasi-criminal liability with the sole fact of past collaboration with the State's security services... The legislator's intention is that persons who are exercising public functions or standing for election to posts involving the exercise of public functions shall submit a declaration regarding cooperation. The purpose of such regulation is to secure the open nature of public life, to eliminate [the possibility of] blackmail because of facts from the past which can be considered as compromising, and to submit those facts for public consideration. The collaboration itself does not prevent any citizen from exercising public functions, and lustration proceedings are designed only to scrutinise the truthfulness of those who exercise or wish to exercise public functions. It is therefore not the collaboration, but the submission of a false declaration which has negative consequences for those affected.\u201d", "39. In a judgment of 21 October 1998 (K 24/98), the court examined the constitutionality of certain provisions of the Lustration Act as amended in 1998. These amendments concerned the provisions regulating the position of the Commissioner of Public Interest and, also, provisions to the effect that certain categories of persons, if found to have made a false lustration declaration, were to be regarded as having lost the moral qualifications necessary for the exercise of certain public functions.", "40. In a judgment of 19 June 2002 (K 11/02), the court held that certain amendments to the Lustration Act, enacted on 15 February 2002, were incompatible with the Constitution because Parliament (Seym) had failed to respect the legislative procedure provided for by the relevant constitutional provisions.", "41. In its judgment of 5 March 2003 ( K 7/01), the Constitutional Court examined the compatibility with the Constitution of certain provisions of the Lustration Act which created the obligation to publish a lustration declaration made by candidates to certain public functions insofar as they did not make any distinction between various categories of collaboration with the secret services.", "42. In its judgment of 28 May 2003 (K 44/02), the court examined the scope of the notion of secret collaboration as provided for by Article 4 of the Lustration Act as amended in September 2002.", "43. The court also dealt with other problems concerning the Lustration Act in its judgments K 39/97, P 3/00, SK 10/99 and SK 28/01.", "44. The following are extracts from Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe Resolution 1096 (1996) on measures to dismantle the heritage of former communist totalitarian systems:", "\u201c9. The Assembly welcomes the opening of secret service files for public examination in some former communist totalitarian countries. It advises all countries concerned to enable the persons affected to examine, upon their request, the files kept on them by the former secret services...", "11. Concerning the treatment of persons who did not commit any crimes that can be prosecuted in accordance with paragraph 7, but who nevertheless held high positions in the former totalitarian communist regimes and supported them, the Assembly notes that some states have found it necessary to introduce administrative measures, such as lustration or 'decommunisation' laws. The aim of these measures is to exclude persons from exercising governmental power if they cannot be trusted to exercise it in compliance with democratic principles, as they have shown no commitment to or belief in them in the past and have no interest or motivation to make the transition to them now.", "12. The Assembly stresses that, in general, these measures can be compatible with a democratic state under the rule of law if several criteria are met. Firstly, guilt, being individual, rather than collective, must be proven in each individual case - this emphasises the need for an individual, and not collective, application of lustration laws. Secondly, the right of defence, the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, and the right to appeal to a court of law must be guaranteed. Revenge may never be a goal of such measures, nor should political or social misuse of the resulting lustration process be allowed. The aim of lustration is not to punish people presumed guilty - this is the task of prosecutors using criminal law - but to protect the newly emerged democracy.", "13. The Assembly thus suggests that it be ensured that lustration laws and similar administrative measures comply with the requirements of a state based on the rule of law, and focus on threats to fundamental human rights and the democratisation process.
