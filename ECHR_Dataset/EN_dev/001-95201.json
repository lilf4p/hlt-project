At the material time the applicants were the owners, executive directors, editors-in-chief, news directors and journalists of four daily newspapers published in Turkey: \u00dclkede \u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem, G\u00fcndem, G\u00fcncel and Ger\u00e7ek Demokrasi. The publication of all four newspapers was regularly suspended, pursuant to section 6(5) of Law no. 3713 (the Prevention of Terrorism Act), by various Chambers of the Istanbul Assize Court, between 16 November 2006 and 25 October 2007, for periods ranging from 15 days to a month in respect of various news reports and articles. The impugned publications were deemed to be propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation, the PKK/KONGRA-GEL, as well as the approval of crimes committed by that organisation and its members.", "6. In the first case against \u00dclkede \u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem on 16 November 2006, the trial judge considered that the content of certain reports and articles contained elements of propaganda, the approval of terrorist crimes and had identified officials who risked terrorist attack, contrary to section 6(5) of Law no. 3713. Their content thus exceeded the permissible limits of Article 10 of the Convention. Moreover, the offences had not been limited to a single issue of the newspaper, but had been continuous. Consequently, he was authorised by section 6(5) to suspend the publication and distribution of the periodical for a period of fifteen days to a month.", "7. In the case against G\u00fcncel on 16 July 2007, the newspaper was suspended for 15 days, not by virtue of section 6(5) of Law no. 3713, but because its owners, journalists and content were the same as those of G\u00fcndem, whose publication and distribution had been suspended for 15 days by a court decision of 12 July 2007.", "8. Neither the applicants nor their representative participated in these ex parte procedures, and their written objections to the suspension orders were dismissed. Consequently, the orders were executed.", "9. The applicant Ali G\u00fcrb\u00fcz, the owner of \u00dclkede \u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem, was prosecuted under sections 6(1) and (2) and 7(2) of Law no. 3713, as well as Article 215 of the Criminal Code, for disseminating propaganda in favour of the aforementioned organisation, approving crimes committed by that organisation and its members, and identifying officials with anti-terrorist duties as targets, in respect of various articles published in their newspaper (case no. 2007/367). Ali G\u00fcrb\u00fcz was convicted and fined 380,000 new Turkish liras (TRY) (approximately 217,000 euros (EUR)).", "10. The applicant \u00d6zlem Aktan, the executive director of \u00dclkede \u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem and G\u00fcndem, was similarly prosecuted. Her first case concerning the former newspaper was disjoined from that of Ali G\u00fcrb\u00fcz. Her second case (no. 2007/197) involved another applicant, L\u00fctfi \u00dcrper, the owner of G\u00fcndem and G\u00fcncel. They were charged under sections 5, 6(2) and (4) and 7(2) of Law no. 3713, as well as Articles 215 and 218 of the Criminal Code.", "L\u00fctfi \u00dcrper was prosecuted on three other occasions on similar charges (case nos. 2007/419, 2007/343 and 2007/482). Another applicant, H\u00fcseyin Bekta\u015f, the owner and executive director of Ger\u00e7ek Demokrasi, was prosecuted for the same offences under sections 6(2) and 7(2) of Law no. 3713 and Article 215 of the Criminal Code.", "11. According to the information in the case file, all these prosecutions are still pending at first instance, except for that against Ali G\u00fcrb\u00fcz, which is apparently still pending before the Court of Cassation.", "12.
