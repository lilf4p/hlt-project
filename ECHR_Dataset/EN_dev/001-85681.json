The applicant is a privately owned commercial company, Regent Engineering International Limited, registered in Victoria (the Seychelles). The company\u2019s actual address is in London (United Kingdom). It was represented before the Court by its director, Mr Yuriy Portnik, who resides in London.", "7. In December 1998 COM s.r.o. (\u201cCOM\u201d), a limited liability company registered in Prague (Czech Republic) instituted proceedings in the International Commercial Arbitration Court at the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Ukraine (\u041c\u0456\u0436\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0446\u0456\u0439\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0430\u0440\u0431\u0456\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0436\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0434 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0422\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0456\u0432\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e-\u041f\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0456 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u2013 \u201cthe Arbitration Tribunal\u201d) against an open joint-stock company, Oriana, seeking an award for breach of contract. In particular, COM claimed that Oriana, a company registered in the city of Kalush (Ivano-Frankivsk Region), with 99.9% of its shares owned by the State, had failed to comply with its contractual obligations concerning the processing of raw materials.", "8. On 23 December 1998 the Arbitration Tribunal made an arbitration award (case AC no. 142y/98) ordering the Oriana company to pay COM the amount of 2,466,906.47 United States dollars (USD) in compensation.", "9. On 19 July 1999 COM lodged an application with the Ivano-Frankivsk Regional Arbitration Court (\u201cthe Regional Arbitration Court\u201d) seeking a ruling that COM was a creditor in relation to the Oriana company, on the basis of the 23 December 1998 award.", "10. On 2 August 1999 the Kalush State Bailiffs\u2019 Service of the Ministry of Justice (\u201cthe Bailiffs\u2019 Service\u201d) instituted enforcement proceedings against Oriana in order to collect the debt from it as ordered by the Arbitration Tribunal. These enforcement proceedings were joined to the other enforcement proceedings that were pending against Oriana.", "11. On 16 October 1999 the Regional Arbitration Court rejected the applicant company\u2019s request to initiate bankruptcy proceedings against Oriana.", "12. On 18 and 21 October 1999 the Bailiffs\u2019 Service initiated the attachment of the property owned by Oriana. On 13 December 1999 the Bailiffs\u2019 Service quashed the decision on the attachment of Oriana\u2019s assets.", "13. On 14 December 1999 the property owned by Oriana was attached again. On 16 December 1999 the Bailiffs\u2019 Service decided to sell some of the property that had been attached (the Oriana company\u2019s polymerisation workshop).", "14. On 20 September 2000 COM again requested the Regional Arbitration Court to institute bankruptcy proceedings against Oriana. It also sought a ruling including it on the list of Oriana\u2019s creditors.", "15. Between 1999 and 2003 the Bailiffs\u2019 Service took a number of measures to obtain payment of the debts accumulated by Oriana. In particular, it sent payment orders to the debtor\u2019s bank, seized its assets, prohibited the unauthorised sale of property belonging to Oriana and attempted to sell some of the company\u2019s property in order to pay its debts. It also attached the Oriana company\u2019s bank accounts and its shares (including the shares which Oriana owned in the Lukor company).", "16. At the same time, the enforcement proceedings were suspended several times because Oriana contested the bailiffs\u2019 actions before the courts and because its numerous creditors filed applications with the court seeking an insolvency order in respect of the company.", "17. On 18 September 2002 the Ivano-Frankivsk Regional Commercial Court (formerly the Ivano-Frankivsk Regional Arbitration Court) instituted bankruptcy proceedings against Oriana. These proceedings are still pending.", "18. On 22 January 2003 COM requested the Ivano-Frankivsk Regional Commercial Court to include it on the list of creditors of the Oriana company.", "19. On 10 February 2003 the applicant company concluded a contract with COM concerning the transfer of the latter\u2019s right to claim the debt awarded by the Arbitration Tribunal on 23 December 1998.", "20. On 8 June 2004 the applicant company and COM requested that the Arbitration Tribunal recognise the applicant company as the creditor in the arbitration proceedings against Oriana on the basis of the above-mentioned contract. On 21 June 2004 the President of the Arbitration Tribunal dismissed their request, stating that the Arbitration Tribunal had been dissolved after having made the award of 23 December 1998.", "21. On 9 July 2004 the applicant company and COM requested that the Ivano-Frankivsk Regional Court of Appeal (\u201cthe Court of Appeal\u201d) declare the applicant company to be legally entitled to the debt awarded to COM by the Arbitration Tribunal on 23 December 1998.", "22. On 16 July 2004 the applicant company and COM requested the Bailiffs\u2019 Service to change the creditor in the enforcement proceedings on the basis of the contract.", "23. On 9 September 2004 the applicant company and COM requested the Court of Appeal to declare that the applicant company was the Oriana company\u2019s creditor and to substitute the applicant company for COM as a party to the enforcement proceedings on the same grounds as mentioned above.", "24. On 10 September 2004 the Court of Appeal allowed the applicant company\u2019s request. It declared the applicant company to be Oriana\u2019s creditor in respect of the debt of USD 2,466,906.47 resulting from the arbitration award of 23 December 1998.", "25. On 18 November 2004 the applicant company and COM requested the Bailiffs\u2019 Service to substitute the applicant company for COM in the enforcement proceedings against Oriana.", "26. On 9 December 2004 the Bailiffs\u2019 Service substituted the applicant company for the original creditor in the enforcement proceedings on the basis of the ruling of 10 September 2004.", "27. On 29 December 2005 the Ivano-Frankivsk Regional Commercial Court (\u201cthe Regional Commercial Court\u201d) ruled that the Bailiffs\u2019 Service had to discontinue the enforcement proceedings.", "28. On 30 December 2005 the Bailiffs\u2019 Service discontinued the enforcement proceedings and transferred the writs of enforcement to Oriana\u2019s property administrator (\u0440\u043e\u0437\u043f\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043c\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0430).", "29. On 23 January 2006 the applicant company requested the Regional Commercial Court to amend the list of Oriana\u2019s creditors and to include it on this list on the basis of the contract of 10 February 2003 and the ruling of the Court of Appeal of 10 September 2004.", "30. On 6 February 2006 the Regional Commercial Court allowed the applicant company\u2019s request and ordered that the administrator of the Oriana company\u2019s property make the relevant amendments to the list of creditors.", "31. On 27 February 2006 the applicant company requested to be informed whether the Bailiffs\u2019 Service had substituted it for COM in the list of creditors in the enforcement proceedings against Oriana.", "32. The enforcement proceedings are still pending.", "33. Under section 12 of the Law (\u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u201c\u041f\u0440\u043e \u0432\u0456\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0456 \u0431\u043e\u0440\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0430\u0431\u043e \u0432\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0439\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0442\u043e\u043c\u201d), a commercial court is entitled to order a moratorium on debt recovery from a company which is the subject of insolvency proceedings. The moratorium entails a prohibition on execution by the Bailiffs\u2019 Service of judgments against the company concerned. The same section provides that a company protected by the moratorium is immune from any fines and other sanctions for non-fulfilment or improper fulfilment of its financial obligations during the moratorium.", "34. The Law (\u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u201c\u041f\u0440\u043e \u0432\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440i\u044e \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0443\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0443 \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043bi\u0437\u0430\u0446i\u044e \u043c\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0430\u201d) aims at protecting State interests with regard to the sale of assets belonging to undertakings in which the State holds at least 25% of the share capital. A moratorium on the enforcement of judgment debts has been introduced until the mechanism for the forced sale of the property of such undertakings is improved. No time-limit has been set.", "35. Section 2 of the Law provides that the prohibition on the forced sale of assets includes the execution of writs by the State Bailiffs\u2019 Service on the assets belonging to such companies. The Law therefore stays the execution of all writs by the State Bailiffs\u2019 Service in respect of the assets of undertakings in which the State holds at least 25% of the share capital.", "36. Under Article 214 of the Civil Code, in the event of delay in the fulfilment of its financial obligations, a debtor must, upon a claim by the creditor, pay the amount of the debt, plus any interest payable at the officially established inflation rate during the default period.", "37. Chapter 40 (\u201cCompensation for damage\u201d) of the Civil Code provides for compensation for damage and establishes the grounds for such compensation. Chapter VII (\u201cProtection of property\u201d) of the Ownership Act guarantees protection of property and allows for court action in such matters. Also, Articles 197-202 of Chapter 17 (\u201cReassignment of debts\u201d) of the Civil Code provide for the conclusion of transfer contracts and the reassignment of rights to claim debt recovery.", "38. Under section 2 of the Act (\u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u201c\u041f\u0440\u043e \u0432\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0434\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f\u201d), the enforcement of judgments is entrusted to the State Bailiffs\u2019 Service. Under section 85 of the Act, the creditor may file a complaint against actions or omissions of the State Bailiffs\u2019 Service with the head of the competent department of that service or with a local court. Section 86 of the Act entitles the creditor to institute court proceedings against a legal person entrusted with the enforcement of a judgment on account of the inadequate enforcement or non-enforcement of that judgment, and to receive compensation.", "39. Under the Enforcement Proceedings Act, awards made by arbitration tribunals (\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0456 \u0441\u0443\u0434\u0438) are subject to enforcement by the State Bailiffs\u2019 Service (section 3(1) of the Act) and are therefore treated as equivalent to judgments delivered by domestic courts.", "40. Section 11 of the Act (\u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u201c\u041f\u0440\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0443 \u0432\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0443 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0431\u0443\u201d) provides for the liability of bailiffs for any inadequate performance of their duties, and for compensation for damage caused by a bailiff when enforcing a judgment. Under section 13 of the Act, acts and omissions of the bailiff can be challenged before a superior official or the courts.", "41. There have been several resolutions of the Cabinet of Ministers in relation to the financial situation of the Oriana company:", "(a) no. 1650 of 19 October 1998 (on measures aimed at preventing Oriana\u2019s bankruptcy and on the transfer of the company\u2019s management to the Shelton enterprise);", "(b) no. 1280 of 16 July 1999, which quashed the previous resolution on Oriana (it also related to measures aimed at ensuring Oriana\u2019s financial and economic well-being and the restructuring of its debts);", "(c) resolution no. 800 of 10 May 1998 (on the approval of the list of enterprises exempt from land tax payment in 1999);", "(d) no. 92-p of 19 February 2000 (on privatisation of the Oriana company);", "(e) no. 314-p of 10 August 2000 (on payment of Oriana\u2019s debts for the loans it received);", "(f) no. 810-p of 28 October 2004 (suspending privatisation of Oriana, following the sale of 47.93% of shares in the Oriana company to CJSC Lukor, a closed joint-stock company founded by Oriana and Lukoil, a Russian company).", "42. On 3 August 2000 the Cabinet of Ministers adopted a procedure for payment of Oriana\u2019s debts from the State budget, amounting to USD 34,115,000.", "43. On a number of occasions the Government included Oriana on the list of State-owned companies which had strategic importance for Ukraine\u2019s economic well-being and security and were thus to be excluded from privatisation (see, for instance, resolutions nos. 1346 and 1734 of the Cabinet of Ministers of 29 August 2000 and 23 December 2004).", "44. The Government also undertook to fund compensation for environmental damage caused by the Oriana company\u2019s operations (resolution no. 593 of the Cabinet of Ministers of 18 July 2005).", "45. In its resolution of 19 August 2002 the Cabinet of Ministers adopted an action plan providing for the elimination of environmental damage caused by the operation of Kaliyny Zavod, an enterprise belonging to the Oriana company. The action plan provided for the allocation of 33,800,000 Ukrainian hryvnas (UAH) from the State budget for necessary environmental work during the period from 2003 to 2012.", "46. In decision no. 308-p of 3 August 2005 the Prime Minister ordered the Cabinet to examine Oriana\u2019s financial problems and to take the necessary steps for its economic development.", "47. Also, it ensues from the report of 15 December 2004 by the State Property Fund that the State, and in particular the State Property Fund, managed Oriana\u2019s \u201ccorporate rights\u201d (its corporate investments). In particular, on 26 May 2006 the State Property Fund appointed the State\u2019s representative to Oriana\u2019s supervisory board and ordered that the relevant structural department of the State Property Fund should issue a letter of authority for the representative enabling him to manage the State\u2019s shares in the company.", "48. In its judgment the Constitutional Court found that the Law of 29 November 2001 on the introduction of a moratorium on the forced sale of property complied with the Constitution of Ukraine. It also held that the Law at issue did not violate the constitutional principle of the binding nature of court judgments. Court judgments requiring the forced sale of the property of enterprises, given both prior to and after the Law was adopted, had not been set aside; they remained in force, and their enforcement was merely suspended until the mechanism for the forced sale of property was improved. That meant that the Law extended the term for enforcement of judgments during that period (\u201cperiod of legislative improvement\u201d).", "49. The relevant provisions of Chapter VIII of the Act, concerning the recognition and enforcement of awards, read as follows:", "\u201cIn matters governed by the present Act, no court shall intervene except where so provided in the present Act.\u201d", "\u201c1.
