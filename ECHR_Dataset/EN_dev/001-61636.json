The applicant was born in 1942 and is at present living in Diyarbak\u0131r, Turkey. At the time of the events giving rise to his application, the applicant was living in the \u00c7aylarba\u015f\u0131 (Dahlezeri in Kurdish) hamlet attached to T\u00fcreli village in the Lice district of the province of Diyarbak\u0131r. The application concerns the alleged unacknowledged detention and subsequent disappearance of the applicant's two sons, Servet and \u0130kram \u0130pek, in the course of an operation conducted by security forces in his village on 18 May 1994. It further pertains to the alleged destruction of his family home and property by the security forces during the same operation.", "11. The facts surrounding the disappearance of the applicant's two sons and the alleged destruction of his family home and property are disputed between the parties.", "12. The facts as presented by the applicant are set out in Section 1 below. The facts presented by the Government are contained in Section 2.", "13. A summary of the documents submitted by the parties is to be found in Part B. The witness evidence taken by the Court's Delegates at hearings conducted in Ankara is summarised in Part C.", "14. On 17 May 1994 the applicant and his son \u0130kram \u0130pek were tending their sheep away from the village of T\u00fcreli when soldiers approached them and asked them for identification. After being shown identification, the soldiers went on their way. The applicant's other son, Servet \u0130pek, had good relations with soldiers from Lice and had even made tea for them on occasions.", "15. On 18 May 1994 at about 10 a.m. the applicant, together with his son \u0130kram \u0130pek, was bringing his sheep back to their hamlet near T\u00fcreli village, when a group of about 100 soldiers in uniform raided the village. The soldiers left their vehicles outside the hamlet and entered it on foot. They were armed with G-3 rifles and other weapons. A military helicopter circled above the hamlet. The applicant has since learned that the soldiers were not from Lice, but from around Bolu. The Lice soldiers had told the applicant previously to be wary of the soldiers from Bolu.", "16. The soldiers told the applicant and \u0130kram \u0130pek to gather with the other villagers, that is, men, women and boys \u2013the young girls were told to remain in the hamlet \u2013 by the local school, which is located outside the hamlet. The houses in the hamlet cannot be seen from the school. One group of soldiers remained by the school; the other group went into the hamlet.", "17. The applicant saw flames rising from the village and his hamlet, and the women and children began to weep. The soldiers who were with them threatened them, saying: \u201cIf you start crying, we will burn you just like your houses\u201d. All the villagers then fell quiet.", "18. Both the applicant's and his brother's houses were completely destroyed by fire. After most of the houses had been destroyed, the soldiers released the villagers. But they did not release the applicant's sons \u0130kram \u0130pek and Servet \u0130pek, or Seyithan, Abd\u00fclkerim, Nuri and Sait Yolur. These men went with the soldiers in order to carry the latter's equipment to their vehicles.", "19. When the applicant returned to the hamlet, he saw that the houses were in flames. The young girls told him and the other villagers that the soldiers had thrown some white powder into the houses and had set them alight. The fires were so far advanced that there was nothing the applicant could do.", "20. Since a few of the houses had not caught fire, the applicant and the other villagers thought they could shelter in them.", "21. At about 3.30 p.m., the same soldiers raided the hamlet again. They asked why some of the houses had not been burned. When the applicant and the other villagers replied: \u201cwe did not put them out, you could not have lit them properly\u201d, the soldiers said: \u201cwe shall burn them now\u201d, and they burned the remaining houses. The applicant has since learned that the villages of T\u00fcreli and Makmu Kirami were also burned down that day.", "22. The applicant's wife Fatma then asked the soldiers, in Kurdish, about what had happened to her sons \u0130kram \u0130pek and Servet \u0130pek. The soldiers could not understand Kurdish, and asked what she had said. When the applicant explained that she was asking about her sons, the soldiers replied that they were in Lice and that they would be released soon.", "23. After this second burning, the soldiers waited in the village, and only left in the direction of Lice in the evening.", "24. Since his own house had been burned, the applicant with his wife Fatma, his son Hakim, and Sevgol, the wife of his son \u0130kram \u0130pek, moved to a house which had been evacuated two years previously in the hamlet of Kalenderesi, also attached to T\u00fcreli village. All they had left were the clothes they were wearing. Neighbours gave them a few more clothes. They remained there, in abject poverty, for some four months. The applicant has since moved to Diyarbak\u0131r. The Government have provided no aid or assistance to the applicant or his family ever since the time when his house was burned.", "25. Abd\u00fclkerim, Nuri and Sait Yolur, who had been taken into custody together with \u0130kram and Servet \u0130pek, were released the next day. They themselves did not speak to the applicant afterwards but informed him through a third person that they had been held together until 10 p.m. the first night with their eyes bound. At 10 p.m. they were separated from \u0130kram and Servet \u0130pek and they never saw the two brothers again. Seyithan Yolur remained with \u0130kram and Servet \u0130pek. All three have been missing ever since.", "26. About 15 days after \u0130kram and Servet \u0130pek were taken into custody, and having heard nothing about their whereabouts, the applicant travelled to Diyarbak\u0131r. With the help of a relative, he applied to the office of the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court (Diyarbak\u0131r Devlet G\u00fcvenlik Mahkemesi, hereafter DGM) chief public prosecutor. He also applied to the Lice public prosecutor's office and the Lice gendarmerie command. The applicant was unable to obtain any information about his sons from any of these State authorities.", "27. In the meantime, in a letter dated 15 September 1994, Mr \u0130brahim Erge, a senior colonel at the Chief of Staff in Ankara, informed Mr \u015eakir Yolur that the security forces had not conducted any operation on 18 May 1994 in the \u00c7a\u011flarba\u015f\u0131 hamlet of T\u00fcreli village attached to the Lice district and that his son Seyithan Yolur had not been apprehended.", "28. On 27 October 1994 the applicant filed another petition with the DGM chief prosecutor in Diyarbak\u0131r, asking him to investigate what had happened to his sons. The applicant was not permitted to meet the prosecutor, but a plain-clothes policeman who was there looked at the records and told the applicant verbally that the individuals in question were not there.", "29. The applicant's other son, Hakim \u0130pek, sent two or three petitions to the Governor of the State of Emergency. He received two replies consisting of denials that his brothers had ever been detained. He was so angry that he tore the letters up and disposed of the pieces.", "30. On 23 December 1999 the applicant went to the Kulp Gendarmerie Commander's Office at the request of the latter. He was asked where his sons were. The applicant stated that they had been taken away by the State. The gendarmes accused him of lying, insisted that his sons had in fact been taken by the PKK, yelled at him, and asked him why he was complaining about the Turkish State. Under duress the applicant was obliged to apply his thumbprint to documents prepared by the gendarmes, the contents of which were not made known to him.", "31. No security operation was conducted in T\u00fcreli village or in Dahlezeri hamlet on 18 May 1994. Neither the applicant's sons nor any other persons had been taken into custody.", "32. The applicant did file a petition with the DGM chief public prosecutor in Diyarbak\u0131r on 27 October 1994, stating that his sons Servet and \u0130kram \u0130pek had been taken into custody and requesting the prosecutor to investigate his sons' fate. The chief public prosecutor asked the security forces whether the applicant's sons had been taken into custody for an offence falling within the jurisdiction of DGMs. The security forces informed the prosecutor that this was not the case and the applicant was informed of this outcome.", "33. The applicant made no applications about the alleged disappearance of his sons to the offices of the Lice public prosecutor or to the Lice District Gendarmerie Commander. However, following the communication of the application to the Government, an ex officio investigation into the allegations was conducted by the Lice public prosecutor. However, it was not possible to locate the applicant at the address given by the applicant in his application form as submitted to the Commission. Moreover, the applicant was not known by the people living in the neighbourhood. His name was not registered in the registry of the head (muhtar) of the neighbourhood.", "34. The Government further stated that no evidence has been found during the investigation to prove that the alleged offences had been committed by the security forces and that the Lice District Administrative Council (Lice \u0130l\u00e7e \u0130dare Kurulu) had rendered a decision not to prosecute members of the security forces. It had not been possible to communicate this decision to the applicant as his address was not known to the authorities and the Lice Governor had therefore ordered the publication of the outcome of the investigation in a newspaper.", "35. The Government finally stated that the applicant had been invited to the Kulp Gendarmerie Commander's Office in order to make a statement as part of the administrative investigation in which the Kulp Gendarmerie Commander had been appointed as investigator.", "36. On 26 December 1999 the Gendarmerie Commander questioned the applicant in relation to his allegations and the applications he had filed with various authorities, including a certain \u201cEuropean Human Rights Diyarbak\u0131r branch\u201d. The applicant repeated his allegations that his two sons, \u0130kram and Servet, along with the Yolur brothers had been taken away and that all the houses in his hamlet had been burned down by soldiers. The applicant further deposed that he had not applied to the \u201cEuropean Human Rights Diyarbak\u0131r branch\u201d. Nor had he given any statement to the latter body or signed any document in respect of his allegations.", "37. The following information appears from documents pertaining to the investigation carried out following the communication of the application to the respondent Government on 7 March 1995.", "38. On 3 March 1995 Mr Sefa \u00d6zmen, a deputy to the Diyarbak\u0131r Governor, informed Mr Hakim \u0130pek, in response to the allegations contained in his petition of 23 January 1995, that the security forces had not conducted any operation in the region on the dates mentioned in his petition, that his brothers were not on the list of persons wanted by the security forces and that the whereabouts of his brothers were not known to the authorities.", "39. On 25 April 1995 the Diyarbak\u0131r chief public prosecutor instructed the Diyarbak\u0131r police headquarters to summon the applicant to his office so that a statement could be taken from him. The address of the applicant recorded in this letter is the same as the one given in the application form with the exception of the name of the block of flats. According to the application form, the name of the block of flats was 'Varol', but in the prosecutor's letter the name was recorded as 'Baro'.", "40. On 2 May 1995 the Diyarbak\u0131r police informed the public prosecutor that there were no blocks of flats called Baro in the street indicated by him. This letter went on to say that the applicant was not known by the people living in the neighbourhood and that his name was not registered in the registry of the head (muhtar) of the neighbourhood.", "41. On 18 May 1995 the commander of the Tepe gendarmerie station, in whose jurisdiction T\u00fcreli village was located, recorded in a report that Abd\u00fclrezzak \u0130pek and his family had left the village and had gone to the town of D\u00f6rtyol near Hatay to work.", "42. On 24 May 1995 the Diyarbak\u0131r chief public prosecutor sent a copy of the letter he had received from the International Law and Foreign Relations Directorate of the Ministry of Justice on 20 April 1995 to the Lice chief public prosecutor and asked him to investigate the applicant's allegations that his house had been burned down and that his sons had been taken away by the security forces.", "43. On 7 June 1995 the Lice chief public prosecutor sent a letter to the gendarmerie commander of Lice and instructed the latter to confirm whether or not an operation had been conducted in Tural\u0131 village on 18 May 1995 and whether Servet and \u0130kram \u0130pek had been detained. He also asked the commander to find out the applicant's address and to summon the applicant to his, i.e. the prosecutor's, office.", "44. On 13 June 1995 the Lice prosecutor sent another letter to the Lice gendarmerie commander's office and informed the latter that the name of the village was incorrectly recorded as 'Tural\u0131' which was within the jurisdiction of the town of Hani. The prosecutor repeated his requests in his letter of 7 June 1995 and asked the gendarmerie commander to look for the applicant in the village of 'T\u00fcreli'.", "45. On 20 June 1995 the Lice gendarmerie commander replied to the prosecutor's requests. The commander stated that the said persons had never been detained by his soldiers and that no operation had been conducted in the vicinity of T\u00fcreli village at that time. The commander finally stated that the applicant had moved to the town of D\u00f6rtyol in the province of Hatay to work.", "46. On 21 June 1995 the Lice prosecutor took a decision of non-jurisdiction and sent the file to the office of the Lice district governor. This action was taken pursuant to the Law on the Prosecution of Civil Servants Memurin Muhakemat\u0131 Kanunu) according to which authorisation must be sought in order to investigate the actions of members of the security forces.", "47. On 2 February 1996 the gendarmerie commander of Diyarbak\u0131r, in an apparent response to a request from the Lice governor's office, appointed Turgut Alp\u0131, a gendarmerie lieutenant-colonel, to investigate the applicant's allegations.", "48. On 28 February 1996 the newly appointed Lieutenant- Colonel Alp\u0131 instructed the Lice gendarmerie commander to forward copies of the names and addresses of the military personnel who had been working in the area at the time of the incident. He further requested copies of all operation reports, operation logbooks, custody ledgers and any other relevant documents.", "49. Also on 28 February 1996 Lieutenant-Colonel Alp\u0131 instructed the Diyarbak\u0131r police headquarters to take a statement from one Abdurrezzak \u0130pek in respect of allegations of village destruction and disappearances. According to this letter, Abdurrezzak \u0130pek was born in 1959 and living in Diyarbak\u0131r.", "50. The Diyarbak\u0131r police headquarters forwarded a copy of the statement taken from Abdulrezak \u0130pek on 8 March 1996 and a copy of his identity card to Lieutenant-Colonel Alp\u0131.", "51. Abdulrezak \u0130pek stated in his statement that he did not even know where T\u00fcreli village was and that his children had not been taken away by soldiers. In fact, he did not have any children with those names. According to the copy of his identity card, this Abdulrezak \u0130pek was born on 1 January 1959.", "52. On 12 March 1996 the Lice gendarmerie commander replied to Lieutenant-Colonel Alp\u0131's requests and enclosed copies of two pages of custody ledgers and copies of two pages of operation logbooks in which the day-to-day activities of the Lice gendarmerie were recorded. The Lice commander further stated in his letter that his soldiers had not conducted an operation in T\u00fcreli village on 18 May 1994 and that Servet and \u0130kram \u0130pek had not been detained. The letter further states that Major \u015eahap Yaral\u0131 had been Lice gendarmerie commander on 18 May 1994 but he had since been posted to another town in central Anatolia. Sergeant-Major \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc G\u00fcnl\u00fck\u00e7\u00fc had been commander of the Tepe gendarmerie station in whose jurisdiction T\u00fcreli village was located. He had since been posted to a town in the west of the country.", "53. Copies of the custody ledgers, which were enclosed with this letter, have been submitted to the Court. They do not contain the names of \u0130kram or Servet \u0130pek. A copy of the daily activities logbook kept at the Lice gendarmerie station does not mention any operation planned, or conducted, at the relevant time.", "54. On 25 March 1996 Lieutenant-Colonel Alp\u0131 concluded his investigation report. He came to the conclusion that no operation had been conducted by security forces in T\u00fcreli village on 18 May 1994 and that the security forces had not even gone to that village on that day. LieutenantColonel Alp\u0131 further considered that the statement taken from Abdurrezzak \u0130pek in which the latter stated that he was not from T\u00fcreli village and that his house had never been burned down or that his children had not been taken away, also proved that no operation had taken place. He recommended that authorisation to prosecute members of the security forces should not be granted as there was no evidence to prove that the alleged events had taken place. This report was forwarded to the Lice governor's office on 1 April 1996.", "55. On 16 May 1996 the Lice District Administrative Council, under the presidency of the Lice Governor, decided on the basis of the information submitted by Lieutenant-Colonel Alp\u0131 not to grant authorisation for the prosecution of members of the security forces. This decision was appealed against ex officio pursuant to domestic law.", "56. On 18 October 1996 the Diyarbak\u0131r Regional Administrative Court (Diyarbak\u0131r B\u00f6lge \u0130dare Mahkemesi), sitting as an appeal court, rejected the appeal and upheld the decision not to grant authorisation for the prosecution of members of the security forces. It had not been possible to communicate this decision to Abdurrezzak \u0130pek since his address was unknown to the authorities. Thus, the Lice Governor ordered the publication of this decision in a newspaper.", "57. Finally, the applicant has submitted a letter dated 21 January 2000 and signed by \u015eakir Yolur, the father of Seyithan Yolur and the uncle of Sait and Nuri Yolur who were allegedly taken from the village by soldiers and detained together with the applicant's sons.", "58. Mr Yolur, who also lived in the same village as the applicant, confirmed the applicant's version of events and added that Sait and Nuri had been released but that his son Seyithan had not been released. He has not heard from his son Seyithan since the incident.", "59. Mr Yolur made inquiries at various military establishments in the region and sent a telegram to the Chief of Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces in Ankara (Genel Kurmay Ba\u015fkanl\u0131\u011f\u0131) complaining about the disappearances in the course of the impugned events.", "60. The Chief of Staff stated in his reply that no operation had taken place and that the persons referred to had not been detained.", "61. The facts of the case being in dispute between the parties, the Court conducted an investigation with the assistance of the parties. In this respect, three delegates of the Court took oral evidence between 18 and 20 November 2002 from eight witnesses. A further three witnesses had been summoned but did not appear for various reasons. The evidence given by the witnesses may be summarised as follows.", "62. The witness told the delegates that he had lived in the hamlet of Dahlezeri outside T\u00fcreli village between 1969 and May 1994 when the \u201cGovernment destroyed the hamlet.\u201d About twenty families lived in the hamlet. The inhabitants were all in some way related. The applicant kept livestock and grew crops for his living.", "63. The applicant stated that two military raids had taken place on the hamlet on 18 May 1994. The first raid began around noon, at the time of the midday prayer. The soldiers gathered all the inhabitants (about a hundred) in front of the school, including the children. The village muhtar, with whom he enjoyed a good relationship, was not present. The men were separated from the women and children. When questioned by the Delegates, the applicant stated that the soldiers had collected the inhabitants' identity documents. No names were called out. Six persons, including his sons, \u0130kram and Servet, were led away by the soldiers. These persons were chosen at random (\u201cYou, you and you.\u201d) and were made to carry the soldiers' rucksacks. The soldiers returned the identity documents to the other inhabitants and then released them. During this time, the applicant could see that the hamlet had been set on fire. When he returned to the hamlet, he found that the houses, including his own house, belongings and livestock, had been burned.", "64. The inhabitants started to salvage their property and belongings. However, at 6 p.m., the soldiers returned and ordered everyone to evacuate the village. According to the applicant, an order was given to shoot the inhabitants if they tried to put out the flames. They were made to walk for a long time. During this time he could hear messages coming through on the soldiers' walkie-talkies to halt the operation. They were threatened that they would be killed if they tried again to put the fires out. On being questioned at the hearing, the applicant affirmed that he could understand Turkish. The applicant later mentioned in his evidence that other villages had been burned that day, including T\u00fcreli.", "65. The applicant confirmed his belief during questioning that the raids were conducted by soldiers. He related that they were dressed as such, carried G-3 or G-1 rifles and used military vehicles and helicopters during the raids. The applicant stated that he had never seen any members of the PKK in the hamlet. While there may have been clashes between the PKK and the security forces away from the area, there had never been any clashes in his neighbourhood. He maintained that there had been no PKK members in the hamlet. When questioned, the applicant stated that PKK members may have come to the hamlet and may have been given food since the inhabitants were afraid of them. According to the applicant, there were no village guards in the hamlet, although the authorities had proposed that inhabitants set up a village-guard system.", "66. The applicant further testified that the soldiers who carried out the raids were from Bolu. They were accompanied by soldiers from Lice. Soldiers from Lice had come to the area in the past to carry out checks. The applicant also affirmed that his sons \u0130kram and Servet had never been arrested by the security forces before the operation on 18 May 1994, and he could offer no explanation as to why they had been taken away. His son, \u0130kram, had returned home from Ankara two days before the military operation to enjoy a rest. His other son, Servet, worked as a shepherd.", "67. As to his own enquiries concerning the whereabouts of his sons, the applicant stated that he had applied to the authorities in Kulp, Lice, Istanbul and Ankara, as well as to the Human Rights Association in Diyarbak\u0131r. He deposed that, following the events of 18 May 1994, he had obtained from a soldier the name of the commander in charge of the operation, a Major Osman Duman. He had never disclosed that information to anyone before.", "68. The witness had been married to \u0130kram \u0130pek for six months at the relevant time. She stated that her husband had just returned to the hamlet from Ankara where he had spent three months. On the morning of 18 May 1994 her brother-in-law, Servet \u0130pek, informed the family that the hamlet was full of soldiers. Everyone was forcibly made to assemble at the school outside the hamlet. In the meantime, the houses were set alight. The witness stated that the raid occurred at 11 a.m. and that the burning took place at noon.", "69. When the inhabitants were outside the school, the soldiers took their identity cards. Six people, including her husband \u0130kram and her brother-in-law Servet, were picked out, apparently on account of their youth, and told to carry the soldiers' gear to the military vehicles.", "70. The remaining inhabitants were allowed to return to their houses at 1 p.m. However, with the exception of a few houses, everything had been burned down, including their family home and belongings. The soldiers returned to the hamlet again at around 6 p.m. with orders to kill the inhabitants. Houses which had only partly been burned or where the flames had been extinguished were again set on fire. The inhabitants were all led away from the hamlet. The witness stated that she could make out from the radio communications between the soldiers that the order to kill them had been revoked. They were released at 7 p.m. but ordered not to stay in the hamlet. The witness went to live with her parents in Diyarbak\u0131r.", "71. The witness had no doubts that the operation was carried out by Turkish soldiers. She was unable to assess how many soldiers were involved. She testified that there were no members of the PKK living in the hamlet and that she had no recollection of PKK members ever having come to the hamlet for assistance. When questioned by the Delegates, the witness affirmed that neither her husband nor her brother-in-law had ever been in trouble with the authorities. The witness stated that she was never requested by the authorities to give a statement about the above events.", "72. The witness is the applicant's son and the brother of \u0130kram and Servet \u0130pek. He stated that the events under investigation had taken place on 18 May 1994 when soldiers arrived in the village. He estimated that five thousand soldiers were involved in what he referred to as the \u201cgeneral operation.\u201d The soldiers approached the hamlet on foot from Pilgrimage Hill where they had left their military vehicles. They rounded up the inhabitants at the local school where they separated the men from the women. Everyone's identity cards were taken. The soldiers picked out six of the villagers including his brothers \u0130kram and Servet \u0130pek and the three Yolur brothers to carry their rucksacks back to the vehicles. The witness affirmed that he saw these individuals being led away on foot towards the military vehicles and getting into the vehicles. The soldiers handed back the identity cards to the remaining villagers who went back to the hamlet only to find that the houses had been set alight. The witness stated that his family's livestock and belongings had been destroyed. According to the witness, these events took place at noon.", "73. Some villagers attempted to extinguish the flames. However, the soldiers returned around 4 or 5 p.m. with orders to kill them. The villagers were rounded up and taken away. However, an order came over the military radio not to fire on the villagers. They were allowed to return but were threatened with death if they tried to put out the fires.", "74. When questioned by the Delegates the witness stated that there were no PKK members living in the hamlet or in the neighbouring village, and if any members visited they would be denied assistance since the inhabitants were afraid of reprisals from the authorities. Moreover, there were no guards in the hamlet - although the authorities had proposed the setting up of a village-guard system. The witness had no explanation as to why the hamlet had been destroyed and his brothers taken away. He did however refer to an incident in T\u00fcreli village about a half an hour away in which a number of soldiers were killed. The witness informed the Delegates that all the villages in the neighbouring region had been burned.", "75. The witness stated that he and his father (the applicant) had made many attempts in writing to find out from the authorities about the fate of his missing brothers. They were consistently informed that \u0130kram and Servet were not in detention. The witness stated that, out of anger, he tore up and threw away the replies which he had received from the regional governor. The witness told the Delegates that his father had been told the name of the commander of the operation by a soldier whom he had met in the Kiran neighbourhood. His father had written down the name.", "76. The witness stated that he had been born in Dahlezeri hamlet. However, at the beginning of 1994 he was living in Diyarbak\u0131r. There were twenty households in the hamlet and all the families were in some way related. He knew both \u0130kram and Servet \u0130pek. The witness had returned to the hamlet two days before the start of the military operation. He related to the Delegates that troops from Bolu and other areas had arrived in the vicinity on 17 May 1994 and that there may have been thousands of them involved in the operation. On the following day, all the villagers were made to assemble in a group in front of the local school while the soldiers, who had arrived in the hamlet on foot, burned down the houses. When questioned by the Delegates, the witness stated that five or six soldiers stood guard around the inhabitants outside the school, and he estimated that there may have been sixty to seventy, maybe even a hundred, soldiers involved in the operation in the hamlet.", "77. According to the witness, the school where everyone was grouped was ten metres away from the hamlet. He could see the fires burning in the hamlet. The villagers' identity documents were taken by the soldiers and six of them (himself, Abd\u00fclkerim Yolur, Sait Yolur, Seyithan Yolur, \u0130kram \u0130pek and Servet \u0130pek) were requested to carry the soldiers' rucksacks up to their vehicles which had been parked on the hilly area around the village. When questioned, the witnessed stated that the military vehicles were not visible from the school. The witness told the Delegates that the soldiers commented that Seyithan Yolur would be taken to Lice and conscripted into the army since he had evaded his military service. The witness estimated that the six of them left with the soldiers around 9 to 10 a.m. On their way to the military vehicles, he could see from a hill that smoke was rising again from the village. By the time they reached their destination, it was late afternoon. However, rather than being released, they were then taken in an open-top military vehicle to Lice along with fifty or sixty soldiers. He could see smoke rising from the villages along the route to Lice. It was dark when they arrived there. They were made to get out of the vehicle and to lie face down. The witness remarked that many other persons arrived around this time. He estimated that about one hundred and fifty persons were lying down in front of the establishment. Their identity cards were collected. The witness stated that he and two others (his brothers Sait and Abd\u00fclkerim Yolur) were taken to a custody room where they spent the night. They were never ill-treated during this time. In the morning their identity documents were returned and they were told to leave. The last time that he saw \u0130kram and Servet \u0130pek was when they were lying down after being taken from the military vehicle. The witness stated that when he arrived back in the hamlet, the houses had been burned.", "78. The witness had no explanation as to why he and his two brothers were released whereas the \u0130pek brothers and Seyithan Yolur were kept in custody. When questioned, the witness deposed that the place to which they had all been taken was \u201ca large military place in Lice\u201d.", "79. The witness had no doubt that the people who raided the hamlet were soldiers carrying G-3s. He had never heard of any PKK activity in or around the hamlet, and had no explanation as to why the hamlet had been burned; nor had he ever heard of a Major Osman Duman.", "80. The witness stated that he was from the same hamlet as the \u0130pek family. All the families living there were related. He had returned to the hamlet on 17 May 1994 from Ayd\u0131n for a visit. Soldiers on foot raided the village between 11 a.m. and noon on 18 May 1994. He was certain that they were soldiers since they were carrying G-3s. A helicopter flew above the area. The soldiers arrived in the hamlet on foot. The inhabitants were all made to assemble at the school on the edge of the hamlet, men on one side, women on the other. The soldiers took everyone's identity documents. He could see the hamlet being burned. Six of them (himself, Mehmet Nuri Yolur, Sait Yolur, Seyithan Yolur, \u0130kram \u0130pek and Servet \u0130pek) were requested to carry the soldiers' bags up to T\u00fcreli village. The soldiers kept their identity documents, but returned the identity documents of the persons who remained behind. They set off around noon with the soldiers for T\u00fcreli village, which was burning. They reached the outskirts around 2 p.m. Rather than being released as promised, they were made to await the arrival of military vehicles from Lice to take the soldiers back. The witness stated that T\u00fcreli village was burning at the time, although they did no go into the village and they did not see any villagers. The six of them got into one of the vehicles and set off towards sunset for Lice. According to the witness there were about one hundred soldiers in the truck. When they arrived in Lice, at the \u201cRegiment\u201d, they were made to lie on the ground and were divided into two groups of three. The witness was unable to confirm whether, apart from the six, there were other persons lying on the ground. One group comprised \u0130kram and Servet \u0130pek and Seyithan Yolur. The witness stated that this was the last occasion on which he saw them. Their names were read out. He and his brothers, Mehmet Nuri and Sait, were taken inside the \u201cRegiment\u201d and spent the night in a cell-like room as the soldiers' guests since by that stage it was dark. They were well-treated. There were two other persons in the room whom they did not know. When questioned, the witness was unable to provide any precise description of the building where he spent the night. He confirmed that the cell door was locked and guarded. The following morning they were handed their identity documents and released. He returned to the hamlet where he remained for one or two nights, sleeping in the open. When questioned, the witness stated that he had no explanation as to why \u0130kram and Servet \u0130pek and Seyithan Yolur had been detained. He had no knowledge of any PKK activity in the area and had never heard of a Major Durmu\u015f.", "81. The witness stated that seventeen or eighteen villages might have been burned on 18 May 1994.", "82. The witness stated that he had been serving in Diyarbak\u0131r when he was appointed on 2 February 1996 to investigate the applicant's complaints. He found no records at the Lice District Gendarmes Headquarters to indicate that \u0130kram and Servet \u0130pek had been taken into custody or that an operation had been conducted on 18 May 1994 by the gendarmes or military units. The commander at Lice was interviewed and he confirmed that neither of these persons had been taken into custody. The investigation was closed on the basis of the absence of documentary evidence that the \u0130pek brothers had been detained. According to the witness there was no need to obtain the operational records of the military, given that the Lice District Gendarmes Commander at the time had responsibility for the whole area. When asked about the possibility that the Bolu brigade may have been in the area at the time of the incident, the witness observed that the Lice District Gendarmes Commander would have been aware of this. The witness reaffirmed that he had established through the Lice District Gendarmes Headquarters that no operation had been conducted in or around 18 May 1994. When questioned, the witness stated that he did not find it necessary to ascertain from the Bolu brigade whether it had records of operations which it had conducted in 1994. He repeated that the district gendarmerie commander would have had any such information since he had overall responsibility for the area. It had been established that he did not have any information.", "83. The witness told the Delegates that he did not personally visit Dahlezeri hamlet or T\u00fcreli village since he knew that the inhabitants had all left. He knew the area, having served there and knew that the villages had been abandoned at some stage. The witness could not confirm whether Dahlezeri hamlet or T\u00fcreli village had actually been destroyed by burning. When questioned on this point, the witness observed that the terms of reference of his investigation also extended to the allegation that the hamlet had been burnt down. The Lice District Gendarmerie Headquarters informed him that this matter had been investigated and it was found that the hamlet had not been destroyed as alleged. The witness conceded that the report which was sent to him by the commander of the Lice District Gendarmes Headquarters only mentioned that no military operation had been carried out. The witness further stated that no villages in the area had been destroyed by military units. On the other hand, he had personally witnessed the burning of villages by the PKK.", "84. The witness declared that, with the exception of the first name and family name, he had no personal identification details of the applicant Abd\u00fcrrezzak \u0130pek at the time of his investigation. Thus, when someone of the same name was located and questioned by the Diyarbak\u0131r police, there was no reason to believe that the wrong man had been interviewed. No attempts were made to question other members of the applicant's family or inhabitants of the hamlet since they had no addresses for them. Moreover, there had been intense terrorist activity in the area at that time. The witness deposed that Captain \u015eahap Yaral\u0131 had not been questioned since it could not be established that the \u0130pek brothers had been taken into custody and, in addition, Captain \u015eahap Yaral\u0131 had been posted out of the area by the time he undertook his investigation.", "85. The witness confirmed that he had been the Lice District Gendarmerie Commander in 1994 and that his responsibilities included overall command of the Tepe gendarme station. His responsibilities had included T\u00fcreli village. He deposed that no military operations had been carried out in the area under his jurisdiction on 18 May 1994. Had any such operation been conducted on that day, either by the gendarmes or by the military or jointly, it would have been recorded in the log book of the district gendarmerie headquarters. The witness affirmed that the armed forces, including the Bolu commando brigade, would have notified his command of any operation which was to be undertaken, including on 18 May 1994. Notification of planned military operations was established practice.", "86. The witness stated that no purpose would have been served by visiting the Dahlezeri hamlet or T\u00fcreli village in the course of his investigation. The area had been the scene of intense terrorist activity and the villagers had been forced to leave by the PKK. The witness observed that there must exist a minute recording that an officer had questioned former inhabitants of the Dahlezeri hamlet. He stressed that the security forces had never engaged in village burning or forcible evacuation of villagers.", "87. When questioned, the witness reiterated that the names of all persons who were taken into custody were entered in the custody register. There was no reference in the register to the detention of the \u0130pek brothers. The witness noted that no entries were made in respect of persons who were in the gendarme station under observation, for example for the purposes of simple investigations.", "88. The witness, when asked if he had heard of a Major Osman Durmu\u015f, stated that there had been a Major Osman in the region at the time of his service there. He recollected that Major Osman was in the area in an advisory capacity to one of the battalions which was responsible for overseeing the local elections.", "89. The witness was the commander of the Tepe gendarme station between October 1993 and July 1994. He was responsible, inter alia, for ensuring the security of T\u00fcreli village and its inhabitants. He stated, however, that he had never been to T\u00fcreli or Dahlezeri during his term of service at the Tepe gendarme station. He explained that at the relevant time they were unable to get to the remote villages since they did not have a vehicle at their disposal. The witness did observe that the soldiers under his command would have visited T\u00fcreli village for the purposes of carrying out investigations. The witness deposed that no military operation had been conducted on 18 May 1994 in the region, either by the soldiers under his command or by the armed forces, including the Bolu commando brigade. If any such operation were to be conducted by forces not under his command, he would have been informed twenty-four hours in advance.", "90. According to the witness, there had been intense terrorist activity in the area, which forced many people to leave their villages and to move to safer places, such as Diyarbak\u0131r. He tried in vain to convince the villagers not to leave their villages. The villagers told him that they were sick of terrorists coming to their villages and forcibly taking their food provisions or abducting their sons. The witness rejected any suggestion that the authorities could have ordered the villagers to leave their villages or that they could have been responsible for the immigration from the region.", "91. When questioned about the allegations that Dahlezeri hamlet had been destroyed and that the applicant's two sons had been taken away by soldiers, the witness averred that he had never received any such information during his term of service. Had he ever been informed of such an incident he would have carried out an investigation into the allegations and would have reported the situation to the district gendarmerie command to which his station was attached. No application was ever filed about missing persons either by Abdurrezak \u0130pek or any other person. The witness further deposed that he had never been questioned by the Turkish authorities in relation to the applicant's allegations before the Court. The witness never heard of a Major Osman Duman serving in the area in question. However, he might have served in another division or at the Lice infantry battalion, which was stationed in an unused school.", "92.

The latter requirement of the provision does not necessarily require proof of the existence of any fault on the part of the administration, whose responsibility is of an absolute, objective nature, based on a concept of collective liability and referred to as the theory of \u201csocial risk\u201d. Thus, the administration may indemnify people who have suffered damage from acts committed by unknown or terrorist authors when the State may be said to have failed in its duty to maintain public order and safety, or in its duty to safeguard individual life and property.", "94.

Two principal decrees relating to the south-eastern provinces of Turkey have been made under the Law on the State of Emergency (Law no. 2935 of 25 October 1983).
