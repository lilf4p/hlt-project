The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in the city of Grozny, in the Chechen Republic.", "8. In the morning of 23 October 2003 the applicant, his parents Kh.G. and S.B. and three siblings, Z.G., M.G. and Z.Kh.G., were at home at 25, Shakespeare Street, Katayama district of Grozny.", "9. At about 7 a.m. on 23 October 2003 five grey UAZ vehicles without registration numbers arrived at the house. A group of twenty to thirty men got off the vehicles and burst into the applicant's house. The intruders were wearing camouflage uniforms with insignia on the forearm indicating \u201cArmed Forces of Russia\u201d (\u0412\u043e\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0421\u0438\u043b\u044b \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438), black masks and green helmets with plexiglass parts to protect their faces, those helmets being, according to the applicants, a usual part of the equipment of specialpurpose squads of the Russian security forces, such as the Federal Security Service (\u201cFSB\u201d). All intruders carried sub-machine guns, wore bullet-proof jackets and vests used for carrying full sub-machine gun cartridges. Some of them were, in addition, armed with pistols and were carrying black Kenwood walkie-talkies, through which they were communicating. They spoke unaccented Russian. According to the applicant and his relatives, the intruders' actions were very well co-ordinated.", "10. The intruders took the applicant's family members outside and searched the house, without giving any explanations or presenting any warrants. One of the armed men ordered the Gisayevs to produce their identity papers. Having checked them, he ordered his subordinates to put the applicant in one of the UAZ vehicles. Shortly thereafter the applicant was placed in the vehicle and one of the intruders, sitting in the front passenger seat, ordered another man, whom he referred to as \u201cNumber 12\u201d, to put a shirt over the applicant's head. He also told someone over his walkie-talkie: \u201cTo the base station, we carry out an arrest, do not disturb\u201d (\u201c\u041f\u043e \u043e\u043f\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043f\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0442\u0443, \u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0441 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0438\u0442\u044c\u201d).", "11. After the applicant had been put in the vehicle, his father repeatedly requested the intruders to explain the reasons for the applicant's arrest, to name the State authority to which they belonged and to which he could apply in connection with the applicant's detention. Although the armed men initially disregarded his questions, one of them finally replied: \u201cWe will check him and let him go. You can request further information from the FSB.\u201d", "12. Shortly thereafter the intruders got into their vehicles and drove off in the direction of the Staropromyslovskoye highway in Grozny. While the applicant and his relatives were outside, they had an opportunity to memorise several details concerning the vehicles. In particular, they noticed that they were armoured and equipped with loopholes for riflemen and had on their roofs square boxes with long antennas. Subsequently, the applicant and his relatives learnt that those boxes were containers for radio-frequency suppression, which formed part of the special equipment of the FSB and the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Russian army (the \u201cGRU\u201d).", "13. When the applicant's relatives went back inside, they discovered that some items and money had been taken.", "14. After the abductors had taken off with the applicant, they drove for about twenty minutes. On its way the vehicle honked while passing through a checkpoint, stopped for a while and then continued moving. Shortly thereafter the vehicle stopped and honked again and the applicant heard the sound of a gate opening. He was then ordered to get out. While doing so, he managed to look around and concluded that he was near the \u201cAvtobaza\u201d station on the Staropromyslovskoye highway, where the premises of the operational-search bureau ORB-2, the FSB, the Organised Crime Unit (\u201cthe UBOP\u201d), the military commander's office and the government of the Chechen Republic were located.", "15. The applicant's abductors took him inside an unknown building to a room located on the fourth floor, sat him down in the corner and handcuffed him to a heating pipe. When they left, the applicant managed to remove the shirt from his face and saw that he was in a room where there was a table and a chair. On the chair he saw a camouflage jacket with Russian military insignia on its sleeve. On the table there was a phone.", "16. Later the same day the servicemen interrogated the applicant as to whether he was a member of illegal armed groups or knew something about them. In his submission, they considered that he must have had that information based, among other things, on the fact that he had used to work in the Ministry of the Interior under the Maskhadov regime. He refused to confess to anything. They then threatened him with violence and mentioned that his family was in danger because of his reluctance to speak. Then they left the room and locked the door.", "17. After a while several persons entered the room; they asked the applicant if he had any information on the Chechen rebels and weapon hoards. The applicant denied his involvement in any illegal activities; the men beat him with a truncheon. Then they attached electric wires to his right hand and right foot and started passing an electric current through his body. They also burned his hands and feet with cigarettes, beat and insulted him. The applicant was denied any food and water. Then the servicemen again handcuffed him to the pipe and left him alone.", "18. Some two hours later five to six persons returned to the applicant's room and gave him some water. Immediately thereafter they put a plastic bag over his head. About two hours later a few more men entered the room. They plastered the applicant's eyes and mouth with adhesive tape and began to beat and kick him. The applicant was lying face down; one of the servicemen stood on his back. The servicemen connected an electric wire to the applicant's handcuffs and to the little toe of his right foot and passed, again, an electric current through his body. The men told the applicant that they would blow up his family house unless he confessed that he was a rebel fighter. They tortured him in that way for about three hours. At about midnight they handcuffed the applicant to the pipe and left.", "19. In the morning of 24 October 2003 the servicemen brought the applicant to the ground floor and allowed him to wash the blood off his body. The applicant discovered that his nose was swollen, his right wrist and right ankle were burned and one of his lips was badly cut. Then the servicemen brought the applicant back to the room on the fourth floor and continued to interrogate him even more violently.", "20. In the evening of 24 October 2003 the servicemen again used an electric current on the applicant, beat and abused him. Then they tied him to the pipe and left. At night the applicant moaned in pain; having heard the noise, the servicemen returned and beat him again.", "21. In the morning of 25 October 2003 two servicemen whom the applicant had not seen before entered the room and beat him. They threw some sharp objects at the applicant's head; when it started bleeding, they bandaged his head with a piece of cloth to stop the bleeding and continued to beat him. One of the servicemen beat the applicant on the abdomen and back with another sharp object, and kicked him on the throat and shoulder.", "22. According to the applicant, when speaking among themselves, the servicemen often used specific terms. In particular, some of them would ask others if anything happened while they had been on duty or when they would take leave. Over the phone, which was in the room where the applicant was held, the servicemen would inform their interlocutors that someone \u201chad gone to the military commander's office\u201d. In the applicant's presence they were addressing each other as \u201cNumber 6\u201d or \u201cNumber 12\u201d. On several occasions the persons who had tortured the applicant, when leaving the room, were addressing others saying \u201cYou have been called by the commander\u201d or \u201cGet down to the canteen and fetch us some food, don't forget the apples\u201d. Once at night the applicant heard the sounds of machine guns coming from outside. The person who was in the room with him took the phone and asked someone over it: \u201cWhy are you shooting?\u201d.", "23. On 25 October 2005 the man who had been in command of the operation when the applicant was abducted came to the applicant's room and told the others that the applicant's relatives were at the gate. He called someone over the phone several times asking if the applicant's relatives had left. He also told the person to frighten them to make them leave. Among themselves, the servicemen who were in the room were discussing how the applicant's relatives could have learnt about his whereabouts and from whom they might have obtained that information.", "24. Shortly thereafter, at about 3 or 4 p.m. on 25 October 2003 the servicemen put a black plastic bag over the applicant's head, plastered his eyes with adhesive tape and took him outside the building. Then they placed him in a car, put on some loud music and drove for around forty or fifty minutes. Despite the music, the applicant was able to hear that the car was moving through busy streets. He also heard the servicemen talking over their walkie-talkies. During the ride they told the applicant that they were going to shoot him. According to the applicant, the car was moving in the direction of the Minutka Square or Khankala. When the car stopped, the servicemen dragged the applicant out and placed him in a boot of another car. That car drove for about twenty or thirty minutes stopping four times, presumably at checkpoints. Then the servicemen took the applicant out of the boot and took him to the basement of a building which was unfamiliar to him. The applicant's abductors referred to the place as \u201cKhankala\u201d.", "25. In the basement the servicemen tied the applicant to a pole and started interrogating him. They asked him whether he knew anything about rebel fighters and weapon hoards; the applicant replied in the negative. The servicemen beat him all over his body, including the face, head and solar plexus. After two hours of beating they ordered the applicant to lie on the left side of his body and tied him to the table legs and left. When they left, he managed to lift the plastic bag off his eyes so that he could see a cellar of concrete blocks measuring around 5 x 10 square metres. After a while the servicemen brought him a blanket and a pillow.", "26. In the morning of 26 October 2003 the servicemen gave the applicant some tea and a piece of bread and asked him whether his real name was Lyanov, not Gisayev. The applicant replied that he had never forged his identity papers to change his name.", "27. While kept in the basement, the applicant had to lie on the floor covered with water. Occasionally he heard the noise of helicopters and armoured vehicles outside. At times different persons came to the basement; they threatened the applicant, insulted and beat him.", "28. On the fourth day of the detention in the basement a man entered and hit the applicant on the face. The applicant fell; the man ordered him to rise. Then two other men arrived; they put a plastic bag over the applicant's head, plastered his eyes and mouth and told him that his death had come. The applicant asked them to give his corpse to his parents after his death; the men replied that they would feed his dead body to dogs. For the next three hours they passed an electric current through the applicant's body and beat him. Then the applicant vomited and nearly fainted; he was bleeding. Later, when the applicant regained consciousness, several servicemen beat him again.", "29. Over the following days the servicemen repeatedly came to the basement and ill-treated the applicant; at times they used an electric current. They surrounded the applicant and took turns to hit him; they stood on the applicant's back and beat him with truncheons; they hung him up by his arms and left him hanging for a long time. From time to time they attached an electric cable to the applicant's ear and passed electricity though it. Several times they put a gas-mask on his face so that he was forced to inhale a substance with a strong suffocating smell.", "30. The servicemen threatened the applicant with murder again and again. They forced him to drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes to make sure that he was not a radical Islamic fundamentalist, which was particularly insulting for the applicant, a devout Muslim. They also put to him all sorts of questions concerning his religious beliefs and the Muslim traditions of the Chechen people in which they appeared to be interested.", "31. The servicemen spoke unaccented Russian; they employed legal terms used by the police and FSB officers. According to the applicant, there were offices above his room in the basement. He heard people saying that the special-purpose squad (\u201cthe OMON\u201d) had arrived, that someone needed to be sent to a particular location in a helicopter, that a special-purpose squad would take off to the town of Malgobek in Ingushetiya. Every morning a woman called \u201cNadya\u201d would arrive at the office upstairs and tell the others that she had had ordered from the stock a certain quantity of soap, bedding or tinned food. The applicant also heard the noise of armoured vehicles, helicopters and a working military radio station coming from the outside.", "32. On an unspecified date several servicemen entered the basement, put a plastic bag on the applicant's head, plastered his eyes with adhesive tape and told him that they were going to shoot him. They took the applicant outside the building and put him in the boot of a car. After a half-an-hour ride the car stopped; the servicemen took the applicant out of the boot and led him inside a building. There they attached him to a pipe and left.", "33. At some point the servicemen took the plastic bag off the applicant's head and gave him food and water. The applicant spent a day and a half in that room; he was not beaten during that period. Then the servicemen took the applicant to another room and handcuffed him to a bed. He spent two more days there. Then a man came who asked the applicant if he had seen any faces, apparently of those who had beaten him. The applicant replied in the negative. The man told him that he had not been detained but kidnapped.", "34. In the evening of 8 November 2003 the servicemen again put a plastic bag on the applicant's head and told him that he would be released. They commented that the applicant would have to leave Chechnya; otherwise they would kill him and his family. Then they put the applicant in a car; after a half-an-hour ride the car stopped. A man asked the applicant in Chechen if he was Akhmed from the Katayama district; the applicant replied in the affirmative. The man told the applicant to get out of the car and escorted him to another car. There he removed the plastic bag from the applicant's head and told him not to worry and that he would bring him home. The applicant saw that the man was his relative who was working with the law-enforcement authorities. When the applicant looked around, he realised that the cars were parked on the Staropromyslovskoye highway in Grozny near a fence over which was written \u201cMinistry of Defence of the Russian Federation\u201d, about five hundred metres away from the buildings of the FSB, the city military commander's office, the UBOP, ORB-2 and the Chechen Government.", "35. The applicant saw his relative give something to two servicemen wearing camouflage uniforms with the Russian military insignia. One of them, a forty-year-old man of medium height, carried a gun; the other was a tall brown-haired man in his mid-thirties. Later the applicant discovered that his relatives had paid a ransom of some 1,500 US dollars for his release.", "36. Then the applicant's relative brought him home. According to the applicant, he could not communicate the name of his relative because the latter feared for his life.", "37. The above description of the events is based on the applicant's fivepage typed complaint to the prosecutor's office of the Staropromyslovskiy District of Grozny dated 11 February 2004, his elevenpage written statement made on 26 March 2004 and his written statement of 21 June 2004; the applicant's father's statements of 26 March and 22 December 2004 and 2 February 2005; the applicant's mother's statements of 22 December 2004 and 2February 2005; written statements by Z.Kh.M. made on 6 July 2004 and 2 February 2005; a written statement by Z.M. made on 2 February 2005; a written statement by M.Z. of 2 February 2005; a detailed sketch of the area of the Staropromyslovskoye highway, on which are located the premises of the FSB, the UBOP, the ORB-2, the Ministry of Defence and other authorities mentioned by the applicant, with the indication of where those authorities' premises, as well as their checkpoints, fences and car parks, are to be found, accompanied by the applicant's detailed description and written explanation.", "38. On 23 October 2003 unidentified armed persons in camouflage uniforms and masks, driving five grey UAZ vehicles, burst into the applicant's house at 25, Shakespeare Street, Grozny, and abducted the applicant.", "39. On 23 October 2003 the applicant's father complained about his son's abduction to the prosecutor's office of the Staropromyslovskiy District of Grozny (\u201cthe district prosecutor's office\u201d) and the police. However, those State authorities denied having any information on the applicant's whereabouts and also refused to institute a criminal investigation into his abduction.", "40. The applicant's father also reported the circumstances of his son's kidnapping to the Special Envoy of the Russian President in Chechnya for Rights and Freedoms (\u201cthe Special Envoy\u201d) and the State Council of the Chechen Republic. On 28 October 2003 the Special Envoy requested the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic (\u201cthe republican prosecutor's office\u201d) that requisite measures be taken to establish the applicant's whereabouts.", "41. On an unspecified date in October 2003 the applicant's relatives applied to the local police in connection with his abduction. The police officers allegedly told them that in the early morning on 23 October 2003, while they had been on duty, unspecified FSB officers informed them over radio channels that the latter were carrying out an arrest on Shakespeare Street and that the police officers were not to interfere with the operation.", "42. On the same day two young men who knew about the abduction of the applicant allegedly came to the applicant's father and told him that they had been in the city centre on the morning of 23 October 2003 and had seen five UAZ vehicles, which had first been driven through the city centre and had then entered the premises of ORB-2, located on the Staropromyslovskoye highway near the premises of the UBOP, the military commander's office, the FSB and the Ministry of Defence.", "43. On an unspecified date the applicant's relatives went to ORB-2 and tried to obtain information concerning him. However, the persons to whom they talked denied having arrested him. At one point two men approached the applicant's relatives. They introduced themselves as FSB officers and asked the applicant's father who had given him the information that his son had been abducted by the FSB. When he refused to reply, they became aggressive and insisted that he tell them his source of information. Faced with his refusal to do so, they ordered him to leave, saying that the place was dangerous and that he could be shot dead. They also said that they did not have the applicant. Having heard that, the applicant's relatives returned home.", "44. On 26 October 2003 a friend of the applicant, an official of a lawenforcement agency, came to the applicant's relatives and told them that the applicant had been abducted by officers of ORB-2, which was under direct command of the FSB. He also told them that after his abduction the applicant had been held for three days on the premises of ORB-2 and then transferred to Khankala for further interrogation.", "45. Subsequently, the applicants found a person who was an officer of the FSB and who negotiated with the abductors the applicant's release in exchange for 1,500 US dollars (USD). The applicant's relatives collected the money and gave it to that man.", "46. Upon his return home the applicant experienced major health problems. He suffered from insomnia and severe headaches; at some point he had a fever. His extremities ached and wounds festered. He had bruises, burns and cuts all over his body. He was not able to walk on his own and needed assistance in moving around the house. The applicant's health was so poor that he could not visit a doctor for several weeks following his release. According to the applicant, after his release he had to undergo medical examinations and treatment on a permanent basis and to take various medication including painkillers, to ease the pain.", "47.
