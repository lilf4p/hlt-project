The applicant had DEM 5,593.49 and US$ 499.91 in his new bank account; and 646 French Francs (FRF) and small amount of Swiss Francs (CHF), pounds sterling (GBP) and Austrian Schillings (ATS) in his old bank account.

The claims of the holders of the frozen savings accounts had been regulated by the 1993 Act of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia because the country was facing a difficult economic situation. The court rejected the applicant\u2019s claim on the ground that he had not wished to withdraw funds from his savings account in order to purchase an apartment, business premises, or for other purposes set out by law.", "As regards the interest rate, the court held that since the applicant had not concluded a contract with the bank for putting funds in a notice account he could not have received the same interest payable to the holders of such accounts.", "On 6 March 1997 the Appellate Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal. It held, inter alia, that the applicant\u2019s allegations that the bank should have paid penalty interest were ill-founded, as the accounts had been frozen by virtue of law.", "On 18 March 1999 the Supreme Court upheld the lower courts\u2019 decisions. It held that the applicable law in the applicant\u2019s case had been the 1993 Act with its amendments.
