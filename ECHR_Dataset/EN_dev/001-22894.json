POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant, Zbigniew Pas\u0142awski, is a Polish national, who was born in 1955 and lives in Ustrzyki Dolne, Poland. He was represented before the Court by Mr Z. Cicho\u0144, a lawyer practising in Cracow, Poland. The respondent Government were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Drzewicki.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "On 28 February 1996 the applicant bought 3.71 hectares of land situated near the Bieszczadzki National Park in the Ustrzyki Dolne County. After consulting specialists in forestry, he decided that the nature of the land made it suitable for a commercial nursery. The applicant submitted that he had fenced the property with posts and planted 15,000 spruce trees on it. He intended to sell them as Christmas trees. The applicant used tree shelters made of woollen fabric and a chemical repellent to prevent damage caused by game. The Government submitted that the applicant had failed to \u201cproperly secure\u201d his property from game and hunters.", "During winter 1996/97 about 80% of the trees were damaged by game. The applicant estimated his loss at PLN 47,800. He replaced destroyed trees but in spring 1997 game again damaged trees. The Government contested the applicant's estimate.", "Furthermore, the applicant submitted that on numerous occasions he met on his plantation Polish and foreign hunters accompanied by a forest warden (le\u015bniczy). When the applicant asked the forest warden why they hunted on his private property he was told that his land had been leased to the local hunting club (Ko\u0142o \u0142owieckie). It followed that the hunters could take game on the applicant's land whether he objected to it or not, whereas the applicant himself had no right to hunt on his property. In addition, the forest warden stated that although he could see damage to the applicant's property caused by game, according to law nobody was responsible for it.", "Subsequently, the applicant complained to the Krosno Regional Office (Urz\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki w Kro\u015bnie), the Krosno Regional Directorate of Sate Forests (Regionalna Dyrekcja Las\u00f3w Pa\u0144stwowych w Kro\u015bnie), the Ombudsman and the local hunting club which leased his property.", "In a letter of 1 April 1996 the Krosno Regional Office observed that the applicant's claim concerned damage caused to a nursery and informed him that according to Article 46 (1) of the Law of 13 October 1995 compensation could be obtained only for damage to harvested crops or crops under cultivation. Moreover, the applicant was advised to approach the local hunting club in order to start co-operation in protecting his property from damage. Finally, he was informed that under Article 14 of the Law of 28 September 1991 he could apply for a subsidy to reimburse the cost of planting new trees if his property was covered by the official zoning map.", "On 30 July 1997 the applicant received a letter from the Ombudsman which stated:", "\u201cIn reply to your letter (...) concerning damage to your nurseries caused over many years by game \u2013 for which you cannot obtain compensation \u2013 unfortunately I do not have good news for you. I should explain the following:", "1) The question whether compensation should be paid is regulated by law (...). However, the currently binding law \u2013 as before \u2013 is very unfavourable to you and many other individuals. The presently binding regulations, i.e. the Nature Preservation Law of 16 October 1991 (...) and the Hunting Law of 13 October 1995 (...) allow only very limited liability for damage caused by game. According to those regulations, such a liability, i.e. an obligation to pay compensation, exists only in the following cases:", "(a) damage caused by bison, bears and beavers, or", "(b) if damage is caused to harvested crops and crops under cultivation \u2013 also by (...) boars, elks, deer, fallow deer and roe deer (...). However, damage caused by other species does not result in such liability. It follows that those who suffered damage [caused by such species] do not have legal grounds and possibilities to obtain compensation, as neither the State Treasury, i.e. organs of public administration, nor any other institution is obliged to pay compensation.", "2) The Ombudsman has considered that such a legal situation (...) should be changed since it is unfair and detrimental to citizens. The Sejm and Senate are competent to introduce changes to legislation which would create liability for damage caused by game. (...) In 1995, when the Hunting Bill was being considered by the Sejm, the Ombudsman pointed out to the Speaker of the Sejm \u2013 not for the first time \u2013 that the legal regulation of that subject-matter should be changed (...). Unfortunately, the Sejm adopted the Hunting Bill without taking into account the Ombudsman's submissions and did not extend liability for damage to all kinds of damage caused by game but instead practically repeated old regulations.", "Therefore, the legal regulation of that subject-matter has not been changed. Even if in the future the Sejm changes (...) the regulations (...), it will not be possible to receive compensation for damage suffered before the change [of legislation] because new regulations will not apply retroactively to damage caused before the date on which new regulations enter into force.", "The legislation presently in force does not provide for the liability of either the State Treasury or any other institution for damage caused, inter alia, in crops other than agricultural and therefore there is no legal i.e. judicial avenue to claim effectively compensation precisely because there are no legal grounds for such a claim. (...)\u201d", "Article 14, in so far as relevant, provides: (...)", "3. The official zoning map (...) designs grounds to be afforested.", "(...)", "5. The owners (...) of grounds can obtain subsidies from the State budget for full or partial reimbursement of the costs of afforesting grounds referred to in paragraph 3. The decision concerning the grant of subsidy to cover those costs is made by the mayor after receiving an application from an owner (...) and the opinion of the county council.", "\u201cGame, for the nation weal, is the property of the State Treasury.\u201d", "\u201cGame taken on hunting grounds (obw\u00f3d \u0142owiecki) in compliance with the legal regulations belongs to the lessee or manager of the hunting grounds, and on the land not pooled into hunting grounds \u2013 to the State Treasury\u201d", "\u201cHunting grounds consist of an area not smaller than three thousand hectares on which there exist conditions for hunting.\u201d", "\u201cThe Governor [establishes the borders of] hunting grounds and changes the borders of hunting grounds within his province by way of an ordinance which is issued after receiving an opinion of the Regional Director of the State Forests Administration and the Polish Hunting Federation.\u201d", "\u201cHunting grounds are leased to the local hunting clubs of the Polish Hunting Federation.\u201d", "\u201c1.
