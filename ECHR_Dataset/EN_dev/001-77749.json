BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6;Violation of P1-1;Pecuniary damage - financial award;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award", "JUDGES": "J\u00e1n \u0160ikuta;Josep Casadevall;Kristaq Traja;Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4;Nicolas Bratza;Rait Maruste", "TEXT": ["7. The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Banja Luka.", "8. Between 7 January 1977 and 31 January 1983 the applicant deposited in total 70,140 German marks (DEM) in her savings account at the then State-owned Privredna banka Sarajevo Filijala Banja Luka. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as in other successor States of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (\u201cSFRY\u201d), such savings are commonly referred to as \u201cold\u201d foreign-currency savings, having been deposited prior to the dissolution of the SFRY. The relevant background information on this subject is set out in detail in the Chamber\u2019s decision on the admissibility of the present application (see Jeli\u010di\u0107 v. Bosnia and Herzegovina (dec.), no. 41183/02, ECHR 2005-XII).", "9. On 31 December 1991 the balance in the applicant\u2019s account, which included accrued interest, was DEM 235,924 (in the former SFRY, foreign-currency deposits earned high interest).", "10. On several occasions in 1992 and 1993, the applicant managed to withdraw in total DEM 9,352, regardless of statutory restrictions which had been introduced in the late 1980s.", "11. On 3 October 1997 the applicant initiated civil proceedings against the Banjalu\u010dka banka, the legal successor of the Privredna banka Sarajevo Filijala Banja Luka, seeking the recovery of her entire \u201cold\u201d foreign-currency savings and accrued interest.", "12. On 26 November 1998 the Banja Luka Court of First Instance established that the balance in the applicant\u2019s account indicated above was DEM 295,274, including accrued interest. The court also found that the applicant had DEM 4,896 in another account at the same bank. The Banjalu\u010dka banka was ordered to pay the applicant, within 15 days, DEM 300,170 (approximately 153,475 euros (EUR)), default interest on the above amount at the rate applicable in the country of the currency (namely Germany) from 3 October 1997, legal costs in the amount of 9,076 dinars (approximately EUR 290) and default interest on the last-mentioned amount at the statutory rate from the date of the judgment.", "13. On 5 February 1999 the Banja Luka Court of First Instance mistakenly held that the Banjalu\u010dka banka had not appealed against the judgment of 26 November 1998 and accordingly issued a writ of execution (rje\u0161enje o izvr\u0161enju). On 25 February 1999 the Banja Luka Court of First Instance established that an appeal had in fact been submitted. On 4 November 1999 the Banja Luka District Court rejected that appeal and the first-instance judgment of 26 November 1998 therefore became enforceable.", "14. Meanwhile, the applicant filed an application with the Human Rights Ombudsperson, who referred the application to the Human Rights Chamber (the human rights bodies set up by Annex 6 to the 1995 General Framework Agreement for Peace).", "15. On 12 January 2000 the Human Rights Chamber found a violation of Article 6 of the Convention and of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 arising from a failure to enforce the judgment of 26 November 1998. The Human Rights Chamber held the Republika Srpska responsible and ordered it to ensure full enforcement without further delay.", "16. After the Banjalu\u010dka banka had failed to execute the judgment voluntarily, on 22 March 2000 the competent court sent a fresh writ of execution to the Republika Srpska Payment Bureau (Slu\u017eba za platni promet Republike Srpske).", "17. On 28 July 2000 the Supreme Court of the Republika Srpska rejected an appeal on points of law (revizija) against the judgment of 26 November 1998.", "18. On 8 November 2000 the writ of execution was returned to the competent court, execution having been impossible on account of a statutory prohibition (see paragraph 24 below).", "19. On 30 January 2001 the applicant converted part of her savings (DEM 20,000) into privatisation coupons under the Privatisation of Companies Act 1998. She subsequently sold those coupons on the secondary market, allegedly for DEM 9,000.", "20. On 18 January 2002 the privatisation of the Banjalu\u010dka banka was completed and the applicant\u2019s \u201cold\u201d foreign-currency savings became a public debt of the Republika Srpska pursuant to section 20 of the Opening Balance Sheets Act 1998.", "21. On 7 March 2002 and 9 February 2004 the applicant converted a further part of her savings (EUR 20,452 in total) into privatisation coupons as before. She subsequently sold those coupons on the secondary market, allegedly for EUR 8,794 in total.", "22. On 15 April 2006 Bosnia and Herzegovina took over the debt arising from \u201cold\u201d foreign-currency savings from its constituent units pursuant to section 1 of the Old Foreign-Currency Savings Act 2006.", "23.
