The respondent Government were represented by their Agent, Mr P. Vr\u0161ansk\u00fd, succeeded by Mr P. Kres\u00e1k in that function.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "On 5 November 1992 the applicant was granted a trade licence (\u017eivnostensk\u00fd list) entitling him, inter alia, to run a business in musical instruments. He thus became a selfemployed person. On 5 January 1993 the applicant registered himself with the health insurance fund (nemocensk\u00e9 poistenie) and with the pension fund (d\u00f4chodkov\u00e9 zabezpe\u010denie).", "In 1993, for income tax purposes, the applicant declared to have earned an annual income of 9,550 Slovakian korunas (SKK) from his selfemployment activity. In 1994 he declared an annual income of SKK 7,595, in 1995 SKK 11,050, in 1996 SKK 18,225 and in 1997 SKK 2,850.", "On 1 January 1995 the Social Security Administration Act no. 274/1994 Coll. (Z\u00e1kon o Soci\u00e1lnej pois\u0165ovni - \u201cthe 274/1994 Act\u201d) entered into force. This Act regulates inter alia the obligation to contribute to the health insurance fund and the pension fund, the calculation of these contributions and the modalities of their payment. Self-employed persons, like the applicant, are required to pay contributions to both funds, the amount of which is calculated on the basis of their average monthly taxable income gained during the previous fiscal year. The Act also defines the minimum and the maximum amount of such contributions (see under \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201d below).", "On 8 September 1997 the Trnava branch office (pobo\u010dka) of the Social Security Administration (Soci\u00e1lna pois\u0165ov\u0148a) ordered the applicant to pay within 15 days a contribution of SKK 24,978 to the health insurance fund and the pension fund for the period between on 1 January 1995 and 30 June 1997. This amount was composed of SKK 9,504 for the fiscal year 1995 (i.e. SKK 792 per month), SKK 10,236 for 1996 (i.e. SKK 793 per month until April 1996 and SKK 873 per month as from April 1996), and SKK 5,238 for 1997 (i.e. SKK 873 per month). The applicant was informed that failure to pay or a late payment entailed the imposition of a fine.", "The applicant filed an appeal with the Head Office (\u00fastredie) of the Social Security Administration arguing that, given his low income, he could not afford to pay these contributions. On 24 October 1997 the Head Office of the Social Security Administration upheld the decision of its Trnava branch.", "The applicant filed an administrative law appeal with the Trnava Regional Court (Krajsk\u00fd s\u00fad) against the decisions taken by the Social Security Administration. The applicant submitted that his income was below the statutorily defined minimal living standard (\u017eivotn\u00e9 minimum) and argued that, in these circumstances, he should be exempted from his payment obligations under the 274/1994 Act. In his opinion, the application of this Act in his personal situation was unethical and unconstitutional.", "In its judgment of 24 September 1998 the Regional Court upheld the challenged decisions. No appeal was available against this judgment. It became final and binding on 30 October 1998 when it was served on the applicant.", "In 1998 and in 1999 the applicant declared to the income tax authorities that he had earned an annual income of SKK 8,737 and SKK 675 from his selfemployment activity.", "On 17 May 1999 the Trnava branch office of the Social Security Administration ordered the applicant to pay within 15 days a contribution in the amount of SKK 20,742 to the health insurance fund and the pension fund for the period between 1 July 1997 and 30 April 1999.

The applicant has been unemployed since.", "On 3 June 1999 the applicant was informed by a judicial enforcement officer that enforcement proceedings had been brought against him in order to obtain payment of the contributions due as well as the fines for late payment. According to the applicant, he was thus forced to contract debts in order to pay the amounts due.", "On 16 November 1999, after having conducted an audit of the applicant's situation, the Trnava branch office of the Social Security Administration found that the applicant still owed a total amount of SKK 138,221 in fines for late payments of his contributions to the social funds for the years 1993 - 1999.", "Under Section 4a \u00a7 1 (b) persons who hold a trade licence for carrying out a small trade (\u017eivnos\u0165) are considered selfemployed persons.", "Section 6 \u00a7 1 (c) provided that selfemployed persons took part in and were entitled to benefit from the pension schemes.

Under Section 145ba \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 the amount of such benefits is calculated as a daily average of the \u201cassessment basis\u201d (see below).", "Under Section 14 \u00a7\u00a7 1 (b) and 2 selfemployed persons are liable to pay contributions to the health insurance fund and the pension fund.", "According to Section 15 \u00a7 1 the level of these contributions are a \u201cpercentage\u201d of the \u201cassessment basis\u201d (vymeriavac\u00ed z\u00e1klad), which is 50% of the average monthly taxable income earned by a self-employed person during the previous fiscal year (Section 16 \u00a7 4 in conjunction with Section 17 \u00a7 2 of the Act).", "The \u201cpercentages\u201d applicable to selfemployed persons varied in the course of the material period. Until 31 December 1995 it was 4.8 % for the health insurance fund and 27.5 % for the pension fund. Since 1 January until 31 December 1996 the applicable \u201cpercentages\u201d were respectively 3.8 % and 28.5 %. Since 1 January 1997 these \u201cpercentage\u201d changed again to 4.8 % and 27.5 %, respectively.", "However, regardless of income actually earned by a selfemployed person during the previous fiscal year, Section 16 \u00a7 8 provides that his or her personal \u201cassessment basis\u201d cannot be lower than the statutorily defined \u201cminimal assessment basis\u201d and cannot be higher than the statutorily defined \u201cmaximal assessment basis\u201d. The minimal basis is equal to the statutorily defined \u201cminimum wage\u201d (see below) and the maximal basis is this \u201cminimum wage\u201d multiplied by eight.", "Until 31 March 1996, the \u201cminimum wage\u201d was defined by the governmental Decree no. 53/1992 Coll. on Minimum Wage (Nariadenie vl\u00e1dy o minim\u00e1lnej mzde), as amended.
