De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["5. The applicant, Mrs Bj\u00f6rk Ei\u00f0sd\u00f3ttir, is an Icelandic national who was born in 1974 and lives in Reykjav\u00edk. At the material time she worked as a journalist for Vikan, a weekly magazine.", "6. In 2007 there was a public debate in the print and televised media in Iceland on whether the regulations pertaining to strip clubs should be made stricter or whether such clubs should be banned. In June 2007 a magazine named \u00cdsafold published an article discussing the links between such clubs and prostitution. It maintained that the conditions of strip club dancers originating from eastern Europe could be compared to human trafficking as defined in the relevant United Nations instruments.", "7. Subsequently, Vikan published in its issue no. 31 interviews with three east European women who worked at a strip club called Goldfinger owned by Mr Y. They had stated that they were happy working for Mr Y and that the critical remarks made about strip clubs could only be explained by the envy of certain other women. In the same issue, Vikan published the interviews of two anonymous strip dancers who described negative aspects of their jobs, namely that it was accompanied by prostitution and drug addiction.", "8. Thereafter Vikan was contacted by a young Icelandic woman, Mrs Z, who offered to tell her story. She was a former strip dancer who had worked at several strip clubs and had worked for Mr Y. She said that she had felt offended at seeing strip dancing being portrayed as a glamorous career. Mrs Z met the applicant for an interview, which the applicant tape recorded and then typed up on the basis of the recording. The applicant sent the typed version to Mrs Z by e-mail for confirmation and consent to publish the story. Mrs Z responded in the affirmative.", "9. On 23 August 2007 Vikan published in its issue no. 34 an article based on the interview conducted by the applicant with Mrs Z. An introduction referred to the above-mentioned coverage in issue no. 31. In the interview, Mrs Z described her work as a striptease dancer in various establishments, notably at Goldfinger owned Mr Y. The article, which had a number of sub-headings, comprised, inter alia, Mrs Z\u2019s description of prostitution which she was reported to have said went on unhindered in these establishments, for example at Goldfinger; her drug addiction after she had started working as a striptease dancer; and threats she had been subjected to in connection with her work. The front cover of the magazine displayed a photograph of Mrs Z, which was also found on the first inside page of the magazine next to an editorial by Mrs G.E.A., the magazine\u2019s editor, dealing with the above-mentioned article. Photographs of Mrs Z also featured on the title page of the article, next to its main text and a photograph of Mr Y.", "10. Alongside the latter photograph it was stated that the magazine had contacted him and had asked his opinion about Mrs Z\u2019s account that he \u201cencourage[d] girls who work[ed] for him to engage in prostitution and act[ed] as an intermediary in this respect\u201d. It was further stated:", "\u201c[Mr Y] totally rejected this. \u2018I can categorically state that not one of my girl employees is encouraged to engage in prostitution. But, on the other hand, I cannot prohibit acts by them in their free time.\u2019 When it was put to him that prostitution reportedly took place within the walls of his club, his answer was that this was not, to his knowledge, true to fact. \u2018This is simply a tremendous lie and it seems that those who are successful must always be slandered. I have always tried to act as fairly as I possibly can towards my girls. I have been active in this branch for nine years, and I would not have retained my employees if I had asked them to do something against their will, ... [Mr Y] also was of the view that Vikan\u2019s account of these matters was prompted by vicarious considerations, as Vikan was published by the same company as Mannl\u00edf and \u00cdsafold, against which he said that he had initiated legal proceedings. [Mr Y] was emphatic that no falsehood should be published about him or his business, and finally stated: \u2018I hope to God that you will not have any troubles on account of what you publish in your magazine.\u2019\u201d", "11. On 5 and 6 September 2007 Mr Y lodged defamation proceedings against the applicant, the editor, Mrs G.E.A., and Mrs Z before the Reykjav\u00edk District Court. In his writ, in which he set out the four judicial claims described below, he requested that the following statements published by Vikan in the relevant issue, be declared null and void (dau\u00f0 og \u00f3merk):", "A. \u201cI ended up working for [Mr Y], but there was a lot of prostitution at his clubs, and huge pressure was placed upon the girls who worked for him to engage in such activities.\u201d", "B. \u201c[Mr Y] has always been strongly involved in prostitution which occurs inside his clubs. After dancing in private was banned, the prostitution has simply been carried out behind curtains allegedly used for the purpose of talking to the clients in private.\u201d", "C. \u201cIt varies a lot whether the clients pay [Mr Y] himself for the service or deal directly with the girls...\u201d", "D. \u201cI have overcome my fear of those men, although I have certainly been threatened with death and for a while I was too afraid to leave the house.\u201d", "E. \u201cThe girls he employs come here temporarily for three months at a time and are treated as if they were in prison.\u201d", "F. \u201cIn between, they are really under house arrest in the building apart from a period of time during which they are permitted to go outside.\u201d", "G. \u201cThe reason for this is that girls were discovered to have found clients for themselves outside the club without [Mr Y] receiving a share of the fee; he wants to control the prostitution himself.\u201d", "A. \u201cProstitution the rule rather than the exception.\u201d", "B. \u201cThreatened with death.\u201d", "C. \u201cBrought to Iceland without any suspicion of what was going to happen.\u201d", "A. \u201cThreatened with death if she told anyone.\u201d [Published as a heading on the front page.]", "B. \u201c[Mrs Z] worked as a stripper and tells the Vikan reporter all about the prostitution and the threats to her life.\u201d [Published in a summary in the table of contents.]", "C. \u201c[Mrs Z] says the prostitution is allowed to continue unhindered and that it is conspicuous inside the striptease clubs.\u201d [Published in a summary in the table of contents.]", "\u201c[Mrs Z.] is incredibly brave to have the courage to step forward and tell her story despite having been threatened with death ... .\u201d", "12. Mr Y argued that the responsibility for the statements in judicial claim no. 1 lay mainly with Mrs Z or, in the alternative, with the applicant as the author of the article. The latter was responsible for the remarks in judicial claim no. 2 and the defendant G.E.A., as the magazine\u2019s editor, was responsible for the remarks in judicial claim no. 3. Alternatively, in the event that the court did not accept this claim, Mr Y requested that the applicant be held responsible as the author of the article referred to in the heading and summary in question.", "13. In addition, Mr Y requested an order that the respondents, jointly and severally, be ordered to pay him 5,000,000 Icelandic kr\u00f3nur (ISK) in respect of damages and ISK 800,000 to cover the cost of publishing the judgment in the case in three newspapers and also in the following issue of Vikan.", "14. In disputing the above claims, the applicant and the editor of Vikan argued inter alia:", "\u201cMost people would agree that the plaintiff is a controversial individual because of the activities in which he has been involved in Reykjav\u00edk and K\u00f3pavogur. The debate relating to the connection between striptease dancing and prostitution is tenacious, not least because abroad such operations are often run side by side, openly and in a legal manner, but also because of the nature of these activities. As an example of the persistence of such rumours in Iceland, a report on human trafficking in Iceland (court document no. 7), by the US Embassy in Iceland, dating from 2006, could be mentioned. At page 3 of the report, it is stated that during its compilation, a member of the embassy staff was offered sexual services at the restaurant Goldfinger. It is an established fact that the operation of pole-dancing establishments comprises obtaining girls, for the most part foreign nationals, for the purpose of dancing scantily clad or nude in front of the clients of the establishment, or in private cubicles, and, as indicated by the term, it is hard to observe everything that goes on inside such closedoff spaces. Furthermore, the plaintiff has admitted in public that there have been incidents at Goldfinger where clients were offered sexual services, cf. an interview with the plaintiff on Channel 2, 1 June 2007 (court document no. 6). Because of the mystique, among other things, which to most people, surrounds such activities as well as persistent rumours regarding prostitution and human trafficking, the defendants felt that a discussion of this matter would be of interest and relevance to the general public. The defendants refer, for example, to a news item contained in court document no. 9, which cites the Chief of Police in Reykjav\u00edk as stating in his report regarding a licence for Goldfinger that European research has shown striptease dancers to be subjected to various kinds of abuse and, in many cases, they become the victims of human trafficking or other crimes. The defendants feel that the plaintiff has to accept and tolerate controversial discussion with regard to the operation of Goldfinger .... The presentation of the plaintiff\u2019s case, however, is characterised by the shortcoming that he appears to identify himself with the operation of all the poledancing establishments in Iceland.\u201d", "15. In the course of the oral proceedings before the District Court, Mr Y and Mrs Z concluded a judicial settlement agreement, whereby he withdrew his action against her. He maintained his claims against the applicant and the editor.", "16. By a judgment of 4 April 2008 the District Court found that several of the statements originating from Mrs Z had been defamatory and that she in principle could be held liable but the action against her had been withdrawn. In contrast, the applicant and the editor could not be held liable and so the District Court dismissed Mr Y\u2019s action against them.", "17. Mr Y then appealed against the District Court\u2019s judgment to the Supreme Court.", "18. The applicant and the editor referred to their arguments before the District Court and disputed that the allegations that had formed the subjectmatter of Mr Y\u2019s defamation action had constituted defamatory statements and innuendos against him. In any event, with regard to judicial claim no. 1, according to section 15 of the Printing Act, the respondents could not be held responsible for the affirmations made by Mrs Z in the interview and who ought to be considered as their author. As to judicial claim no. 2, the disputed sub-headings had not contained innuendos directed against the appellant\u2019s honour or allegations to the effect that he had organised prostitution or other illicit activities. The interview had been conducted with Mrs Z who had spoken unreservedly about her experience of working as a striptease dancer in a number of striptease establishments. In processing the interview the applicant had used sub-headings in order to divide the text into chapters for clarification and to highlight each topic separately. She had only referred to the interviewee\u2019s words and had made no independent contribution. The same or similar considerations applied to judicial claims nos. 3 and 4. The conditions for liability under section 26 of the Damage Compensation Act no. 50/1993 had not been fulfilled. The respondents had not made any allegations that exceeded their constitutionally protected right to freedom of expression (Article 73 of the Icelandic Constitution).", "19. By a judgment of 5 March 2009 the Supreme Court rejected Mr Y\u2019s appeal in so far as it concerned the editor. In so far as it concerned the applicant, it upheld judicial claim no. 1, items A to C and E to G, and judicial claim no. 2, item A. It ordered the applicant to pay the appellant ISK 500,000 (approximately 3,000 euros (EUR)) in compensation for nonpecuniary damage and ISK 400,000, plus interest, for his costs before the District Court and the Supreme Court. Its judgment contained the following reasons:", "\u201cThe main issue in dispute in the present case is whether the respondents are liable on the basis of section 15 (2) and (3) of the Printing Act, No. 57/1956 for statements that [the applicant] had cited from the interviewee and whether headings and references which the respondents themselves had created, which they maintained was done in close connection with the words used by their interviewee, fell within the provision on freedom of expression in Article 73 of the Icelandic Constitution. The grounds of the case of each party are sufficiently described in the judgment which is being challenged. As indicated therein, the plaintiff based his claim for the annulment of the remarks in judicial claim no. 1, items A to G, on the premise that they contained defamatory innuendos regarding his character, which are the responsibility of the [applicant] as the author of the article, see section 15 (2) of Act No. 57/1956. The title page of the article stated that its text had been prepared by [the applicant]. She confirmed at the court hearing that she had been the author of the article and had also formulated the sub-headings. She had determined the wording of the sub-headings, which, like the article, contained a near-verbatim rendering of [Mrs Z]\u2019s statements. This was indeed her ([Mrs Z]\u2019s) account. [The applicant] stated that she had tape-recorded the interview, used the recording as a foundation for the article and had sent the result to [Mrs Z]. Subsequently [Mrs Z] had confirmed by email that this was an accurate rendering of her account. When comparing the manuscript of the interview and its tape-recording, on the one hand, and the article in question with its subheadings, on the other hand, it is however clear that this is not a verbatim rendering of the interviewee\u2019s statements. However, it is also clear that the [applicant] in the main accurately rendered the substance of what her interviewee had said. As mentioned above, she had later confirmed that her story had been accurately rendered. Since the [applicant] is, as stated on the front page [...], the author of the text and has admitted to having written the article and its sub-headings, she is considered to be the author of the article and the sub-headings in the sense of section 15 (2) of Act No. 57/1956 and as such bears responsibility for this work. It is of no consequence whether [Mrs Z] may also be regarded as the author of the article in the sense of this provision of the law.", "By the remarks identified in items A, B, \u0421 and D of judicial claim no. 1 of his claim, the plaintiff [Mr Y] is alleged to be guilty of offences under Article 206 of the Penal Code [...], by organising for his own profit prostitution among the girls working for him on his premises and by exerting pressure on them for this purpose. The words in items \u0395 and F, however, convey the suggestion that Mr Y had deprived the girls who worked for him of their freedom, which constituted an offence under Article 226 of the Penal Code. The main text under the sub-heading \u2018Prostitution the rule rather than the exception\u2019 contained, inter alia, the words specified in items A and B of judicial claim no. 1, as well as other allegations relating to [Mr Y] and his striptease premises, Goldfinger. It is clear from the relationship between the main text and the heading, that the heading is directed against [Mr Y]. The same applies to this heading as to the remarks in judicial claim items A, B., \u0421 and G above. The remarks identified in items A, B, C, E, F and G of judicial claim no. 1 and the sub-heading referred to in item A of judicial claim no. 2 constitute a violation of Article 235 of the Penal Code. They do not comprise an expression of opinion or values but statements of fact that are not covered by Article 73 of the Icelandic Constitution with respect to freedom of expression. In accordance with Article 241 (1) of the Code they are declared null and void by the court.", "The words mentioned in item D of judicial claim no. 1 were directed against unspecified persons, not against the appellant [Mr Y]. The sub-headings in items B and C of judicial claim no. 2 were of a general nature; nor did the text below those headings appear to link them to [Mr Y]. Therefore, the [applicant] is acquitted with respect to those judicial claims. The words indicated in judicial claim nos. 3 and 4 of the claim, for which the respondent [editor, G.E.A.] bears responsibility according to section 15 (3) of Act No. 57/1956, are also of a general nature and she is therefore acquitted with respect to these judicial claims.", "The reasoning and conclusions of the present judgment are to be published in the first issue of Vikan that appears after its delivery. However, the claim in respect of expenses for further publication are rejected.", "Under section 26 (1)(b) of the Damage Compensation Act No. 50/1993, [Mr Y] is awarded compensation, to be paid by [the applicant] with respect to the abovementioned defamatory statements, in an amount of ISK 500,000, plus interest [...], which is deemed actionable. In accordance with this conclusion, the [applicant] is ordered to pay the appellant legal costs before the District Court and the Supreme Court [...]. In other respects, legal costs are not recoverable.\u201d", "20.
