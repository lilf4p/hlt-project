The applicant was born in 1944 and lives in the city of Yalta, Ukraine.", "9. In March 2000 the applicant lodged a claim with the Yalta City Court against the local social welfare department, challenging the refusal of the latter to award her a higher pension. In her claim, the applicant maintained that, under Article 46 of the Constitution and Article 19 of the Law on Pensions, her pension should not be lower than the minimum living standard. Therefore, given that her pension was fixed at UAH 74.70 per month and the minimum living standard was established at UAH 118.30 per month, the applicant claimed a corresponding increase in her pension.", "10. On 4 April 2000 the court decided against the applicant. The court established in particular that, although Article 19 of the Law on Pensions provided the possibility for a higher pension, it also limited the amount to a maximum sum which the applicant in fact received. The court did not consider the applicant\u2019s argument about the inconsistency of the amount of her pension with the minimum living standard guaranteed by Article 46 of the Constitution.", "11. The applicant appealed against the judgment of the Yalta City Court to the Supreme Court of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea.
