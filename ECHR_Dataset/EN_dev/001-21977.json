THE CZECH REPUBLIC", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a German national, born in 1947 and living in Altenstadt, Germany. Until 21 July 2001, he was serving a prison term in the Czech Republic. He was placed under guardianship by the Weiden District Court (Amtsgericht) in 1995 and his health requires permanent medical control. Before the Court, he is represented by Mr R. Giebenrath, a lawyer practising in Offenburg and Strasbourg. The respondent Government are represented by their Agent, Mr E. Slav\u00edk, from the Ministry of Justice.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "On 9 February 1994 the Sokolov District Court (okresn\u00ed soud) (\u201cthe District Court\u201d) convicted the applicant of assault on a public officer and sentenced him conditionally to a year\u2019s imprisonment. The applicant was further prohibited from driving motor vehicles for one year. The District Court established that on 2 July 1993 the applicant had driven his car at a policeman who had attempted to stop him after he had committed a road traffic offence. The policeman saved himself by jumping to one side. The Sokolov District Attorney (okresn\u00ed st\u00e1tn\u00ed z\u00e1stupce) appealed against the judgment.", "On 7 June 1995 the Plze\u0148 Regional Court (krajsk\u00fd soud) (\u201cthe Regional Court\u201d) modified the first instance judgment in that it imposed an immediate fifteen month prison sentence on the applicant. It also prohibited the applicant from driving motor vehicles for two years. The Regional Court noted that the applicant is a foreigner without a permanent or temporary residence in the Czech Republic. It therefore considered that it would be impossible to control the applicant\u2019s behaviour during a probationary period if a conditional prison sentence were imposed.", "In its judgment the Regional Court pointed out that the District Court had acted erroneously in that it had held the main hearing on 6 January 1994 in the applicant\u2019s absence without duly notifying him. It considered, however, that the evidence available permitted a decision in the case without taking into account the evidence heard at the main hearing before the District Court. The Regional Court therefore held that these shortcomings did not affect the decision on the merits of the case. It appears that the applicant did not attend the hearing before the appellate court and that he was represented by a lawyer appointed ex officio.", "On the same day, the judgment of the Regional Court became enforceable. According to the Government, it was served on the applicant on 12 October 1995.", "On 6 February 1996 the District Court ordered the applicant to reimburse the fees of the lawyer who had been appointed to represent him. On 17 August 1998 the Regional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint about that decision. On 24 July 2000 a clerk of the District Court delivered a decision rectifying the sum the applicant actually had to pay.", "In the meantime, on 21 June 2000, the applicant had been arrested by the Czech police. He was placed in the Horn\u00ed Slavkov prison where he started serving his prison sentence. On 13 July 2000 he was transferred to the Kyn\u0161perk nad Oh\u0159\u00ed prison.", "On 2 August 2000 the applicant complained to the director of the Kyn\u0161perk nad Oh\u0159\u00ed prison that he had some problems with his glasses and that the water had not been running for an hour.", "In two letters dated 2 and 23 September 2000, respectively, the applicant complained to the Constitutional Court (\u00dastavn\u00ed soud) in summary terms about the criminal proceedings leading to his conviction and the enforcement of the sentence.", "On 24 September 2000 the applicant sent a letter to several institutions and officials, including the Constitutional Court, the Attorney General (Vrchn\u00ed st\u00e1tn\u00ed z\u00e1stupce) and the director of the Kyn\u0161perk prison, in which he complained that the Czech authorities had failed to react to his written submissions and that he had not been provided with adequate medical care in prison. He also made a request for a desk and a typewriter.", "On 12 October 2000 the applicant complained to the prison director that he was no longer allowed to prepare his application in the prison dining room. He explained that he could not concentrate on such work in the cell where he was detained together with ten or eleven other people.", "On 27 October 2000 he complained in writing to the prison director that he was not allowed to use a typewriter or make copies of documents. He also alleged that he was not provided with adequate medical care.", "In January 2001 the applicant was taken to a hospital in Brno for an examination of his mental health.", "On 3 January 2001 the Vice-President of the Constitutional Court warned the applicant that his petitions to the Constitutional Court did not satisfy the formal requirements for lodging a constitutional appeal. He informed the applicant that an appellant must be legally represented before the Constitutional Court, must indicate his name, specify the subject of his constitutional appeal, sign the appeal and date it. He also informed the applicant about the sixty-day time-limit for lodging a constitutional appeal.", "On 16 January 2001 the Ministry of Justice (Ministerstvo spravedlnosti) informed the applicant that his two requests for the introduction of a complaint for a breach of law (podn\u011bt k pod\u00e1n\u00ed st\u00ed\u017enosti pro poru\u0161en\u00ed z\u00e1kona), on 1 July and 1 August 2000, were rejected as having no basis.", "According to the Government, on 4 April 2001, after a discussion between the applicant and the prison director, the latter held that the applicant would be provided with necessary aid for his correspondence and, in particular, that his correspondence would be sent without delay and given to him immediately upon its arrival at the prison.", "By letter of 25 April 2001, the Czech Bar Association (\u010cesk\u00e1 advok\u00e1tn\u00ed komora) acknowledged receipt of the applicant\u2019s letter of 23 March 2001 which, however, they had found to be unclear. He was therefore invited to specify his claims. A list of German speaking lawyers was joined to the letter.", "By letter of 8 June 2001 the applicant urged the Constitutional Court inter alia to decide on his constitutional appeals.", "Article 10 provides that the ratified and promulgated international treaties on human rights and fundamental freedoms, by which the Czech Republic is bound, shall be applicable as directly binding regulations having priority over the law.", "According to Article 3 \u00a7 1, fundamental human rights and freedoms are guaranteed to everybody irrespective of sex, race, colour of skin, language, faith, religion, political or other conviction, ethnic or social origin, membership of a national or ethnic minority, property, birth, or other status.", "According to Article 8 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, personal liberty is guaranteed.

If the court allows the constitutional appeal, it shall inter alia declare in its judgment which of the constitutionally guaranteed rights or freedoms or which provision of a constitutional act or an international treaty were violated, and what act by a public authority perpetrated the violation.

This period does not include any time when the sentenced person was abroad or was serving another prison sentence.", "Code of Criminal Procedure (Act no. 141/1961, as amended)", "Section 202(2) allows a trial to be held in the absence of the accused if the court considers that the case can be decided and the purpose of the criminal proceedings achieved in the accused\u2019s absence, provided that the formal indictment was duly served, the accused was properly summoned to attend the trial and was heard as to the facts constituting the subject of the indictment by a competent authority, was officially informed of the charges (section 160) and of the possibility to study the criminal file and make any suggestions regarding the completion of the investigation (section 166(1)).", "According to section 248(1), an appeal shall be lodged with an appellate court within eight days of the accused receiving the judgment against which appeal is made.", "According to section 15, all prisoners have the same rights in the same circumstances within the scope of this Act.", "Section 16(5) provides that a prisoner has the right to medical care in accordance with a special law on the subject, subject to the limitations associated with the aim of the punishment.", "Section 26(1) provides that a prisoner has a right to file complaints and requests to the competent authorities in order to enforce those rights and interests protected by law.
