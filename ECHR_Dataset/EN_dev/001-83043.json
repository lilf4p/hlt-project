Between 5 July and 27 December 1991 the applicant worked as a manager of a joint stock company (\u201cthe employer\u201d). On 7 February 1992 he was dismissed by the employer\u2019s disciplinary commission, a decision which was confirmed by the executive board on 17 March 1992.", "5.

Of nine hearings scheduled before the first-instance court, none was adjourned at the applicant\u2019s request.", "9. On 29 December 1993 the then Municipal Court dismissed his claim. That decision was upheld by then District Court\u2019s decision of 30 March 1994 dismissing his appeal of 10 February 1994.", "10. On 30 May 1994 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law (\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0458\u0430) which was granted by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 20 December 1995.

On 17 April 1996 the applicant submitted a fresh appeal on points of law before the Supreme Court. On 20 November 1997 the Supreme Court quashed both the first- and second-instance decisions and remitted the case for a renewed examination.

The employer\u2019s receiver (\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0435\u043d \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a) could decide the reinstatement issue.", "15.

After three hearings being fixed, on 24 April 2001 the \u0160tip Court of First Instance dismissed the applicant\u2019s claims finding that: he was discharged as the employer\u2019s manager by the executive board on 27 December 1991; under an application for disciplinary proceedings submitted by the strike board, the newly appointed manager requested the disciplinary commission to dismiss him for having committed serious work-related violations, which was actually done by the commission\u2019s decision of 7 February 1992; and the executive board dismissed his objection by decision of 17 March 1992. The court therefore concluded that the applicant\u2019s claims were ill-founded. This decision was given by another first-instance judge.

On 21 January 2002 the applicant submitted an appeal on points of law before the Supreme Court arguing that the lower courts had wrongly established and assessed the facts.", "18. The applicant died on 31 October 2002.", "19. On 11 September 2003 the Supreme Court finally dismissed his appeal finding that the lower courts had properly established the facts and correctly applied the national law. According to a note written on the slip receipt, on 3 December 2003 there was an unsuccessful attempt to serve this decision due to the applicant\u2019s death. The applicant\u2019s successors maintained that they learnt about this decision only on 29 July 2004 when they received the Government\u2019s observations. The Government did not contest that assertion.", "20. During the proceedings, the applicant applied several times to the first-instance court to expedite the proceedings.
