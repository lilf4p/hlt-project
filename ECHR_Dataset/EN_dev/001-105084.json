On 21 June 2002 the applicant left his car in a repair shop, in order to have it mended. The mechanic, employed by the said shop, subsequently caused a traffic accident while driving the applicant\u2019s vehicle.", "4. On 24 September 2002 the applicant therefore filed a claim with the Municipal Court (Op\u0161tinski sud) in Ivanjica, seeking compensation for the pecuniary damage suffered.", "5. On 19 November 2003 the Municipal Court adopted a partial judgment (delimi\u010dna presuda) in the applicant\u2019s favour. This judgment subsequently became final.", "6. On 19 January 2004 the Municipal Court: (i) ruled against the applicant as regards the remainder of his claim; (ii) ordered him to pay the related litigation costs; and (iii) ordered one of the two respondents to cover the applicant\u2019s own litigation costs associated with the partial judgment of 19 November 2003.", "7. On 20 April 2004 the District Court (Okru\u017eni sud) in U\u017eice quashed this judgment\u2019s rulings under points (i) and (ii), but upheld its order under point (iii).", "8.

On 8 February 2010 the High Court (Vi\u0161i sud) in U\u017eice, now acting as the competent court of second instance, upheld this judgment on appeal and it thereby became final. There is nothing in the case file that would suggest that the sums awarded to the applicant have not been paid, and the applicant personally has not raised any objections in this respect.", "12. On 8 January 2008 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud), complaining about the length of the above civil suit.", "13. On 22 December 2009 the Constitutional Court held that the applicant had indeed suffered a breach of his \u201cright to a trial within a reasonable time\u201d, and ordered the competent courts to bring the impugned proceedings to a conclusion as soon as possible. The court, additionally, declared that the applicant was entitled to the non-pecuniary damages sought, in accordance with Article 90 of the Constitutional Court Act (see paragraph 23 below).", "14.

On 12 March 2010 the applicant\u2019s lawyer filed another submission with the Commission for Compensation, specifying that he had made a mistake in his earlier request.

On 22 June 2010 the applicant personally claimed a total of RSD 8,033,542 (at the time approximately EUR 77,300) on account of the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage suffered, but offered, simultaneously, to settle for the said RSD 3,500,000.", "18. In September 2010 the applicant filed a claim with the Court of First Instance (Osnovni sud) in Po\u017eega, specifically its Detached Section (Sudska jedinica) in Ivanjica, noting that he had received no response from the Commission for Compensation which was why he was entitled to bring a separate civil suit in this respect (see paragraph 23, Article 90, below). The applicant sought RSD 4,000,000 (at the time approximately EUR 40,000) for the non-pecuniary damage sustained, plus statutory interest.", "19. On 14 October 2010 the Commission for Compensation offered to pay the applicant the sum of RSD 50,000 (at the time approximately EUR 500) for the non-pecuniary damage referred to in the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision.", "20.
