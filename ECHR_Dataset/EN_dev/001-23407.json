UKRAINE", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "All the applicants are Ukrainian nationals and residents who opened savings accounts with the Ukraine Savings Bank, which until 1992 was an integral part of the USSR Savings Bank. With the exception of the cases expressly referred to below, all the accounts were opened in the 1980s. Under the terms of the agreements: \u201cThe State guarantee[d] that deposits [would] be repaid in full on demand by the account holder\u201d. The rule was not stated to be subject to any restrictions.", "In 1996 the Ukrainian authorities implemented a monetary reform intended to replace the former monetary unit, the karbovanets coupon, with a new currency, the Ukrainian hryvna (\u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043aa \u0433\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043da, UAH), at an exchange rate of 100,000 karbovanets coupons for 1 hryvna. The conversion also had an impact on the applicants\u2019 deposits, which had already considerably depreciated as a result of inflation.", "On 21 November 1996 the Ukrainian Parliament enacted the Ukrainian Citizens\u2019 Deposits (State Guarantee of Reimbursement) Act (Law no. 537/96). Pursuant to section 3 of that Act, the applicants\u2019 deposits were indexed at a ratio of 1 karbovanets coupon to 1.05 hryvnas. Section 7 established a system for the indexed savings to be repaid progressively, taking into account the account holder\u2019s age, the amount on deposit and other criteria. Each year the Government brings in regulations specifying the categories of account holders entitled to receive compensation in the coming year. Under the regulations, only account holders aged 80 or over are entitled to recover a part of their savings (UAH 48, equivalent to approximately 10 euros (EUR) per person). In addition, on an account holder\u2019s death, his or her heirs are entitled to UAH 150 to pay for the burial.", "In the late 1990s each of the applicants issued proceedings against the Ukraine Savings Bank in the relevant courts seeking payment of all or part of their indexed deposits in hryvnas. Their claims were dismissed both at first instance and on appeal on points of law. In most of the decisions, the courts held that the claimants concerned were not entitled to compensation under Law no. 537/96 for the fall in value of their deposits, as they were under 80 and thus had no valid legal claim granted by the Government under the Act. As regards the fifth, twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth applicants, who had attained the qualifying age, the courts found that they were entitled to compensation limited to UAH 48, as the legislation in force did not provide for the repayment of the full value of their deposits.", "Subsequently, some of the applicants made one or more unsuccessful applications for supervisory review of the final decision to the President of the Ukrainian Supreme Court or the president of the relevant regional court.", "...", "The first paragraph of Article 41 of the Constitution (\u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0446i\u044f \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u00ef\u043d\u0438) reads as follows:", "\u201cEveryone has the right to own, use and dispose of his or her property...\u201d", "The relevant parts of Article 384 of the Civil Code (\u0426\u0438\u0432i\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441) read as follows:", "\u201cPrivate persons may deposit sums of money in State savings banks and other financial institutions, have access to their deposits...", "The State guarantees the confidentiality and safekeeping of deposits and their repayment on demand by the account holder...\u201d", "The third paragraph of section 39 of the Banking Activities Act (\u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u201c\u041f\u0440\u043e \u0431\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0438 i \u0431\u0430\u043d\u043ai\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0443 \u0434i\u044f\u043b\u044c\u043di\u0441\u0442\u044c\u201d \u2013 Law no. 872-XII of 20 March 1991), which was in force until January 2001, provided:", "\u201c...

Under these regulations, the right to partial reimbursement of the deposits is reserved to account holders who attained the age of 80 by 1 January 1997 and heirs of deceased account holders, for the purposes of making burial arrangements. Account holders from the first category are entitled to reimbursement of UAH 48 (approximately EUR 10), whereas the heirs of deceased account holders are entitled to an amount equivalent to the funeral grant, that is to say UAH 150 (approximately EUR 30). Since 1999 disabled ex-servicemen have also been able to claim reimbursement of part of their deposits. Regulation no. 275, which covers the year 2001, added to these categories account holders who had reached the ages of 100 or 80 respectively by 1 January 2001. Account holders in the latter category are entitled to the sum of UAH 50. All the aforementioned payments may only be made \u201cto the extent the sum allocated in the State budget for the year concerned allows\u201d.", "According to a practice direction (no. 1-5/117) issued by the Ukraine Supreme Court on 15 March 1999 on the implementation of Law no. 537/96, complaints concerning the repayment of indexed deposits to private individuals under the statutory guarantee provisions in force are to be dealt with under the contentious-business procedure. The practice direction is binding on all Ukrainian courts. When deciding such cases, the courts must remember that they are not dealing with liability for breach of contract between the account holder and the Savings Bank, but with the repayment of revalued deposits under the relevant provisions. The Supreme Court also directed that payments of compensation for indexed deposits must be made solely through branches of the Savings Bank. Consequently, in the event of litigation, the regional branch of the Savings Bank and the Ukraine Treasury must be joined to the proceedings as defendants. The Savings Banking reimburses the indexed deposits to the extent the sums allocated for that purpose in the budget of the Ukrainian State have been paid over to it in accordance with the ranking provisions established by the Cabinet. Thus, if a court finds that the sums concerned have not been paid to the Savings Bank or that the claimant is not a person entitled to reimbursement of the deposits for the year concerned, that person\u2019s claim must be dismissed. If the claim exceeds the prescribed sum, the court shall grant it to the extent laid down in the State Guarantees of the Reimbursement of Ukrainian Citizens\u2019 Deposits Act.", "On 5 April 2002 the Cabinet passed a resolution concerning the reimbursement in 2002 of the value of deposits made by Ukrainian citizens before 2 January 1992 in branches of the former USSR Savings Bank situated on Ukrainian territory (\u041f\u0440\u043e \u0432\u0438\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0443 \u0432 2002 \u0440\u043e\u0446i \u0433\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0445 \u0437\u0430\u043e\u0449\u0430\u0434\u0436\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0434\u044f\u043d \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u00ef\u043d\u0438, \u0432\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u043e 2 \u0441i\u0447\u043d\u044f 1992 \u0440. \u0432 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0448\u043d\u044c\u043e\u0433\u043e \u041e\u0449\u0430\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0443 \u0421\u0420\u0421\u0420, \u0449\u043e \u0434i\u044f\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440i\u00ef \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u00ef\u043d\u0438). By that resolution, the Government allocated UAH 500,000,000 from the national budget to enable individual deposits to be indexed. Of that amount, UAH 65,000,000 was allocated to the heirs of account holders who had died between 1997 and 2002, on condition that they had not yet received the grant available under section 8 of Law no. 537/96. The remaining UAH 435,000,000 was to be divided between the other account holders.
