POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 8;Pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses (domestic proceedings) - claim dismissed;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["8. The applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Celestyn\u00f3w, Poland.", "9. The applicant and O. had a relationship and were living together for an unspecified period. In 1994 O. gave birth to the applicant's son, P. In August 1996 during the applicant's stay abroad, P.'s mother, O., moved out from their house and took P. with her, apparently as a result of growing tensions and disagreements in the couple. Afterwards she refused to allow the applicant to have contact with P. Subsequently, on an unspecified date, the applicant took P back to his place, without O.'s agreement.", "10. On an unspecified later date O. filed with the Bia\u0142ystok District Court (s\u0105d rejonowy) a request for limitation of the applicant's parental responsibility for P.", "11. On 12 September 1996 the court issued an interim order to place P. with his mother. It relied on P.'s age, on the fact that O. breast-fed P. and, also, on the fact that he was suffering from allergy. On the following day a court-appointed guardian assisted by a police officer arrived at the applicant's place and after a two-hour skirmish took P. away.", "12. On 8 November 1996 the applicant and O. concluded a friendly settlement as to the access arrangements. They agreed that P.'s place of residence would be with his mother. The applicant had a right to take P. to his place at specified dates and times in 1996. Starting from 1 January 1997 he was supposed to spend every second weekend with his son at his home. As to the exact dates of meetings in 1997 the parties agreed to determine them at a later date.", "13. At the beginning of 1997 O. refused to hand over her son to the applicant, maintaining that P. was ill at that time.", "14. In February 1997 the applicant requested that a court guardian assist him in meetings with P., submitting that O. failed to comply with the settlement they had concluded in November 1996.", "15. On an unspecified date the applicant petitioned the Bia\u0142ystok District Court to fine O. for obstructing his contacts with P. as established in the settlement of 8 November 1996. He also requested the prosecution authorities to institute criminal proceedings against O.", "16. On an unspecified date at the requests of the applicant and O. proceedings concerning parental responsibility were instituted.", "17. On 4 April 1997 the Bia\u0142ystok District Court stayed the proceedings concerning the applicant's petition, considering that only after the completion of the parental-responsibility proceedings would it be possible to examine them. The court observed that the parties to the court settlement of November 1996 had not specified the dates of the applicant's meetings with P. and that therefore the settlement was impossible to enforce. It was therefore impossible to examine the applicant's petition to have a fine imposed on O.", "18. On 19 May 1997 the applicant went to O. and, after an altercation, took his son away. Subsequently, O. informed prosecution authorities that the applicant had kidnapped P. and threatened her.", "19. On 22 May 1997 the applicant sent letters to the Bia\u0142ystok District Court and the prosecution authorities informing them that he had taken over the custody of P. and would continue to exercise his parental rights until the completion of the parental-responsibility proceedings pending before the District Court. He declared that O. would be able to meet her son at the applicant's home.", "20. On 17 July 1997 the District Court, at O.'s request, ordered the applicant to hand over P. to O. within seven days. Initially, he declared his willingness to do so, but, subsequently, went into hiding together with his son.", "21. On 5 August 1997 the Bia\u0142ystok District Prosecutor (prokurator rejonowy) discontinued the proceedings initiated at the applicant's request, considering that O. had not committed the criminal offence of obstructing his contacts with P. It was established that O. had ceased to comply with the terms of the November 1996 settlement at the beginning of 1997, relying on the fact that P. had been sick at that time. She also objected to the applicant taking P. to his home as he lived far away from O.'s residence. The applicant's appeal against that decision was dismissed by the Regional Prosecutor (prokurator wojew\u00f3dzki).", "22. On 25 August 1997 the prosecutor discontinued the investigations instituted at O.'s request. He considered that the applicant had not committed a criminal offence. It had been established that since 22 March 1997 O. had not allowed the applicant to take his son to his home, despite the fact that P. had got better. The applicant had only been allowed brief visits at her home to see P. The applicant had informed the police and requested to be given assistance, but his efforts failed to affect the mother's conduct. It was further pointed out that after taking away P. from his mother the applicant had informed the prosecution authorities in Bia\u0142ystok and Otwock about the incident. In the light of the fact that the applicant had full parental rights in respect of P. the prosecutor did not consider his acts a criminal offence. O.'s allegations about having been threatened by the applicant proved unsubstantiated.", "23. On 21 August 1997 and 16 September 1997 the Otwock District Court ordered the applicant to reveal P.'s place of residence and warned him that in case of failure to comply with its order he would be fined, with imprisonment in default. He did not comply with these orders.", "24. On 5 February 1998 the Otwock District Court issued an enforcement order in respect of the Bia\u0142ystok District Court's decision of 17 July 1997. It ordered a bailiff to take P. from the applicant by force and hand him over to O.", "25. On 24 February 1998 in the course of the parental-responsibility proceedings the Bia\u0142ystok District Court limited the applicant's parental rights to a right to information about his child's health. It amended the settlement of 8 November 1996 in that it decided that further contacts between the applicant and his son should take place on the third Saturday of each month at the mother's home from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. without the possibility to take P. anywhere.", "26. The court referred to the November 1996 settlement between the parties, to the subsequent difficulties in the applicant's access to P. and to the fact that on 19 May 1997 he had taken P. to his place. The court considered that although there was nothing in the case-file to suggest that the applicant's parenting skills were insufficient and it was difficult to establish to which of the parents P. was more attached, the applicant's conduct in the course of the proceedings proved his disrespect to the organs of justice and disregard of the interest of the child.", "27. The court dismissed O.'s request to divest the applicant of parental rights, considering that at that stage it was too early to adopt such a serious measure.", "28. The applicant and O. appealed against that decision.", "29. On 27 April 1998 the Warsaw Regional Court (s\u0105d wojew\u00f3dzki) dismissed the applicant's appeal against the enforcement order of 5 February 1998.", "30. On 19 June 1998 the Bia\u0142ystok Regional Court amended the District Court's decision of 24 February 1998 in that it deprived the applicant of all parental rights in respect of P. It considered that he had abused his rights by making it impossible for the son to contact his mother, whereas the mother's care at that stage of the child's development was indispensable. The court further found that the applicant's continuing hiding was to the child's detriment, especially because he was apparently working and his son was taken care of by other people. It emphasised that the child had the right to decent life conditions, home and stability, of which the applicant had deprived him. The court further pointed out that the difficulties in enforcing court orders in the past could not justify the applicant's conduct and he should have availed himself of legal remedies.", "31. On 8 August 1998 the police took P. away from the applicant.", "32. On 17 August 1998 the applicant requested the District Court to prevent the issue of a passport for P., submitting that O. intended to abduct P. abroad. In reply, he was informed that until the date when the judgment of 19 June 1998 obtained legal force the passport would not be issued without the applicant's approval.", "33. On 28 August and 23 September 1998 the applicant informed the Bia\u0142ystok District Court about instances of obstructing his contact with P. by O. and requested assistance in the enforcement of his access rights.", "34. On 9 September 1998 the Bia\u0142ystok Regional Court dismissed the applicant's request for the appointment of a legal-aid lawyer for the purpose of lodging a cassation appeal and exemption from courts costs. The court found that he ran a business and in July 1997 his income had reached 700 Polish zlotys (PLN), whereas he would have to pay only a PLN 30 fee for his cassation appeal and the legal fees in a case like his would not exceed PLN 300. The court further noted that the applicant was single and owned a plot of land with a building under construction, as well as a car. On 6 October 1998 the Regional Court rejected the applicant's cassation appeal against that decision, as it was not provided for by law. On 16 December 1998 the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against the latter decision.", "35. On 24 November 1998, in reply to the applicant's complaint, the Office of the Prime Minister requested the Bia\u0142ystok District Court to submit information and documents concerning the applicant's case, as it had certain doubts as to the decision to restrict his parental responsibility for P.", "36. On 16 December 1998 the Head of the Family Department at the Bia\u0142ystok District Court informed the applicant that none of the court guardians had agreed to assist in the arrangements for his contact with P.", "37. On 24 February 1999 the Ombudsman's office requested the Warsaw Regional Prosecutor to indicate the policemen who on 8 August 1998 had taken P. away from his father, as well as the person who had ordered it, in breach of the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. The applicant submits that no further measures were taken by the Ombudsman.", "38. On 16 March 1999 the Bia\u0142ystok District Court dismissed the applicant's and O.'s petitions concerning his contact with his son. The court relied on the opinion prepared by two experts, according to which the relations between the child and parents were disturbed, and because of the child's age it was recommended that the meetings with the father would take place at the mother's home. The experts noted that P. would not want to leave his father. They pointed out that the need to maintain P.'s contacts with his father existed, but that the parents did not show understanding for the needs of the child and were driven by the wish to harm each other.", "39. On 18 June 1999 the applicant filed with the Bia\u0142ystok Regional Court a petition in which he requested that O. be deprived of her parental rights and he be granted parental responsibility. Subsequently, he asked the court to issue an interim order to the effect that P.'s place of residence would be with the father.", "40. In 2000 the applicant filed an unsuccessful request for the reopening of the proceedings terminated on 19 June 1998.", "41. On 8 February 2001 the Bia\u0142ystok District Court refused the applicant's request for the enforcement of the part of the judgment given on 24 February 1998 concerning his contacts with his son. The court considered that the place of residence of O. and the son was unknown and therefore enforcement was impossible.", "42. On 20 February 2001 the District Court dismissed the applicant's petition to deprive O. of parental responsibility for P. It noted that the applicant's submissions as to the allegedly improper manner in which the mother looked after P. were unsubstantiated. On the contrary, the experts were of the opinion that there were strong emotional bonds between her and P. The applicant appealed.", "43. In her letter of 26 February 2001, written in reply to the applicant's complaint, the President of the Bia\u0142ystok Court of Appeal agreed with his contention that the proceedings were lengthy.", "44. On 27 March 2001 the police authorities informed the applicant that O. with his son had left for London on 30 May 2000.", "45. On 17 May 2001 the Bia\u0142ystok Regional Court quashed the District Court's decision of 8 February 2001. On 10 August 2001 the District Court, following the Regional Court's instructions, stayed the enforcement of the orders concerning contact between the applicant and his son because the applicant was unable to indicate O.'s place of residence.", "46. On 27 September 2001 the Regional Court dismissed the applicant's appeal against the decision of the District Court.", "47. The proceedings are stayed.", "48. The Family and Custody Code (Kodeks Rodzinny i Opieku\u0144czy) provides:", "\u201cIn a decision on divorce, the court is competent to issue orders concerning the manner in which the care of the parties' minor children should be carried out (...). The court may grant custody right to one parent and limit the custody rights of the other one.\u201d", "The Code of Civil Procedure (Kodeks Post\u0119powania Cywilnego) provides:", "\u201cThe custody court can change its decision if the best interest of person whom it concerns so require. \u201c", "According to the Supreme Court's resolution, if a parent who has been obliged by a court decision to respect the other parents' access rights refuses to comply therewith, access decisions are liable to enforcement proceedings. The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure on enforcement of nonpecuniary obligations are applicable to enforcement of court decisions on parental rights or access rights (resolution of the Supreme Court of 30 January 1976, III CZP 94/75, OSNCP 1976 7-8).", "\u201c1. If the debtor is obliged to take measures which cannot be taken by any other person, the court in whose district the enforcement proceedings were instituted, on a motion of a creditor and after hearing the parties, shall fix the time-limit within which the debtor shall comply with his obligation, on pain of fine (...).", "2. If the debtor fails to comply with this obligation, further time-limits may be fixed and further fines may be imposed by a court.\u201d", "If the court obliges a parent exercising custody rights to ensure access to a child to the other parent, Article 1050 of the Code of Civil Procedure is applicable to the enforcement of this obligation."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
