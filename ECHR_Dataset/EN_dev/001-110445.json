It appears from the record of the jurors\u2019 responses to the questions asked by the presiding judge that close relatives of five jurors worked for the police and at the Service for Execution of Sentences. In particular, the husband of juror no. 2 and the son of juror no. 4 worked as traffic police officers. The son-in-law of juror no. 3 was employed by the Service for the Execution of Sentences.

In January 2004 the Ivanovo Regional Court received information regarding attendance by two witnesses from the list.

The prosecution requested the Regional Court to read out statements made by the prosecution witnesses and the applicant\u2019s associate, Mr A., to the Uzbek authorities, arguing that it was impossible to obtain their attendance. Four witnesses failed to appear for various personal reasons and the remaining witnesses lived in Uzbekistan. The applicant and his counsel objected, relying on the defendant\u2019s right to cross-examine witnesses testifying against him. The applicant noted that during the pre-trial investigation he had repeatedly asked the investigating authorities to hold confrontation interviews with the witnesses. However, his requests had been dismissed without any explanation.", "23. The Regional Court agreed to read out statements by the four prosecution witnesses who had failed to appear for personal reasons, finding those reasons to be valid. As regards statements by the remaining witnesses and Mr A., the Regional Court held as follows:", "\u201cDuring the last six months the court has taken all lawful steps to ensure the witnesses\u2019 presence, and certain witnesses have sent in information which confirmed that they had been summoned properly. Due to the fact that other witnesses live in another State, and taking into account that they confirmed their statements in a court hearing in the Tashkent City Court [during the trial against Mr A.], [the court] considers that the present extraordinary circumstances preclude their attendance [and] decides to read out the statements of the ... witnesses who failed to appear.\u201d", "The Regional Court read out statements by the remaining six prosecution witnesses and by Mr A.

The Court further heard the applicant and his parents, who denied the applicant\u2019s involvement in the robbery and murder and insisted that at the time of the crime he was staying with his family in Russia.", "25. At the same hearing the applicant accused the prosecution of jury tampering and sought the discharge of the entire panel. He claimed that juror no. 1 had tapped the prosecutor on the hand and the prosecutor had responded with a nod of the head. Defence counsel supported the accusation claiming that he had witnessed the incident. The prosecutor denied the incident, stating that he was not acquainted with juror no. 1. Juror no. 1, in response to questions from the presiding judge, stated that he had not known the prosecutor before the trial and that he had never had a conversation with him. The presiding judge, without giving any reasons, dismissed the applicant\u2019s challenge to the empanelled jury.", "26. The parties\u2019 closing arguments followed. The defence argued that there was no material evidence, such as fingerprints, bloodstains and so on, linking the applicant to the criminal offences, and that the applicant had been denied an important right to cross-examine witnesses against him.", "27. On 7 May 2004 the jury, by eight to four votes, found the applicant guilty of aggravated murder and robbery.", "28. On 12 May 2004 the Ivanovo Regional Court accepted the verdict and sentenced the applicant to eighteen years\u2019 imprisonment.", "29. The applicant and his lawyer appealed, arguing that the jury had not been fair and impartial because certain jurors had been victims of criminal offences and the prosecution had tried to exert improper influence on at least one of the jurors. They further alleged a violation of the applicant\u2019s rights, having regard to the fact that at no stage of the proceedings had either he or his lawyer been offered the opportunity to question the prosecution witnesses.", "30. On 8 July 2004 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation upheld the conviction, finding that the investigating authorities and the Regional Court had not committed any serious violations of the criminal procedural law.", "31. The Russian Code of Criminal Procedure provides that an officer of a court or a judge\u2019s assistant has to compile a list of jury candidates for the trial. The candidates are to be drawn at random from the district or regional list of jurors. The candidates\u2019 names are entered in the list in the order in which their lots were drawn. The list of jury candidates is then served on the parties. The parties have the right to make an unlimited number of challenges for cause and two peremptory challenges to potential jurors. The presiding judge decides on the challenges. After deleting the names of the successfully challenged candidates, the court secretary or the judge\u2019s assistant makes up the list of the remaining jury candidates, whose names are to appear in the same order as in the first list. The twelve candidates whose names appear first on the list form the jury, and the two candidates whose names appear next become substitutes. Before the jury is sworn in, the parties may challenge the entire panel if they argue that due to particular features of a criminal case the panel will be unable to render an objective verdict. The presiding judge is to decide on any such challenge to the empanelled jury (Articles 326\u2013330).", "32. Earlier statements made by a victim or witness may be read out if the parties give their consent to it and if (1) there are substantial discrepancies between the earlier statement and the later statement before the court or (2) the victim or the witness has not appeared before the court (Article 281 \u00a7 1).", "33.

In particular, Article 453 provides that a prosecutor, an investigator or a court, when they need to carry out an interrogation, a search, seizure or any other procedural action in the territory of a foreign State, may ask assistance from investigating or judicial officials of that State to organise/perform that procedural action. Records of procedural actions performed by foreign officials on a request by Russian authorities will have the same evidentiary weight as evidence received by Russian officials in the territory of the Russian Federation (Article 455). Article 456 deals with the issue of summoning witnesses who live outside the Russian Federation to give statements regarding a criminal case pending before Russian authorities.", "35. The Convention on Legal Assistance and Legal Relations in Civil, Family and Criminal Matters (signed in Minsk on 22 January 1993 and amended on 28 March 1997, \u201cthe 1993 Minsk Convention\u201d), to which both Russia and Uzbekistan are parties, provides that a witness and a victim who are subjects of one Contracting Party can be summoned, for the purpose of their examination, by a \u201cbody of justice\u201d of another Contracting Party.
