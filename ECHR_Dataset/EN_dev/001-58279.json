The applicant is a Turkish citizen who was born in 1957 and lives in Istanbul.", "9. At the material time, the applicant was the major shareholder in Deniz Bas\u0131n Yay\u0131n Sanayi ve Ticaret Organizasyon, a Turkish limited liability company which owns a weekly review entitled Haberde Yorumda Ger\u00e7ek (\u201cThe Truth of News and Comments\u201d), published in Istanbul.", "10. In issue no. 23 dated 30 August 1992, two readers\u2019 letters, entitled \u201cSilahlar \u00d6zg\u00fcrl\u00fc\u011f\u00fc Engelleyemez\u201d (\u201cWeapons cannot win against freedom\u201d) and \u201cSu\u00e7 Bizim\u201d (\u201cIt is our fault\u201d), were published.", "11. The letters read as follows (translation):", "(a) \u201cWeapons cannot win against freedom", "In the face of the escalating war of national liberation in Kurdistan, the fascist Turkish army continues to carry out bombings. The \u2018\u015e\u0131rnak massacre\u2019 which Ger\u00e7ek journalists revealed at the cost of great self-sacrifice has been another concrete example this week.", "The brutalities in Kurdistan are in fact the worst that have been experienced there in the past few years. The massacre carried out in Halep\u00e7e in southern Kurdistan by the reactionary BAAS administration is now taking place in northern Kurdistan. \u015e\u0131rnak is concrete proof of it. By causing provocation in Kurdistan, the Turkish Republic was heading for a massacre. Many people were killed. In a three-day attack with tanks, shells and bombs, \u015e\u0131rnak was razed to the ground.", "And the bourgeois press, en masse, wrote about the slaughter. And as the bourgeois press has said, there are indeed scores of \u2018unanswered\u2019 questions to be asked. As to \u015e\u0131rnak, the attack on \u015e\u0131rnak is the most effective form of the campaign that is being waged throughout Turkey to eradicate the Kurds. Fascism will follow it up with many more \u015e\u0131rnaks.", "But the struggle of our people for national freedom in Kurdistan has reached a point where it can no longer be thwarted by bloodshed, tanks and shells. Every attack launched by the Turkish Republic to wipe out the Kurds intensifies the struggle for freedom. The bourgeoisie and its toadying press, which draw attention every day to the brutalities in Bosnia-Herzegovina, fail to see the brutalities committed in Kurdistan. Of course, one can hardly expect reactionary fascists who call for a halt in the brutalities in Bosnia-Herzegovina to call for a halt in the brutalities in Kurdistan.", "The Kurdish people, who are being torn from their homes and their fatherland, have nothing to lose. But they have much to gain.\u201d", "(b) \u201cIt is our fault", "The TC[] murder gang is continuing its murders ... on the grounds of \u2018protecting the Republic of Turkey\u2019. But as people wake up to what is happening and become more aware, as they gradually learn to stand up for their rights and the idea that \u2018if they won\u2019t give, then we\u2019ll take by force\u2019 gradually germinates in people\u2019s minds and grows stronger day by day \u2013 as long as this continues, the murders will obviously also continue ... Beginning of course with those who planted the seed in people\u2019s minds \u2013 according to the generals, imperialism\u2019s hired killers, and according to the double-chinned, pot-bellied, stiff-necked Turguts, S\u00fcleymans and B\u00fclents ... Hence the events of 12 March, hence the events of 12 September ... Hence the gallows, hence the prisons, hence the people sentenced to 300 or 400 years. Hence the people murdered in the torture rooms \u2018in order to protect the Republic of Turkey\u2019. Hence the Mazlum Do\u011fans exterminated in Diyarbak\u0131r Prison ... Hence the Revolutionaries recently officially assassinated ... The TC murder gang is continuing \u2013 and will continue \u2013 to commit its murders. Because the awakening of the people is like a flood of enthusiasm ... Hence Zonguldak, hence the municipal workers, hence the public service employees ... Hence Kurdistan. Can the \u2018murder gangs\u2019 stop that flood? There may be some who see the title of this letter and wonder what on earth it has to do with the text.", "The \u2018hired killers\u2019 of imperialism, i.e. the authors of the 12 September coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, and their successors of yesterday and today, those who are still looking for \u2018democracy\u2019, who in the past participated in one way or another in the struggle for democracy and freedom, who now covertly or openly criticise their past actions, who confuse the masses and present the parliamentary system and the rule of law as the means of salvation, give the green light to the killings of the TC murder gang.", "I am addressing the \u2018faithful servants\u2019 of imperialism and its hardened spokesman (men), the one(s) who said some time ago \u2018You won\u2019t get me to say that the nationalists commit crimes\u2019[], who say(s) today \u2018Those are not what we call journalists\u2019, who say(s) \u2018Who\u2019s against demonstrations? Who\u2019s against claiming one\u2019s rights? Of course they can hold a march ... They\u2019re my workers, my peasants, my public employees\u2019, but then has (have) the public employees who march to Ankara beaten up in the very heart of the city and say(s) afterwards \u2018The police did the right thing\u2019, and who postpone(s) strikes for months on end. I am addressing the blabbers, the deserters and the charlatans who are stirring up the reactionary consciousness of the masses, who try to judge these people by their attitude towards Kurdistan and try to work out how \u2018democratic\u2019 they are. The guilt of the murder gang is proven. It is through flesh-and-blood experience that people are beginning to see it and realise it. But what about the guilt of the charlatans, the ones who are thwarting the struggle for democracy and freedom ... Yes, what about their guilt ... They have their share in the killings by the murder gang ... May their \u2018union\u2019 be a happy one!\u201d", "12. In an indictment dated 21 September 1992, the public prosecutor at the Istanbul National Security Court (\u0130stanbul Devlet G\u00fcvenlik Mahkemesi) charged the applicant in his capacity as the owner of the review, as well as the review\u2019s editor, with disseminating propaganda against the indivisibility of the State and provoking enmity and hatred among the people. The charges were brought under Article 312 of the Criminal Code and section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 (\u201cthe 1991 Act\u201d \u2013 see paragraphs 22 and 24 below).", "13. In the proceedings before the Istanbul National Security Court, the applicant denied the charges. He asserted that the expression of an opinion could not constitute an offence. He further stated that the letters in issue had been written by the readers of the review and for that reason could not engage his responsibility.", "14. In a judgment dated 12 April 1993, the court found the applicant guilty of an offence under the first paragraph of section 8 of the 1991 Act. It found no grounds for convicting him under Article 312 of the Criminal Code. The court initially sentenced the applicant to a fine of 200,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL). However, having regard to the applicant\u2019s good conduct during the trial, it reduced the fine to TRL 166,666,666. The editor of the review was for his part sentenced to five months\u2019 imprisonment and to a fine of TRL 83,333,333.", "15. In its judgment, the court held that the incriminated letters contravened section 8 of the 1991 Act. The court concluded that the letters referred to eight districts in the south-east of Turkey as an independent State, \u201cKurdistan\u201d, described the PKK (Workers\u2019 party of Kurdistan) as a national liberation movement involved in a \u201cnational independence war\u201d against the Turkish State and amounted to propaganda aimed at the destruction of the territorial integrity of the Turkish State. In addition the court found that the letters contained discriminatory statements on grounds of race.", "16. The applicant appealed against his conviction to the Court of Cassation, contending that his trial and conviction contravened Articles 6 and 10 of the Convention. He asserted that section 8 of the 1991 Act was contrary to the Constitution and denied that the letters in question disseminated separatist propaganda. He also maintained that he had not been able to be present at the hearing at which the decision on his conviction had been given. He pleaded that the decision given in his absence and without his final statement having been taken was contrary to law.", "17. On 26 November 1993 the Court of Cassation ruled that the amount of the fine imposed by the National Security Court was excessive and set aside the applicant\u2019s conviction and sentence on that account. The court remitted the case to the Istanbul National Security Court.", "18. In its judgment of 12 April 1994, the Istanbul National Security Court sentenced the applicant to a fine of TRL 100,000,000 but subsequently reduced the fine to TRL 83,333,333. As to the grounds for conviction, the court, inter alia, reiterated the reasoning used in its judgment of 12 April 1993.", "19. The applicant appealed. He relied on the defence grounds which he had invoked at his first trial. He also maintained that the National Security Court had convicted him without having duly heard his defence.", "20. On 30 September 1994 the Court of Cassation dismissed his appeal, upholding the National Security Court\u2019s reasoning and its assessment of the evidence.", "21. Following the amendments made by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995 to the 1991 Act (see paragraph 25 below), the Istanbul National Security Court ex officio re-examined the applicant\u2019s case. On 8 March 1996 the court confirmed the sentence which it had initially imposed on him.", "22.
