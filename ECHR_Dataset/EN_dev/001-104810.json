CROATIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Anatoly Kovler;Elisabeth Steiner;George Nicolaou;Julia Laffranque;Khanlar Hajiyev;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska", "TEXT": ["The first applicant, Imobilije Marketing d.o.o., is a limited liability company incorporated under Croatian law, which has its registered office in Rab. The second applicant, Mr Ivan Debeli\u0107, is a Croatian national who was born in 1939 and lives in Rab. He is an advocate practising in Rab. The first applicant was represented before the Court by the second applicant. The Croatian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mrs \u0160. Sta\u017enik.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "On 14 June 1999 the applicants concluded a lease agreement with Mrs K.K. whereby they as lessors leased their business premises to her for a period of five years (from 1 April 1999 until 1 April 2004). In return, K.K. as a lessee was obliged to pay them in Croatian kunas (HRK) the counter value of 10,000 German marks (DEM) per year. For the first year K.K. agreed to pay the applicants in kunas the counter value of: (a) DEM 2,000 upon the conclusion of the agreement, (b) DEM 1,000 by 20 July 1999; and (c) DEM 7,000 by 30 August 1999. For every subsequent year K.K. agreed to pay in kunas the counter value of: (a) DEM 3,000 by 1 April of the current year for the following year, and (b) DEM 7,000 by the end of the current year for that year.", "The agreement was concluded in the form of a notarial deed (javnobilje\u017eni\u010dka isprava) and contained an enforcement clause entitling the applicants to directly institute enforcement proceedings against K.K. if she failed to pay the annual rent.", "Given that by 20 July 1999 K.K. had paid only the counter value of DEM 1,500 of the amount due by that date, on 26 July 1999 the applicants instituted enforcement proceedings before the Rab Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Rabu) with a view to collecting the unpaid amounts. By 26 October 2009 the applicants had instituted another ten sets of enforcement proceedings before the same court with a view to satisfying their claims arising from the above-mentioned lease agreement. However, even though the court had frozen K.K.\u2019s bank account already on 1 September 1999, the applicants were unable to satisfy any of their claims owing to the lack of funds on that account. It would appear that eight out of the eleven enforcement proceedings are still pending,", "Meanwhile, on 23 August 1999 the applicants instituted non-contentious proceedings before the Rab Municipal Court asking the court to issue a preliminary measure (prethodna mjera) \u2013 a type of security measure (mjera osiguranja) \u2013 freezing K.K.\u2019s bank account for the sum corresponding in kunas to the counter value of DEM 47,000, that is, the remaining amount of rent that would become due before the expiry of the lease agreement on 1 April 2004. They argued that K.K.\u2019s behaviour, in particular her failure to pay the full amount of the rent due by 20 July 1999, suggested that it was likely that she would not pay the future instalments of the rent as they become due.", "On 11 April 2003 the court dismissed the applicants\u2019 request.", "Following an appeal by the applicants, on 15 October 2003 the Rijeka County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Rijeci) quashed the first-instance decision and remitted the case.", "In the resumed proceedings, on 4 August 2006 the Rab Municipal Court again dismissed the applicants\u2019 request.", "Following an appeal by the applicants, on 23 October 2006 the Rijeka County Court again quashed the first-instance decision and remitted the case.", "On 24 September 2007 the Rab Municipal Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 request for a third time. The court found the applicants\u2019 request superfluous because their claim had been sufficiently secured. In particular, the court found that the applicants had frozen K.K.\u2019s bank account already on 1 September 1999 in the above-mentioned enforcement proceedings.", "On 28 May 2009 the Rijeka County Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal and upheld the first-instance decision endorsing the reasons contained therein. It added that it was not allowed to issue a preliminary measure after the claim to be secured had become enforceable.", "On 1 October 2009 the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law (revizija) against the second-instance decision. It would appear that the case is currently pending before the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske).", "On 3 May 2007 the applicants lodged a request with the Rijeka County Court for protection of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time in respect of the above non-contentious proceedings.", "On 22 September 2009 the Rijeka County Court found a violation of the applicants\u2019 right to a hearing within a reasonable time and awarded them each HRK 5,000 in compensation.", "The relevant part of the Courts Act (Zakon o sudovima, Official Gazette nos. 150/2005, 16/2007 and 113/2008), which entered into force on 29 December 2005, reads as follows:", "\u201c(1) A party to court proceedings who considers that the competent court failed to decide within a reasonable time on his or her rights or obligations or a criminal charge against him or her, may lodge a request for the protection of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time with the immediately higher court.", "(2) If the request concerns proceedings pending before the High Commercial Court of the Republic of Croatia, the High Court for Administrative Offences of the Republic of Croatia or the Administrative Court of the Republic of Croatia, the request shall be decided by the Supreme Court of the Republic of Croatia.", "(3) The proceedings for deciding the request referred to in paragraph 1 of this section shall be urgent. The rules of non-contentious procedure shall apply mutatis mutandis in those proceedings and, in principle, no hearing shall be held.", "(1) If the court referred to in section 27 of this Act finds the request well founded, it shall set a time-limit within which the court before which the proceedings are pending must decide on a right or obligation of, or a criminal charge against, the person who lodged the request, and shall award him or her appropriate compensation for the violation of his or her right to a hearing within a reasonable time.", "(2) The compensation shall be paid out of the State budget within three months from the date the party\u2019s request for payment is lodged.", "(3) An appeal, to be lodged within fifteen days with the Supreme Court, lies against a decision on the request for the protection of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time.
