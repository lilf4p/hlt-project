At the time of the dispute, the shop was in S.\u2019s possession. The applicant claimed to have bought the shop from its previous owners, who had privatised it in 2003, while S. argued that the privatisation process had been unlawful and that he had a lawful claim to the shop.", "The applicant lodged a lawsuit seeking S.\u2019s eviction from the shop.", "By a judgment of 23 November 2005, the Shamkir District Court found that the applicant had purchased the shop on 6 October 2003 and was its lawful owner pursuant to the ownership certificate issued by the Ministry of Economic Development on 16 January 2004.

S. appealed against that judgment.", "On 7 April 2006 the Court of Appeal delivered a judgment dismissing S.\u2019s appeal.
