The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Vilnius.", "6. At the relevant time, the applicant was a founding member of the Liberal Democrats political party, led by Mr Rolandas Paksas. The applicant was also a member of the Vilnius City Municipal Council.", "7. On 16 March 2003 the State Security Department (\u201cthe SSD\u201d) intercepted a telephone conversation between the applicant and Jurij Borisov (\u201cJ.B.\u201d) (see Borisov v. Lithuania, no. 9958/04, \u00a7 15, 14 June 2011), a major contributor to the electoral campaign of the State President, Rolandas Paksas. The tapping of J.B.\u2019s telephone had been authorised by a court. The conversation was as follows:", "\u201cJurij Borisov (J.B.): So. He [the State President R. Paksas] said on television that Borisov isn\u2019t on the list of his advisers and won\u2019t be included.", "Algirdas Drak\u0161as (A.D.): Won\u2019t be on the list of his advisers? But I don\u2019t understand. After all, you always said that [he would].", "J.B.: A week ago he and I agreed that from Monday I would be on the list [of advisers to the President].", "A.D.: I don\u2019t know anything about this.", "J.B.: I am telling you \u2013 that was his promise. So he has been stressed for two days, because he has already betrayed me. You understand? He has already sold me. And he is stressed, he is afraid to meet. So I have told him, if by Monday he doesn\u2019t fulfil any of his promises - not a single one for what I have done for him - I will begin to recover my money. I will have to go public, do you understand?...", "A.D.: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t heard that, I don\u2019t know.", "J.B.: Algis, I have recorded everything on tape, the tape will be ready tomorrow.", "A.D.: Damn, I don\u2019t know that. I don\u2019t know that. I know that you declared that you would act differently, that you wouldn\u2019t go to the President\u2019s Office because the salary is low there, that you wouldn\u2019t manage to earn a living there. I know only that.", "J.B.: That was in the press. At his [the State President\u2019s] request: \u201cJura, tell that in the meantime you won\u2019t go [to work at the President\u2019s Office]. And on Monday you will be [working] there\u201d....That\u2019s why he has already been suffering for two days, because he has lied on television. And I don\u2019t know how he is going to walk away from this... Death to him as to the President. Tomorrow this lie will surface... That\u2019s why he is restless...", "A.D.: I don\u2019t know these facts, how can I give you an answer.", "J.B.: Algis, I am not asking you for an answer, I am just emotional, because I don\u2019t know ... how I should go and talk to him. Because I have to go public and say everything now. Rolandas is such-and-such... We have agreed with him... And now: he went to Dalia [D.K.G. - adviser to the President], and [the President] has said that Borisov won\u2019t harass you. I don\u2019t know what she has told him. So the President, you understand, is a corpse already.", "A.D.: If it is easier for you, but you\u2019re behaving improperly.", "J.B.: Algis, I haven\u2019t done anything yet, so far I\u2019ve done nothing. But he has sold me publicly already.", "A.D.: Calm down. He hasn\u2019t sold you publicly; he is not that kind of person ... I don\u2019t know that you are not going to be an adviser. That wasn\u2019t discussed openly, there was no such idea, I haven\u2019t heard about that. He hasn\u2019t sold you publicly; I can\u2019t imagine he would do that. He is not like that.", "J.B.: You see. Such is the fact...", "A.D.: Such fact can\u2019t [be]...", "J.B.: Maybe you want to see the agreement with his signature? I\u2019ll show it [to you] tomorrow.", "A.D.: I can only repeat what I\u2019ve said.", "J.B.: Okay, Algis, have you called him?", "A.D.: What? I have called him, but he isn\u2019t picking up his telephone.\u201d", "8. On 17 September 2003 the SSD applied to the Attorney General\u2019s Office with a request for the applicant\u2019s telephone to be tapped. The request was based on operational information that the applicant maintained contact with J.B. and A.Z., both of whom had contributed to the electoral campaign of Mr Rolandas Paksas. A.Z. worked for a Russian public relations company. Subsequently, J.B. was convicted of having threatened the State President so that the latter would appoint him as an adviser, grant him Lithuanian citizenship and grant other favours, failing which J.B. threatened to disclose certain information which could damage the President\u2019s reputation (see Borisov, cited above, \u00a7 30). The monitoring of the applicant\u2019s telecommunications also had the goal of establishing the nature of his relationship with a Russian citizen, V.F., who, according to the SSD, had been expelled from Spain in 1982 for spying for the former USSR.", "9. Later that day the Attorney General requested the Vilnius Regional Court to authorise the tapping of the applicant\u2019s telephone. The court order was classified as secret, and was not disclosed to the applicant. The Attorney General based his request on the applicant\u2019s \u201cpossible participation in smuggling strategic goods and other crimes\u201d. The court granted the request, authorising the measure for a period of three months. The court order reads:", "\u201con the basis of the material in the case file of the operation it is reasonable to [tap the applicant\u2019s telephone] in order to verify his involvement in the criminal activities described in the request: the information in the case file (the operative information and other data) confirms that [the applicant] could be linked to criminal acts which qualify as serious crimes; in order to establish all the relevant circumstances other operative measures had already been [exhausted], therefore a supplementary investigative measure [tapping of the applicant\u2019s telephone] is to be authorised, pursuant to the rules of the Law on Operational Activities\u201d.", "10. As came to light later on, the request by the SSD was also based on the applicant\u2019s allegedly unlawful involvement in attempts to take over the shares of the road-building company \u201c\u017demaitijos keliai\u201d.", "11. On 1 November 2003 the SSD declassified the recording of the telephone conversation of 16 March 2003 between the applicant and J.B. It sent the recording to the Attorney General\u2019s Office. The following day, the latter began a pre-trial investigation into threats to the State President.", "12. On 2 November 2003 the recording of the telephone conversation of 16 March 2003 between the applicant and J.B. was aired by the State-run and private national television channels LTV and LNK. The SSD denied any involvement in leaking the conversation to the media.", "13. Having intercepted the applicant\u2019s telephone conversations between 18 September and 11 November, the SSD obtained recordings of his communications with the State President, the President\u2019s advisers and the applicant\u2019s business partners. It can be seen from the transcripts of those recordings that the SSD intercepted five conversations between the applicant and the head of State. At least one of these telephone calls was from the State President to the applicant. The transcripts also reveal that the conversations between the applicant and his interlocutors contained some swearing.", "14. On 11 November 2003 the Attorney General wrote to the director of the SSD. The Attorney General noted that on 10 and 11 November the media had made known the fact that the SSD had obtained recordings of telephone conversations between the applicant and the State President. Such recordings, if they existed, were unlawful, given that Article 6 \u00a7 3 of the Law on Operational Activities prohibited any operational activities in respect of the head of State (see \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201d below). The SSD was ordered to make sure that the recordings were not made public and were destroyed the same day.", "The letter of the Attorney General does not specify whether by that time the content of the applicant\u2019s conversations with the State President had already been disclosed to the public.", "15. The letter also read that \u201cnoting the illegal practice, which began on 30 October 2003, of transfer and making public operational information, the SSD is ordered to adhere strictly to the requirements of the Law on Operational Activities and the Law on State Secrets, as well as those concerning Criminal Procedure\u201d. On this point the Attorney General emphasised that classified information obtained during operational activities, as well as data concerning a person\u2019s private life and/or demeaning to his or her honour or dignity should not be disclosed. Furthermore, once the operational investigation had been terminated and where the information concerning the target of the surveillance activities had not proved to be true, such information had to be destroyed. Lastly, the information collected during a pre-trial investigation was to remain confidential, unless a prosecutor decided otherwise.", "16. On 12 November 2003 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Attorney General, alleging that the tapping of his telephone had been unlawful. He also complained that his telephone call with the State President had been intercepted. The applicant alleged a breach of privacy.", "17. On 20 November 2003 the Attorney General requested information from the SSD regarding the leak.", "18. On 11 December 2003 the SSD informed the Attorney General that neither recordings nor transcripts of the applicant\u2019s conversation with J.B. of 16 March 2003 had been given to the media. It noted that on 1 November 2003 the transcripts of that recording had been declassified and submitted to the Attorney General\u2019s Office for the purpose of a pre-trial investigation.", "19. By a letter of 15 December 2003, the Attorney General requested the SSD to conduct an inquiry into the leak, as a result of which the applicant\u2019s and J.B.\u2019s telephone conversation of 16 March 2003 had been aired on television (paragraph 12 above).", "20. On 15 December 2003 the Attorney General\u2019s Office informed the applicant that his telephone conversations had been monitored in accordance with the law. The applicant\u2019s conversations with the State President had been recorded while the SSD had been tapping the applicant\u2019s telephone, and not that of the President. The operational investigation in respect of the applicant had been terminated on 11 November 2003. The applicant was advised to address the SSD in order to obtain the information held on him. To the extent that the applicant complained about the damage he had allegedly sustained by the disclosure of his telephone conversation [of 16 March 2003] to the media, he was advised to bring an action before the civil courts.", "21. On 16 December 2003 the SSD wrote to the Attorney General\u2019s Office that the information gathered pointed to the conclusion that the applicant and other persons were attempting to unlawfully acquire the shares of the \u201c\u017demaitijos keliai\u201d company. The behaviour of the applicant and his interlocutors could be characterised as extortion of property.", "22. In February 2004 the applicant attempted to challenge the lawfulness of the court order authorising the tapping of his telephone. On 18 February 2004 the Vilnius Regional Court informed the applicant by letter that the law did not provide for an appeal against court orders of that type.", "23. The applicant also wrote to the SSD, requesting it to disclose the results of its inquiry into the leak. He explained that such information was necessary in order to enable him to prepare a civil action for damages. The applicant also requested access to the information on him held by the SSD.", "24. On 9 March 2004 the SSD replied that the information recorded by the SSD had been declassified and transferred to the prosecutors as evidence in two sets of criminal proceedings unrelated to the applicant (namely, the proceedings against J.B. for blackmailing the State President and the proceedings relating to the influence of civil servants in the management decisions of the \u201c\u017demaitijos keliai\u201d company). The applicant was advised that he could obtain access to that evidence with a prosecutor\u2019s authorisation.", "25. On 10 March 2004 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Court of Appeal, again challenging the court order of 17 September 2003. He argued that there had been no lawful grounds for the tapping, and that his rights under Article 8 of the Convention had been breached. The applicant was also critical of the fact that the SSD had intercepted and made public his telephone conversations with the State President and J.B. He further complained about the absence of a domestic remedy against the court order authorising telephone tapping, alleging a violation of Article 13.", "By a letter of 6 April 2004, the President of the Court of Appeal returned to the applicant his complaint without examination. The President stressed that to grant a person the right of access to court orders authorising operational measures and to allow him to challenge such court orders would deprive the secret investigative actions of their meaning. He also noted that Article 8 of the Convention did not prohibit secret investigative measures as such, provided that the interference involved was necessary in the interests of national security or for the prevention of crime. Well-reasoned court orders were to guarantee that the investigating authorities acted within the law.", "26. On 15 March 2004 the SSD informed the Attorney General that in September and October 2003 the applicant and a Russian citizen, V.F., had organised visits by Lithuanian civil servants to the Russian Federation and visits by Russian officials to Lithuania. The applicant had acted in cooperation with the advisers to the Lithuanian President. The applicant also had business dealings with V.F. According to the SSD, the applicant had ceased to organise such visits once the Lithuanian media had made public the SSD report \u201cOn negative tendencies posing a threat to national security\u201d. The SSD also reiterated that the above facts could be linked to [unlawful] attempts to take over the shares of the \u201c\u017demaitijos keliai\u201d company. The SSD asked the Attorney General to verify the information by way of criminal proceedings.", "27. On 15 March 2004 the recordings and transcripts of the applicant\u2019s telephone conversations with Russian businessman V.F., J.B. and the State President were deposited with the registry of the Constitutional Court, which was about to hear the State President\u2019s impeachment case. The prosecutors did not impose any restrictions on the disclosure of those recordings.", "28. At the hearing of the Constitutional Court on 19 March 2004, some of the recordings were played. Given that the hearing was public and directly broadcast by national television, the conversations were aired.", "29. On 22 March 2004 the applicant requested the opening of a criminal investigation in relation to the disclosure of the contents of his conversations at the Constitutional Court\u2019s hearing. He argued that after the disclosure \u201cnone of his foreign partners would want to do business with [him] or [his] company\u201d.", "30. On 25 March 2004 the prosecutors refused to open criminal proceedings. They noted that the information had been disclosed during a public hearing at the Constitutional Court and in accordance with domestic law. A further complaint by the applicant was dismissed by the Attorney General, who observed that disclosure of the applicant\u2019s conversations during the proceedings in the Constitutional Court was a normal part of the judicial process. Furthermore, the disclosed materials contained no information about the applicant\u2019s private life. By a final decision of 7 May 2004 the Vilnius City Second District Court upheld the prosecutors\u2019 decisions.", "31. On 31 March 2004 the Constitutional Court found that the State President had committed gross violations of the Constitution and a breach of his constitutional oath on account of, inter alia, exploiting his official status to influence decisions by the \u201c\u017demaitijos keliai\u201d company concerning the transfer of shares with a view to defending the property interests of certain private individuals close to him. He was also found guilty of having knowingly hinted to J.B. that the law-enforcement institutions were investigating him and tapping his telephone conversations (see Paksas v. Lithuania [GC], no. 34932/04, \u00a7 27, 6 January 2011).", "32. The applicant lodged an administrative complaint against the refusal by the SSD to grant him access to the recordings of his telephone conversations.", "33. On 21 May 2004 the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s action as unsubstantiated. The court accepted that pursuant to the domestic legislation a person had a right to obtain information of a private nature held on him by the State institutions (see paragraphs 39 and 40 below). Nonetheless, the information the applicant sought access to had much wider implications; therefore it could not be regarded as concerning his private life. Furthermore, that information had in the meantime been given to the prosecutors as evidence in criminal proceedings (paragraph 24 above). Disclosure of such information was explicitly prohibited by Article 177 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court also noted that citizens\u2019 rights, as established in [Article 25 \u00a7 5 of] the Lithuanian Constitution, could be restricted only when this was provided for by law, necessary in a democratic society and with the aim of protecting rights and freedoms of others. In the applicant\u2019s case, such a restriction had been established by law. There was no proof that by refusing the applicant access to the transcripts of his telephone conversations the SSD had acted arbitrarily. It followed that the applicant\u2019s right to receive information had not been infringed.", "34. On 12 October 2004 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal, upholding the reasoning of the lower court.", "35. In reply to an inquiry by the applicant\u2019s lawyer, on 25 May 2005 the Deputy Attorney General wrote that to that day the SSD had not informed the prosecutors about the results of an internal investigation into the circumstances how the media had got hold of the applicant\u2019s telephone conversation with J.B. (paragraphs 12 and 19 above).", "36. By a letter of 15 July 2005, the SSD informed the applicant that, given that there was no ground for an internal investigation into the lawfulness and reasonableness of the tapping of his phone, as sanctioned by the court on 17 September 2003, no inquiry had ever taken place at the level of the SSD.", "37. The Law on Operational Activities (Operatyvin\u0117s veiklos \u012fstatymas), adopted by the Lithuanian Parliament and published in the State Gazette (Valstyb\u0117s \u017einios) on 28 June 2002, in force at the relevant time, provided:", "\u201c1.

Nonetheless, the authorities could refuse to reveal information, the disclosure of which could damage the interests of State security, defence, foreign policy, or hinder a criminal investigation.
