The applicants appealed the decision.", "By a decision of 20 April 2000 the Dolj County Court allowed the applicants' appeal and quashed the decision of 28 October 1998 on the ground that the claimed immovable property had been nationalised illegally by the State.

The Commission appealed the decision.", "By a final decision of 10 November 2000 the Craiova Court of Appeal allowed the Commission's appeal (recurs) and upheld the decision of 28 October 1998 on the ground that the administrative decisions acknowledging the lawfulness of the nationalisation had not been contested by the applicants, the said administrative decisions remained final and therefore the applicants could no longer institute proceedings seeking the recovery of possession of the claimed immovable property.", "In a letter of 12 September 2001 the applicants informed the Court that they refused to collect the compensation awarded to them on the basis of Law No. 112 of 1995 on the ground that the compensation awarded did not reflect the market value of the property.", "There is no evidence in the file that the applicants filed administrative applications or instituted court proceedings under the procedure provided for by the restitution laws (Laws Nos. 10 of 2001, 247 of 2005 and 1 of 2009) seeking restitution in natura or compensation equivalent to the market value of the claimed immovable property.", "In a letter of 10 February 2010, delivered to the applicants on 15 February 2010, they were asked to inform the Court if they had filed administrative applications or instituted court proceedings under the procedure provided for by the restitution laws.
