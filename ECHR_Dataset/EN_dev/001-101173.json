The applicant's lawyer was present at this hearing and lodged an unsuccessful request for the release of her client. The Court of Appeal decided to extend the applicant's pre-trial detention for up to a maximum of nine months (according to the relevant legal provisions, at the material time, the terms of pre-trial detention applied only to the periods when the case was being investigated. The time when the case was in the court, when the accused was studying the case-file etc. were not taken into consideration). In doing so, the court referred to the complexity of the case, the seriousness of the crimes of which the applicant was accused, his personality and the fact that he could obstruct justice if released.", "18.

On 18 May 2004 the Supreme Court of Ukraine dismissed the prosecution's application for a further extension of the applicant's pre-trial detention. The Supreme Court held that although the accused had been studying the twelve volumes of case materials since 27 August 2003 and he still had around ten volumes to study, there was no indication that the accused had deliberately delayed a trial. According to the court, the case materials had not been properly filed (in two volumes there were no lists of documents and pages were numbered in pencil). Therefore, the Supreme Court concluded that the investigation authorities had failed to properly present case-file materials and there were no grounds for an extension of the applicant's detention on remand.", "23. On 19 May 2004 the Prosecutor General's Office (\u0413\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430 \u041f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438) asked the Supreme Court to lodge an application for an extraordinary review of this decision, considering, inter alia, that such decision would allow \u201cpersons who have committed serious offences to avoid isolation from society\u201d.", "24.

In particular, the court held that the investigating officer could not limit the time for studying the case file.", "27. On 24 May 2004 the Supreme Court granted the prosecution's application for an extension of the applicant's pre-trial detention until 19 June 2004, as the applicant still needed time to study the case file. The court found no reason to release the applicant.", "28. On an unidentified date the case was transferred to the court for consideration of the charges against the applicant.", "29.

On 24 May 2005 the three Supreme Court judges, including judge P., upheld this judgment.", "31.

Between 2005 and 2007 the applicant instituted proceedings against the judges of the Court of Appeal complaining of different procedural shortcomings in the course of consideration of his criminal case. All of his complaints and subsequent appeals were rejected since the applicant should have raised these complaints during the examination of his case and not in a separate set of proceedings.", "33. Before his arrest the applicant suffered from limited mobility caused by a multiple fracture of his left thigh which was the result of a gunshot wound. He had a metallic plate fitted, but this became dislodged and caused a deformation of the bone. As a consequence the applicant's left leg was 3 cm shorter than his right and he suffered from pains in his left leg. According to a certificate issued by Yalta Town Hospital (\u042f\u043b\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043c\u0456\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043b\u0456\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043d\u044f) on 10 January 2002, the applicant received in-patient treatment there between 27 November and 12 December 2000 for a left thigh fracture which, according to this certificate, required further surgery and inpatient treatment.", "34.

According to the applicant, from the date of his admission and until 1 April 2003 he was subjected to a high security regime. In particular, he was only allowed outside his cell when handcuffed and accompanied by two guards with a prison dog in attendance. He was also held in a metal cage during his lawyer's visits and interviews by the investigator.", "37. On 16 January 2002 the applicant was punished for an unspecified offence with five days' confinement in a punishment cell (\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0446\u0435\u0440).

On 31 January 2002 the applicant's lawyer requested a surgeon from Polyclinic no. 3 of the Solomyansky District of Kyiv (\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0456\u043a\u043b\u0456\u043d\u0456\u043a\u0430 \u2116 3 \u0421\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c'\u044f\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0443 \u043c. \u041a\u0438\u0454\u0432\u0430) to give his opinion on the applicant's orthopaedic problems. The surgeon, having examined the applicant and his medical case file, found that he had sustained a multiple fracture of the left thigh and was suffering pain related to this fracture. He needed further examination by an orthopaedist and in-patient treatment in a specialist hospital. The applicant also required a crutch, orthopaedic shoes and strong painkillers.", "39. In March 2002 the applicant allegedly started to cough.", "40. On 21 and 22 August 2002 the applicant was examined by prison doctors and diagnosed as suffering from infiltrative tuberculosis, pleurisy and a compound fracture of the left thigh.

According to the applicant, on 10 December 2002 he was again punished with five days' detention in a punishment cell. Since the temperature there was lower and humidity higher than in the medical cell, the applicant's health deteriorated significantly.", "46. The Government submitted that between 12 March and 28 April 2003 the applicant again refused to take medication.", "47. In October 2003 the applicant was examined by the Head of the Orthopaedic Department of the Kyiv Medical Academy of Postgraduate Studies (\u041a\u0430\u0444\u0435\u0434\u0440\u0430 \u043e\u0440\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0456\u0457 \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0457 \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0457 \u0430\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0456\u0457 \u043f\u0456\u0441\u043b\u044f\u0434\u0438\u043f\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0457 \u043e\u0441\u0432\u0456\u0442\u0438) who, in his opinion of 10 October 2003, stated that the applicant's compound fracture of the left thigh required in-patient treatment in a specialist hospital.", "48. In 18 November 2003 the applicant's state of health declined. He had two X-rays, and medication was administered directly into the pleural cavity. On 18 December 2003 the applicant was examined by P., a professor of phthisiology, who prescribed him further treatment.", "49. In January 2004 the applicant's tuberculosis was aggravated by a pyopneumothorax (accumulation of pus in the pleural cavity) on account of which he was transferred to the Institute of Phthisiology and Pulmonology (\u0406\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0442 \u0444\u0442\u0456\u0437\u0456\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0456\u0457 \u0442\u0430 \u043f\u0443\u043b\u044c\u043c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0456\u0457 (hereinafter - \u201cthe Institute\u201d)) on 4 February 2004.", "50.

On 9 March 2004 the applicant was transferred from the Institute to SIZO no. 13. According to the applicant, because his treatment at the Institute had not been finished, he had still had tubes in his lungs for draining pus and further antibiotic treatment when he was transferred. He had received no such treatment in the SIZO and since the place where the tubes were inserted had become infected, the applicant had removed them himself.", "53. According to a letter, written in reply to a request for information made by the applicant's lawyer on 11 March 2004 and signed by the Institute's head doctor, the head of the relevant department and the treating doctor at the Institute, the applicant's treatment had consisted of pleural drainage and the administration of antibiotics, carried out in parallel with intensive anti-tuberculosis treatment. It was necessary to continue this treatment in future. The doctors were aware of the applicant's orthopaedic problems, which aggravated his general condition, but this had not affected his treatment for tuberculosis.", "54.

The continued failure of the prison authorities to address this condition and his consequent reduced immunity may have been the reason why the applicant had contracted tuberculosis. The experts found that the applicant required specialist in-patient treatment, which could not be provided in the medical unit of SIZO no. 13.", "56.
