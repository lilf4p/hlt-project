Under the provisions of the 1969 Code there were three different legal avenues whereby a detained person could challenge the lawfulness of his or her detention and thus possibly obtain release. Under Article 212. \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure he could appeal to a court against a detention order given by a prosecutor (see \u00a7 41 above). Under Article 222 \u00a7\u00a7 2(1) and 3 he could lodge an appeal against a further decision by that court prolonging his detention at a prosecutor's request. Finally, Article 214 of the Code stated that an accused could at any time apply to the authority conducting the criminal proceedings, i.e. the prosecutor or the court, depending on the stage the proceedings had reached, to have a preventive measure quashed or altered.", "47. Imposition and prolongation of preventive measures, including detention on remand, were examined by the courts in proceedings held in camera. The presence of the parties at court sessions other than hearings, including sessions held in proceedings concerning review of detention on remand, was regulated in Articles 87 and 88 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which, insofar as relevant, provided:", "\"The court pronounces its decisions at a hearing if the law provides for it; and otherwise, at a court session held in camera. ...\"", "\"A court session in camera may be attended by a prosecutor (...); other parties may attend if the law provides for it.\"", "48.

Pursuant to Article 249 of the new Code, before deciding on the application of the preventive measures, the court shall hear the person charged with offence. The lawyer of the detainee should be allowed to attend in the court session, if he or she is present. It is not mandatory to inform the lawyer of the date and time of the court session, unless the suspect so requests and if it will not hinder the proceedings.", "49.
