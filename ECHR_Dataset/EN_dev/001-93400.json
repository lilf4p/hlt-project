Shortly after BiH [i.e. Bosnia and Herzegovina] was internationally recognised as an independent state on 6 April 1992, hostilities broke out in Sarajevo, marking the beginning of a conflict within the city, which would last until 1995. Even before the conflict began, armed forces occupied strategic positions in and around Sarajevo. The city was subsequently subjected to blockade, bombardment and sniper attacks from these positions. From May 1992, Bosnian Serb Forces under the command and control of General Ratko MLADIC used shelling and sniping to target civilian areas of the city and its civilian population and institutions, killing and wounding civilians, and thereby also inflicting terror upon the civilian population. Much of the bombardment and sniping was from positions in the hills around and overlooking Sarajevo, from which the attackers had a commanding view of the city, its population and institutions.\u201d", "and", "\u201c20.

By using the word \u2018committed\u2019 in this indictment, the Prosecutor does not suggest that the accused physically committed any of the crimes charged personally. \u2018Committed\u2019 in this indictment includes participation in a joint criminal enterprise.", "21. The objective of the joint criminal enterprise within BiH was the elimination or permanent removal, by force or other means, of Bosnian Muslim, Bosnian Croat, or other non-Serb inhabitants from large areas of BiH through the commission of crimes which are punishable under Articles 3, 4, and 5 of the Statute of the Tribunal. General Ratko MLADIC participated in the joint criminal enterprise as a co-perpetrator and/or an aider and abettor.", "...", "24. Numerous individuals participated in this joint criminal enterprise.

As Commander of the Main Staff of the VRS, General Ratko MLADIC, acting individually and in concert with other members of the joint criminal enterprise, participated in the joint criminal enterprise from no later than 12 May 1992 until at least 22 December 1996 in the following ways:", "(a) Planning, preparing, facilitating, or executing a campaign of persecutions, which included acts of genocide, within BiH, by establishing control of the municipalities listed in Paragraph 36 of the indictment [amongst others, Vogo\u0161\u0107a]; attacking and destroying non-Serb towns and villages, as well as looting, destroying, and/or appropriating residential, commercial and religious properties in the municipalities; killing and terrorising the non-Serb inhabitants, and submitting them to cruel and inhumane treatment and conditions, including physical, psychological and sexual abuse, often in detention facilities; using non-Serbs for forced labour, including at front lines, and as human shields; imposing restrictive and discriminatory measures on the non-Serb population; and separating, deporting, and permanently removing non-Serbs who did not subjugate themselves to Serb authorities;", "(b) Planning, preparing, facilitating, or executing a protracted military campaign of artillery and mortar shelling and sniping into civilian areas of Sarajevo and upon its civilian population and institutions, killing and wounding civilians, and thereby inflicting terror upon its civilian population; ...\u201d", "and", "\u201cCount 1: GENOCIDE, punishable under Articles 4(3)(a), 7(1) and 7(3) of the Statute of the Tribunal;", "Count 2: COMPLICITY IN GENOCIDE, punishable under Articles 4(3)(e), 7(1) and 7(3) of the Statute of the Tribunal.\u201d", "14.

The applicant argued that according to the indictment against Mr Mladi\u0107 the acts of the \u201cjoint criminal enterprise\u201d mentioned in paragraph 24 had included murders amounting to \u201cgenocide\u201d committed in the municipality of Vogo\u0161\u0107a, an area under the applicant\u2019s territorial responsibility, but that this crime was not included on the applicant\u2019s indictment. \u201cGenocide\u201d being a crime more serious than any with which the applicant had been charged, the confirmation of this indictment by Judge O. reflected on the latter\u2019s part a preconception that the applicant\u2019s guilt was great indeed.", "16. On 3 February 2003 the challenge was dismissed by Judge L., who found that the confirmation of the amended indictment reflected no more than a provisional view of the validity of the charges against Mr Mladi\u0107 and could not be seen as prejudicial to his impartiality vis-\u00e0-vis the applicant, who moreover continued to benefit from the presumption of innocence.", "17. On 25 May 2007 the applicant, through a firm of lawyers in Belgrade, lodged a communication with the Human Rights Committee under the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (\u201cthe Optional Protocol\u201d).

The latter lacked jurisdiction to establish facts for itself and had moreover deprived the applicant of an appeal against the life sentence.", "The applicant asked the Human Rights Committee to order a full retrial by the ICTY\u2019s Trial Chamber.", "18.
