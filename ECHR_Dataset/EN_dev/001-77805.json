On 31 July 2003 the court for the third time requested the Centre to carry out the examination. By letter of 27 November 2003 the Centre acceded to the request but asked for further information. It appears that the necessary information was furnished.", "32. The court received a completed expert report on 30 July 2004 and scheduled the next hearing for 30 November 2004. On that date the proceedings did not take place because of the judge's involvement in a different set of proceedings. The case was adjourned until 6 December 2004.

The proceedings continued on 12 January 2005 and lasted, with interruptions, until 25 February 2005.
