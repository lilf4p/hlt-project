In a decision dated 7 May 2009 and published in the Official Gazette on 7 October 2009, the Constitutional Court examined the independence and impartiality of military courts on account of the presence of a military officer on the bench. The Constitutional Court firstly pointed out that the officer sitting on the bench of the military criminal court was appointed on a case by case basis by his hierarchical superiors and continued to perform his other military duties while also acting as a judge. Noting that the military officer remained in the service of the military authorities, the Constitutional Court found that military courts could not be considered as compatible with the principle of judicial independence guaranteed under Article 9 of the Constitution. As a result, the Constitutional Court decided to repeal section 2(1) of Law no. 353 on the Composition and Functioning of Military Courts. The decision of the Constitutional Court became effective one year after its publication in the official gazette."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
