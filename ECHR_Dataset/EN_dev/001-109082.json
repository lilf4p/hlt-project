On 17 June 2001 Mr Shumkov was placed in a disciplinary cell, where on 1 August 2001 he slashed his left wrist. After medical aid had been administered to him, he was ordered to return to the cell. When Mr Shumkov refused to comply, officers L. and S. used rubber truncheons and physical force to return him to his cell.", "15. On 4 August 2001 at 2 a.m. Mr Shumkov knocked at the door of his cell to attract the warder\u2019s attention, and when the warder Yu. came over Mr Shumkov said that he needed pills for blood pressure. Warder Yu. reported accordingly to Major P., an officer on duty, who promptly arrived at the disciplinary cell and, having opened the door, found that Mr Shumkov had slashed veins in his elbows. Mr Shumkov said that he needed a bandage but refused to accept medical assistance from the warders and also said that he would not let anybody into the cell except for the prison doctor. At 2.15 a.m. Major P. sent officer D. to fetch the prison doctor, G. At around 2.40 a.m. Dr G. arrived, dressed the wounds and administered injections of cardiamine and caffeine. Mr Shumkov was then placed on a stretcher and transported to the medical unit; however, he was dead upon arrival at the unit as a result of heavy blood loss. The time of death was entered in the register as 2.40 a.m.", "16. On 6 August 2001 a post-mortem report was drawn up. According to the report, the cause of Mr Shumkov\u2019s death was heavy blood loss as a result of injuries to the large blood vessels in the antecubital fossa and forearms.", "17. On 10 August 2001 the prison governor, K., decided not to open a criminal investigation into the death of Mr Shumkov for lack of corpus delicti.", "18. On 17 August 2001 the Kazachinsko-Lenskiy District Prosecutor\u2019s Office quashed that decision and referred the case back for additional inquiries. He stated, in particular, that in the course of the inquiries conducted it had not been established whether the officers on duty had tried to provide Mr Shumkov with medical aid and that neither the officers on duty nor the detainees held in adjacent cells had been questioned.", "19. On 20 August 2001 the prison doctor G. provided an explanation concerning the events of 4 August 2001 to the Kazachinsko-Lenskiy District Prosecutor\u2019s Office. He submitted:", "\u201cAt 2.30 a.m. on 4 August 2001 a service car arrived to collect me from my home, and I was told that I had to go urgently to the [correctional facility] since a detainee [had collapsed] in a disciplinary cell. I immediately got into the car and at 2.40 a.m. we arrived at the [correctional facility]. Having entered the disciplinary wing, I asked to open the cell where [Mr] Shumkov was being held. [When] the warder opened the door, I saw that [Mr Shumkov] was lying motionless on the floor and blood was splashed around the whole cell. Having examined [Mr Shumkov\u2019s] elbow joints, I found that a vein and an artery were cut open on the left elbow joint and similar injuries had been caused to the right elbow joint. I immediately dressed the wounds and administered injections of cardiamine, caffeine..., glucose and gluconate and performed artificial ventilation. Since the treatment had no effect, [Mr Shumkov] was transported to the medical unit and fifteen minutes after the beginning of the treatment I pronounced him dead as a result of heavy blood loss. Before my arrival at the disciplinary cell the warders did not provide [Mr] Shumkov with medical aid since he requested to be seen by a doctor and refused to accept medical aid until the [doctor\u2019s] arrival. On 1 August 2001 [Mr] Shumkov had committed an act of self-mutilation, having slashed minor blood vessels on his left arm... An antiseptic dressing was applied. If [on 4 August 2001] I had arrived twenty or thirty minutes earlier, it would still have been impossible ... to save [Mr Shumkov\u2019s] life since he had arteries and veins slashed in both arms.\u201d", "20. On 21 August 2001 the prison governor K. again refused to open a criminal investigation as no crime had been committed. He stated that on 4 August 2001 the prisoner had asked warders to call for a doctor because he had high blood pressure. The warders had discovered that the prisoner had cut veins in both elbows. Mr Shumkov had then been placed in the medical unit, where he had died as a result of heavy blood loss.", "21. On 24 August 2001 the Kazachinsko-Lenskiy District Prosecutor\u2019s Office refused to open a criminal investigation into the death of Mr Shumkov for lack of corpus delicti.", "22. On 4 June 2002 the Office of the Prosecutor General set aside the decision of 24 August 2001 and opened a criminal investigation. The prosecutor noted that the district prosecutor\u2019s office had failed to investigate the grounds for Mr Shumkov\u2019s confinement in a disciplinary cell, the circumstances leading to his suicide and his mental state, in particular taking into account the medical records concerning his treatment from 1996 to 2001. Nor had they identified the object with which Mr Shumkov had slashed the veins in his elbows.", "23. The case was forwarded to the Irkutsk Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office. The applicant was informed of that decision by letters of 7 and 25 June 2002.", "24. On 8 July 2002 another post-mortem report was drawn up on the basis of Mr Shumkov\u2019s medical file. It confirmed the findings of the postmortem report of 6 August 2001.", "25. On 15 July 2002 the prison doctor G. was questioned. He stated that he had known Mr Shumkov since June 2001, when the latter had complained of headaches and high blood pressure. At around 2.40 a.m. on 4 August 2001, following a call from the officer on duty, he had arrived at the disciplinary cell, where he had found that Mr Shumkov had slashed his veins. Dr G. had dressed the wounds and administered an injection of caffeine; however, by that time Mr Shumkov was already in a semiconscious state. Mr Shumkov had been then transported to the medical unit, where, according to doctor G.\u2019s statement, he had died at 2.40 a.m.", "26. On the same date the Ust-Kuta District Prosecutor\u2019s Office refused to institute criminal proceedings against officers L. and S. concerning the events of 1 August 2001, and against warder Yu. and Major P. concerning the events of 4 August 2001. The decision stated, inter alia, that after Mr Shumkov had committed an act of self-mutilation on 1 August 2001, his cell had been searched on several occasions and no forbidden items had been found. On 4 August 2001 warder Yu. and Major P. had immediately provided Mr Shumkov with first aid.", "27. On an unspecified date the applicant complained about the length of the criminal investigation. On 30 December 2002 the Ust-Kuta District Prosecutor\u2019s Office replied to her that it had questioned all the witnesses and had examined medical evidence and that an expert report on Mr Shumkov\u2019s mental state at the relevant time had been commissioned.", "28. On 27 January 2003 the Ust-Kuta District Prosecutor\u2019s Office discontinued the criminal proceedings against the prison governor K. and officer Y., the head of the operating unit, for lack of corpus delicti. It appears that on an unspecified date that decision was quashed.", "29. On 31 January 2003 a commission of four psychiatrists and one psychologist drew up a forensic psychiatric report in respect of Mr Shumkov. The commission concluded as follows:", "\u201c[The commission\u2019s] conclusion:", "[Mr] Shumkov suffered from a chronic psychiatric disorder in the form of psychopathy of mixed type. [This diagnosis] is confirmed by the anamnesis, medical documents and the criminal case file: [Mr Shumkov] had such character traits as difficulty in communication, quarrelsomeness, hot temper, irritability, aggressiveness, affective instability, tendency towards hysterical and demonstrative reactions with self-mutilation in subjectively difficult situations, tendency towards simulative behaviour (his examination and lengthy monitoring in the course of repeated placements for psychiatric and neurological in-patient treatment did not confirm the epileptic nature of the \u2018fits\u2019) ... However, the above-mentioned peculiarities of [Mr Shumkov\u2019s] psychic state were not accompanied by a broad decrease in intellect or disturbances of thought, delirium, hallucinations or disturbances of critical and prognostic functions, since as a whole he could control his actions (his conduct changed depending on the place and environment, he took into account the social status and rank of the interlocutor), realise the meaning of his actions and direct them. In the period preceding [the act of self-mutilation committed by Mr Shumkov] ... he did not display signs of a temporary mental disorder or dementia, he did not have delirium or hallucinations, and he could realise the meaning of his actions and direct them.", "The psychologist\u2019s conclusion:", "Psychological analysis of the contents of the criminal case file confirms that [Mr] Shumkov had such individual psychological peculiarities as egocentrism, emotionally volitional instability, hot temper, increased irritability, malignance, aggressiveness, difficulties in interpersonal contact, tendency towards conflict in close contact, tendency to create conflict situations, [tendency towards] asocial acts, and impulsiveness. In subjectively difficult situations [he] displayed affective outbursts, demonstrative behaviour, a tendency towards impulsive behavioural reactions, simulative behaviour and suicide attempts... The analysis of the contents of the criminal case file confirms the lack of extreme conditions which would have prompted the suicide, and of conditions that would have been conducive to the accumulation of negative emotional experiences and ... neuropsychological tension. [Mr Shumkov\u2019s] individual psychological peculiarities were conducive to his committing suicide.\u201d", "30. On 28 February 2003 Ust-Kuta District Prosecutor\u2019s Office again discontinued the criminal proceedings against the prison governor K. and officer Y. on the same ground as before.", "31. On 31 March 2003 the Deputy Prosecutor of the Irkutsk Region quashed the decision of 28 February 2003 as ill-founded and premature. He stated, in particular, that the investigating authorities had failed to clarify all the circumstances preceding Mr Shumkov\u2019s death, had not fully complied with the instructions of the Office of the Prosecutor General, had not made a legal assessment of the correctional facilities\u2019 officers\u2019 actions as regards the search in the disciplinary cell, and of the prison doctor G.\u2019s actions as regards the untimely medical aid provided on 4 August 2001.", "32. On 28 May 2003 the Ust-Kuta District Prosecutor\u2019s Office discontinued the criminal proceedings on the following grounds.", "33. According to the decision, Mr Shumkov was irritable, aggressive, had an explosive temper and had constant conflicts with other detainees and warders. He often complained of poor health and headaches. During the period of serving his sentence, that is, from December 1993 to August 2001, Mr Shumkov was on eleven occasions admitted to hospitals within the penal system. In 1995 he was diagnosed with epilepsy; however, the diagnosis was not confirmed and in 1998 it was changed to psychopathy. From 23 May to 9 June 2001 Mr Shumkov underwent treatment for his condition in Hospital No. 1 in the Irkutsk Region. For swearing and threatening physical violence he was discharged from the hospital on 9 June 2001 and transferred back to correctional facility IK-20. Between 10 April and 1 August 2001 Mr Shumkov was subjected to disciplinary measures on six occasions.", "34. On 17 June 2001 Mr Shumkov was placed in a disciplinary cell for a breach of discipline. On 1 August 2001 he cut his veins. After medical aid had been administered to him, he refused to return to his cell, insulted and threatened officers L. and S. and grabbed L.\u2019s uniform. So as to prevent his unlawful threats, L. and S., using physical force and rubber truncheons, placed him in the cell. Thereafter Mr Shumkov was examined by a member of staff of the medical unit, who noted bruises on his body and extremities. According to the results of the investigation, officers L. and S. lawfully used rubber truncheons and physical force against Mr Shumkov. On the same date the prison governor ordered Mr Shumkov\u2019s placement in a disciplinary cell for the act of self-mutilation.", "35. At around 2.10 a.m. on 4 August 2001 Mr Shumkov, while being held in disciplinary cell no. 20, cut his veins. He refused medical aid from the officers on duty and requested to be seen by a doctor. At around 2.40 a.m. the prison doctor G. provided Mr Shumkov with medical aid, having dressed the wounds and administered injections, following which Mr Shumkov was transported to the medical unit, where he died at 2.45 a.m. as a result of heavy blood loss.", "36. The prison governor K. submitted that on 1 August 2001 he had ordered Mr Shumkov\u2019s placement in a disciplinary cell for having committed an act of self-mutilation.", "37. A witness, S-v, stated that on 4 August 2001 he had been held in an adjacent disciplinary cell when he had heard Mr Shumkov shouting and complaining of high blood pressure. Then Mr Shumkov had cut his veins. S-v did not know why he had done so.", "38. Major P. stated that on 4 August 2001 he and warder Yu. had been among the officers on duty in the disciplinary wing. At around 2.10 a.m. he had heard screaming from cell no. 20, where Mr Shumkov was being held. At around 2.15 a.m. he and warder Yu. had entered the cell and had seen that Mr Shumkov had cut his veins. They had tried to provide him with medical aid so as to stop the bleeding, but he had firmly refused to be aided and to leave the cell and had stated that he needed a doctor. Major P. had then called for a doctor, who had arrived at the disciplinary wing at 2.40 a.m. Dr G. had dressed the wounds and had administered injections, following which Mr Shumkov had immediately been transported to the medical unit. However, because of the blood loss he had died there at around 2.45 a.m. In the course of additional questioning Major P. submitted that late in the evening of 3 August 2001 he and warders D. and Yu. had conducted an inspection of the disciplinary wing and had not found any forbidden objects.", "39. Warder Yu. made a similar statement and added that after Mr Shumkov had been pronounced dead, officer Y., the head of the operating unit, had arrived at the disciplinary wing and conducted an inspection of cell no. 20.", "40. Dr G. submitted that on 4 August 2001 he had been the prison doctor on standby duty. At around 2.40 a.m., after a call from an officer on duty, he had arrived at the disciplinary wing, where in cell no. 20 he had dressed the wounds and administered an injection of caffeine to Mr Shumkov, who had cut his veins. At the time Mr Shumkov had been in a semi-conscious state. Then Mr Shumkov had been transported on a stretcher to the medical unit, where he had died. Dr G. had pronounced him dead at 2.45 a.m.", "41. The post-mortem report stated that the death of Mr Shumkov had occurred because of heavy blood loss as a result of injuries caused by the slashing of the large vessels in the elbows and forearms. It also noted that the prisoner had had bruises on his body and legs.", "42. According to a psychiatric and psychological expert report, Mr Shumkov suffered from psychopathic personality disorder, was in constant conflict with other persons, and tended towards hysterical behaviour, self-mutilation, suicide attempts and simulation of epileptic fits. However, he was able to assess and control his conduct and never showed symptoms of imbecility. The experts did not establish the existence of any circumstances which could have prompted Mr Shumkov to commit suicide.", "43. In the course of the investigation no proof of prison governor K.\u2019s and officer Y.\u2019s having committed such offences as abuse of official powers and incitement to suicide was found.", "44. In the course of additional inquiries, it was established that Mr Shumkov had cut his veins with a piece of a blade from a disposable safety razor which he had had with him in the disciplinary cell as it was allowed by the internal regulations. When warder D. had asked Mr Shumkov what he had done with the piece of blade, he had replied that he had placed it in the lavatory pan.", "45. The additional check also established that duty schedules were fixed for medical staff for holidays and weekends. At night a member of the medical staff remained on duty at his home. The time required for a member of the medical staff to arrive at the correctional facility in reply to an urgent call depended on the distance between his home and the facility. Dr G., who had been the prison doctor on duty on 4 August 2001, had arrived at the facility within twenty minutes from the departure of the operating unit to fetch him. This was also confirmed by Dr G. in the course of additional questioning and by the head of the medical unit, K-v.", "46. Warder D. stated that during the night of 3 to 4 August 2001 he had been the assistant officer on duty. At around 10 p.m. on 3 August 2001 he, Major P. and warder Yu. had conducted an inspection of the disciplinary wing and had found no forbidden objects. At around 2 a.m. on 4 August 2001 or a little later, following a call from warder Yu., he had arrived at disciplinary cell no. 20 and had seen that Mr Shumkov had cut his veins. When he had asked him how he had cut his veins, Mr Shumkov had explained that he had used a piece of blade from a disposable safety razor which he had thrown into the lavatory pan. Mr Shumkov had refused to leave the cell to be provided with first aid and requested to be seen by a doctor. Warder D. then had gone to fetch Dr G. and had returned with him twenty minutes later. He did not know what medical aid Dr G. had provided since he had left to inspect the facility. Having reached the medical unit, he had learnt from Dr G. that Mr Shumkov had died of blood loss.", "47. Having regard also to (i) Annex 1 to the Internal Regulations of Correctional Institutions, adopted by order no. 224 of the Ministry of the Interior of 30 July 2001, which did not forbid the keeping of a disposable safety razor in a disciplinary cell, and (ii) the Instruction on Supervision of Inmates held in Correctional Facilities, adopted by order no. 83 of the Ministry of Justice of 7 March 2000, which provided that constant supervision of inmates held in disciplinary cells must be effected through the inspection hole in the doors of the cells, and that officers on duty must call a doctor for inmates requiring medical assistance, the Ust-Kuta District Prosecutor\u2019s Office concluded that the prison governor K., the head of the operating unit Y., Major P., warders D. and Yu. and the prison doctor G. had not committed the alleged offences of incitement to suicide, abuse of official powers and neglect of duty or failure to assist in a dangerous situation, and discontinued the criminal proceedings.", "48. On 9 September 2004 the Office of the Prosecutor General dismissed a complaint by the applicant about the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings, finding that decision to have been lawful and well-founded.", "49. On an unspecified date the applicant challenged the decision of 28 May 2003 before a court. She also complained that her son\u2019s beating with rubber truncheons by warders on 1 August 2001 had not been lawful.", "50. On 29 October 2004 the Ust-Kuta District Court of the Irkutsk Region dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint. The applicant was not present at the hearing.", "51. On 14 February 2005 the Irkutsk Regional Court quashed that decision and remitted the case for a fresh examination on the ground that the applicant had not been duly notified of the hearing of 29 October 2004.", "52. On 5 April 2005 the Ust-Kuta District Court held that the prosecutor\u2019s decision was lawful and dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaints.", "53. On 6 September 2005 the Irkutsk Regional Court upheld the decision on appeal. The applicant\u2019s subsequent application for supervisory review of that decision was refused by the Irkutsk Regional Court on 18 January 2006.", "54. On 29 July 2002 Dr P., a neuropathologist at prison hospital no. 2, was questioned. He submitted that in March 2000 Mr Shumkov had been admitted to the hospital, having been diagnosed with epilepsy. However, the diagnosis had not been confirmed and Mr Shumkov had been diagnosed with a psychopathic disorder. During his stay at the hospital he had displayed unbalanced behaviour and mood swings, and had been irritable and emotionally unstable. Mr Shumkov had been provided with a complete course of treatment. His parents had never been asked to provide any medicines for him since all the required medicines had been available at the hospital.", "55. Having examined Mr Shumkov\u2019s medical file, the neurologist G. stated that in his childhood he had suffered a craniocerebral trauma. Since 1988 he had been suffering from frequent fits that had mostly occurred at night. He had been diagnosed with epilepsy and had undergone in-patient treatment in 1992. Later he had been treated in the psychiatric ward of prison hospital no. 1. There he had repeatedly feigned polymorphous fits and had been placed under constant monitoring, which had revealed no momentary lapses of reason or convulsive contractions, although irritability, hot temper and rudeness had remained. Accordingly, the diagnosis of epilepsy had been changed to one of psychopathy. During the term of Mr Shumkov\u2019s detention, in-patient and outpatient treatment and supervision had been fully available to him.", "56. The head of a psychiatric ward, Sh., having studied Mr Shumkov\u2019s medical file, concluded that while in detention he had been fully provided with the requisite medical assistance for his mental and somatic state. The diagnosis of epilepsy had been correctly discarded and had not subsequently been confirmed.", "57. On 30 April 2009 L., the head of the medical unit of correctional facility IK-20, issued a certificate concerning the circumstances of Mr Shumkov\u2019s death. The certificate stated:", "\u201cAt around 2 a.m. on 4 August 2001 ... [Mr Shumkov] knocked at the door of disciplinary cell no. 2, told [warder Yu.] that he had high blood pressure and asked him to call for a doctor on duty.", "[Warder Yu.] reported to [Major P.], [who] immediately sent [warder D.] in a car to fetch [prison doctor G.], who lived near the correctional facility and was required to go to the facility in the event of an emergency. At the same time [Mr Shumkov] was placed under constant visual supervision through the inspection hole in the door of the cell.", "At 2.15 a.m. [the warders] opened cell no. 20 following changes in [Mr Shumkov\u2019s] behaviour and discovered that he had committed an act of self-mutilation, having cut blood vessels in both arms.", "[Mr Shumkov] refused to leave the cell to receive medical assistance and stated that he would wait for the doctor in the cell. [The warders] brought bandages to the cell in order to dress the wounds. [Mr Shumkov] took the bandages but refused [the warders\u2019] medical assistance.", "At 2.30 a.m. [Dr G.] arrived and immediately provided [Mr Shumkov] with medical assistance in the cell. [He] dressed the wounds so as to stop the bleeding, administered injections to increase blood pressure and stimulate cardiac activity ..., and performed artificial lung ventilation and indirect heart massage, following which [Mr Shumkov] was taken to the medical unit ... where, despite the efforts to resuscitate him, at 2.40 a.m. he was pronounced dead as a result of heavy blood loss caused by the injuries to the large blood vessels.\u201d", "58. According to a certificate of 21 April 2009 issued by the prison authorities, during Mr Shumkov\u2019s detention in correctional facility IK-20 from 10 April to 23 May 2001 and from 9 June to 4 August 2001 he was held in conditions which complied with the relevant regulations. There was no infringement of Mr Shumkov\u2019s right to life by any officers of the correctional facility.", "59. Another certificate issued on the same date stated, inter alia, that in the course of serving his sentence Mr Shumkov had breached prison discipline thirty-five times, as a result of which he had on six occasions been placed in the disciplinary wing and twenty-seven times in solitary confinement in a disciplinary cell. In 2000 he was recognised as a persistent offender and placed in stricter conditions of detention. All these measures were applied lawfully. Mr Shumkov was hot-tempered, tended to create conflicts, behaved defiantly and did not react to admonitions.", "60. In an undated certificate prison officer A. stated that throughout the term of his imprisonment Mr Shumkov had physically resisted prison officers, provoked conflicts with other inmates, behaved aggressively and breached disciplinary regulations.", "61. In two undated certificates prison officers U. and E. stated that in 1999 they had served in correctional facility IK-6. They submitted that Mr Shumkov had been mentally unstable and had repeatedly created conflicts with other detainees, which was the reason for his subsequent transfer to a different correctional facility. A number of times he had attempted to commit acts of self-mutilation by cutting his forearms. He had also regularly been admitted for treatment in prison hospital no. 1.", "62. In a certificate of 16 April 2009 prison officer B. stated that during the term of his imprisonment Mr Shumkov had on a number of occasions been subjected to disciplinary sanctions for disobedience, insults and conflicts with other inmates. He had often been aggressive and violent. Such behaviour had been caused not only by his psychological particularities but by a manifest unwillingness to follow the prison rules.", "63. In a report of 20 April 2009 prison officer P-na stated that from 1996 to 2000 she had held a post as inspector of the living quarters. She remembered Mr Shumkov as a frequent offender who had behaved defiantly towards other detainees, which had often caused conflicts.", "64. On 2 August 2001 inspector K. of correctional facility IK-20 drew up an internal inspection report concerning the incident of 1 August 2001. According to the report, the use of rubber truncheons in respect of Mr Shumkov was lawful and proportionate.", "65. On 15 August 2002 the Ust-Kuta Prosecutor\u2019s Office refused to institute criminal proceedings against officers L. and S. in respect of the events of 1 August 2001. The decisions stated, inter alia:", "\u201cOn 1 August 2001 [the detainee Mr] Shumkov committed an act of self-mutilation having slashed his veins. However, he was provided with medical aid in due time.
