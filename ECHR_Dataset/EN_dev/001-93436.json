He is represented before the Court by Mr W. Tomczyk, a lawyer practising in Warsaw. The Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "Following the entry into force of the Law of 11 April 1997 \u201con disclosing work for or service in the State\u2019s security services or collaboration with them between 1944 and 1990 by persons exercising public functions\u201d (ustawa o ujawnieniu pracy lub s\u0142u\u017cby w organach bezpiecze\u0144stwa pa\u0144stwa lub wsp\u00f3\u0142pracy z nimi w latach 1944-1990 os\u00f3b pe\u0142ni\u0105cych funkcje publiczne) (the \u201c1997 Lustration Act\u201d), the applicant, a former Prime Minister who at the material time had been a member of the Sejm, declared that he had not collaborated with the Communist-era secret services.", "On 25 June 1999 the Commissioner of the Public Interest (Rzecznik Interesu Publicznego), Mr B. Nizie\u0144ski, applied to the Warsaw Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) for proceedings to be instituted in the applicant\u2019s case on the grounds that he had lied in his lustration declaration by denying that he had cooperated with the secret services.", "On 25 June 1999 the Warsaw Court of Appeal decided to institute lustration proceedings against the applicant. The court was composed of three judges: a judge rapporteur A.L. and judges Z.B. and R.K. The decision contained the following reasons:", "\u201cThe Commissioner of the Public Interest lodged with the Warsaw Court of Appeal an application for lustration proceedings to be instituted in respect of J\u00f3zef Oleksy.", "The Court of Appeal finds that the application should be granted. The materials submitted together with the application point to the assessment (wskazuj\u0105 na ocen\u0119) that J\u00f3zef Oleksy lodged an untrue lustration declaration.", "In those circumstances it has been decided as above.\u201d", "On 25 October 2000 the Warsaw Court of Appeal, acting as the firstinstance lustration court, found that the applicant had submitted an untrue lustration declaration because he had not revealed that he had intentionally and secretly collaborated with the State\u2019s secret services. The operative part of the judgment was served on the applicant; however, the reasoning was considered \u201ctop secret\u201d and, in accordance with Article 100 \u00a7 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, could only be consulted in the secret registry of the court.", "The applicant lodged an appeal.", "On 27 June 2000 the Warsaw Court of Appeal, acting as the secondinstance lustration court, allowed the applicant\u2019s appeal and quashed the impugned judgment.", "On 13 June 2004 the magazine Newsweek-Polska published an article on the applicant\u2019s lustration case and his alleged cooperation with the secret services. According to the applicant, the article relied on documents and information in the case file that had been classified \u201ctop secret\u201d and was presented in a manner that made him believe that they had been obtained from the Commissioner of the Public Interest.", "On 17 June 2004 the applicant applied to have the Commissioner, Mr B. Nizie\u0144ski, excluded from dealing with his case on the grounds that there was reasonable doubt as to his impartiality.", "On 24 June 2004 the First President of the Supreme Court decided that under domestic law he did not have the right to examine the applicant\u2019s challenge of the Commissioner as he could not be considered his superior within the meaning of Article 48 \u00a7 1 of the Code of the Criminal Procedure.", "The applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against that decision. On 21 September 2004 the Constitutional Court (Trybuna\u0142 Konstytucyjny) refused to hear the complaint, mainly on the ground that it was not competent to decide on issues concerning gaps in the law. It reiterated its role as a \u201cnegative legislator\u201d, in that it was called on to strike down laws that breached the Constitution, but had no legislative powers. An appeal by the applicant against that decision was dismissed on 19 May 2005. The applicant\u2019s lawyer was notified of this decision on 24 May 2005. On 19 May 2005 the Constitutional Court decided to inform the Sejm that the case disclosed a gap in the law in that it had not provided for a procedure for challenging the Commissioner of the Public Interest, nor an authority to which such a challenge could be directed. The closing of such a gap in the law was, in the court\u2019s opinion, indispensable to ensure the integrity of the legal system, and respect for the rule of law, defence rights and the right to court. The Commissioner of the Public Interest, Mr B. Nizienski, took part in the proceedings up to the end of the applicant\u2019s lustration trial on 22 December 2004.", "On 22 December 2004 the Warsaw Court of Appeal gave a judgment in which it found the applicant guilty of lying in his lustration declaration.

He complained, inter alia, that the judge, R.K., who dealt with the case at the initial stage of the proceedings, should have been disqualified from dealing with the case as there was reasonable doubt as to his impartiality.", "On 21 October 2005 the Warsaw Court of Appeal, acting as a secondinstance lustration court, upheld the impugned judgment. The applicant could consult the written reasons for the judgment in the secret registry of the court.", "On 26 January 2006 the applicant\u2019s lawyer consulted the file and complained to the court that the reasoned judgment did not contain the dissenting opinion. The dissenting opinion, which was 50 pages long, was submitted to the parties on 21 February 2006, only three days before the expiry of the time-limit for lodging a cassation appeal.", "On 24 February 2006 the applicant\u2019s lawyer lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court (S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy). He argued that the applicant had not been aware of an obligation to disclose his activities for the Agenturalny Wywiad Operacyjny, \u201cAWO\u201d, a separate agency, which according to information in his possession could not be considered as belonging to the secret services within the meaning of the Lustration Act.", "On 31 January 2007, after a hearing, the Supreme Court quashed both previous judgments of the Warsaw Court of Appeal of 21 October 2005 and 22 December 2004 and discontinued the lustration proceedings against the applicant (umorzy\u0142 post\u0119powanie).", "It established that the lustration declaration submitted by the applicant had been \u201csubjectively untrue but objectively true\u201d (obiektywnie nieprawdziwe lecz prawdziwe subiektywnie o\u015bwiadczenie lustracyjne).
