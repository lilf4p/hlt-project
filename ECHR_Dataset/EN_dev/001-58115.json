Since approximately 1985, serious disturbances have raged in the south-east of Turkey between the security forces and the members of the PKK (Workers\u2019 Party of Kurdistan). This confrontation has so far, according to the Government, claimed the lives of 4,036 civilians and 3,884 members of the security forces.", "11. At the time of the Court\u2019s consideration of the case, ten of the eleven provinces of south-east Turkey had since 1987 been subjected to emergency rule.", "12. In August 1987, while serving several sentences in Diyarbak\u0131r military prison, the applicant made the following remarks in an interview with journalists:", "\u201cI support the PKK national liberation movement; on the other hand, I am not in favour of massacres. Anyone can make mistakes, and the PKK kill women and children by mistake \u2026\u201d", "\u201c... PKK'n\u0131n ulusal kurtulu\u015f hareketini destekliyorum.

On 30 August 1987 the \u201cpress offences\u201d department of the Istanbul public prosecutor\u2019s office began a preliminary investigation in respect of the applicant among others, on the ground that he had \u201cdefended an act punishable by law as a serious crime\u201d, an offence under Article 312 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 31 below).", "14. On 28 September 1987 the Istanbul public prosecutor\u2019s office ruled that there was no case to answer in respect of the journalists and that it had no jurisdiction ratione loci to deal with Mr Zana\u2019s case. It sent the file to the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor.", "15. In an order of 22 October 1987 the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor ruled that he had no jurisdiction, on the ground that the offence committed by the applicant was governed by Article 142 \u00a7\u00a7 3\u20136 of the Criminal Code (a provision which makes it an offence to disseminate propaganda that is racist or calculated to weaken national sentiment). He forwarded the file to the public prosecutor at the Diyarbak\u0131r National Security Court.", "16. On 4 November 1987 the latter likewise ruled that he had no jurisdiction, on the ground that when the applicant had made his statement to the journalists he was in custody in a military prison and therefore had military status in law. He forwarded the file to the Diyarbak\u0131r military prosecutor\u2019s office.", "17. By means of an indictment dated 19 November 1987, the Diyarbak\u0131r military prosecutor\u2019s office instituted proceedings in the Diyarbak\u0131r Military Court against Mr Zana (among others) under Article 312 of the Criminal Code.

At a hearing before the Diyarbak\u0131r Military Court on 15 December 1987 the applicant argued that the court had no jurisdiction to hear his case and refused to put forward a defence on the merits.", "19. At a hearing on 1 March 1988 counsel for Mr Zana asked the Military Court to rule that it had no jurisdiction as the offence with which his client was charged was not a military one and a military prison could not be regarded as military premises. The court dismissed that application on the same day.", "20. On 28 July 1988 the applicant was transferred from Diyarbak\u0131r military prison to Eski\u015fehir civilian prison.", "21. The Eski\u015fehir Air Force Court, acting under powers delegated to it by the Diyarbak\u0131r Military Court, summoned the applicant to submit his defence. The applicant, who was on hunger strike, did not appear at the hearing on 2 November 1988. He did appear at one held on 7 December 1988 but refused to address the court, as he considered that it had no jurisdiction to try him.", "22. In a decision of 18 April 1989 the Diyarbak\u0131r Military Court held that it had no jurisdiction in the case and sent the file to the Diyarbak\u0131r National Security Court.", "23.

At a hearing held on 20 June 1990 by the Ayd\u0131n Assize Court, acting under powers delegated by the Diyarbak\u0131r National Security Court, the applicant refused to speak Turkish and said in Kurdish that he wished to defend himself in his mother tongue. The Assize Court pointed out to him that, if he persisted in his refusal to defend himself, he would be deemed to have waived his right to do so. Since Mr Zana continued to speak in Kurdish, the court noted in the record of the hearing that he had not put forward a defence.", "25. The proceedings then continued before the Diyarbak\u0131r National Security Court, where the applicant was represented by his lawyers.", "26. In a judgment of 26 March 1991 the Diyarbak\u0131r National Security Court sentenced the applicant to twelve months\u2019 imprisonment for having \u201cdefended an act punishable by law as a serious crime\u201d and \u201cendangering public safety\u201d. In accordance with the Act of 12 April 1991, he would have to serve one-fifth of the sentence (two months and twelve days) in custody and four-fifths on parole.", "27. The National Security Court held that the PKK qualified as an \u201carmed organisation\u201d under Article 168 of the Criminal Code, that its aim was to bring about the secession of part of Turkey\u2019s territory and that it committed acts of violence such as murder, kidnapping and armed robbery. The court also held that Mr Zana\u2019s statement to the journalists, the exact terms of which had been established during the judicial investigation, amounted to an offence under Article 312 of the Criminal Code.", "28. The applicant appealed on points of law on 3 April 1991. In a judgment of 19 June 1991, served on the applicant\u2019s representative on 18 July 1991, the Court of Cassation upheld the National Security Court\u2019s judgment.", "29.
