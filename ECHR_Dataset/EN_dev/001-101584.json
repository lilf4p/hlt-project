On unspecified dates they sued the competent authorities for adjustment of the monthly food allowance in line with the inflation rate.", "6. By two separate judgments of 4 June 2007, one in favour of Mr Pavlenko and another in favour of the remaining applicants, the Mineralniye Vody Town Court of the Stavropol Region upheld their actions in part. The court ordered the local department of the State Treasury to pay 1,283.86 RUB Russian roubles (RUB) to Mr Pavlenko and RUB 1,925.45 to each of the remaining applicants in monthly disability pension payments, to be adjusted in accordance with legal requirements. The court further ordered the local welfare authority to provide monthly the Treasury with the documents necessary to make the payments.

On 29 November 2007 the Presidium of the Stavropol Regional Court, by two separate judgments, quashed the awards of 4 June 2007 and remitted the cases for a fresh examination. The Presidium found that the lower court had erred in applying the provisions of the Law No. 1244-1 \u201cOn Social Protection of Citizens Exposed to Radiation as a Result of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station Explosion\u201d (\u201cthe Chernobyl Law\u201d) and, as a result, incorrectly determined the defendant authority in the case. The Presidium had not specified a due defendant.", "11.

Instead, the authorities started to pay the applicants monthly disability benefits in accordance with the relevant legislation.", "12. On 15 February 2008 the Town Court discontinued the proceedings in all cases except for that of Mr Pavlenko, due to the applicants' failure to appear before the first instance court. On 19 February 2008 the proceedings in Mr Pavlenko's case were discontinued by the Town Court on the same ground.", "13. In February 2009 the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation brought proceedings against all applicants claiming repayment of the lump sums they had received pursuant to the quashed judgments.
