He is represented before the Court by Mr O. Berg, a lawyer practising in Strasbourg. The respondent Government are represented by their Agent, Mrs A. Wittling-Vogel, Ministerialdirigentin, of the Federal Ministry of Justice.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "In March 1996 the applicant was first questioned by the police on suspicion of three counts of abetting economic subsidy fraud. The indictment was issued on 15 September 1999.", "On 16 May 2002 the M\u00fchlhausen Regional Court opened the main proceedings.", "On 6 June 2005 the M\u00fchlhausen Regional Court informed the applicant that it intended to terminate the proceedings in accordance with Article 206a of the Code of Criminal Procedure as it considered that the length of proceedings precluded their continuation (see \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201d below).", "On 12 June 2005 the applicant gave his consent to that discontinuation.", "On 16 June 2005 the prosecutor\u2019s office submitted that it would contest such termination of the proceedings. However, it suggested discontinuing the proceedings in accordance with Article 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201d below).", "On 23 June 2005 the Regional Court discontinued the proceedings in accordance with Article 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure after the applicant\u2019s lawyer had agreed to the proposed termination of the proceedings on the same day.", "On the same day the sitting judge of the Regional Court instructed the court\u2019s registry to formally serve the discontinuation order on the applicant\u2019s defence counsel and to informally transmit a copy of that decision to the applicant together with other documents, such as the submissions of the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office of 16 June 2005.", "On 24 June 2005 the applicant\u2019s defence counsel acknowledged receipt of the court\u2019s decision of 23 June 2005.", "On an unspecified date the applicant received the Regional Court\u2019s letter of 23 June 2005; however, it is disputed between the parties whether that letter contained the court\u2019s decision to discontinue the proceedings.", "Between 24 June 2005 and 27 July 2005 the applicant addressed further letters to the Regional Court requesting the court to comply with its obligation to proceed speedily.", "On 12 November 2007 the Court requested that the applicant provide information as to whether the proceedings had been discontinued in the meantime.", "On 26 November 2007 the applicant replied that he had not received any information about the discontinuation of the proceedings and that he did not know whether a discontinuation was imminent or intended.", "Therefore, on 22 January 2008 the Court decided to communicate the application to the respondent Government concerning the length of the proceedings.", "Under Article 206a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the court may terminate the proceedings by an order made outside the main hearing should a procedural impediment arise after the main proceedings have started. Thus the length of proceedings may preclude their continuation if, in exceptional circumstances, redress for the length of proceedings cannot be granted in a decision on the merits.", "Article 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure governs the discontinuation of criminal proceedings on the ground of insignificance. During the investigation proceedings the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office may discontinue the criminal proceedings if they concern an offence that does not carry a sentence of at least one year\u2019s imprisonment (Vergehen), if the defendant\u2019s guilt is of a minor nature and if there is no public interest in criminal prosecution. The court which has jurisdiction to open the main proceedings must consent to discontinuing the proceedings unless they concern offences which are not subject to an increased minimum penalty and the consequences ensuing from the offence were minor (Article 153 \u00a7 1). If the indictment has already been preferred with the court the latter may discontinue the proceedings at any stage under the conditions set out in Article 153 \u00a7 1 with the consent of both the public prosecutor\u2019s office and the defendant (Article 153 \u00a7 2)."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
