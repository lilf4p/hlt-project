The applicant was born in 1985. He is presently serving a prison sentence in Tajikistan.", "10. Until 2006 the applicant was living in his native village of Navgilem in the Sogdiskaya Region of Tajikistan. He was a merchant at the local food market.", "11. The events preceding the applicant\u2019s departure from Tajikistan were described by him as follows.", "12. From 2002 to 2005 the applicant attended a mosque, where he was studying the Quran under the tutorship of Mr S. Marufov. The latter was detained by local police and died in detention in May 2006. Before his death Mr Marufov had reportedly been ill-treated (see paragraph 102 below).", "13. Following Mr Marufov\u2019s death, the Tajik authorities started targeting his followers. The applicant fled the country, fearing prosecution on grounds of his religious activities.", "14. The applicant arrived in Russia in June 2006 and made a living from various low-skilled jobs in the Moscow suburbs.", "15. On 7 November 2006 the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Tajikistan brought criminal proceedings against the applicant and authorised his detention pending trial. The applicant was charged under Articles 186 \u00a7 2 and 187 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code of Tajikistan with forming, some time in 1992, together with several other individuals, a \u201ccriminal conspiracy\u201d named \u201cBayat\u201d (\u0411\u0430\u0439\u044a\u0430\u0442), which later joined a \u201ccriminal armed group\u201d named \u201cthe Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan\u201d (\u201cthe IMU\u201d). The second charge against the applicant concerned his alleged involvement in an armed attack carried out on 27 September 2006 on three members of the regional parliament.", "16. On the same date the Tajik Prosecutor\u2019s Office issued a warrant for the applicant\u2019s arrest based on the charges mentioned above and put his name on the list of \u201cwanted persons\u201d.", "17. The Russian police apprehended the applicant on 21 November 2009 in Moscow pursuant to an international search warrant issued by the Tajik authorities. He remained in detention pending extradition until 21 May 2011 (see paragraphs 3236 below).", "18. On 21 December 2009 and 29 March 2010 the Deputy Prosecutor General of Tajikistan asked his Russian counterpart to order the applicant\u2019s extradition to Tajikistan.", "19. On 17 June 2010 the Deputy Prosecutor General of Russia ordered the applicant\u2019s extradition. He found, inter alia, that the applicant had been charged in Tajikistan with involvement since 1992 in a criminal organisation, the IMU. The Deputy Prosecutor General also noted that at the end of 2005 the applicant had moved to Russia, where he had founded an armed cell of the IMU and that in 2006 he had transferred up to 5,000 United States dollars per month to the IMU leaders in Tajikistan, thus fuelling their terrorist activities, such as the murdering of State officials. The Deputy Prosecutor General considered that the applicant\u2019s acts were also punishable under the Russian Criminal Code and that his extradition could not be prevented by a crime he may have committed in Moscow, since no investigation or prosecution had been initiated in that respect. Nor did he find any obstacle to the applicant\u2019s extradition in either international treaties or legislation of the Russian Federation.", "20. The applicant complained about the extradition order to the Moscow City Court (\u201cthe City Court\u201d), stating that the Tajik authorities would subject him to torture with a view to making him confess to a crime he had not committed. He cited extensive case-law of the Court establishing the risk of torture to which certain applicants in a similar position would have been subjected in the event of extradition to that country (Khodzhayev v. Russia, no. 52466/08, 12 May 2010, and Khaydarov v. Russia, no. 21055/09, 20 May 2010). The applicant also emphasised the contradictions and even the absurdity of certain charges brought against him in Tajikistan, according to which he had been actively involved in terrorist activities since 1992 when he was still a small child.", "21. The Deputy Prosecutor General provided the City Court with a letter signed by his counterpart in Tajikistan, which contained, inter alia, the following assurances:", "\u201cWe guarantee that in accordance with the norms of international law [the applicant] will be provided with all opportunities to defend himself in the Republic of Tajikistan, including through the assistance of a lawyer. He will not be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and relevant United Nations and Council of Europe conventions and protocols thereto).", "The Criminal Code of Tajikistan does not provide for the death penalty in respect of the crimes imputed to [the applicant].", "The Prosecutor General\u2019s Office of Tajikistan guarantees that the aim of the extradition request in respect of [the applicant] is not his persecution on political grounds, or for reasons of his race, religious beliefs, nationality or political opinions.", "... Tajikistan undertakes to prosecute [the applicant] only for the crimes which constitute the basis of his extradition and that [the applicant] will not be handed over to a third State without the consent of the Russian Federation and will be free to leave the territory of the Republic of Tajikistan after having served his sentence.\u201d", "22. On 29 October 2010 the City Court held a public hearing. It allowed the request by the defence to question Ms E. Ryabinina, in her capacity as expert of the Russian Human Rights Institute, about the situation in Tajikistan. The expert responded to the questions at the public hearing, explaining the details of four recent judgments delivered by the Court in connection with the prospective extradition to Tajikistan of the applicants concerned and the legal implications for the Russian Federation (Khodzhayev, cited above; Khaydarov, cited above; Iskandarov v. Russia, no. 17185/05, 23 September 2010; and Gaforov v. Russia, no. 25404/09, 21 October 2010).", "23. By a judgment adopted on the same date, the City Court upheld the extradition order, finding no obstacle to the applicant\u2019s extradition to Tajikistan. The applicant\u2019s arguments, based on Russia\u2019s obligations under the Convention and the Court\u2019s case-law, were dismissed by the City Court in the following terms:", "\u201c... the arguments that the applicant might be persecuted on religious grounds and regarding a serious risk of torture in the course of criminal prosecution in Tajikistan ... are considered by the court to be unfounded since those arguments constitute assumptions that are in no way corroborated; quite to the contrary, they are completely rebutted by the case materials, which have been examined by the court, and in particular by the written guarantees provided by the Deputy Prosecutor General of the Republic of Tajikistan ...", "The arguments ... that torture and persecution on religious and political grounds take place in the Republic of Tajikistan as confirmed by documents of the European Court of Human Rights and other organisations for the defence of human rights ... are considered by the court to be unfounded, as those documents relate to other persons, but not to [the applicant]; moreover, those arguments are negated by the aforementioned written guarantees of the Tajik Prosecutor\u2019s Office.\u201d", "24. On 9 December 2010 the Supreme Court upheld the City Court\u2019s decision. The applicant\u2019s argument that his extradition would violate Article 3 of the Convention was dismissed by the Supreme Court by sole reference to the text of the written guarantees provided by the Tajik Prosecutor\u2019s Office.", "25. On 22 December 2009 the applicant applied to the Moscow City branch of the Russian Federal Migration Service (\u201cthe FMS\u201d) for refugee status. He argued that he had been persecuted in Tajikistan on the grounds of his religious beliefs and that he would be subjected to torture in the event of extradition.", "26. On 26 April 2010 the Moscow City branch of the FMS dismissed the application. The applicant was notified of the decision on 12 May 2010.", "27. On 26 August 2010 the Deputy Director of the FMS dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant against that decision. He reminded the applicant that the IMU was considered by the supreme courts of both Tajikistan and Russia as an organisation carrying out terrorist activities. While noting the extensive international criticism of the use of torture and the impunity of the State officials responsible in Tajikistan, the Deputy Director of the FMS found no well-founded reason for fearing that the applicant would be persecuted on religious grounds. Noting that the great majority of the population of Tajikistan were Muslims, he found it unlikely that the applicant would be persecuted solely on the basis of his Islamic beliefs. As to the authorities\u2019 attempt to strengthen control over religious beliefs, this was considered to be pursuing the understandable aim of limiting the influence of radical Islam, including the IMU. He concluded that the applicant was not eligible for refugee status and that his application had been motivated by his intention to escape criminal liability in Tajikistan. He noted at the same time that the existence of a well-founded fear of becoming a victim of torture or ill-treatment might be a ground for granting the applicant temporary asylum in Russia under section 12 of the Refugees Act.", "28. On 1 October 2010 the applicant appealed against the FMS\u2019s decision to the Basmanniy District Court of Moscow. He argued that the FMS had not made a thorough and adequate analysis of the situation in Tajikistan and taken due account of the information provided by various international sources in that connection. He further submitted that the FMS had presumed him guilty of the offences that had been imputed to him by the Tajik authorities and had in effect upheld the version of the facts as presented by the Tajikistan Prosecutor\u2019s Office.", "29. On 10 November 2010 the Basmanniy District Court upheld the FMS\u2019s decision of 26 August 2010. It referred to the arguments contained in that decision, finding them convincing and considering that the applicant had failed to provide evidence to the contrary. On 6 December 2010 the court\u2019s decision was upheld on appeal by the Moscow City Court.", "30. On 24 May 2011 the applicant applied to the FMS for temporary asylum in Russia. On 2 June 2011 the UNHCR Office in Russia informed the applicant\u2019s representative that he met the criteria established by its statute and was eligible for international protection under its mandate.", "31. On 6 September 2011 the Moscow City branch of the FMS granted the applicant temporary asylum in Russia and issued a certificate to that effect. The certificate was recorded under reference \u0412\u0423 \u2116 0004219 and delivered to the applicant on 8 September 2011 in his lawyer\u2019s presence.", "32. Following the applicant\u2019s apprehension in Moscow (see paragraph 17 above), on 23 November 2009 the Meshchanskiy District Court of Moscow ordered his detention pending extradition.", "33. On 15 January 2010 the same court extended the applicant\u2019s detention until 21 May 2010. The applicant lodged an appeal against that decision on 1 February 2010. It was dismissed by the City Court on 22 March 2010.", "34. On 17 May 2010 the Meshchanskiy District Court further extended the applicant\u2019s detention until 21 November 2010. The applicant appealed against that decision on 19 May 2010. The City Court dismissed the appeal on 12 July 2010.", "35. On 19 November 2010 the City Court further extended the applicant\u2019s detention until 21 May 2011. On 22 November 2010 the applicant lodged an appeal against that decision, which was dismissed by the Supreme Court of Russia on 21 December 2010.", "36. On 20 May 2011 the Meshchanskiy District Prosecutor ordered the applicant\u2019s release under a personal guarantee provided by his lawyer in accordance with Article 103 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.", "37. According to the applicant\u2019s written testimony and the complementary information collected by his representatives from witnesses and other available sources, his abduction and transfer to Tajikistan took place as follows.", "38. At around 9 or 10 p.m. on 31 October 2011 the applicant and a friend were driving in the south-west district of Moscow when their car was blocked by a mini-van in Michurinskiy avenue. According to the details provided by the applicant\u2019s lawyer to the police and investigative authorities, the incident took place between 11.30 and 11.45 p.m. at 15, Vernadskiy avenue in Moscow. The applicant and his friend got out of the car and tried to escape. They were followed by three or four unidentified men who fired two shots. The applicant\u2019s friend managed to escape, while the applicant was stopped, beaten up with a truncheon and forced into the minivan by the same men, who did not identify themselves.", "39. The applicant was kept in the mini-van for a night and a day. The individuals who had apprehended him subjected him to torture and illtreatment. They beat him up, put a gun to his head and threatened to kill him unless he agreed to return to his home country. The applicant showed them the temporary asylum certificate delivered by the FMS, but they just laughed at him in response. The person who put questions to the applicant was of Tajik origin.", "40. In the evening of the following day the applicant was taken by his kidnappers directly to the airfield of Moscow\u2019s Domodedovo airport, without going through the usual border and customs formalities and security checks. The applicant was handed over to a Tajik patrol, who forced him into a nearby aircraft without presenting a ticket or any travel documents.", "41. At around 4 a.m. the next day, the aircraft arrived at the airport of Khujand in Tajikistan, where the applicant was handed over to the Tajik authorities. His requests for a lawyer were refused. According to the written testimony of the applicant\u2019s father, the applicant was detained and questioned for an unspecified period of time at Khujand police station. The applicant\u2019s father testified in writing that police officers, one of whom was identified as S. M., had severely ill-treated the applicant in order to make him confess to crimes he had never committed and state that he had come back to Tajikistan voluntarily. He further testified that on 20 December 2012 the investigator, R.R., had refused to allow him to meet with his son in detention, referring to the father\u2019s failure to help the authorities apprehend the applicant and bring him back to the country.", "42. The Government\u2019s submissions in respect of the applicant\u2019s account of the facts were limited to the following.", "43. Following enquiries from the Court, letters received from the Government dated 18 November 2011 and 29 February 2012 contained no information about the applicant\u2019s whereabouts or his crossing of the State border. The Government further submitted that the applicant\u2019s rights and freedoms had not been restricted in any way after his release on 20 May 2011, that the law had not obliged the authorities to ensure any surveillance over the applicant, that his extradition or expulsion had been suspended pursuant to the interim measures ordered by the Court and that he had not, therefore, been handed over to Tajikistan through the extradition procedure.", "44. On 5 April 2012 the Government retransmitted the official information provided on 26 March 2012 by the Prosecutor General of Tajikistan to his Russian counterpart, according to which the applicant had \u201cvoluntarily surrendered\u201d on 3 November 2011 to the Sogdiyskiy Regional Department for the Fight against Organised Crime (\u0420\u041e\u0411\u041e\u041f) and had been detained in temporary detention facility no. 2 (\u0421\u0418\u0417\u041e \u21162) of Khujand.", "45. According to the latest information received from the Government on 25 February 2013, the inquiry into the applicant\u2019s abduction and transfer was still pending.", "46. Once informed of the applicant\u2019s abduction on the evening of 31 October 2011, his representatives immediately contacted the competent Russian authorities, asking them to take urgent measures to prevent the applicant\u2019s forcible removal from Russian territory.", "47. Between 3 and 5 a.m. on 1 November, Ms E. Ryabinina faxed four formal requests to that effect to the head of the Moscow City Police Department, the Director of the FMS, the Prosecutor General and the Representative of the Russian Federation at the Court, respectively. She also solicited the assistance of the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Russian Federation.", "48. In her letter to the head of the Moscow City Police Department, the applicant\u2019s representative stated the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s abduction. She also reminded him of the applicant\u2019s legal status as a person to whom temporary asylum had been granted by the FMS and interim measures had been applied by the Court to prevent his extradition. The letter concluded as follows:", "\u201cIn view of [those circumstances] there are weighty reasons to fear that an abduction attempt has been made in respect of [the applicant] with a view to his subsequent illegal transfer from Russia to Tajikistan, whose authorities have requested his extradition for criminal prosecution.", "The situation is aggravated by the fact that the applicant\u2019s brother [Sh. T.] disappeared on 8 September in Moscow and, according to the information provided by his wife, was remanded in custody on 13 September in Khujand, the Republic of Tajikistan, where he is still being detained. Some time earlier, on 23 August of this year, two other asylum seekers who had been protected against forcible transfer by [the interim measures decided by] the European Court, disappeared in Moscow: a Tajik national, S.K., and an Uzbek national, M. A. They were both transferred to Tajikistan and remanded in custody. Any claim that they left voluntarily must be excluded as they did not have any documents permitting them to cross the State border of the Russian Federation: M. A.\u2019s national passport was being held by the Moscow branch of the FMS, while S.K. had lost his passport several years previously. ...\u201d", "49. On the same day, the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Russian Federation also sent a letter to the head of the Moscow City Police Department, which read as follows:", "\u201c... There are well-founded reasons to fear that an attempt might be made illegally to transfer [the applicant] to Tajikistan, where his life is threatened.", "Today, 1 November 2011, [the applicant\u2019s representative] asked you to take urgent measures in order to prevent [the applicant\u2019s] forcible transfer from the territory of the Russian Federation, and above all, through the airports of Moscow.", "I ask you to consider the [above] request as soon as possible and to take all possible measures with a view to finding [the applicant] and preventing his forcible transfer from the territory of the Russian Federation.", "I ask you to inform me of the results following your consideration of the request.\u201d", "50. There is no information about any protective measure taken by the authorities concerned in response to any of those requests.", "51. On 7 November 2011 the Office of the Representative of the Russian Federation at the Court replied to the applicant\u2019s representative that pursuant to the interim measures taken by the Court, the Russian authorities were abstaining from his extradition and that the relevant instruction had been sent to the Federal Service for the Execution of Sentences (\u0424\u0421\u0418\u041d), the Prosecutor General and the Ministry of the Interior.", "52. Following the applicant\u2019s complaint about his abduction in the present case and similar events in certain other cases, on 25 January 2012 the Registrar of the Court sent a letter to the Representative of the Russian Federation at the Court. The letter read as follows:", "\u201cThe President of the Court, Sir Nicolas Bratza, has instructed me to express on his behalf his profound concern at the applicant\u2019s disappearance in Russia and his subsequent transfer to Tajikistan notwithstanding the interim measures indicated under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.", "The President has noted that since the Court\u2019s judgment in the Iskandarov case (no. 17185/05, 23 September 2010) where it held the Russian Federation responsible for a violation of Article 3 on account of the applicant\u2019s unexplained abduction and transfer to Tajikistan by unidentified persons, the Court has been confronted with repeated incidents of that kind in four other cases, including the above-mentioned case (the other three cases are: Abdulkhakov v. Russia, no. 14743/11; S.K. v. Russia, no. 58221/10; and Zokhidov v. Russia, no. 67286/10). The explanations so far provided by the Government do not clarify how applicants could against their will be moved across the Russian State border notwithstanding the Government\u2019s official assurances that no extradition would be effected pending examination of their cases by the Court.", "The President is deeply disturbed at those developments. He is particularly concerned about their implications for the authority of the Court and possible continuation of such unacceptable incidents in cases of other applicants to whom the interim measures still apply on account of the imminent risk of violation of their rights under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention in the countries of destination. As an indication of the seriousness with which he views this turn of events, the President has asked that the Chairman of the Committee of Ministers, the President of the Parliamentary Assembly and the Secretary General of the Council of Europe be informed immediately.", "The President also notes that the Court\u2019s Chamber has requested additional observations from the Government to address this worrying and unprecedented situation and expects the Russian competent authorities to provide the Court with exhaustive information about the follow-up given to the incidents in the Russian Federation. In the meantime, your authorities\u2019 attention is drawn to the fact that interim measures continue to apply under Rule 39 in twenty-five other Russian cases concerning extradition or expulsion. Those cases are listed in appendix to the present letter.\u201d", "53. On 5 March 2012 the Representative of the Russian Federation at the Court informed the Registrar in response that appropriate information would be submitted \u201cupon receiving the necessary data from the relevant authorities\u201d.", "54. On 30 November and 2 December 2011 the Ministry of the Interior informed the applicant\u2019s representative that her complaint about the applicant\u2019s abduction had been sent to the Moscow South-West Police Department (\u0423\u0412\u0414 \u043f\u043e \u042e\u0433\u043e-\u0417\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0410\u041e \u0413\u0423 \u041c\u0412\u0414 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0433. \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0435) and then to the Gagarinskiy Inter-District Investigation Division of the South-West Administrative Circuit of Moscow (\u0413\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041c\u0421\u041e \u0421\u0423 \u043f\u043e \u042e\u0417\u0410\u041e \u0413\u0421\u0423 \u0421\u041a \u0420\u0424). On 30 December 2011 the latter decided to transmit the file to the Nikulinskiy Inter-District Investigation Division of the South-West Administrative Circuit of Moscow (\u041d\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041c\u0421\u041e \u0421\u0423 \u043f\u043e \u042e\u0417\u0410\u041e \u0413\u0421\u0423 \u0421\u041a \u0420\u0424 \u043f\u043e \u0433. \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0435 \u2013 hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Nikulinskiy Investigation Division\u201d).", "55. Under Article 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the senior investigator of the Nikulinskiy Investigation Division, P.K., conducted a pre-investigation inquiry (\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u2013 \u201cthe inquiry\u201d).", "56. On 21 March 2012 P. K. refused to open a criminal investigation in respect of the applicant\u2019s alleged abduction on the grounds of absence of corpus delicti. After a brief recapitulation of the facts, as presented by the applicant\u2019s representative, the senior investigator concluded as follows:", "\u201c... having analysed the materials of the inquiry, the investigating authority finds at present no evidence of crime under Articles 126 and 127 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, because it has not been objectively established whether the applicant remains on the territory of the Russian Federation or has crossed the border of the Russian Federation. Information has also been received in the course of the inquiry that no shootings or abductions of persons have been reported on the territory where [the applicant] was allegedly abducted. The investigating authority does not exclude the possibility that following [the applicant\u2019s] release from detention he might have staged his abduction with a view to escaping criminal liability for crimes he had committed on the territory of the Republic of Tajikistan.\u201d", "57. On the same day the head of the Nikulinskiy Investigation Division, S.K., quashed the above decision and sent the case back to the same senior investigator for a further inquiry. His decision was reasoned as follows:", "\u201cThe investigator\u2019s refusal to institute criminal proceedings is unfounded and must be quashed. In the course of a further inquiry it is necessary to obtain replies to all requests for information that were sent on the matter and to proceed to an additional interview of [the applicant\u2019s representative].\u201d", "58. On 27 March 2012 the head of the First Division for Procedural Supervision of the Moscow Directorate General of Investigation (\u0413\u0421\u0423 \u0421\u041a \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0433. \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0435) also requested a further inquiry into the matter. Furthermore, on 30 March 2012, the deputy to the Nikulinskiy Inter-District Prosecutor (\u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0440\u0430) asked the investigator to ascertain whether the Russian authorities had been involved in the applicant\u2019s alleged abduction.", "59. On 20 April 2012 the senior investigator, P.K., again refused to open a criminal investigation by a new decision, which repeated word for word his earlier decision of 21 March 2012 (see paragraph 56 above).", "60. On 23 April 2012 the deputy head of the Nikulinskiy Investigation Division, A.N., quashed that decision, also repeating word for word the previous decision by the head of the Nikulinskiy Investigation Division of 21 March 2012, which had quashed P. K.\u2019s first decision of the same date (see paragraph 57 above).", "61. On 23 May 2012 the senior investigator, P.K., yet again refused to open a criminal investigation in respect of the applicant\u2019s abduction. The text of that decision was not submitted to the Court.", "62. On 9 June 2012 the deputy head of the Nikulinskiy Investigation Division, A.N., again quashed that decision and demanded that the following procedural steps be taken:", "\u201cIn the course of a further inquiry a second request must be sent to the law-enforcement bodies of the Republic of Tajikistan in order to elucidate the following questions: has [the applicant] crossed the border of Tajikistan; is [the applicant] being detained in a pre-trial detention facility; and have criminal proceedings been brought against [the applicant]?", "A separate set of proceedings needs to be instituted on the basis of the materials concerning the possible unlawful crossing of the Russian border by the applicant ... and the materials sent to the FSB with a view to carrying out an inquiry under Article 151 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.", "... [the applicant\u2019s representative] needs to be questioned on the following points: is she still a representative of [the applicant] and can she clarify anything about [his] crossing of the border? A number of other verification measures need to be taken with a view to adopting a lawful and well-founded decision.\u201d", "63. On 9 July 2012 an investigator of the Nikulinskiy Investigation Division, A.Z., refused to bring criminal proceedings in respect of the applicant\u2019s abduction. After a brief statement of facts, the decision read as follows:", "\u201cAccording to information received from the Border Control Department of the Federal Security Service of Russia (\u201cthe FSB\u201d), the law of the Russian Federation does not provide for the names of persons crossing the State border of the Russian Federation to be recorded. In accordance with section 30(15) of the State Border of the Russian Federation Act, only the number of persons crossing the border is monitored.", "It is therefore impossible to confirm or refute the information about the crossing of the State border by [the applicant].", "Following a request for information about [the applicant], a national of the Republic of Tajikistan, the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office of the Republic of Tajikistan answered that the aforementioned request could not be satisfied as it had been made in breach of the Convention of 22 January 1993 for legal assistance and legal relations in civil family and criminal cases.", "The police authorities in charge of the relevant territory have not received any information during the relevant period about unlawful acts involving either the use of a weapon or the abduction of persons in the circumstances indicated in the application.", "The Moscow City and Regional branch of the FSB has in its possession material relating to verifications of the possible unlawful crossing of the border of the Russian Federation by [the applicant].", "Given that [the applicant] is subject to an international search warrant for the commission of crimes under Articles 186 \u00a7 2 and 187 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code [of Tajikistan], he might have staged his abduction with a view to escaping criminal liability for crimes he had committed on the territory of the Republic of Tajikistan.", "Thus, the preliminary inquiry has established no objective data indicative of [the applicant\u2019s] abduction.\u201d", "The investigator sent the above decision to the applicant\u2019s representatives on 16 August 2012.", "64. On 25 February 2013 the Government informed the Court that similar inquiries had continued and were still pending. No further decisions by the investigation authorities or documents were provided to the Court. According to the Government\u2019s information, the inquiry found that the applicant had illegally crossed the Russian State border, surrendered to the Tajik authorities and had been placed in detention. The investigator\u2019s decision of 9 July 2012 refusing to open a criminal investigation was again quashed by his superior on an unspecified date. According to the Government, the latest decision refusing to open a criminal investigation had been issued on 29 November 2012 by the head of the Nikulinskiy Investigation Division but had yet again been quashed. As a result, the file had been sent back to the investigators for an additional inquiry.", "65. The Government also specified that the FSB had been asked to check the information about the applicant\u2019s illegal crossing of the State border. Another request had been sent to Tajik authorities to identify the applicant\u2019s whereabouts in Tajikistan. However, as of 23 January no responses had been received to either request.", "66. The applicant\u2019s representatives informed the Court that on 30 November 2011 the Sogdiyskiy Regional Court of Tajikistan had started its examination of a criminal case against thirty-four individuals, including the applicant. The applicant had been charged with various crimes under Articles 185 \u00a7 1, 186 \u00a7 1, 187 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, 189 \u00a7 3 (a), 244 \u00a7 4 (c), 306 and 307 \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code of Tajikistan.", "67. Public hearings were held by the court as from 29 January 2012. Lawyer R.T., who took part in the trial, provided the applicant\u2019s representatives with a written testimony showing that the applicant had not pleaded guilty at the trial. According to R. T., the applicant submitted that he had been abducted in Moscow, forcibly transferred to Tajikistan and tortured in order to make him confess to the crimes.", "68. In March and April 2012 eleven relatives of the co-accused repeatedly asked the Sogdiyskiy Regional Prosecutor, Sh.K., and the President of the Sogdiyskiy Regional Court, N.M., to order a forensic medical examination of the thirty-four co-accused in order to verify their allegations that they had been tortured by the authorities during the criminal proceedings. Their written request referred to the relevant provisions of the Constitution and the Code of Criminal Procedure of Tajikistan, which prohibit the use of torture and exclude any evidence obtained under duress. The applicant\u2019s mother made a similar request in respect of the applicant. There is no information regarding the authorities\u2019 response to those requests.", "69. On 19 April 2012 the Sogdiyskiy Regional Court found the applicant guilty and sentenced him to twenty-six years\u2019 imprisonment.

Chapter 54 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (\u201cthe CCrP\u201d) of 2002 governs the procedure to be followed in the event of extradition.", "71. An extradition decision made by the Prosecutor General may be challenged before a court (Article 463 \u00a7 1). In that event, the extradition order should not be enforced until a final judgment has been delivered (Article 462 \u00a7 6).", "72. A court must review the lawfulness and validity of a decision to extradite within a month of receipt of a request for review. The decision should be taken in open court by a panel of three judges in the presence of a prosecutor, the person whose extradition is sought and the latter\u2019s legal counsel (Article 463 \u00a7 4).", "73. Issues of guilt or innocence are not within the scope of judicial review, which is limited to an assessment of whether the extradition order was made in accordance with the procedure set out in applicable international and domestic law (Article 463 \u00a7 6).", "74. Article 464 \u00a7 1 lists the conditions under which extradition cannot be authorised. Thus, the extradition of the following should be refused: a Russian citizen (Article 464 \u00a7 1 (1)) or a person who has been granted asylum in Russia (Article 464 \u00a7 1 (2)); a person in respect of whom a conviction has become effective or criminal proceedings have been terminated in Russia in connection with the same act for which he or she has been prosecuted in the requesting State (Article 464 \u00a7 1 (3)); a person in respect of whom criminal proceedings cannot be launched or a conviction cannot become effective in view of the expiry of the statutory time-limit or for other valid grounds in Russian law (Article 464 \u00a7 1 (4)); or a person in respect of whom extradition has been blocked by a Russian court in accordance with the legislation and international treaties of the Russian Federation (Article 464 \u00a7 1 (5)). Lastly, extradition must be refused if the act that serves as the basis for the extradition request does not constitute a criminal offence under the Russian Criminal Code (Article 464 \u00a7 1 (6)).", "75. In the event that a foreign national whose extradition is being sought is being prosecuted or is serving a sentence for another criminal offence in Russia, his extradition may be postponed until the prosecution has been terminated, the penalty has been lifted on any valid ground or the sentence has been served (Article 465 \u00a7 1).", "76. In its ruling no. 11 of 14 June 2012, the Plenum of the Russian Supreme Court indicated, with reference to Article 3 of the Convention, that extradition should be refused if there were serious reasons to believe that the person might be subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment in the requesting country. Extradition could also be refused if exceptional circumstances disclosed that it might entail a danger to the person\u2019s life and health on account of, among other things, his or her age or physical condition. Russian authorities dealing with an extradition case should examine whether there were reasons to believe that the person concerned might be sentenced to the death penalty, subjected to ill-treatment or persecuted because of his or her race, religious beliefs, nationality, ethnic or social origin or political opinions. The courts should assess both the general situation in the requesting country and the personal circumstances of the person whose extradition was being sought. They should take into account the testimony of the person concerned and that of any witnesses, any assurances given by the requesting country, and information about the country provided by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, by competent United Nations institutions and by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.", "77. The Constitution guarantees the right to liberty (Article 22):", "\u201c1. Everyone has the right to liberty and personal integrity.", "2. Arrest, placement in custody and detention are only permitted on the basis of a judicial decision. Prior to a judicial decision, an individual may not be detained for longer than forty-eight hours.\u201d", "78. Article 46 of the Constitution provides, among other things, that everyone should be guaranteed judicial protection of his or her rights and freedoms and stipulates that decisions, actions or inaction of State bodies, local authorities, public associations and officials may be challenged before a court.", "79. When performing actions requested under the Minsk Convention, to which Russia and Tajikistan are parties, an official body applies its country\u2019s domestic laws (Article 8 \u00a7 1).", "80. A request for extradition must be accompanied by a detention order (Article 58 \u00a7 2). Upon receipt of a request for extradition, measures should be taken immediately to find and arrest the person whose extradition is sought, except in cases where that person cannot be extradited (Article 60).", "81. A person whose extradition is sought may be arrested before receipt of a request for his or her extradition. In such cases a special request for arrest containing a reference to the detention order and indicating that a request for extradition will follow must be sent (Article 61 \u00a7 1). A person may also be arrested in the absence of such a request if there are reasons to suspect that he or she has committed, in the territory of the other Contracting Party, an offence for which extradition may be requested. The other Contracting Party must be informed immediately of the arrest (Article 61 \u00a7 2).", "82. A person detained pending extradition pursuant to Article 61 \u00a7 1 of the Minsk Convention must be released if the requesting country fails to submit an official request for extradition with all the requisite supporting documents within forty days of the date of placement in custody (Article 62 \u00a7 1).", "83. Article 1 \u00a7 3 of the CCrP provides that general principles and norms of international law and international treaties of the Russian Federation are a constituent part of its legislation concerning criminal proceedings. Should an international treaty provide for rules other than those established in the CCrP, the former are to be applied.", "84. Chapter 13 of the CCrP (\u201cMeasures of restraint\u201d) governs the use of measures of restraint, or preventive measures (\u043c\u0435\u0440\u044b \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f), while criminal proceedings are pending. Such measures include placement in custody. Custody may be ordered by a court following an application by an investigator or a prosecutor if a person is charged with an offence carrying a sentence of at least two years\u2019 imprisonment, provided that a less restrictive measure of restraint cannot be used (Article 108 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3). The judicial decision to place a person in custody may be appealed against to a higher court within three days. The higher court must decide the appeal within three days of the date on which the appeal is lodged (Article 108 \u00a7 11).", "85. A period of detention pending investigation may not exceed two months (Article 109 \u00a7 1). A judge may extend that period up to six months (Article 109 \u00a7 2). Further extensions of up to twelve months, or in exceptional circumstances, up to eighteen months, may only be granted if the person is charged with serious or particularly serious criminal offences (Article 109 \u00a7 3). No extension beyond eighteen months is permissible and the detainee must be released immediately (Article 109 \u00a7 4).", "86. Chapter 54 (\u201cExtradition of a person for criminal prosecution or execution of a sentence\u201d) regulates extradition procedures. Upon receipt of a request for extradition that is not accompanied by an arrest warrant issued by a foreign court, a prosecutor must decide on the measure of restraint in respect of the person whose extradition is sought. The measure must be applied in accordance with established procedure (Article 466 \u00a7 1). If a request for extradition is accompanied by a detention order issued by a foreign court, a prosecutor may impose house arrest on the individual concerned or place him or her in detention \u201cwithout seeking confirmation of the validity of that order from a Russian court\u201d (Article 466 \u00a7 2).", "87. By decision no. 101-O of 4 April 2006 the Constitutional Court held that the absence of any specific regulation of detention matters in Article 466 \u00a7 1 did not create a gap in the law that was incompatible with the constitutional guarantee against arbitrary detention. Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Minsk Convention provided that, in executing a request for legal assistance, the requested party would apply its domestic law, which in the case of Russia was the procedure laid down in the CCrP. Such procedure comprised, in particular, Article 466 \u00a7 1 of the Code and the norms in its Chapter 13 (\u201cMeasures of restraint\u201d) which, by virtue of their general character and position in Part I of the Code (\u201cGeneral provisions\u201d), applied to all stages and forms of criminal proceedings, including proceedings for the examination of extradition requests. Accordingly, Article 466 \u00a7 1 of the CCrP did not allow the authorities to apply a custodial measure without complying with the procedure established in the CCrP or the timelimits fixed in the Code.", "88. By decision no. 333-O-P of 1 March 2007, the Constitutional Court held that while Articles 61 and 62 of the Minsk Convention did not govern the procedure for detention pending the receipt of an extradition request, the applicable procedures and time-limits were to be established by domestic legal provisions in accordance with Article 8 of the Minsk Convention. It further reiterated its settled case-law to the effect that the scope of the constitutional right to liberty and personal inviolability was the same for foreign nationals and stateless persons as for Russian nationals. A foreign national or stateless person may not be detained in Russia for more than fortyeight hours without a judicial decision. That constitutional requirement served as a guarantee against excessively long detention beyond forty-eight hours, and also against arbitrary detention, in that it required a court to examine whether the arrest was lawful and justified. The Constitutional Court held that Article 466 \u00a7 1 of the CCrP, read in conjunction with the Minsk Convention, could not be construed as permitting the detention of an individual for more than forty-eight hours on the basis of a request for his or her extradition without a decision by a Russian court. A custodial measure could be applied only in accordance with the procedure and within the time-limits established in Chapter 13 of the CCrP.", "89. By decision no. 383-O-O of 19 March 2009 the Constitutional Court upheld the constitutionality of Article 466 \u00a7 2 of the CCrP, stating that this provision \u201cdoes not establish time-limits for custodial detention and does not establish the grounds and procedure for choosing a preventive measure, it merely confirms a prosecutor\u2019s power to execute a decision already delivered by a competent judicial body of a foreign state to detain an accused. Therefore the disputed norm cannot be considered to violate the constitutional rights of [the claimant] ...\u201d", "92. Article 33 of the UN Convention on the Status of Refugees of 1951, which was ratified by Russia on 2 February 1993, provides as follows:", "\u201c1.

The Refugees Act (Law no. 4258-I of 19 February 1993), as in force at the material time, incorporated the definition of the term \u201crefugee\u201d contained in Article 1 of the 1951 Geneva Convention, as amended by the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees. The Act defines a refugee as a person who is not a Russian national and who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, ethnic origin, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country, or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, unwilling to return to it (section 1(1)(1)).", "94. The Act does not apply to anyone believed on reasonable grounds to have committed a crime against peace, a war crime, a crime against humanity, or a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a person seeking refugee status (section 2(1)(1) and (2)).", "95. A person who has applied for refugee status or who has been granted refugee status cannot be returned to a State where his life or freedom would be imperilled on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion (section 10(1)).", "96. If a person satisfies the criteria established in section 1(1)(1), or if he does not satisfy those criteria but cannot be expelled or deported from Russia for humanitarian reasons, he may be granted temporary asylum (section 12(2)). A person who has been granted temporary asylum cannot be returned against his will to the country of his nationality or to the country of his former habitual residence (section 12(4)). The person loses temporary asylum if the underlying circumstances cease to exist or if he is granted a permanent residence permit in Russia or establishes his place of residence outside Russian territory (section 12(5)). The person is deprived of temporary asylum, inter alia, if he is found guilty of a crime committed on Russian territory or is found to have submitted false information or documents that had justified the authorities\u2019 decision to grant him temporary asylum (section 12(6)).", "97. According to the Procedure for Granting Temporary Asylum adopted by Decree no. 274 of 9 April 2001, as in force at the material time, a competent FMS body delivers a certificate for temporary asylum to any person to whom it has been granted (\u00a7 8). The certificate constitutes an identity document in the Russian Federation (\u00a7 9). When a certificate for temporary asylum is delivered to a person, his other identity documents are withheld by the FMS on a temporary basis. Temporary asylum is granted for a period of up to one year, which may be renewed for each consecutive year upon request by the person concerned, provided that the underlying circumstances continue to exist (\u00a7 12). The person to whom temporary asylum is granted enjoys all rights and obligations provided for by the Refugees Act except the right to receive a lump-sum allowance (\u00a7 13).", "98.

He also expressed his concerns at the lack of safeguards against illegal extradition or rendition from and to other countries, as \u201cthere seems to be no meaningful opportunity for judicial review of these measures that are generally conducted by the law enforcement bodies under the direction of the Prosecutor General. The Minsk Convention on Legal Assistance in civil and criminal matters of 1993, other agreements between CIS countries ... offer general language about protection against abuse, but they operate more meaningfully as international cooperation in law enforcement.

During this period of incommunicado detention, the risk of torture or other ill-treatment is particularly high. The new Criminal Procedure Code also introduced remand hearings within 72 hours of a suspect\u2019s arrest.

The Court has also used the instrument of interim measures (Article 39 of the Rules of the Court) in order to prevent irreparable damage. The Assembly commends the Court for finding that such interim measures are binding on states parties. It considers that this instrument may have still wider potential uses for protecting applicants and their lawyers who are exposed to undue pressure. The Court may find it useful in this respect to examine the practice of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which have used interim measures to enjoin the authorities to place applicants under special police protection in order to shield them from criminal acts by certain non-state actors.\u201d", "109. The explanatory memorandum adopted by the Assembly\u2019s Committee of Legal Affairs and Human Rights (Doc. 11183 of 9 February 2007, \u00a7 48) referred in this connection to the practice developed under Article 63 \u00a7 2 of the American Convention on Human Rights, which empowers the Inter-American Court of Human Rights to order positive action by states. For example, in the Aleman-Lacayo case, the InterAmerican Commission of Human Rights asked the Court to adopt a measure requesting that the Government of Nicaragua adopt effective security measures to protect the life and personal integrity of Dr AlemanLacayo, including providing him and his relatives with the \u201cname and telephone number of a person in a position of authority\u201d who would be responsible for providing them with protection. The Court granted the Commission\u2019s request and called upon the Nicaraguan Government to adopt \u201csuch measures as are necessary to protect the life and personal integrity of Dr Aleman-Lacayo\u201d (see Aleman-Lacayo case, Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Order of 2 February 1996).", "110.
