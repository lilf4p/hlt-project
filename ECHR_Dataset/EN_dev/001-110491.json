The applicant was taken to Central Prison from the courtroom.", "11. On 26 January 2006 the Zemgale Regional Court examined the applicant\u2019s appeal and upheld the judgment of the lower court. According to the records of the hearing the applicant said in his statement to the court that he had been beaten up on his way to the prison and that it had happened because of his previous cooperation with the police.", "12. In his appeal on points of law of 16 February 2006 the applicant complained about the severity of the sentence. He also mentioned his cooperation with police, and that as a result he had suffered bodily injuries in prison.", "13. On 23 February 2006 the applicant asked the Prosecutor General to reduce his final sentence. He mentioned, inter alia, that because of his cooperation with the police he had encountered problems in prison, specifically that his nose had been broken and he had also sustained other body injuries. In March 2006 he sent a similar request to the Aizkraukle District Court.", "14. On 7 March 2006 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law.", "15. On 1 September 2006, at the request of the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, the Aizkraukle District Court reduced the applicant\u2019s sentence by one year, owing to the fact that he had helped to disclose a serious criminal offence.", "16.

On 21 March 2006 an officer of the Security Department of the Prison Administration met the applicant. According to the report drawn up by the officer during the meeting the applicant complained about possible threats, in that the people he had testified against were known to some of his fellow inmates. The applicant denied having any problems in Central Prison where he was employed in the canteen.", "23. Further, according to the same report, in a telephone conversation on 22 March 2006 a police officer in charge of G.\u2019s criminal case confirmed that the applicant was cooperating, and acknowledged that the applicant might therefore encounter problems in prison, but he refused to confirm this in writing. With the agreement of the deputy head of the Prison Administration it was decided to transfer the applicant to J\u0113kabpils Prison.

Relying on the above reports, on 3 October 2006 the Prison Administration informed the Ombudsman\u2019s Office that there was no information about the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment.", "29. In response to the request of the Government Agent, on 2 November 2007 the Office of the Prosecutor General stated that they had not received any complaints from the applicant concerning ill-treatment in Central Prison on 6 January 2006 or in any other prison. The letter confirmed that by virtue of section 6 of the Law of Criminal Procedure the Office of the Prosecutor would have decided on the opening of criminal proceedings if it had received a complaint from the applicant of physical or sexual ill-treatment or a refusal by the prison administration to review the complaint.", "30. Aiming to ensure that the applicant attended G.\u2019s trial, on 4 September 2006 the prosecutor in charge asked the Prison Administration to transfer the applicant from J\u0113kabpils Prison to R\u012bga. In her letter the prosecutor noted that G. had been detained in Central Prison and that his criminal case contained compelling information that G. had previously intimidated the applicant.

The prosecutor referred to a report addressed to the Office of the Prosecutor General which confirmed the attempt to intimidate the applicant.", "31. It appears that on two occasions the applicant had been transferred to Mat\u012bsa Prison in R\u012bga in order to attend G.\u2019s trial.", "32.

The report of 13 March 2008 to the Latvian Government on the visit to Latvia carried out by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment (\u201cthe CPT\u201d) from 5 to 12 May 2004 notes the following:", "\u201c46. During the 2004 visit, the delegation examined several internal investigation files on inquiries conducted by the Security Departments into serious incidents of inter-prisoner violence at Daugavpils Prison and R\u012bga Central Prison. The delegation also had consultations with the competent prosecutor in R\u012bga.", "It came to light that, in several cases, no criminal investigations had been initiated, despite the fact that medical evidence consistent with allegations of inter-prisoner violence was available. In this connection, the delegation was informed that, as a rule, instances of inter-prisoner violence were only reported to the prosecutor if the victim made explicit allegations to this effect in his written statement to the Security Department. In this connection it appeared to be immaterial whether or not the prisoner concerned had previously made such allegations to the doctor and the allegations had been recorded in his medical file.", "It is also of concern that, even when the prosecutor had become aware of serious cases of inter-prisoner violence, he had not always initiated investigation not taken a formal reasoned decision on the matter. In fact, the Security Department\u2019s investigation file was simply returned to the prison, without any record being kept that the prosecutor had examined the case.", "47. The CPT recommends that the existing procedures be reviewed in order to ensure that whenever injuries are recorded by a doctor which are consistent with allegations of inter-prisoner violence, the matter is immediately brought to the attention of the relevant prosecutor and a preliminary investigation is initiated by him.", "More generally, the CPT calls upon the Latvian authorities to develop strategies with a view to addressing the problem of inter-prisoner violence in the establishments visited (and, as appropriate, in other prisons in Latvia).", "50. In the light of the above, the CPT calls upon the Latvian authorities to take immediate steps to review throughout the prison system the role played by the Security Departments, in the light of the remarks made above ... .", "In particular, steps should be taken to ensure that:", "- criminal investigations into instances of ill-treatment by staff as well as inter-prisoner violence are no longer carried out by the Security Departments. Such investigations should be conducted by a body which is independent of the establishment concerned, and preferably of the prison system as a whole.", "- prisoners are allocated/transferred to cells under the responsibility of the Director of the establishment concerned\u201d.", "...", "66. At R\u012bga Central Prison, neither the complement of qualified nursing staff nor the psychiatric/psychological services had been strengthened, despite the specific recommendations made after the 1999 visit and reiterated after the 2002 visit. ....", "67. In the light of the above, the CPT reiterates its recommendation that steps be taken, as a matter of priority, to ensure that:", "- the complement of qualified nursing staff at Daugavpils Prison and R\u012bga Central Prison is increased;", "...", "- every newly-arrived prisoner is properly interviewed and physically examined by a medical doctor (or a fully qualified nurse reporting to a doctor) as soon as possible after his admission to Daugavpils Prison; save for exceptional circumstances, the interview/examination should be carried out on the day of admission;", "...", "68. In both establishments (including the Prison Hospital), the examination of medical files revealed that the injuries observed (upon admission or after violent incidents within the prison) were frequently not recorded in detail, and that no additional information was given as to the causes of the injuries sustained.", "...", "The CPT must therefore reiterate its recommendation that steps be taken at Daugavpils Prison and R\u012bga Central Prison (as well as in other prison establishments in Latvia) to ensure that the record drawn up after a medical examination of a prisoner, on arrival or after a violent incident within the prison, contains:", "(i) a full account of statements made by the prisoner concerned which are relevant to the medical examination, including any allegations of ill-treatment made by him;", "(ii) a full account of the objective medical findings based on a thorough examination;", "(iii) the doctor\u2019s conclusions in the light of (i) and (ii).

In response to the above report the Latvian Government referred to an instruction of 29 March 2004 adopted by the Prison Administration. According to the instruction, in case there has been an incident of ill-treatment in a prison establishment, the prison doctor has to examine the detainee and to inform the administration of the prison. The latter has to inform the Prosecutor\u2019s office and carry out an investigation according to the procedure established by law.", "49.

As was the case during all previous visits, the delegation observed a number of shortcomings in the manner in which injuries were recorded at R\u012bga Central Prison. First of all, several newly-arrived prisoners met by the delegation displayed visible injuries on various parts of the body (including on the face), but no injuries at all were recorded in the medical file, despite the fact that these injuries had apparently been sustained prior to admission. Further, although objective medical findings relating to injuries were recorded in other cases, they were frequently not accompanied by an account of the statements made by the persons concerned which are relevant to the medical examination. In particular, medical records frequently failed to note the prisoner\u2019s account of the origin of these injuries (or to note if the person concerned had refused to reply to the relevant questions asked by the doctor) as well as the doctor\u2019s conclusions in the light of the objective findings and the prisoner\u2019s account. Further, at J\u0113kabpils Prison, the delegation found instances where visible injuries had not been recorded at all in the prisoners\u2019 medical files (including after violent incidents in the prison).", "The CPT must recommend once again that steps be taken at R\u012bga Central Prison and J\u0113kabpils Prison, as well as in all other prisons in Latvia, to ensure that the record drawn up after a medical examination of a prisoner, on arrival or after a violent incident within the prison, contains:", "(i) a full account of statements made by the prisoner concerned which are relevant to the medical examination, including any allegations of ill-treatment made by him;", "(ii) a full account of objective medical findings based on a thorough examination;", "(iii) the doctor\u2019s conclusions in the light of (i) and (ii).
