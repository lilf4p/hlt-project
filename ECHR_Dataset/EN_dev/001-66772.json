If the authority has not complied with the decision, the court may, under section 31 of the 1995 Act, impose a fine on it and may itself give a ruling on the right or obligation in question.", "Pursuant to section 31 of the Law, a party to the proceedings who sustains damage as a result of a failure of the administrative body to act in compliance with the judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court given under Article 17 of the Act, is entitled to claim compensation from the administrative authority concerned, according to principles of civil liability as set out in the Civil Code. Such a claim should be first lodged with that authority. A decision on the compensation claim should be taken by that administrative authority within three months.", "If the authority concerned fails to give a ruling in this respect within this timelimit, or if the party is not satisfied with the compensation granted, a compensation claim against the administrative body can be lodged with a civil court.", "Section 34 of the 1995 Act sets out the requirement of the exhaustion of available remedies before lodging a complaint with the Supreme Administrative Court.
