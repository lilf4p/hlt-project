The applicant, Mr Eduard Miljak, is a Croatian national who was born in 1978 and is currently serving a prison term in Lipovica Prison. He is represented before the Court by Mr S. Simi\u0107, a lawyer practising in Pula. The Croatian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) are represented by their Agent, Ms \u0160. Sta\u017enik.", "2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "3. On 8 April 1998 the applicant had a motor accident and suffered injuries to his spine. Following the accident, the applicant underwent several operations as well as other medical treatment and rehabilitation. He was diagnosed with vertebral fracture, tetraplegia and spastic paraplegia and is incontinent. He is classified as one hundred percent disabled.", "4. On 4 September 2008 the applicant was detained in Pula Prison in connection with a criminal investigation opened in respect of him. On 5 September 2008 the applicant was transferred to Zagreb Prison Hospital (Bolnica za osobe li\u0161ene slobode - \u201cthe ZPH\u201d). He was accommodated in a room measuring 18 square metres together with five other patients. With no assistance from staff, he could not wash or relieve himself unless his roommates helped him to do so. Owing to his disability, the applicant was unable to leave his bed because the space between the beds was not wide enough for the wheelchair. He alleges that the bathroom and toilet were in a poor state of repair and always dirty and smelly. During his stay in the ZPH the applicant did not leave the surgical ward.", "5. The medical documentation submitted confirms that the applicant is severely disabled and reliant on a wheelchair to move around. During his stay in the ZPH the applicant was diagnosed with hepatitis C.", "6. On 17 February 2009 the Pula County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Puli) found the applicant guilty of trafficking in illegal substances and sentenced him to four years\u2019 imprisonment.", "7. On 18 November 2009 the applicant petitioned a sentence-execution judge of the Pula County Court and complained about the conditions in which he had been kept. He sought immediate transfer to an institution where he could be provided with adequate medical care. It appears that he received no reply.", "8. On 7 December 2009 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint about the conditions of his detention in the ZPH.", "9. In a medical certificate of 15 December 2009 the head of the surgical ward of the ZPH stated that the ZPH had no adequate accommodation for the applicant and that they were not in a position to ensure that he could go outside.", "10. On 5 March 2010 the applicant was transferred to Lipovica Prison.", "11. According to the applicant the conditions of his detention in that prison, as regards the size of his cell and the time he spends outdoors, have ameliorated. However, he had to buy a wheelchair adapted for his needs at his own expense. He also needs an electric bed, which would be more suitable for his condition. The mattress he sleeps on is also inadequate. He does not have a cupboard or a table next to his bed. The medical personnel leave the prison premises every day at 3 p.m. and after that time he is dependent on the two other inmates who share his cell. Thus, they shower him, change his urinary sheath, transfer him from his bed to his wheelchair and clean him when he accidentally relieves himself in bed. Also, since his arrival at Lipovica Prison he has developed a bed sore on his foot and his cellmates change the bandages on that wound. They also help him change his clothes, cut his nails and shave him. In this respect he depends on their goodwill.", "12. According to the Government the applicant is held in a cell measuring twenty square metres, together with two other inmates who voluntarily help him in maintaining his personal hygiene and his physiological needs. The cell has central heating and is never locked. The applicant has the opportunity to spend time outdoors anytime between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. He uses a toilet and shower adapted for wheelchair users and is under the constant supervision of a doctor, a nurse and a paramedic. He has his meals in the prison canteen or sometimes in his cell. In his free time he watches television on his own television set in his cell. He also often goes to a bowling alley adapted for people with disabilities. All the entrance areas at the prison are adapted for wheelchair users. The applicant has the right to go to a nearby town for four hours a month.", "13. On 29 May 2009 the applicant gave oral evidence before the Constitutional Court in the proceedings concerning the conditions in the ZPH (see paragraph 8 above). He repeated his complaints as regards the conditions and lack of adequate medical care in the ZPH. He made no complaints as regards his placement in Lipovica Prison. The relevant part of the Constitutional Court decision referring to the applicant\u2019s statement as regards Lipovica Prison reads:", "\u201cThe applicant says that he was transferred to Lipovica Prison on 5 March 2010 and speaks well of the conditions in that institution.\u201d", "14. On 3 November 2010 the Constitutional Court accepted the applicant\u2019s complaint and found a violation of his constitutional right to humane treatment and respect for his dignity guaranteed under Article 25 of the Constitution. It found that the ZPH had no facilities for persons in the applicant\u2019s condition and also ordered the Croatian Government to secure the \u201cunhindered movement of prisoners with special needs\u201d in the ZPH within three years. It did not make a decision as to where the applicant should be detained in the future.", "15. On an unspecified date the applicant filed a claim for damages with the Pula State Attorney\u2019s Office, asking that a settlement be reached in the matter. The State authorities offered to pay him 70,000 Croatian kuna (HRK) in compensation, which he refused. On 6 July 2011 he brought a civil action against the State in the Pula Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Puli) seeking compensation in the amount of HRK 170,000.
