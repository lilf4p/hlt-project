TURKEY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Preliminary objection joined to merits and rejected (non-exhaustion of domestic remedies);No violation of Art. 2 in respect of killing of applicant's relatives;Violation of Art. 2 on account of lack of effective investigation;No violation of Art. 3;Not necessary to examine Art. 6-1;Violation of Art. 13;No violation of Art. 8;No violation of Art. 14", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["9. The applicant, Ms \u015eemsi \u00d6nen, is a Turkish citizen, born in 1968. At the relevant time, she lived in the village Karata\u015f near Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 (Mardin) in south-east Turkey. The application was brought by the applicant on behalf of her deceased parents and brother, on her own behalf and on behalf of her ten suriving siblings, namely Mekiye, Ishan, Ercan, Mehmet Nuri, Medine, Sultan, Sevgi, Iskender, Melek and Hamdullah. It concerns the killing of their parents and brother Orhan, allegedly by armed members of the Balp\u0131nar village guards, and the investigation thereof.", "10. Since the 1980s, a violent conflict has been conducted in the south-eastern region of Turkey between the security forces and sections of the Kurdish population in favour of Kurdish autonomy, in particular members of the PKK (Kurdish Workers' Party). According to the Government, one of the main terrorist activities of the PKK was the killing of people who have acted contrary to the cause of this organisation or who have misused property of the PKK. At the time of the events in issue, ten of the eleven provinces of south-east Turkey had been under emergency rule since 1987.", "11. The facts of the case, in particular the circumstances of the killings and the efforts of the authorities to investigate the killings, are disputed.", "12. As the village of Karata\u015f, where the applicant and her family lived at the time of the events in issue, had refused the village guard system, tension had arisen between Karata\u015f and its neighbouring village Balp\u0131nar. This refusal had also resulted in pressure being applied to the villagers by the gendarmes.", "13. On or about 15 November 1992, four Balp\u0131nar village guards were killed in a clash with the PKK. On the same day, shortly after the clash, gendarmes and village guards attacked the village of Karata\u015f. This attack lasted several hours. The following day, the Muhtar of Karata\u015f complained to the Governor that his village was being subjected to pressure and violence from the gendarmes and village guards. No investigation of the attack took place.", "14. Some weeks before 16 March 1993 the house of the Muhtar and the applicant's family house were both strafed by several rounds of bullets fired by Balp\u0131nar village guards. The Muhtar again complained to the Governor about the pressure exerted on his village by the Balp\u0131nar village guards and requested that steps be taken to put an end to it.", "15. In the evening of 16 March 1993 the applicant's older brother, Orhan \u00d6nen, and her parents, Ibrahim and Mome \u00d6nen, were killed and the applicant suffered a wound to her foot as a result of a planned action by members of the Balp\u0131nar village guards to kill Orhan \u00d6nen. Before he was shot and killed, the applicant's father was able to pull the scarf from the head of one of the intruders and shouted that he recognised the gunmen as Ali Erta\u015f, head of the Balp\u0131nar village guards, and his nephew Orhan Erta\u015f, a former Balp\u0131nar village guard. The applicant's mother, who was seriously injured by a bullet, died on her way to hospital.", "16. The Commander of the local Fosfat gendarme station, who had possibly been informed beforehand of the plan by the Balp\u0131nar village guards to kill Orhan \u00d6nen, seriously delayed the applicant's mother's access to medical treatment by refusing to provide a car to replace the defective minibus which was to transport her to a hospital and by unduly delaying the departure of this minibus for Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131.", "17. The subsequent investigation of these killings was not only ineffective and inadequate in professional terms, but was in fact designed to cover up the involvement of the Balp\u0131nar village guards and to prevent the conviction of Ali and Orhan Erta\u015f. From the very beginning of the investigation, and throughout the entire subsequent proceedings, the authorities blamed the PKK for the killings and failed to keep the applicant informed of any steps taken in the investigation.", "18. On 8 October 1992 PKK forces attacked Balp\u0131nar village guards on the slopes of the K\u0131rm\u0131z\u0131tepe hill close to the village of Balp\u0131nar. This clash lasted about twenty minutes. There were no casualties. To date, the perpetrators of this attack have not been found.", "19. On 15 November 1992 PKK forces ambushed nine Balp\u0131nar village guards on a road near the village of Karata\u015f. In the course of this clash, which lasted about fifteen minutes, four village guards were killed and four others wounded. An investigation into the clash was carried out. The Fosfat gendarme station commander, Salih Kaygusuz, took statements from the five surviving village guards during the course of the investigation. To date, the perpetrators of this attack have not been identified.", "20. On 16 March 1993 at about 20.15 hours an armed PKK attack using rocket missiles and heavy weapons was carried out on a PTT radio link station in Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131-Kaletepe, at a distance of about one kilometre from Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131. The village guards present returned fire. The clash lasted about ten to fifteen minutes. There were no casualties. Shortly after the clash, gendarmes from the Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 Central gendarme station arrived at the scene. The next day, a land mine was found on the road leading to the PTT station. The initial investigation of this attack was carried out by Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 Central gendarme station under the responsibility of the public prosecutor at Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131.", "21. Also in the evening of 16 March 1993 the killing of three Karata\u015f villagers was reported to the public prosecutor in Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131. For reasons of security, the public prosecutor only arrived at the scene of the incident at 08.00 hours the next morning. He conducted an investigation, including attendance at the post mortem examination of the bodies of the victims carried out by a medical doctor.", "22. All necessary steps were taken to investigate the killing of the applicant's parents and brother, including the collection of evidence. After having completed his preliminary investigation, the public prosecutor of Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 issued on 7 July 1993 a decision of lack of jurisdiction and the investigation was referred to the public prosecutor's office at the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court. This referral resulted in the institution of proceedings against Ali and Orhan Erta\u015f before the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court.", "On 6 May 1994, in the context of these proceedings and on the instructions of the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court, further statements were taken before a judge of the Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 Criminal First Instance Court from Ali Erta\u015f, Mahmut Denli and Mecit Kaya. No statements were taken from the applicant and her sister Mekiye, since they no longer resided in Karata\u015f and their new address could not be established.", "23. On 28 December 1994 the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court acquitted Ali and Orhan Erta\u015f for lack of evidence. After this decision the investigation nevertheless continued but the perpetrators of the killing of the applicant's parents and brother have not been found.", "24. The Government submitted that it appeared from information obtained that the PKK had provided the applicant's brother Orhan with a taxi, which he had put to his own private use. He had thus made his family a target of the PKK, a terrorist organisation which was in all likelihood responsible for the killing of the applicant's parents and brother.", "25. On 16 March 1993 an incident report was drawn up by the gendarmes of the Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 District gendarme station stating that at around 21.30 hours that day, a group of terrorists belonging to the outlawed PKK organisation entered the home of Ibrahim \u00d6nen and opened fire. Ibrahim and Orhan \u00d6nen were shot and killed. Mome and \u015eemsi \u00d6nen were injured and Mome \u00d6nen died on the way to hospital. The report also referred to nine empty Kalashnikov cartridges without further specifications.", "On the same date NCO Salih Kaygusuz of the Fosfat Gendarme Station drew a sketch map of the interior of the \u00d6nen family's two-room house. It indicated in one room the location of the bodies of Ibrahim and Mome \u00d6nen, two blood stains between the body of Ibrahim \u00d6nen and the front door and five empty cartridges. In the other room the location of the body of Orhan \u00d6nen and four empty cartridges was indicated. No blood stains were recorded in the room where the body of Orhan \u00d6nen was indicated. The sketch map only recorded what had been found inside the house. It did not contain any information about the immediate surroundings of the house.", "26. According to a post mortem examination report dated 17 March 1993, due to security precautions, the team of experts only arrived on 17 March 1993 at about 08.00 hours in Karata\u015f, acting on a report that three persons had been killed there on 16 March 1993 at 20.00 hours. This team consisted of the public prosecutor of Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 Yekta \u00c7obano\u011flu, the medical doctor Sedat \u0130\u015f\u00e7i of the Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 Health Centre, a clerk, an autopsy assistant and a driver. The report further indicated that Mome had died on the way to hospital and that her body had been brought back to the village. The bodies of Ibrahim, Mome and Orhan \u00d6nen had been identified by a relative, Mehmet Hadi Ara\u00e7. The examination report contained information on bullet - entries and exits and concluded that the respective causes of death were haemorrhaging of the lungs, loss of blood and cessation of vital functions. Given the obvious nature of the cause of death, it was decided that there was no need to conduct an autopsy.", "27. On 1 and 5 April 1993 statements were taken from the applicant and her sister Mekiye by the Fosfat gendarme station commander, Salih Kaygusuz, and by gendarme officer Cengiz Kesler of the Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 district gendarme station.", "On 4 April 1993 Salih Kaygusuz took statements from the Balp\u0131nar village guards Ali Erta\u015f, son of Kas\u0131m and born in 1953, and Mecit Kaya, son of Mehmet and born in 1960, in relation to the events of 16 March 1993. Ali Erta\u015f stated that he was the Head of the Balp\u0131nar village guards and that on 16 March 1993 he had been on patrol duty on the K\u0131rm\u0131z\u0131tepe hill to the west of Balp\u0131nar. He denied any involvement in the killing of the applicant's parents and brother and stated that he felt slandered. His account was supported by Mecit Kaya who confirmed that he had been on patrol on the K\u0131rm\u0131z\u0131tepe hill together with Ali Erta\u015f until the morning of 17 March 1993. Mecit Kaya further declared that neither the village of Balp\u0131nar nor Ali Erta\u015f had any involvement in the killings.", "On 5 April 1993 Mr Salih Kaygusuz took a statement from Orhan Erta\u015f, son of \u015eeyhmus and born in 1969, who stated that on 16 March 1993 he had not been in Balp\u0131nar. On that day he had been loading goods onto his lorry in the province of Mersin and had driven his lorry to Istanbul. He further declared that due to his work, he never stayed very long in Balp\u0131nar.", "28. Between 7 April and 17 May 1993 a ballistics examination was carried out. According to a ballistics report of 29 April 1993 of the forensic laboratory in Diyarbak\u0131r, the nine empty 7.62 mm calibre Kalashnikov cartridges found at the scene of the killing had been fired from three different weapons with the same calibre, i.e. six from one weapon, two from another and one from a third weapon. In a report of 17 May 1993, transmitted to the Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 prosecutor, the forensic laboratory in Diyarbak\u0131r concluded that none of the nine cartridges found at the scene of the killings matched the five empty cartridges reportedly taken from the Kalashnikov rifle of Ali Erta\u015f and that, therefore, the nine cartridges had not been fired from Ali Erta\u015f' weapon.", "29. On 7 July 1993 the Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 public prosecutor Yekta \u00c7obano\u011flu, decided that he lacked jurisdiction to deal with the case. The decision listed Ali and Orhan Erta\u015f as being suspected of the offence of \u201cpolitically motivated murder\u201d of the applicant's parents and brother. It noted that, following its investigation, the District gendarme command had concluded that unidentified members of the PKK terrorist organisation had committed the killings, but that, according to the respective accounts of the applicant and her sister Mekiye, their father had recognised the perpetrators as Ali and Orhan Erta\u015f. Concluding that the alleged offence fell within the scope of Law No. 2845, it was decided that the Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 prosecutor's office lacked jurisdiction and that the case-file should be transmitted to the prosecutor's office at the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court.", "30. On 13 September 1993, following referral of the prosecution's case file to the prosecutor at the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court, the prosecutor at this court, Tanju G\u00fcvendiren, took certain additional measures with respect to the ballistics examination. He enquired as to why only five empty cartridge shells had been sent for examination, whereas six such cartridges taken from Kalashnikov weapons owned by six village guards had been required for a comparison. He further instructed the gendarmerie to provide him with a list of the Karata\u015f village guards as well as the Kalashnikov delivery receipts of these village guards and to send the Kalashnikov delivered to Ali Erta\u015f and all other Kalashnikovs belonging to the village guards to the forensic laboratory in Diyarbak\u0131r for a ballistics examination. In the event of there being insufficient replacement rifles, he instructed that these rifles be discharged and the empty cartridges numbered in order to identify which cartridge was fired from which weapon and to send these cartridges to the forensic laboratory for a ballistics examination.", "On 19 October 1993 the Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 District gendarme command sent to the prosecutor's office at the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court sixty-five weapon and ammunition delivery receipts of the Balp\u0131nar village guards and sixty-five numbered empty cartridges. No information was provided as to the circumstances of the firing of the weapons. On 27 October 1994 the Regional Criminal Police Laboratory in Diyarbak\u0131r submitted to the State Security Court a ballistics examination report which concluded that none of the sixty-five empty 7.62 mm Kalashnikov cartridges matched the nine cartridges found at the place where the applicant's parents and brother had been shot.", "31. On 6 January 1994 prosecutor Tanju G\u00fcvendiren charged Ali and Orhan Erta\u015f with politically motivated murder of the applicant's parents and brother Orhan, under Articles 31, 33 and 448 of the Turkish Penal Code and Article 13/2 of the Law No. 6136.", "On 21 January 1994 the State Security Court instructed the Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 Court of First Instance, inter alia, to take statements from Ali and Orhan Erta\u015f, Mecit Kaya and Mahmut Denli, and to take evidence from \u015eemsi and Mekiye \u00d6nen. It adjourned its further examination until 16 March 1994. On that date it noted that the results of its instructions had not yet arrived and that it appeared from the case-file that weapons seized from the suspects had been sent to the Diyarbak\u0131r Police Laboratory for a ballistics examination.", "Pending the implementation of its above-mentioned orders for the hearing of witnesses and a request for the preparation of a further forensic laboratory report, the State Security Court adjourned the proceedings several times, on the last occasion until 28 December 1994.", "32. In the meantime, according to a statement dated 4 May 1994 and signed by the gendarmes Yusuf Kocer and Salih G\u00fcnay and by the Muhtar of Karata\u015f Muhittin Ara\u00e7, the applicant and her sister Mekiye were living around Cezaevi in the Diyarbak\u0131r province, but their address could not be established. In another statement dated 4 May 1994 and signed by the same gendarmes and the Muhtar of Balp\u0131nar, Izettin Kaya, it was noted that the current whereabouts of Orhan Erta\u015f were unknown.", "On 6 May 1994, in the presence of the Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 public prosecutor Yekta \u00c7obano\u011flu, the judge at the Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 Court of First Instance, Ayhan \u0130stikbal, took statements from Mahmut Denli, Mecit Kaya and Ali Erta\u015f. It was noted that Orhan Erta\u015f had not appeared. Ali Erta\u015f stated that Orhan Erta\u015f had left Balp\u0131nar some time ago, that he was unaware of Orhan's whereabouts and, in any event, Orhan had not been in the village for a long time. As regards the applicant and her sister Mekiye, it was noted that they had not appeared and that the response to their summons indicated that they were not in the village and were residing in the Cezaevi neighbourhood in Diyarbak\u0131r. On 29 June 1994 the State Security Court noted that no statements had been taken from the applicant and her sister Mekiye as their address could not be established.", "33. On 28 December 1994 the State Security Court tried the case in the absence of the defendants as well as of the applicant and her sister. The prosecution submitted that the applicant and her sister had only heard their father state the names of the accused but that there was no other evidence supporting their account. The prosecution argued that, in these circumstances, the accused should be given the benefit of the doubt and acquitted. By judgment of 28 December 1994 the State Security Court unanimously acquitted Ali and Orhan Erta\u015f of the charges against them.", "34. Since the facts of the case are disputed, particularly concerning the circumstances of the killings and the adequacy of the follow-up investigation, the Commission conducted an investigation with the assistance of the parties. The Commission obtained documentary evidence, including written statements. The oral evidence of the applicant and 12 witnesses was heard by three Delegates at a hearing in Ankara on 30 March and 1 and 2 April 1998.", "35. As regards written evidence, the Commission had particular regard to the statements of both the applicant and his sister Mekiye \u00d6nen of 1 and 5 April 1993 (taken by the Fosfat gendarme station commander Salih Kaygusuz and by gendarme officer Cengiz Kesler of the Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 district gendarme station); a statement by the applicant of 9 June 1993 (taken by Mr Yekta \u00c7obano\u011flu, the public prosecutor of Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131); an undated statement taken by Mr Sedat Aslanta\u015f of the Diyarbak\u0131r Branch of the Human Rights Association (submitted to the Commission on 18 October 1993); a statement by the applicant's sister of 6 July 1993 (taken by Yekta \u00c7obano\u011flu); statements by village guards Ali Erta\u015f and Mecit Kaya taken on 4 and 5 April 1993 (at Fosfat gendarme station by Salih Kaygusuz); a statement by Mahmut Denli (taken on 5 April 1993 by gendarme Cengiz Kesler at the Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 District gendarme station); a statement of 6 July 1993 of Ali Erta\u015f (taken by Yekta \u00c7obano\u011flu); statements taken on 6 May 1994 from Mahmut Denli, Mecit Kaya and Ali Erta\u015f by judge Ayhan \u0130stikbal of the Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 Court of First Instance upon request of the State Security Court of Diyarbak\u0131r.", "The Commission also had regard to an incident report and a sketch map, both dated 16 March 1993; an ambulance record of 16 March 1993; a post mortem examination report dated 17 March 1993; correspondence of the Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 public prosecutor; forensic ballistics inquiries and examinations; Yekta \u00c7obano\u011flu's decision of lack of jurisdiction dated 7 July 1993 and a number of minutes of the proceedings before the State Security Court; as well as other documents.", "The latter included gendarme reports and statements related to the investigation of the attack on Balp\u0131nar village guards on 15 November 1992, according to which a group of nine Balp\u0131nar village guards travelling by tractor on the road from Balp\u0131nar to the Fosfat gendarme station were attacked by PKK forces on 15 November 1992 at around 16.00 hours. At the time of the attack, the village guards found themselves between the villages Ar\u0131su and Karata\u015f. Four village guards were injured, amongst whom Ramazan Erta\u015f, son of Kas\u0131m and born in 1955. Four others were killed, amongst whom Nesrettin Erta\u015f, son of \u015eeyhmus and born in 1965, and Davut Erta\u015f, son of Kas\u0131m and born in 1944.", "Account was also taken of letters of various dates between 30 June 1995 and 25 March 1998, from the Commander of the Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 District gendarme station to the office of the public prosecutor in Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 in which he informed the public prosecutor that the identities of the PKK members who had killed the applicant's parents and brother had not yet been established. A number of these letters, including one sent on 25 March 1998, stated that the investigation of the matter was still ongoing.", "36. The oral evidence included statements by the applicant herself, Mekiye \u00d6nen, Ercan \u00d6nen, Muhittin Ara\u00e7, Tahir \u00d6nen, Mehmet Hadi Ara\u00e7, Salih Kaygusuz, Mahmut Denli, Mecit Kaya, Yekta \u00c7obano\u011flu, Sedat \u0130\u015f\u00e7i, Cengiz Kesler and Tanju G\u00fcvendiren.", "37. The verbatim record of the hearing held on 30 March 1998 contained the following passages of relevance to the Government's preliminary objection as to the authenticity of the application (see paragraph 71 below):", "\u201cMr RESS: Did you make two statements at the station, and did you sign them?", "Miss \u015eemsi \u00d6NEN: Yes. I went there a few times. They asked me questions. I answered them. They wrote them down. I put my fingerprint as I don't know how to write. But I don't know what they wrote. I answered the questions just as I'm doing here now. My brother was with me. I put my fingerprint to the statements.", "Mr. RESS: Since you cannot read, I will only show you your fingerprint, and you will say whether it's yours or not.", "A document is shown to the applicant.", "Miss \u015eemsi \u00d6NEN: Yes, it's mine. That's how I put my fingerprint.\u201d", "38. In relation to the oral evidence, the Commission was aware of the difficulties in assessing evidence obtained orally through interpreters: it therefore paid careful attention to the meaning and significance to be attributed to the statements made by the witnesses appearing before its Delegates. The Commission was aware that the cultural context of the applicant and witnesses rendered it inevitable that there would be a certain degree of imprecision with regard to dates and other details. However it did not consider that this by itself detracted from the credibility of the testimony.", "In a case where there were contradictory and conflicting factual accounts of events, the Commission was acutely aware of its own limitations as a first instance tribunal of fact. The problems of language were adverted to above; there was also an inevitable lack of detailed and direct familiarity with the conditions in the region. In addition, the Commission had no powers to take specific measures to compel witnesses to give oral or written evidence. In the present case, despite the Commission's specific request, the Government failed to submit certain relevant documents. The Commission was therefore faced with the difficult task of determining events on the basis of incomplete evidence.", "The Commission's findings can be summarised as follows.", "39. The villages of Balp\u0131nar and Karata\u015f were situated in an area which was subjected to significant PKK activity in the early 1990's. It was undisputed that, prior to the events at issue, village guards from Balp\u0131nar had been attacked on two occasions by PKK forces and that, on 16 March 1993, PKK forces attacked a nearby PTT radio link installation.", "The inhabitants of Karata\u015f, Balp\u0131nar and about forty other villages belonged to the \u201cMetina\u201d clan. It appeared that, at the relevant time, all villages belonging to this clan, with the exception of the village of Karata\u015f and one other village, had village guards and that pressure was exerted to join the village guard system. A number of witnesses stated that the refusal of Karata\u015f to join the village guard system had resulted in tension between Karata\u015f and Balp\u0131nar. Other witnesses denied such tension. The public prosecutor at Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 confirmed that he had heard rumours that the inhabitants of Karata\u015f opposed the Turkish State and, therefore, the village guards were their enemies. The Balp\u0131nar village guards were not authorised to act on their own initiative. They received their orders from and had to report to the Commander of the nearby Fosfat gendarme station.", "40. Although it could not make any definite findings on this point, the Commission did not consider it to be implausible that Karata\u015f' refusal to join the village guard system during a period of significant PKK activity in the area, had resulted in tension between the village guards of Balp\u0131nar and the inhabitants of Karata\u015f.", "41. The Commission was satisfied from the evidence given by the applicant and her sister, that in the evening of 16 March 1993 after having introduced themselves as soldiers knowing that the Muhtar was absent from Karata\u015f and wishing to conduct a house search, two armed and masked men entered their family home. One of the men immediately shot and killed their brother Orhan. In the course of their struggle with the intruders, the applicant's father was shot and killed by one of the intruders and the applicant's mother was seriously injured by a shot fired by the other intruder. There was no reason to doubt that both the applicant and her sister heard their father call out the names of the two perpetrators whom he had recognised as Ali and Orhan Erta\u015f from Balp\u0131nar.", "The killings in question were the result of a premeditated plan to kill the applicant's brother. As to the possible motive for the killing it could not be excluded that there were tensions between the inhabitants of Karata\u015f and the Balp\u0131nar village guards at the relevant time which had already resulted in armed attacks on houses in Karata\u015f. Nor could it be excluded that Orhan \u00d6nen may have been a particular target because of his suspected involvement in the PKK killing of village guards from Balp\u0131nar. On the other hand, the Government's contention that the PKK had a motive for killing Orhan \u00d6nen because they had provided him with a vehicle which he had used for his own benefit rather than for services required by the PKK had not only remained unsubstantiated but was, moreover, contradicted by substantial evidence submitted by the applicant.", "42. As to the circumstances of the killing itself, the Commission found it established that the killers were aware that the Muhtar of Karata\u015f was absent from the village and that the applicant and her sister heard their father call out the names of the perpetrators, identifying them as Ali and Orhan Erta\u015f. Moreover, the evidence of Mahmut Denli and Mecit Kaya that the Balp\u0131nar village guards, including Ali Erta\u015f, had been on guard duty throughout the night of 16 March 1993 was at least open to question. In addition, the suspicion of the involvement of Balp\u0131nar village guards was reinforced by the identification of Ali and Orhan Erta\u015f by the applicant and her sister at the Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 gendarme station. Nevertheless, while the evidence was sufficient to give rise to suspicion as to the identity of the killers, it had not been established to the required standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant's brother, father and mother were killed by agents of the State.", "In this connection, the Commission noted that the applicant had given the Delegates a description of the two men: the one who shot her brother Orhan and her mother had been described as a person with long fair hair, hazel eyes and a fair complexion, whilst the man who shot their father was described as having a moustache and black eyes. Her sister, Mekiye, confirmed that the man who shot Orhan had hazel eyes but stated that she had not seen the second intruder. The applicant had further given evidence that, on 5 April 1993, when she subsequently attended the Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 gendarme station, she saw Ali and Orhan Erta\u015f and recognised them as the same two men. This was confirmed by Mekiye in that, on the same occasion, she had recognised Orhan Erta\u015f as one of the killers from his height, build, hazel eyes, nose and complexion.", "The Commission considered that this evidence should be treated with caution. In the circumstances of the sudden and traumatic events of that night, it was at least doubtful whether either the applicant or her sister would have had an opportunity to form a clear and accurate impression of the features of either man. In particular, Mekiye appeared only fleetingly to have seen her brother's killer, whose face had been masked with a scarf. The Commission noted that the description given by them of Orhan and Ali was contradicted by Muhittin Ara\u00e7, who knew both men and who described Orhan as being lean with a dark complexion and black hair and Ali as being a more bulky man of the same height with a light complexion and chestnut brown hair.", "As to the evidence of the subsequent identification of these two men, the Commission found no reason to doubt that the applicant and her sister did see Ali and Orhan Erta\u015f at the Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 gendarme station on 5 April 1993. What was, however, more doubtful was whether the identification of the two men was entirely spontaneous or whether the applicant and her sister were made aware that the men were Ali and Orhan, whose names had been called out by their father.", "43. Finally, it had not been established that Salih Kaygusuz, the Commander of the Fosfat gendarme station, had considerably delayed the provision of medical treatment to the applicant's injured mother or that the gendarme forces failed to offer her available assistance. In this connection, the Commission had regard to its findings as regards the time of the armed attack and the moment at which the applicant's mother received medical care in Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131.", "44. From the evidence of Salih Kaygusuz it appeared that, after the minibus transporting the applicant's mother had left for Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131, he reported the incident in Karata\u015f to his superiors at the District gendarme station in Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 and stated that he suspected that the PKK was responsible for the killings. He was told that, for reasons of security, the public prosecutor would only come to Karata\u015f the next morning. He then ordered a first gendarme team to secure the area around Karata\u015f. A second team, led by himself, joined the first team some time later. Thereupon, he and one gendarme team went to Karata\u015f. They arrived sometime after midnight and found the bodies of the three victims inside the applicant's house.", "45. Although the local gendarmes only arrived in Karata\u015f at least three hours after the killings occurred, the Commission accepted that this delay had been caused by the fact that on the same evening an armed attack on a nearby radio link installation had taken place. However, once in Karata\u015f, the gendarmes only secured the scene of the crime and, in the absence of any instructions, passively awaited the arrival of the competent investigation authorities, in the instant case the public prosecutor at Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131.", "46. According to Salih Kaygusuz, the villagers present were unwilling to provide the first team of gendarmes with any information about the killings. After having secured the scene of the killings, he and the other gendarmes merely awaited the arrival of the prosecutor since they had not been ordered to take any investigative steps.", "47. In the morning of 17 March 1993 an investigation team consisting of the public prosecutor of Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131, Yekta \u00c7obano\u011flu, and, amongst others, Dr. Sedat \u0130\u015f\u00e7i left Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 for Karata\u015f.", "After the investigation team had arrived in Karata\u015f and before attending the post mortem examination of the victims' bodies, the public prosecutor briefly inspected the scene of the killings and ordered Salih Kaygusuz to draw a sketch map of the scene of the killings and to collect the empty cartridges lying there. Without having been numbered and without having recorded the exact location of each cartridge, the nine empty cartridges found were put together in a bag and handed to the public prosecutor. No photographs of the scene of the killings were taken by or on behalf of the investigation team.", "48. The information recorded on the sketch map of the scene of the killings appeared to be incomplete. In contrast to a remark in the post mortem body examination report and the testimony of Dr. Sedat \u0130\u015f\u00e7i, the sketch map did not indicate a large blood stain on the spot where the body of Orhan \u00d6nen had been found. Furthermore, although both Salih Kaygusuz, who drew the sketch map, and Yekta \u00c7obano\u011flu were aware that the body of the applicant's mother had been moved, this fact had not been recorded on the sketch map. Although the Commission accepted that, at the time this sketch map was drawn, the members of the investigation team may have been unaware of the fact that the body of the applicant's father had also been moved from the outside of the house, the subsequent investigation could not have been assisted by the fact that the scope of the sketch map was confined to the inside of the house and did not contain any information about the immediate surroundings.", "49. The Commission noted that, according to the post mortem examination report, the applicant's brother, lying in bed, was hit by numerous bullets in his face, by one bullet in his chest and by another bullet in his knee. The Commission found this recorded observation difficult to reconcile with the fact that, according to the sketch map, only four empty cartridges were found in the room where Orhan \u00d6nen was shot and with the evidence that not a single bullet had been found in that room. Furthermore, although there was strong evidence suggesting that the applicant's father had been shot and killed outside the house, the sketch map only contained information on what had been found inside the house. Although this was denied by Salih Kaygusuz, the Commission could not exclude that more than the nine recorded empty cartridges were in fact found and collected, including empty cartridges found outside the house.", "50. After having conducted the examination of the bodies and released the victims' remains for burial, the investigation team left Karata\u015f. Although the public prosecutor was aware that both the applicant and her sister were present in Karata\u015f during the visit of the investigation team, neither the public prosecutor nor any other official took any statement's from them or any of the other inhabitants of Karata\u015f on that day.", "51. As early as 17 March 1993 the public prosecutor suspected that the PKK was responsible for the killings and, in a telegram sent the same day, informed the office of the public prosecutor at the State Security Court in Diyarbak\u0131r accordingly. Although in his evidence to the Commission's Delegates, Yekta \u00c7obano\u011flu stressed that this had only been a provisional opinion, his respective requests dated 17 March 1993 to the Census Directorate in Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 to issue death certificates in respect of the applicant's parents and brother simply state that they \u201cwere murdered by fire-armed members of the outlawed PKK terrorist organisation\u201d and, consequently, their deaths were officially recorded as having been caused by the PKK terrorist organisation.", "52. It was only on 1 April 1993 that the applicant and her sister Mekiye gave a statement about the events of 16 March 1993 to the commander of the Fosfat gendarme station Salih Kaygusuz. The applicant stated that she had heard her father call out the names of the intruders and she further gave a description of the intruders' physical appearance. Mekiye stated that she had heard her father call out only one name and did not give any description of the intruders' physical features. According to Salih Kaygusuz, this was the first time that he heard the allegation that Ali and Orhan Erta\u015f had committed the killings.", "53. In his testimony to the Delegates, Salih Kaygusuz had a firm recollection that he had also taken statements from Muhittin Ara\u00e7, Tahir \u00d6nen and Mahmut Denli. In reply to the request of the Commission's Delegates to submit these statements, the Government stated by letter of 21 January 1999 that Salih Kaygusuz had not participated in the interrogation of these three persons. The Commission further noted that its case-file did not contain any statement given by any of these three persons at the Fosfat gendarme station.", "54. The Commission further found it established that Yekta \u00c7obano\u011flu, from the outset, had a rather firm conviction that PKK forces had committed the killings. Although he stressed that this had only been a provisional opinion inspired by views expressed by the gendarmes and his own experience, the Commission found no support for the asserted provisional nature of this suspicion. In fact, it appeared from the contents of his written communications of 17 March 1993 that he had firm ideas about the identity of the perpetrators. This element, taken together with his failure to try to talk to the applicant and her sister on 17 March 1993, resulted in a loss of time in the initial phase of the investigation.", "55. As regards the encounter on 5 April 1993 between the applicant and her sister and Ali and Orhan Erta\u015f in the Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 District gendarme station, the Commission found that it could not be excluded that this encounter was in fact the result of a coincidence since Yekta \u00c7obano\u011flu had not ordered a confrontation. It did not appear from the evidence that the applicant and her sister had been invited by the investigation authorities to identify the perpetrators either from a collection of photographs or at an identity parade. The Commission found that no photographs of Ali and Orhan Erta\u015f had ever been shown to the applicant and her sister and that at no point in time had a formal confrontation been ordered.", "The Commission further noted from the evidence submitted that, apart from the statement taken from Orhan Erta\u015f at the Fosfat gendarme station on 5 April 1993, hardly any attempts were made or seriously pursued to obtain any further evidence from him. Nor did it seem that any attempt had been made to verify his alibi by, for instance, checking his whereabouts on 16 and 17 March 1993 by seeking confirmation from those persons present when he was allegedly loading goods in Mersin or from those to whom he had delivered these goods. It did not appear from the statement he gave at the Fosfat gendarme station that he was in fact asked to give the names of persons who had seen him on 16 and 17 March 1993.", "As regards the alibi advanced by Ali Erta\u015f, the Commission noted that his presence on K\u0131rm\u0131z\u0131tepe hill at the time of the killings was in fact only supported by the statements of Mecit Kaya and Mahmut Denli, whereas the latter had stated to the Commission's Delegates that he had not in fact been in the presence of Ali Erta\u015f at the time of the killings, but had only seen him shortly afterwards. Given the evidence that there were, in total, 65 village guards in Balp\u0131nar who were organised in teams of 12-14 persons, the Commission found it remarkable that, apart from Mecit Kaya, no evidence was taken from the other village guards who were on duty in the same team as Ali Erta\u015f at the relevant time in order to verify the respective positions of each team member on K\u0131rm\u0131z\u0131tepe hill that evening.", "56. After having received the case-file, Tanju G\u00fcvendiren, the public prosecutor at the State Security Court noted that the investigation had been incomplete. In order to complete the investigation, he issued a number of instructions to the Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 District gendarme station by letter of 13 September 1993 including that comparison cartridges be taken from the weapons held by the village guards from Karata\u015f. On 19 October 1993 the Commander of the Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 District gendarme station transmitted 65 weapon delivery receipts and 65 empty cartridges taken from the Balp\u0131nar village guards to the office of the public prosecutor at the State Security Court. This letter contained no information as to when and in which manner these cartridges were obtained.", "Although Tanju G\u00fcvendiren considered that there was no concrete evidence in support of the accusations made against Ali and Orhan Erta\u015f and was convinced that the PKK was responsible for the killings, he nevertheless brought proceedings against Ali and Orhan Erta\u015f on charges of politically motivated murder and indicted them on 6 January 1994 before the State Security Court, which had jurisdiction to determine murder charges linked to terrorism. He did not find it necessary to take any further statements or to order the arrest or pre-trial detention of the accused. In his opinion, it was excluded that the security forces would cover up a crime committed by village guards.", "In the subsequent proceedings before it, the State Security Court in Diyarbak\u0131r requested, inter alia, that statements be taken from Ali and Orhan Erta\u015f, from the applicant and her sister Mekiye, and from Mecit Kaya and Mahmut Denli. They were all summoned to appear on 6 May 1994 before a judge of the Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 Court of First Instance in order to give statements, but only Ali Erta\u015f, Mecit Kaya and Mahmut Denli in fact did so. As the whereabouts of Orhan Erta\u015f, the applicant and her sister were not established, their summonses were returned to the State Security Court and, consequently, no further statements were taken from them.", "The Commission noted that, although the gendarmes and the State Security Court were informed that the applicant and her sister were residing in the Cezaevi neighbourhood in Diyarbak\u0131r, it did not appear that any attempts were made or ordered to locate them. Nor did it seem that any further attempts were made or ordered to find Orhan Erta\u015f. The Commission noted that the Muhtar of Karata\u015f, Muhittin Ara\u00e7, testified that he had been aware of the exact address of the applicant and her sister in Diyarbak\u0131r, but that he had never been asked to provide the local gendarmes with this address. He explained his signature on a document dated 4 May 1994 by stating that it had been normal practice in the area for gendarmes to require Muhtars to sign blank documents for future use. No further clarification on this point could be obtained from Salih Kaygusuz, as he had left the Fosfat gendarme station in August 1993. In these circumstances, it was impossible for the Commission to make any findings in this respect. What was clear, however, was that the State Security Court was informed that the applicant and her sister were residing at that time in the Cezaevi neighbourhood of Diyarbak\u0131r. In this connection, the Commission had also regard to the evidence of the applicant's brother that, since their departure from Karata\u015f and to date, the \u00d6nen family had always lived at the same address in Diyarbak\u0131r.", "57. The Commission accepted that the supplementary investigation measures ordered by the public prosecutor at the State Security Court, Tanju G\u00fcvendiren, in order to mend certain deficiencies in the preliminary investigation, were appropriate, although it was open to doubt whether, given the passage of time since the killings, these measures were as effective as they might have been in the initial phase of the proceedings. Moreover, he testified that he was convinced at the outset that the PKK was responsible for the killings, which might explain why he decided to indict Ali and Orhan Erta\u015f before the State Security Court, rather than referring the case to a court competent to try common crimes. This was supported by the fact that, apart from Ali Erta\u015f, none of the other vital witnesses gave evidence to the State Security Court.", "58. The principles and procedures relating to liability for acts contrary to the law may be summarised as follows.", "59. Under the Turkish Criminal Code (TPC) all forms of homicide (Articles 448 to 455) and attempted homicide (Articles 61 and 62) constitute criminal offences. The authorities' obligations in respect of conducting a preliminary investigation into acts or omissions capable of constituting such offences that have been brought to their attention are governed by Articles 151 to 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Offences may be reported to the authorities or the security forces as well as to public prosecutor's offices. The complaint may be made in writing or orally. If it is made orally, the authority must make a record of it (Article 151).", "By Article 235 of the Criminal Code, any public official who fails to report to the police or a public prosecutor's office an offence of which he has become aware in the exercise of his duty is liable to imprisonment.", "A public prosecutor who is informed by any means whatsoever of a situation that gives rise to the suspicion that an offence has been committed is obliged to investigate the facts in order to decide whether or not there should be a prosecution (Article 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).", "60. In the case of alleged terrorist offences, the public prosecutor is deprived of jurisdiction in favour of a separate system of State Security prosecutors and courts established throughout Turkey.", "61. If the suspected offender is a civil servant and if the offence was committed during the performance of his duties, the preliminary investigation of the case is governed by the Law of 1914 on the prosecution of civil servants, which restricts the public prosecutor's jurisdiction ratione personae at that stage of the proceedings. In such cases it is for the relevant local administrative council (for the district or province, depending on the suspect's status) to conduct the preliminary investigation and, consequently, to decide whether to prosecute. Once a decision to prosecute has been taken, it is for the public prosecutor to investigate the case.", "An appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court lies against a decision of the Council. If a decision not to prosecute is taken, the case is automatically referred to that court.", "62. By virtue of Article 4, paragraph (i), of Legislative Decree no. 285 of 10 July 1987 on the authority of the governor of a state of emergency region, the 1914 Law (see paragraph 61 above) also applies to members of the security forces who come under the governor's authority.", "63. If the suspect is a member of the armed forces, the applicable law is determined by the nature of the offence. Thus, if it is a \u201cmilitary offence\u201d under the Military Criminal Code (Law no. 1632), the criminal proceedings are in principle conducted in accordance with Law no. 353 on the establishment of courts martial and their rules of procedure. Where a member of the armed forces has been accused of an ordinary offence, it is normally the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure which apply (see Article 145 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution and sections 9 to 14 of Law no. 353).", "The Military Criminal Code makes it a military offence for a member of the armed forces to endanger a person's life by disobeying an order (Article 89). In such cases civilian complainants may lodge their complaints with the authorities referred to in the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 59 above) or with the offender's superior.", "64. Under section 13 of Law no. 2577 on administrative procedure, anyone who sustains damage as a result of an act by the authorities may, within one year after the alleged act was committed, claim compensation from them. If the claim is rejected in whole or in part or if no reply is received within sixty days, the victim may bring administrative proceedings.", "65. Article 125 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 7 of the Constitution provides:", "\u201cAll acts or decisions of the authorities are subject to judicial review ...", "The authorities shall be liable to make reparation for all damage caused by their acts or measures.\u201d", "66. That provision establishes the State's strict liability, which comes into play if it is shown that in the circumstances of a particular case the State has failed in its obligation to maintain public order, ensure public safety or protect people's lives or property, without it being necessary to show a tortious act attributable to the authorities. Under these rules, the authorities may therefore be held liable to compensate anyone who has sustained loss as a result of acts committed by unidentified persons.", "67. Article 8 of Legislative Decree no. 430 of 16 December 1990, the last sentence of which was inspired by the provision mentioned above (see paragraph 66 above), provides:", "\u201cNo criminal, financial or legal liability may be asserted against ... the governor of a state of emergency region or by provincial governors in that region in respect of decisions taken, or acts performed, by them in the exercise of the powers conferred on them by this legislative decree, and no application shall be made to any judicial authority to that end. This is without prejudice to the rights of individuals to claim reparation from the State for damage which they have been caused without justification.\u201d", "68. Under the Code of Obligations, anyone who suffers damage as a result of an illegal or tortious act may bring an action for damages (Articles 41 to 46) and non-pecuniary loss (Article 47). The civil courts are not bound by either the findings or the verdict of the criminal court on the issue of the defendant's guilt (Article 53).", "However, under section 13 of Law no. 657 on State employees, anyone who has sustained loss as a result of an act done in the performance of duties governed by public law may, in principle, only bring an action against the authority by whom the civil servant concerned is employed and not directly against the civil servant (see Article 129 \u00a7 5 of the Constitution and Articles 55 and 100 of the Code of Obligations). That is not, however, an absolute rule. When an act is found to be illegal or tortious and, consequently, is no longer an \u201cadministrative act\u201d or deed, the civil courts may allow a claim for damages to be made against the official concerned, without prejudice to the victim's right to bring an action against the authority on the basis of its joint liability as the official's employer (Article 50 of the Code of Obligations)."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "2", "3", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
