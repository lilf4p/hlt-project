The first applicant was born in 1982 and lives in Furstenfeld, Austria. He is the father of the second applicant, who was born in 2006 and lives at an unspecified address in Romania.", "7. On 13 April 2004 the first applicant married a Romanian citizen, K.T. The marriage was concluded in Salzburg, Austria. On 15 February 2006 their daughter, the second applicant, was born. The parents had joint custody of the child under Austrian law. They lived in Salzburg.", "8. On 1 February 2008 K.T. and the first applicant separated. On 25 February 2008 K.T. filed a divorce petition with the Salzburg authorities. The first applicant lodged a counter petition on 25 March 2008.", "9. On 29 January 2008 K.T. filed for an interim injunction against the first applicant, seeking his removal from the family home on the ground of his violent behaviour. On 8 February 2008, the Salzburg District Civil Court granted the interim injunction for a period of three months. Criminal proceedings were also initiated against the first applicant for infliction of bodily harm.", "10. On 1 February 2008 K.T. lodged an action for temporary sole custody of the second applicant throughout the divorce proceedings. At the end of September 2008, while the proceedings for the award of custody were pending before the Austrian courts, K.T. left for Romania together with the second applicant. The first applicant was not informed of the departure, even though at the time the spouses had joint custody of the second applicant.", "11. In the meantime, on 25 July 2008 the Salzburg District Criminal Court acquitted the first applicant of inflicting bodily harm. The Salzburg Public Prosecutor reserved the right to initiate criminal proceedings against K.T. for perjury.", "12. On 25 November 2008, the Salzburg District Civil Court granted the first applicant temporary sole custody of the second applicant until the finalisation of the divorce proceedings. The court relied, inter alia, on expert opinion which concluded that the first applicant was better suited to have custody. K.T. does not appear to have appealed against the judgment.", "13. Currently, the divorce proceedings between the first applicant and K.T. are pending before the Romanian courts.", "14. On 30 September 2008 the first applicant submitted a request for the return of the second applicant to Austria under Article 3 of the Hague Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (\u201cthe Hague Convention\u201d). He argued that the second applicant had been removed from Austrian territory in breach of the joint custody held by the spouses at the time of the removal. On 7 October 2008 the Austrian authorities submitted the request to the Romanian Ministry of Justice (\u201cthe Romanian Ministry\u201d), the Central Authority responsible for the obligations established under the Hague Convention.", "15. On 28 October 2008, at the request of the Romanian Ministry, the General Police Department (Inspectoratul General al Poli\u0163iei) confirmed that the second applicant was living with her mother, in Romania, at her grandparents\u2019 home. Furthermore, on 3 November 2008 the Department for Social Services and Child Protection (Departamentul General de Asisten\u0163\u0103 Social\u0103 \u015fi Protec\u0163ia Copilului) drafted a report in relation to the second applicant. The report mainly mentioned K.T.\u2019s statements concerning her situation in Austria, her reasons for departure as well as the maternal grandparents\u2019 declarations concerning their commitment to provide housing and financial support to the second applicant indefinitely. It was also mentioned that the second applicant did not appear to be an abused or neglected child and that she was very attached to her mother and her maternal grandparents. The report concluded that the second applicant had appropriate living conditions, both from a material and emotional point of view.", "16. On 5 December 2008 the Romanian Ministry instituted proceedings on behalf of the first applicant before the Bucharest County Court. By a judgment of 28 January 2009, communicated on 28 May 2009, the Bucharest County Court found in favour of the first applicant, ordering the return of the second applicant to Austria. The Bucharest County Court held that the request fell under Article 3 of the Hague Convention and that none of the exceptions provided for under Article 13 applied.", "17. K.T. appealed. She submitted several pieces of evidence, including declarations of her parents as witnesses given before a Romanian Court in the context of the divorce and custody proceedings. She further submitted a welfare report drafted by the Custody Service within the Timi\u015foara City Hall (Serviciul de Autoritate Tutelar\u0103 din cadrul Primariei Municipiului Timi\u015foara). The report included information on K.T.\u2019s family situation, living conditions, and K.T.\u2019s declarations in relation to the circumstances of her living and departing from Austria. Finally, the report recommended that K.T. were awarded the custody over the second applicant.", "18. By a final judgment delivered on 8 July 2009, and rendered in written form on 17 September 2009, the Bucharest Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on points of law, holding that the return of the second applicant to Austria would expose her to physical and psychological harm, within the meaning of Article 13 \u00a7 1 (b) of the Hague Convention. On the merits, the Bucharest Court of Appeal held that the first applicant had shown violent behaviour towards K.T., as the Salzburg District Civil Court had maintained when granting K.T. the interim injunction of 8 February 2008. The Bucharest Court of Appeal further held that the first applicant had breached the restraining order in September 2008, which determined K.T. to come to Romania. Finally, the domestic court reasoned that even if there was no evidence of a violent behaviour of the first applicant towards the child, this could be inferred from his behaviour towards K.T. and from K.T.\u2019s departure to Romania. The Salzburg District Civil Court\u2019s judgment of 25 November 2008 was set aside on the ground that by that time K.T. and the second applicant had already left Austria.", "19. Throughout the domestic proceedings, the Romanian Ministry informed the Austrian authorities of the progress of the Hague Convention proceedings. The information included the date of the hearings and whether or not an appeal had been lodged. From the evidence adduced to the case file, it appears that the Romanian Ministry did not have any direct contact with the first applicant in connection with the Hague Convention proceedings.", "20. The relevant provisions of the Hague Convention, which entered into force in respect of Romania on 30 September 1992, read, in so far as relevant, as follows.", "\u201cThe removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where \u2013", "a) it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person, an institution or any other body, either jointly or alone, under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention; and", "b) at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.", "The rights of custody mentioned in sub-paragraph a) above, may arise in particular by operation of law or by reason of a judicial or administrative decision, or by reason of an agreement having legal effect under the law of that State.\u201d", "\u201cThe Convention shall apply to any child who was habitually resident in a Contracting State immediately before any breach of custody or access rights.

Where a person, institution or other body having rights of custody applies to the competent authorities in a Member State to deliver a judgment on the basis of the Hague Convention [..], in order to obtain the return of a child that has been wrongfully removed or retained in a Member State other than the Member State where the child was habitually resident immediately before the wrongful removal or retention, paragraphs 2 to 8 shall apply.", "[...]", "3. A court to which an application for return of a child is made as mentioned in paragraph 1 shall act expeditiously in proceedings on the application, using the most expeditious procedures available in national law.", "Without prejudice to the first subparagraph, the court shall, except where exceptional circumstances make this impossible, issue its judgment no later than six weeks after the application is lodged.", "4. A court cannot refuse to return a child on the basis of Article 13 (b) of the [...] Hague Convention if it is established that adequate arrangements have been made to secure the protection of the child after his or her return.", "5. A court cannot refuse to return a child unless the person who requested the return of the child has been given an opportunity to be heard.", "6. If a court has issued an order on non-return pursuant to Article 13 of the 1980 Hague Convention, the court must immediately either directly or through its central authority, transmit a copy of the court order on non-return and of the relevant documents, in particular a transcript of the hearings before the court, to the court with jurisdiction or central authority in the Member State where the child was habitually resident immediately before the wrongful removal or retention, as determined by national law.
