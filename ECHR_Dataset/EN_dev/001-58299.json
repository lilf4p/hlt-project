In 1982 the first applicant, a civil engineer by profession and employed by the French company S., was placed at the disposal of the European Space Agency to perform services at the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt. The first applicant\u2019s contract was later taken over by the French company T.", "The second applicant, a systems programmer and employed by the Italian company T.I., was placed at the disposal of the European Space Agency to perform services at the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt in 1991.", "12. The European Space Agency (\u201cESA\u201d) with headquarters in Paris, formed out of the European Space Research Organisation (\u201cESRO\u201d) and the European Organisation for the Development and Construction of Space Vehicle Launchers (\u201cELDO\u201d), was established under the Convention for the Establishment of a European Space Agency (\u201cESA Convention\u201d) of 30 May 1975 (United Nations Treaty Series 1983, vol. 1297, I \u2013 no. 21524).

In October and November 1993 the applicants instituted proceedings before the Darmstadt Labour Court (Arbeitsgericht) against ESA, arguing that, pursuant to the German Provision of Labour (Temporary Staff) Act (Arbeitnehmer\u00fcberlassungsgesetz), they had acquired the status of employees of ESA. In his submissions, the second applicant indicated that, by letter of 27 September 1993, his employer T.I. had dismissed him.", "14. In the respective labour court proceedings, ESA relied on its immunity from jurisdiction under Article XV \u00a7 2 of the ESA Convention and its Annex I.", "15. On 21 March 1995 the Darmstadt Labour Court, following hearings, declared the applicants\u2019 respective actions inadmissible.", "In both decisions, the Labour Court considered that ESA had validly relied on its immunity from jurisdiction. The Labour Court, referring to section 20(2) of the Courts Act (Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz), according to which immunity from jurisdiction could be provided for, inter alia, in international agreements, considered that ESA enjoyed such immunity under Article XV \u00a7 2 of the ESA Convention and its Annex I.", "In its reasoning, the Labour Court considered in particular that ESA had been established in 1975 as a new and independent international organisation. It therefore rejected the applicants\u2019 argument that ESA was bound by Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Agreement concerning ESOC, which had subjected the former ESRO to German jurisdiction in cases of disputes with its employees which were outside the competence of its Appeals Board.", "The Labour Court further recalled that the Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht), in a decision of 10 November 1993 in a similar case (file no. 7 AZR 600/92; see the Waite and Kennedy v. Germany judgment of 18 February 1999, to be published in the Court\u2019s official reports, \u00a7\u00a7 21-25), had found that the rules in question did not conflict with fundamental principles of German constitutional law.", "16.

Section 1(9)(1) provides that contracts between the hirer-out (Verleiher) and the hiring employer and between the hirer-out and the employee hired out (Leiharbeitnehmer) are void if no official permission has been obtained as required by section1(1)(1). If the contract between a hirer-out and an employee hired out is void under section 1(9)(1), a contract between the hiring employer and the employee hired out is deemed to have been concluded (gilt als zustande gekommen) as from the envisaged start of employment (section1(10)(1)(1)).
