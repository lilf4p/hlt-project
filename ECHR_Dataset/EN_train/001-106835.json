The applicant joined the proceedings as a civil party.", "14. During the proceedings, the applicant lodged an objection, stating that the case should be dealt with by the Beyo\u011flu Assize Court, as the police officers\u2019 actions had amounted to torture. On 17 March 2002 the Beyo\u011flu Criminal Court declared that it did not have jurisdiction and transferred the case to the Beyo\u011flu Assize Court.

On 6 April 2007, on the basis of medical reports and witness statements, the Beyo\u011flu Assize Court found it established that Officer A.\u00c7. had broken the applicant\u2019s nose by head-butting him. Considering that the use of force had not been proportionate, the court found the police officer guilty of ill-treating the applicant under Article 245 of the former Criminal Code. Having regard to the duration of the treatment, the court decided that the act did not amount to torture, since it had not been systematic. In conclusion, A.\u00c7. was sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment and banned from public service for three months. The court then converted his sentence to a fine, having had regard to the fact that he did not have a criminal record. Furthermore, the court decided to suspend his sentence under Law no. 647, considering that he was unlikely to break the law again. The other six police officers were acquitted of the charges against them.", "16. The applicant appealed against this decision.", "17.
