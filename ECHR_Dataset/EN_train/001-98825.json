The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Kyiv.", "6. On 26 July 2004 the applicant and his wife, Mrs K., adopted V.G., an orphan boy born in 1993.", "7. From January 2005, due to conflicts between the applicant's wife on one hand and the applicant and V.G. on the other, they ceased to keep a joint household and the applicant's wife subsequently moved to their summer house.", "8. In October 2006 the applicant sought annulment of his marriage with Mrs K. before the Shevchenkivskyy District Court of Kyiv (the Shevchenkivsky Court).", "9. On 27 October 2006 the child welfare authority of the Vyshgorod Administration (\u0412\u0438\u0448\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0430\u0434\u043c\u0456\u043d\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0456\u044f \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0457 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0456) delivered its opinion, at the request of Mrs K., on annulment of the adoption of V.G. It found that the relations between the adoptee and Mrs K. were negative, while the applicant had authority over the adoptee and positive relations with him. The report also mentioned that the boy had expressed the wish to stay with his adoptive father and that the applicant was willing to take care of the boy's upbringing. It finally recommended cancelling the adoption with respect to the applicant and his wife, as the relations between the latter had deteriorated, which had a negative effect on the boy, so that it would not serve his interests to stay in his adoptive family.", "10. In November 2006 the applicant's then wife requested the Vyshgorod Court to annul the adoption of the child by her and her husband, on the grounds that the child had attacked her physically on several occasions and that her husband, who had been present during one of the incidents, had refused to stop the attacks. She supported her claim by the report of 27 October 2006.", "11. In the course of the proceedings both the applicant and the child objected to Mrs K.'s request for annulment of the adoption by the applicant. The applicant did not object to the annulment of the adoption in respect of Mrs K. He also denied that he had ever witnessed Mrs K. being physically attacked by V.G.", "12. Meanwhile, on 6 March 2007 the applicant and Mrs K. divorced.", "13. On 20 July 2007 the applicant married Ms V.T.", "14. On 9 August 2007 the Shevchenkivskyy Court allowed the request of the applicant's former wife and annulled the adoption of V.G. by her and by the applicant. In particular, referring to Article 238 \u00a7 1 (3) of the Family Code, the court held that the adoption by the applicant's former wife was to be annulled in view of the fact that relations between her and the adoptee had worsened, rendering it impossible for them to live as a family. The court based its findings on the statements of Mrs K. and medical evidence of injuries sustained by her. The court also referred to the testimonies of neighbours of the family and a report on V.G.'s personality of 9 August 2006 provided by his school that stated that he behaved aggressively, insulted and threatened the neighbours and on some occasions had beaten some of his schoolmates. The report of 9 August 2006 also mentioned that this aggressive attitude and lack of respect for others were hereditary traits and required treatment by specialists. The child welfare authority supported the claims of Mrs K. and submitted that annulment of the adoption would be to the benefit of the boy.", "15. The court further held that the adoption of V.G. by the applicant was also to be annulled in the best interest of the child, regardless of the child's wish to stay with his adoptive father, which had been expressed before the court. It found that the applicant had disregarded the child's aggressive attitude towards his adoptive mother, which had caused the child to develop a negative attitude towards women and misconceptions about normal family relationships. The court ordered the child to be transferred to the child welfare authority for subsequent placement in an unspecified specialised institution. V.G. continued to reside with the applicant and has never been taken into care.", "16. On 28 August 2007 the Shevchenkivskyy Court divided the flat between the applicant and Mrs K., his former wife. They received a room each within the flat while other facilities remained in common use.", "17. On 17 December 2007 the Kyiv City Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of 9 August 2007. It dismissed the applicant's appeal and found that he had not adduced any evidence testifying that he was able to influence the boy positively and secure his normal personal development. According to the court of appeal the adoption was correctly annulled by the first-instance court on the basis of Article 238 \u00a7 1 (3) of the Family Code, and the mere fact of positive relations between the applicant and the child and his desire to remain the boy's adoptive father could not serve as a basis for reversal of the above judgment. The court of appeal concluded as follows:", "\u201cThe court correctly took into consideration that the annulment of the adoption ... could be also regarded as a sanction imposed on the boy for his disgraceful behaviour\u201d", "18. On 27 February 2008 the Supreme Court found no grounds to review the applicant's case in cassation.", "19. On 3 June 2008 the Shevchenkivskyy District State Administration of Kyiv, at the request of the applicant and V.G. and in the interest of the latter, appointed the applicant guardian (\u043f\u0456\u043a\u043b\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a) of V.G. As guardian the applicant was entrusted with \u201cprotection of the rights and property interest of the child\u201d and with \u201cfinancial support and constant care for the boy's upbringing and his physical growth and development\u201d.", "20. On 11 September 2008 the applicant's former wife, Mrs K., lodged a claim with the Shevchenkivskyy Court and sought annulment of the decision of the Shevchenkivskyy District State Administration of Kyiv of 3 June 2008. She alleged that that decision had been taken in contradiction to the judgment of the Shevchenkivskyy Court given on 9 August 2007 and that V.G.'s residence in the flat posed a threat to her life.", "21.
