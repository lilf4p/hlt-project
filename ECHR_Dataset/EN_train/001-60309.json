On 18 August 1992, the applicant began work in the Culloden Hotel, Belfast, as a silver service waiter. This hotel is owned by Moyola Cellars Limited, which is subsidiary of Hastings Hotels Group Limited. Initially the applicant had been doing very well and was optimistic about promotion. On 31 October 1992, the restaurant manager informed the applicant that he was being dismissed forthwith. The applicant was given no reason whatsoever for his peremptory dismissal. Various attempts to get an explanation for the dismissal were unsuccessful. Ultimately the general manager told the applicant on 1 November 1992 that he was dismissed because he did not meet the grade and there was no other reason. Of all the full-time and permanent staff in the restaurant the applicant believes that he was the only Catholic.", "9.

The solicitors requested that the RUC provide information as to what the applicant was suspected of and on what basis the applicant had been allegedly described as a suspect. The RUC replied to this letter, stating that they were unable to comment on such matters, it not being force policy to do so.", "11. On 29 March 1993 the solicitors acting on behalf of the applicant\u2019s employers wrote to the Fair Employment Tribunal.", "\u201cWe return herewith Notice of Appearance in relation to the application presented by Mr Liam Devenney. On our instructions, the acts of which complaint is made, were done for the purpose of protecting public safety, and in the circumstances by virtue of Section 42 of the Fair Employment Act 1976, the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Acts do not apply so that the tribunal does not have jurisdiction to entertain the complaint.\u201d", "12. The Fair Employment Tribunal then of its own motion fixed a preliminary hearing for determination of the following issue:", "\u201cWhether the tribunal has jurisdiction to consider the applicant\u2019s complaint in view of the provisions of Section 42 of the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1976.\u201d", "13.

By reply of 6 December 1993 the employers\u2019 solicitors stated:", "\u201cWe today received your letter dated 3 December 1993 in relation to the above. You will be pleased to hear that during the writer\u2019s holiday last week a Section 42 certificate was received from the Crown Solicitor\u2019s office (a certified copy of which is enclosed herewith) so that it now seems unnecessary to take any further action, and that you may close your file in this matter.\u201d", "14. The applicant stated that he did not know the basis upon which the certificate was issued. He had never been shown, and was not entitled to demand, sight of the information, if any, which was placed before the Secretary of State which led to the certificate being issued. The applicant did not know whether this information was correct or incorrect, whether it was complete or incomplete, and whether it was reliable or not. Nor did he know whether the information provided could reasonably support the view expressed in the certificate.", "15. The matter first came before the Fair Employment Tribunal on 3 June 1994. On that occasion the Tribunal declared that the certificate presented did not affect the applicability of the Fair Employment Acts to the dismissal of the applicant by Moyola Cellars Limited, since the certificate referred to an act done by the Hastings Hotel Group.", "16. At a resumed hearing on 5 January 1995 the Fair Employment Tribunal were presented with a new certificate signed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and certifying that the decision by Moyola Cellars Limited to terminate its contract of employment with the applicant was for the purpose of protecting public safety and public order. In light of the certificate, the Fair Employment Tribunal found that the Fair Employment Act did not apply to the termination of the applicant\u2019s contract, nor to the decision summarily to terminate the contract and accordingly that:", "\u201cthere is nothing for this Tribunal to consider in relation to that act [of termination].\u201d", "The tribunal dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaints in relation to his dismissal and the manner of his dismissal.", "17.
