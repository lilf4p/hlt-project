The applicants, both wheelchair-bound and having firstdegree disability status, repeatedly requested social-security services to provide them with a car adapted to their disability. Their numerous complaints in this respect to the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office, Members of the State Duma, and Administration of the President of the Russian Federation proved unsuccessful. As it was mentioned in the authorities\u2019 letters to the applicants, according to the medical expert report ordered by the social-security services, the first applicant was not entitled to a free car and driving was contra-indicated in respect of the second applicant.", "7. On 18 November 2003 the applicants, apparently assisted by counsel, lodged a claim against the Ministry of Labour challenging the refusal to provide them with a car and claiming compensation for non-pecuniary damage.", "8.

According to the applicants, they did not receive the summons.", "11. On 14 May 2004 the district court, having heard the defendant\u2019s representatives, rejected their claim because the applicants had lodged it against a wrong defendant. The court established that the social welfare services did not belong to the Ministry of Labour and that the latter did not have power to review their decisions. The applicants were absent from the hearing. The court found, with reference to the acknowledgment-of-receipt card, that they had been duly summoned and examined the case in their absence. The representative of the respondent authority was present.", "12. On 30 June 2004 the applicants\u2019 representative received a copy of the judgment of 14 May 2004.", "13.

The court examined the case in the applicants\u2019 absence, having mentioned that they had been notified of the appeal hearing. As regards the applicants\u2019 complaint about their absence from the hearing at the first instance court, the appeal court found that they had been properly summoned.

On 4 February 2009 Ms Stakhiyeva, the first applicant\u2019s representative before the Court, requested the district court to grant her access to the case file concerning the applicants\u2019 civil proceedings.", "22.

On 5 February 2009 the President of the district court refused to examine the representative\u2019s oral complaint in this respect, apparently having provided no reasons for the decision.
