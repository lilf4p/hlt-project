On 10 December 1992 the applicant lodged an appeal against the decision. However, on 9 August 1993 the Rent and Tenancy Court of Appeal (Bostadsdomstolen) rejected the appeal. The court\u2019s decision was not open to further appeal.", "In the meantime, on 28 January 1993, the applicant had instituted proceedings before the District Court (tingsr\u00e4tten) of Solna against his landlord, claiming that the negotiated agreement fixing the rent for 1991 for his flat in Sundbyberg should be declared null and void, or modified, in accordance with certain provisions of the Contracts Act (avtalslagen). Furthermore, he claimed damages to compensate him for the work he had undertaken in order to obtain information about the negotiated agreement. Some parts of the summons application were left unspecified.", "On 29 January 1993 the District Court requested the applicant to complete the summons application.

The court rejected his complaints against counsel for the landlord. Furthermore, the court noted that it was not within its competence to examine how an individual judge had evaluated evidence. Finally, the court noted that it was not possible to examine the question of litigation costs in the superior courts at that stage of the proceedings since the issue was to be decided in connection with the determination of the case.", "On 6 September 1995 the applicant lodged an appeal against the decision concerning the request for dismissal of counsel for the landlord.

Relevant domestic law", "According to the Rent Bargaining Act negotiations regarding conditions for the renting of a flat are conducted between a landlord or a landlord and an organisation of apartment building owners on the one side and an organisation of tenants on the other. If a lease contains a so-called negotiation clause, this means that the tenant has accepted the dispositions concerning the rent and other conditions that may follow from an agreement negotiated by the just-mentioned parties. This does not, however, entail any restrictions on the right of the tenant to request an assessment of the tenancy conditions by the Regional Rent Tribunal. The size of the rent, when disputed, shall then be established at a reasonable amount. For this purpose the rent is not to be deemed fair if it is obviously higher than the rent for flats of equivalent utility value. A decision whereby tenancy conditions are amended by a tribunal supersedes the negotiated agreement in that respect.", "According to the 1973 Regional Tenancies and Regional Rent Tribunals Act (lagen om arrenden\u00e4mnder och hyresn\u00e4mnder) the tribunals shall examine disputes concerning, inter alia, rents under the Rent Bargaining Act.

Section 30 concerns the invalidity as a result of fraudulent deception. Section 31 deals with the situation where a person\u2019s distressed circumstances, lack of mental capacity, etc., have been exploited by means of fraudulent practices. From such practices follow that the legal act is not binding on the exploited person.
