Unfortunately, the civil damages are still far from being paid, as I have not even had enough funds to make a down-payment.

On 29 October 2003 a psychologist issued a certificate (confirmed on 25 November 2003 by a second psychologist) stating that the applicant had begun a course of psychotherapy on 19 May 1999 which had been discontinued on 30 September 2002 for reasons beyond his control.

[is] refused in view of the risk of deportation (an application was made to the Ministry of Justice on 25 June 2003, but no decision has yet been taken). There is also a risk that the prisoner might abscond, given that he has failed to reflect on his crime. Before being allowed any privileges he must begin to pay the civil party.\u201d", "19. On 17 January 2004 the applicant reiterated his request, stating that the reasons and the itinerary for the day\u2019s prison leave remained the same. On 27 January 2004 his lawyer submitted arguments in support of the applicant\u2019s request and concluded as follows:", "\u201c... granting [the applicant] a day\u2019s prison leave during which he could begin to put his affairs in order with a view to leading an independent life [outside] prison, [would] not only aid [the applicant\u2019s] rehabilitation and reintegration into society, but [would] also enable him to start paying compensation to the civil party as quickly as possible. ...\u201d", "20. On 17 March 2004 the Attorney General\u2019s representative sent a memorandum to the prison governor containing the following passages:", "\u201c... please inform the prisoner Thomas Boulois", "that by decision of the Prison Board", "the decision of 5 November 2003 refusing his request for prison leave ... remains valid.\u201d", "21.

On 23 December 2004 the Administrative Court ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to examine the application for judicial review, for the following reasons:", "\u201c... A distinction must be made between administrative measures relating to the treatment of prisoners in prison (such as a decision to place them in a more secure part of the prison, and in particular imposing a strict confinement regime \u2013 see Administrative Court ruling no. 14568 of 10 July 2002), which are taken in the context of enforcement by the prison service, and decisions which may alter the nature or scope of a sentence handed down by the ordinary courts, which are to be classified as judicial rather than administrative decisions.", "In the instant case it must be acknowledged that the granting or refusal of the privilege of prison leave constitutes a measure which alters the \u2018scope\u2019 of the sentence imposed on the applicant by the ordinary court.", "Hence, the two decisions in question are judicial in nature.", "Accordingly, bearing in mind their nature as identified above, the impugned decisions cannot be the subject of an application to the administrative courts... .\u201d", "24. On 14 April 2005 the Higher Administrative Court (cour administrative) upheld this ruling, as follows:", "\u201cThe [applicant] submitted that the court erred in finding that it did not have jurisdiction to examine his application for judicial review, arguing that: no other remedy existed in respect of such refusal, with the result that section 2(1) of the Law of 7 November 1996 on the organisation of the administrative courts should be applied; the impugned decisions did not alter the scope of the sentence; the court had denied him justice in breach of Article [6 \u00a7 1] of the [Convention] by depriving him of a fair hearing.", "... The [applicant]\u2019s case concerns a request for prison leave, in other words, a decision which alters the nature of the execution of the sentence handed down by the ordinary courts and which should therefore be classified as a judicial rather than an administrative decision.", "The expression \u2018the scope of the sentence imposed\u2019, used by the court, is not to be understood in the present case as the length of the sentence but as the manner of its execution in a broad sense.", "The administrative court was therefore correct in ruling that it did not have jurisdiction to examine the application.", "A finding by the administrative courts that they lack jurisdiction cannot be construed as a declaration of unwillingness on their part to rule on the issue; the allegation of a denial of justice should therefore be dismissed as unfounded.", "Article [6 \u00a7 1] of the [Convention] is not applicable in relation to a body which has no power to rule on the merits. ...\u201d", "25. On 11 August 2004 the applicant submitted a third request for prison leave, in the following terms:", "\u201c... I have successfully attended several courses run by the CEP-L [Chamber of Commerce] and would like to continue with a view to obtaining the corresponding diplomas.", "The diplomas concerned are in accounting and computer (PC) use.

In a decision of 21 September 2004 the request was refused on the ground that the applicant could attend courses in prison and that he had made no substantial efforts to date towards paying compensation to the victim. The decision also referred to the reasoning of the decision of 5 November 2003.", "27. In a fourth request, submitted on 24 February 2005, the applicant observed, among other things, that he could not understand why, in view of the need for him to reintegrate into society, he had been refused permission to attend the final classes required in order to obtain the diplomas in accounting and computing. He added that the reason he had requested prison leave was to renew his identity papers and driving licence and make arrangements for the repayment of his debts to the various institutions and the civil party.", "28. On 23 March 2005 his request was refused for failure to give reasons.", "29. On 12 July 2005 a fifth request for prison leave (not provided to the Court) was refused on the ground that there was a risk that the applicant would not return to prison.", "30. On 4 May 2006 a sixth request for prison leave (not provided to the Court) was refused on the ground that the applicant had been making no efforts, in particular with regard to paying the civil damages, and was refusing to abide by the conditions imposed on him.", "31. Following the refusal of this request, the applicant applied to the Attorney General\u2019s Department on five occasions between 10 May and 29 October 2006. He requested assistance in putting in place a repayment plan appropriate to his circumstances and the demands of the civil party, and sought an explanation of the requirements he was expected to meet with a view to his reintegration in society, so that he could take steps to comply with them. On 6 November 2006 the Attorney General\u2019s representative decided that he would not, as matters stood, reply to the various letters, which did not call for any comment.", "32. On 20 November 2006 the Attorney General acknowledged receipt of a request from the applicant for an interview and said that he would meet him during one of his forthcoming visits to the prison. The applicant claimed that the meeting had never taken place.", "33.

In the explanatory memorandum to the draft of the 1986 Law, the purpose of the legislation is explained as follows:", "\u201c... the time seems right to provide a sound legal basis for arrangements for the execution of custodial sentences which, within certain limits, allow convicted prisoners to make trips outside prison or to serve their sentence in instalments, so that they can maintain or resume social and professional contacts. Since sentencing lost its expiatory character and took on an essentially sociological role with a neartherapeutic aspect, the efforts of the authorities responsible for the execution of sentences have been directed mainly at the social rehabilitation of prisoners and at helping them settle or resettle in a stable social environment. In striving to achieve this, it is important in particular to ensure that prisoners can maintain their family and social ties, where such exist, and to prepare them for release by enabling them, possibly by means of preparations for an occupation or profession, to find work and adapt to responsible life outside prison. ...\u201d", "36. Section 6 of the 1986 Law defines prison leave as follows:", "\u201cPrison leave shall consist of permission to leave prison either for part of the day or for periods of twenty-four hours. The time shall count towards the length of the sentence.\u201d", "37.

Section 8 of the 1986 Law provides that prison leave may be granted to prisoners convicted of a first offence once a third of their sentence has been served.", "39. Under Section 13, consideration must be given to the personality of the prisoner, his or her progress and the risk of a repeat offence.", "40. Under the terms of the Grand-Ducal Regulation of 19 January 1989 laying down the arrangements for the granting of prison leave, such leave may be granted at the request of the prisoner concerned or his or her representative (Article 4); the request must be made in writing, unless the prisoner is incapacitated or unable to write. The interval between periods of leave must be at least one month, except in special circumstances (Article 5). Where a request for prison leave is refused, no new request may be made within two months, unless new evidence comes to light (Article 6).", "41. Section 12 of the 1986 Law states:", "\u201cIn the case of custodial sentences of over two years ... the measures provided for by this Law ... shall be taken by the Attorney General or his or her representative in accordance with a majority decision of a board comprising, in addition to the Attorney General or his or her representative, a judge and a public prosecutor. ...", "The board shall be convened by the Attorney General or his or her representative and shall be chaired by the judge.", "With the exception of the Attorney General or his or her representative, the full members and their substitutes shall be appointed by ministerial order for a renewable three-year term.\u201d", "42.
