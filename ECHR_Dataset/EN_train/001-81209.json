The association was founded on 19 December 1996 in Plovdiv. At a meeting on that date the founders adopted its articles and elected its management bodies. The applicant was elected as its chairman.", "8. The association's articles read, as relevant:", "\u201c1. [The association] is a Bulgarian patriotic nonprofit organisation. It shall be DEMOCRATIC in form and NATIONAL in content.", "OBJECT: mass, historically and morally enlightening, societal and political, cultural and educational, scientific and research, sport and technical, publishing, advertising, charitable and all other types of activities and services which are allowed (not prohibited) under the [Persons and Family Act of 1949] in respect of nonprofit associations.", "2. [The association] is founded with the aims of: uplifting the Bulgarian spirit; protecting the Bulgarian interests and creating a wealthy, prosperous and patriotic nation; elevating, developing and preserving the Bulgarian national dignity; uniting the Bulgarian identity within and outside the boundaries of the promised Bulgarian land, under the flag of historical truth; protecting and restoring the coat of arms of the Bulgarian Kingdom as a coat of arms of Bulgaria.", "3. [The association] is for the creation of a people's court to judge those responsible for the gravest economic, spiritual, moral and demographic crisis of the Bulgarian society, Bulgarian banking and Bulgarian statehood since 9 September 1944, in particular the period 1994, 1995, 1996 and the following years. ...", "4. [The association] is for a wide discussion ... of the illegal trampling and repealing of our first constitution after our liberation in 1878, the most democratic Constitution of Tarnovo and the imposition of the present [Constitution]...", "[The association] is for the reinstatement (possibly with amendments) of the unlawfully abolished 'CONSTITUTION OF TARNOVO'...", "[The association] is for ... changing the form of government of Bulgaria, for the returning of H.M. KING SIMEON II to the motherland and the throne. ...", "8. ... The core of the [association's] activity shall be the spiritual unification of all Bulgarians, contacts with and consolidation of the Bulgarian Diaspora, establishment of sincere relations with ... all Bulgarians outside Bulgaria, and, in the international relations \u2013 point one shall be: abolition (opening) of the border between Bulgaria and Macedonia...\u201d", "9. On an unspecified later date the association submitted to the Plovdiv Regional Court an application for registration.", "10. The Plovdiv Regional Court refused the application in a judgment of 6 June 1997. It held:", "\u201c[According to] clause 2 of [its articles], [the association] intends to protect and restore the coat of arms of the Bulgarian Kingdom as a coat of arms of Bulgaria. According to clause 3 of the articles, the association is for the establishment of a 'people's court to judge those responsible for the gravest economic, spiritual, moral and demographic crisis of the Bulgarian society, Bulgarian banking and Bulgarian statehood since 9 September 1944, in particular the period 1994, 1995, 1996 and the following years'. Clause 4 of the articles provides for a debate on the repealing of the Constitution of Tarnovo and the adoption of the [C]onstitution [of 1991] which is presently in force.", "The goals which have been enumerated thus far are sufficient to refuse the association's registration. They are clearly political in nature and are characteristic of a political party, whose registration is to be carried out under the Political Parties Act [of 1990].\u201d", "11. The applicant, acting in his capacity of chairman of the association, appealed to the Supreme Court of Cassation. He argued, inter alia, that the association's aims were not political, but goals which could be pursued by every citizen.", "12. Following an amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure of 1952 providing that the judgments of the regional courts were no longer appealable before the Supreme Court of Cassation, but before the newly established courts of appeals, on 1 April 1998 the Supreme Court of Cassation forwarded the applicant's appeal to the newly created Plovdiv Court of Appeals.", "13. On 10 March 1999 the Plovdiv Court of Appeals upheld the lower court's judgment. It held as follows:", "\u201cThe articles of [the association] contain provisions which are contrary to the ... Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria. For instance, clause 2 of the articles provides for the restoration of the coat of arms of the Bulgarian Kingdom as the country's coat of arms. Clause 4 provides for a change of the form of government from republic to monarchy and for the restoration of the Constitution of Tarnovo [of 1879]. Clause 8 of the articles \u2013 abolition of the border between Bulgaria and [the former Yugoslav Republic of] Macedonia. These goals, as formulated in the above-cited clauses, run counter to Articles 1, 2 \u00a7 2 and 164 of the Constitution. Moreover, the association indeed has political goals, whereas by Article 12 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution associations may not pursue political goals and carry out political activities that are characteristic solely of political parties.\u201d", "14. The applicant appealed on points of law to the Supreme Court of Cassation. He argued that the lower court had incorrectly held that the association's aims were contrary to the Constitution. Furthermore, the association did not pursue political aims, because it was not aspiring to accede to power. The courts' refusal to register it was an infringement of its founders' freedom of expression.", "15. On 17 May 1999 the Supreme Court of Cassation directed the applicant to specify the grounds on which he sought the quashing of the judgment below. In line with these instructions, the applicant submitted additional observations. He reiterated his contention that the association's aims were not political, because it was not seeking to accede to power through elections or otherwise, or exercise it. Its aims were characteristic of the civil society and were to be achieved through other, nonpolitical means. Furthermore, the association's articles did not provide for the creation of a people's court, it did not in fact object to the new coat of arms of Bulgaria and was not seeking to change the form of government from republic to monarchy. These were erroneous findings of the lower court. Finally, the association was seeking to achieve the spiritual union of all Bulgarians, not the abolition of the border between Bulgaria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.", "16. On 11 October 1999 the Supreme Court of Cassation upheld the Plovdiv Court of Appeals' judgment in the following terms:", "\u201cThe [lower court] correctly found that the goals set out in clauses 2, 3 and 4 of the association's articles have a certain political tenor and are characteristic of a political party, whose registration is to be carried out under the Political Parties Act [of 1990]. These goals are contrary to Articles 1, 2 \u00a7 2 and 12 \u00a7 2 [of the Constitution of 1991].\u201d", "17. The relevant provisions of the Constitution of 1991 read as follows:", "\u201cBulgaria is a republic with a parliamentary form of government.\u201d", "\u201cThe territorial integrity of the Republic of Bulgaria shall be inviolable.\u201d", "\u201c...", "3. Parties shall facilitate the formation of the citizens' political will.

No political parties shall be formed on ethnic, racial, or religious basis, nor parties which seek to accede to power by force.\u201d", "\u201c1. The citizens' associations shall serve to further and safeguard their interests.", "2. Associations ... may not pursue political goals or carry out political activities that are characteristic solely of political parties.\u201d", "\u201c1. Citizens may freely associate.", "2. Organisations whose activity is directed against the sovereignty [or] the territorial integrity of the country and the unity of the nation, towards the incitement of racial, national, ethnical or religious enmity ... as well as organisations which seek to achieve their goals through violence are prohibited.", "3. The law shall specify the organisations which are subject to registration, the manner of their dissolution, as well as their relations with the State.\u201d", "\u201cThe Coat of Arms of the Republic of Bulgaria shall depict a gold lion rampant on a dark gules shield.\u201d", "18.
