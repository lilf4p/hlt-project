The judgment was not appealed against and it became final and enforceable.", "13. The applicant was issued with a writ of execution which he submitted to the court bailiffs\u2019 service. On 26 April 2001 a bailiff of the 2nd Interdistrict Court Bailiffs\u2019 Service of the Central Administrative District of Moscow refused to accept the writ because the law on budget for the year 2001 and the implementing Government regulation, introduced in December 2000, established that writs against the Treasury were to be submitted directly to the Federal Treasury.", "14.
