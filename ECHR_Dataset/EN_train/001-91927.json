The trial ended on 24 February 2000. The applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to 11 years\u2019 imprisonment.

Article 80 of the Code lays down the principle known as \u201ccompulsory assistance of an advocate\u201d (przymus adwokacki). That Article provides, in so far as relevant:", "\u201cAn accused must have an officially appointed lawyer when a Regional Court is competent to deal with his case as a court of first instance, a crime is involved within the meaning of the Criminal Code, or the individual is remanded in custody.
