On 31 August 1994 the applicant was arrested. On 2 September 1994 the Rybnik District Prosecutor, W., remanded him in custody on suspicion of theft of a car.", "7. The applicant appealed to the Katowice Regional Court. On 12 September 1994 the court dismissed the appeal, finding that there was sufficient evidence to establish that the applicant might have committed the offence concerned and the reasons for which the applicant had been remanded in custody had not ceased to exist.", "8. On 21 September 1994 the Rybnik District Public Prosecutor prolonged the applicant's detention until 30 November 1994, considering that the evidence gathered in the course of investigations strongly indicated that the applicant had committed the offence in question. An expert opinion had still to be taken.", "9. On 10 October 1994 the Katowice Regional Court dismissed the applicant's appeal against this decision, considering that the evidence strongly indicated that the applicant had committed the offence in question. Further time-consuming evidence still had to be taken, which justified the prolongation of the detention.", "10. On 24 October 1994 the Rybnik District Public Prosecutor refused to release the applicant, considering that the investigations had not been completed, further forensic evidence had to be taken and the reasons for which the detention had originally been decided had not ceased to exist.", "11. On 2 November 1994 the applicant wrote a letter to the Ombudsman, complaining about alleged irregularities in the criminal proceedings against him and about having allegedly been assaulted by the police on his arrest. The prison authorities forwarded this letter to the Rybnik District Prosecutor. On 23 November 1994 the Rybnik District Prosecutor informed the applicant that the letter to the Ombudsman had been forwarded to the Tychy District Public Prosecutor, for the purpose of investigating the alleged assault. It was later forwarded to the Ombudsman. The letter reached the Ombudsman's office on 27 December 1994 and was registered there under file number RPO 174886/94/II. On 28 November 1994 the applicant sent a further letter to the Ombudsman.", "12. On 15 November 1994 the Katowice Regional Prosecutor dismissed the applicant's appeal against the decision of 24 October 1994. The Prosecutor considered that the evidence strongly indicated that the applicant had committed the offence in question. The reasons for which the detention had been ordered had not ceased to exist. The investigations should be continued and this required that the applicant should remain in detention.", "13. On 9 March 1995 the applicant filed a request with the Katowice Regional Court to have the lawfulness of his detention reviewed as provided for by Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the European Convention of Human Rights. This request remained unanswered.", "14. On 20 March 1995 the Katowice Regional Court convicted the applicant of possessing stolen goods and ordered that he be released from detention on remand.

On 21 April 1995 the applicant was rearrested and the Racib\u00f3rz District Public Prosecutor decided to put the applicant in detention on remand on suspicion of attempted theft of a car on 20 April 1995. The applicant appealed to the Racib\u00f3rz District Court, invoking, inter alia, Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. On 27 April 1995 the court dismissed the appeal, considering that the detention on remand had been ordered in accordance with the law. Article 210 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that it is the Public Prosecutor who is competent to decide on detention on remand.", "16. On 12 June 1995, in reply to the applicant's letter of 2 November 1994, the Ombudsman informed the applicant that the ratification of the Convention did not automatically entail the derogation of the provisions of Polish law relating to the authorities competent to decide on deprivation of liberty. Thus the courts and prosecutors were still obliged to apply domestic law currently in force in this respect. The relevant amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure had already been adopted by Parliament, but they had not yet entered into force. Current public debate about the possible direct applicability of the Convention in the domestic legal order was of a purely theoretical nature. The decisions concerning the applicant's detention were therefore in accordance with the law.", "17. On 5 September 1995 the Katowice Court of Appeal amended the impugned judgment of 20 March 1995 in that it found the applicant guilty of aiding and abetting the sale of stolen goods and sentenced him to two years and six months' imprisonment and a fine.", "18.

A decision concerning preventive measures may be appealed [to a higher court] ....", "2. A prosecutor's order on detention on remand may be appealed to the court competent to deal with the merits of the case....\"", "19. These provisions were amended on 29 June 1995 by the Law of 29 June 1995 on Amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure and Other Criminal Statutes, which entered into force on 4 August 1996. Pursuant to this amendment, detention on remand could be imposed only by a court order.", "20. A new Code of Criminal Procedure was enacted by the Sejm (Parliament) on 6 June 1997. Its Article 250, in its relevant part, reads:", "\u201c1. Detention on remand shall be imposed by a court order.", "2.

The prosecutor, when submitting to a court a request referred to in \u00a7 2, shall at the same time order that the suspect be brought before a court.\"", "21.

The court shall inform the lawyer of a detained person of the date and time of court sessions at which a decision is to be taken concerning prolongation of detention on remand, or an appeal against a decision to impose or to prolong detention on remand is to be considered.", "24.

Article 1 of the Act laid down the principle of the separation of powers in the following terms:", "\"The legislative power of the State shall be vested in the Sejm and the Senate of the Republic of Poland; the executive power shall be vested in the President of Poland and the Council of Ministers; and judicial power shall be vested in the independent courts.\"", "25.

Pursuant to Article 8 of the Act, a prosecutor is independent in carrying out his or her duties, within the limits set out in this Article. A prosecutor shall abide by the instructions, guidelines and orders of his superiors. However, if an order relates to the substance of any action to be taken in proceedings, a prosecutor may request [his superior] to issue the order concerned with reasons in writing, to alter the order, to relieve him from performing an act prescribed by that order, or to remove him from conducting the case in question. The requests to be removed from a case shall be decided by a hierarchical superior of the prosecutor who issued the order.\"", "30. Chapter III of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1969, applicable at the material time, entitled \"Parties to proceedings, defence counsel, representatives of victims and representatives of society\", described a prosecutor as a party to criminal proceedings. According to all the relevant provisions of the Code read together, a prosecutor performed investigative and prosecuting functions in the course of criminal proceedings.

The Ombudsman may undertake measures provided for by law if he receives information from which it transpires that human rights have been breached. Pursuant to Article 13 of the Act, he is competent to investigate individual complaints. When investigating such complaints he may, inter alia, demand that the judicial, prosecuting and administrative authorities submit to him information about a concrete individual case.

The Ombudsman's actions must be compatible with the principle of the independence of the judiciary. He may also inform a superior authority of his findings and request that appropriate measures provided for by law be taken in respect of the person whose actions amounted to a violation of human rights.", "33. At the relevant time the situation of persons detained on remand was governed by the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences of 19 April 1969. Under Article 89 of that Code, all correspondence of a person detained on remand was subject to censorship, unless a prosecutor and a court decided otherwise. No provision of the Code provided for any remedy to contest the manner or scope of the censorship of a detainee\u2019s correspondence.", "34. The rights of persons detained on remand as regards their correspondence were further set out in Rule 33 of the Rules on Detention on Remand, adopted in 1989.
