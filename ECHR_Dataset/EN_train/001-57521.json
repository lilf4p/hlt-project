The case of Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\"the Commission\") and the Government of the Kingdom of Belgium (\"the Government\") on 14 March and 23 April 1980, respectively. The case originated in two applications (nos. 6878/75 and 7238/75) against that State introduced in 1974 and 1975 by three Belgian nationals, Dr. Herman Le Compte, Dr. Frans Van Leuven and Dr. Marc De Meyere.", "2. On 1 October 1980, the Chamber constituted to examine the case relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the plenary Court (Rule 48 of the Rules of Court). By a judgment of 23 June 1981, the latter held that there had been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention in that the applicants\u2019 case had not been heard publicly by a tribunal competent to determine all the aspects of the matter. It found, on the other hand, that there had been no violation of that Article (art. 6-1) as regards the applicants\u2019 other complaints, and no violation of Article 11 (art. 11) (Series A no. 43, points 2 and 3 of the operative provisions and paragraphs 54-66 of the reasons, pp. 24-28).", "The only outstanding matter to be settled is the question of the application of Article 50 (art. 50) in the present case.

At the hearings of 25 November 1980, the applicants\u2019 lawyer had asked the Court, in the event of its finding a breach of the Convention, to afford his clients just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50). He had, however, stated that he was not yet in a position \"to establish the exact amount of any damages, in view of the possibility of compensation, if only partial, being granted under Belgian law\".", "In its judgment of 23 June 1981, the Court reserved the whole of the question of the application of Article 50 (art. 50) and referred it back to the Chamber under Rule 50 \u00a7 4 of the Rules of Court. On the same day, the Chamber invited the Commission to submit, within the next two months, its written observations on the said question, including notification of any friendly settlement at which the Government and the applicants might have arrived (ibid., p. 45).", "4.
