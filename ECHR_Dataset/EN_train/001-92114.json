At the material time the applicant, Mr Khanpasha Dzhabrailov, his wife and their three children lived at 24 Shamov Street, Goyty village.", "9. The account below is based on eyewitness statements of the applicant and her daughter, Ms Raisa Dzhabrailova.", "10. According to the applicant, the village of Goyty was under the federal forces\u2019 control from December 1999. The road leading to and from the village was blocked by federal checkpoints.", "11.

Around twenty armed men in masks and camouflage uniforms got out of the vehicles; the applicant believed that they belonged to the Russian military because they spoke unaccented Russian and could move freely around the village during the curfew.", "12. Around ten servicemen entered the house, woke the Dzhabrailovs and, threatening them with their machine guns, forced them to the floor. Then they seized Mr Khanpasha Dzhabrailov\u2019s badge of an employee of a local human rights NGO, grabbed the young man and dragged him to the door. When the applicant and her daughter-in-law asked them where they intended to take Mr Khanpasha Dzhabrailov, the servicemen gave no clear answer but shouted at the women, using mostly swear words.

According to the applicant, at some point she and her daughter spoke to an official of the district prosecutor\u2019s office, who had allegedly said to them that Mr Khanpasha Dzhabrailov had confessed that he had been a participant in illegal armed groups. In the Government\u2019s submission, in the criminal investigation file there was a police report, rather than Mr Khanpasha Dzhabrailov\u2019s confession, stating that the applicant\u2019s son had been a member of illegal armed groups and participated in operations under command of Salman Raduyev, one of the Chechen field commanders. According to the Government, however, this information had not been confirmed during the investigation.", "30.

It does not appear that the applicant has ever been declared a victim in the case.", "34. The Government also submitted that the investigating authorities sent enquiries to law-enforcement bodies in the Chechen Republic and further in the Northern Caucasus. According to the replies received by the investigators, no criminal proceedings had ever been brought against Mr Khanpasha Dzhabrailov, he had not been arrested by any of those lawenforcement agencies, nor kept in any detention centres, there was no information as to whether he had participated in illegal armed groups, he had not been found among unidentified corpses and had never applied for assistance to any medical institutions.

In September 2007, when the application was communicated to them, the Government were invited to produce a copy of the investigation file in criminal case no. 34051 opened in connection with the abduction of the applicant\u2019s son. The Government refused to submit any documents from the file, stating that under Article 161 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure disclosure of the documents was contrary to the interests of the investigation and could entail a breach of the rights of the participants in the criminal proceedings. They also submitted that they had taken into account the possibility of requesting confidentiality under Rule 33 of the Rules of Court, but noted that the Court provided no guarantees that once in receipt of the investigation file the applicant or her representatives would not disclose these materials to the public. According to the Government, in the absence of any sanctions in respect of the applicant for the disclosure of confidential information and materials, there were no guarantees concerning compliance by the applicant with the Convention and the Rules of Court.", "41. In December 2007 the Court reiterated its request. In reply, the Government again refused to produce any documents from the file for the aforementioned reasons.
