They are represented before the Court by Mr M. Vefa and Mr B. Deyar, lawyers practising in Diyarbak\u0131r.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "Until May 1994, the applicants lived in Dolapdere village in Silvan, Diyarbak\u0131r, where they own property. Sometime in late 1993, Dolapdere inhabitants started to refuse to serve as village guards \u2013 a security system designed to protect villages against possible terrorist attacks by the PKK militants. Upon their continued refusal, the security forces evacuated the hamlet.", "The applicants had to move to the city centre of Diyarbak\u0131r, where they currently live. On 18 May 1994 the security forces set fire to the houses and the cultivated fields in the village.", "Following the incidents, the applicants filed applications with the administrative and military authorities, asking for an authorization to return to their hamlet, or in the alternative, to continue to cultivate their fields.

The applicants maintained that they were unable to provide copies of the complaints and requests they had filed but stated that the authorities had either disregarded or rejected them.", "The investigation carried out by the authorities indicated that the applicants had left their villages of their own will. The security forces had not destroyed the applicants\u2019 village or forced them to leave their homes.", "The official records indicated that there was no obstacle preventing villagers from returning to their homes and possessions in their villages.
