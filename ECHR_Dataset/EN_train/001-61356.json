The District Court further dismissed the claim for compensation concerning the applicant\u2019s second proposal.", "14. The defendant appealed on 6 March 1995, and on 13 July 1995 the Nitra branch office of the Bratislava Regional Court quashed the first instance judgment to the extent that it had allowed the applicant\u2019s claim for his proposal to be given priority.

It found no particular delays in the proceedings which should be imputed to the applicant and held that the District Court had failed to proceed with the case in an effective manner as required by the relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. The decision stated, in particular, that there had been shortcomings in the judge\u2019s work which had caused excessive delays in the proceedings.", "20. On 30 June 1997 the appellate court adjourned the case as the applicant had challenged its judges dealing with the case. On 27 October 1997 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s request for exclusion of the judges.", "21. On 20 January 1998 the Nitra Regional Court upheld the District Court\u2019s finding that the applicant was not entitled to compensation for the proposal in question as it was neither genuine nor did it resolve the technical problem in question as required by the relevant law. The Regional Court further discontinued the proceedings as regards the applicant\u2019s claim that his proposal should be given priority as it was outside the courts\u2019 jurisdiction. Finally, the Regional Court upheld the District Court\u2019s decision on the expert\u2019s fees and decided that the District Court judge involved was not biased. The Regional Court\u2019s judgment was served on the applicant on 4 August 1998."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
