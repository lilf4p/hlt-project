At the time of the events giving rise to the application, Hyde Park (the first applicant) was registered with the Moldovan Ministry of Justice as a non-governmental organisation lobbying, inter alia, for freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly. In 2007 its members decided to discontinue the organisation\u2019s registration on grounds of alleged pressure and intimidation by the State. In particular, they complained of the refusal of the Ministry of Justice to register amendments to the organisation\u2019s articles of association, the repeated freezing of its bank account, the arbitrary arrest of its members, attempts to shut down its newspaper, among other things. Several of the organisation\u2019s leaders requested political asylum in western countries. It was decided to continue the organisation\u2019s activity under the same name but without registering it with the State authorities. It was also decided that the new unincorporated association would become the former organisation\u2019s successor. After removal of the organisation from the Government\u2019s list of non-governmental organisations on 2 June 2008, Hyde Park\u2019s activities continued as before on the basis of its new articles of association. The association continued editing its newspaper, its Internet page and continued staging protests and demonstrations.", "6. The other applicants are members and supporters of Hyde Park: Gheorghe Lupu\u015foru, Anatol Hristea-Stan, Mariana G\u0103lescu, Alina Didilic\u0103 and Oleg Brega who were born in 1969, 1953, 1982, 1978 and 1973 respectively and live in Chi\u015fin\u0103u, Chi\u015fin\u0103u, Chi\u015fin\u0103u, Cazangic and Pepeni respectively.", "7. On 6 December 2004 Hyde Park applied to the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Municipal Council for authorisation to hold a peaceful meeting in front of the Romanian Embassy on 5 January 2005, to protest against the policy of Romania in respect of Moldovan students. The application was signed by Hyde Park\u2019s president and stated, inter alia, that:", "\u201cBy the present [application] we seek permission from the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Municipality to hold a public gathering on 5 January 2005 in Chi\u015fin\u0103u.", "The members and the supporters of Hyde Park who study in Romania or who have relatives studying there are not content with the manner in which they are treated by the Romanian authorities. Therefore we intend to protest with them and on their behalf in front of the Romanian Embassy, between 11 a.m and 2 p.m. in front of the entrance on Bucharest street.", "We undertake to respect public order and not to block traffic.\u201d", "8. On 30 December 2004 the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Municipal Council rejected the application on the ground that:", "\u201cThe municipal police considered the applicants\u2019 protest to be unfounded and unwelcome because it was the Government of Romania which financed the studies of Moldovan students in Romania and therefore the Romanian authorities were competent to take a decision in respect of the applicants\u2019 application [of 6 December 2004]\u201d.", "9. On 3 January 2005 the first applicant challenged the refusal in court and argued, inter alia, that it was unlawful. It also argued that the Municipal Council had protracted the examination of their application until the last day of the year so as not to leave it enough time to challenge the refusal in the courts. It asked that the case be examined urgently. The applicant explained that many persons who had expressed their wish to participate in the demonstration were students in Romania and were at home, in Chi\u015fin\u0103u, only for the winter break.", "10. On 21 February 2005 the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Court of Appeal dismissed the applicants\u2019 action, finding that the Municipal Council had acted within its competence. The court observed that the police, the Prosecutor\u2019s Office and the Secret Service had obtained information that the applicants intended to breach the provisions of sections 6 and 7 of the Assemblies Act.", "11. Hyde Park appealed against this judgment and argued that the judgment had breached the right of its members to hold peaceful meetings in public places. It also argued that no evidence had been presented to support the view that the holding of the demonstration would have given rise to an infringement of sections 6 and 7 of the Assemblies Act.", "12. On 8 June 2005 the Supreme Court of Justice upheld the appeal, quashed the judgment of the first-instance court and ordered a re-examination of the case. The Supreme Court found that there was no evidence that the applicants intended to breach sections 6 and 7 of the Assemblies Act.", "13. On 6 October 2005 the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Court of Appeal again dismissed the action on the basis that the holding of a protest meeting in front of the Romanian Embassy could have prejudiced the image of the Moldovan State and of the Moldovan people. Moreover, the decision to hold a protest meeting had not been adopted by the council of Hyde Park, as required by its statutes. Additionally, the Hyde Park statutes did not contain, in its list of activities, provisions sanctioning actions such as holding protest meetings. The first applicant appealed.", "14. On 14 December 2005 the Supreme Court of Justice dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal on points of law, on the ground that the holding of a demonstration in front of the Romanian Embassy could have prejudiced the image of the Moldovan State and of the Moldovan people.", "15.
