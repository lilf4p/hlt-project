The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in the town of Beloyarskiy in the Tyumen Region.", "6. On 8 June 2001 the applicant\u2019s son, Mr Valeriy Putintsev, was called up for two years of mandatory military service. He was assigned to serve in military unit no. 39982 in the town of Uzhur.", "7. On the evening of 9 February 2002 Mr Putintsev left the military unit without permission. Three days later he was arrested in a local village and his detention for ten days on a charge of absence without leave was authorised. He was placed in a disciplinary cell at the Uzhur Town Garrison.", "8. On 14 February 2002 junior sergeant L. took up convoy duty in the detention unit of the Uzhur Town Garrison. On the following day, on an order from the commandant of the garrison, junior sergeant L. attempted to search the applicant\u2019s son. Mr Putintsev headbutted the junior sergeant, hurting Mr L.\u2019s lip. Mr L. did not fight back. In view of the incident, the commandant ordered a medical examination of the applicant\u2019s son and junior sergeant L. While escorting the applicant\u2019s son from a military hospital back to the garrison\u2019s detention unit, Mr L., in an attempt to prevent the applicant\u2019s son from escaping, fired at him and wounded him in the right buttock. On the morning of 27 February 2002 the applicant\u2019s son died from the gunshot wound, which had caused injuries to internal organs and extensive bleeding.", "9. The commandant of the Uzhur Town Garrison immediately reported the shooting to the military prosecutor\u2019s office of military unit no. 56681. A criminal investigation was opened into the reported incident. On 15 February 2002, at 3.10 p.m., an acting assistant to the military prosecutor examined the scene of the incident. Junior sergeant L. participated as a witness. The record showed that the grounds adjacent to the military hospital were surrounded by a concrete fence. A road between the hospital building and the fence led to metal gates guarding the entrance to the hospital grounds. A used cartridge from an automatic gun was found on the road approximately twenty-five metres from the entrance gates. The plan of the scene drawn up by the investigator showed that the applicant\u2019s son had started running along the road towards the gates from thirty metres back. He had passed the gates without any attempt being made to stop him. The plan also indicated that junior sergeant L. had also passed the gates in pursuit of the applicant\u2019s son and, having run another seven metres beyond them, had stopped and shot Mr Putintsev. A blood stain measuring sixty by forty centimetres was discovered seventy-three metres from the place where Mr L. had started shooting, on the road between two fences separating the main grounds of the military unit and the grounds of the disciplinary division where the applicant had been detained. The plan also included a drawing of the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s path from the place where he had started running to the blood stain. According to the drawing, having passed the gates of the hospital grounds, he had been running towards the checkpoint of the main grounds of the military unit situated right across from the hospital gates and then, having turned, had sprinted along the road between the two fences.", "10. The investigator seized the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s uniform and underwear, having made photos of the clothes and a detailed description of the stains and damage to them. The photos showed a blood-soaked undershirt and winter underpants. The investigator also took possession of Mr L.\u2019s AK-74 automatic machine gun and the ammunition, including fifty-seven live cartridges and two used ones, collected by officer K. and other soldiers after the shooting.", "11. Several hours later Mr L. was interrogated as a witness. He described his dispute with the applicant\u2019s son which had caused him a lip injury and their subsequent visit to the military hospital for medical examinations. Junior sergeant L. insisted that on the way to the hospital officers had warned the applicant\u2019s son that he would be shot should he attempt to escape. That had not stopped the applicant\u2019s son from running away on their way back from the hospital. Mr L. stressed that despite his warning shouts and his firing two warning shots into the air, Mr Putinstev had continued running away, at the same time inviting Mr L. and accompanying officer K. to catch him. Mr L. had shot at the applicant\u2019s son once, aiming at his legs. Approximately seventy metres had separated the applicant\u2019s son from Mr L. at the moment of the shooting. At the same moment in time, officer K. had been approximately twenty metres away from the applicant\u2019s son, having continued to run after him. The applicant\u2019s son had fallen to the ground and officer K. had ordered Mr L. to call for an ambulance. After the applicant\u2019s son had been taken to hospital, officer K. had told Mr L. to collect the used cartridges. They had been able to recover two of them: one from the two warning shots and one from the target shot.", "12. A search for the bullet with which the applicant had been shot, including with the use of mine detectors, did not produce any results.", "13. On 16 February 2002 the investigator ordered a report from the military unit\u2019s psychologist to address the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s psychological condition preceding the incident. The psychologist indicated that during interviews the applicant\u2019s son had \u201chinted at the presence of hazing in the unit directed towards him by junior commanding officers (sergeants) [whose] last names he [had] not mentioned [and] [had] complained of the impossibility of establishing social contacts and friendly relationships within his military unit\u201d. At the same time, the psychologist described Mr Putintsev as a psychologically settled, stubborn and determined person, able to defend his opinion \u201cuntil the very end by any means\u201d. Having observed during an interview the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s breaking down and developing signs of depression, the psychologist recommended his transfer to another military unit without giving him access to firearms and placing him under psychological supervision in the new unit.", "14. In the days following the shooting the investigator interviewed the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s fellow soldiers, including those who had been on duty at the checkpoint of the military unit on 15 February 2002 and had witnessed the incident, personnel of the military hospital and the unit\u2019s commanding officers. The witnesses described Mr Putintsev as a calm, but unsociable, person and denied subjecting him or witnessing his being subjected to any form of harassment or ill-treatment. Certain witnesses had seen the applicant\u2019s son on the ground after the shooting with his hips and stomach covered in blood. Several of them had helped to transport him to the hospital.", "15. The commandant of the garrison stated that he had had a talk with the applicant\u2019s son following his unauthorised leave. Mr Putintsev had allegedly confided to him that he had had problems with fellow soldiers from the Caucasus but had refused to identify them. The commandant insisted that while giving the evening\u2019s instructions to the convoy groups he had paid particular attention to Mr Putintsev, having heard that he had been \u201cmentally unbalanced\u201d. On the morning of 15 February 2002 the officer had received a report of a dispute between the applicant\u2019s son and a convoy soldier, Mr M., following Mr Putintsev\u2019s refusal to submit to a search. The officer had had a talk with the applicant\u2019s son, during which the latter had complained that convoy soldiers had been beating him up. The commandant had called the officer in charge of the convoy unit, junior sergeant L., and soldier M. and had ordered junior sergeant L. to examine the applicant\u2019s son in their presence to verify whether he had had any injuries. Having complained of insufficient space in the office to perform the examination, Mr L. had asked for the commandant\u2019s permission to do it in another room, where he had then taken Mr Putintsev. On their return only a few minutes later, Mr L. had had an injured lip and had complained of the applicant\u2019s son having attacked him. The commanding officer had authorised a medical examination of the applicant\u2019s son and Mr L. by hospital doctors. He had offered Mr L. the opportunity to step down from convoy duty but the latter had assured him that he had no hard feelings towards the applicant\u2019s son and that he was willing to escort Mr Putintsev to the hospital.", "16. The investigator also studied materials of an internal inquiry into the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s unauthorised leave. The case file included Mr Putintsev\u2019s explanation of his decision to leave the military unit. He stated that he had felt lonely and depressed and had been tired of military service. The inquiry had led to a decision refusing the institution of criminal proceedings against Mr Putintsev in view of his sincere remorse and the fact that his decision to leave the premises of the military unit had been no more than an attempt to cast off the difficulties of life in the army.", "17. On 27 February 2002 the investigation into the shooting took a new turn in view of the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s death. The investigator of the military prosecutor\u2019s office authorised a post-mortem forensic examination, having asked experts to identify the cause of Mr Putintsev\u2019s death and the distance from which the shot had been fired. The experts were also to list any injuries present on the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s body and to determine their nature. In report no. 945 experts identified a perforating wound from the gunshot as the cause of the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s death.", "18. Another expert examination was meant to determine whether Mr L.\u2019s actions had complied with military regulations, in particular whether the use of a gun had been lawful. An expert report issued on 9 March 2002 confirmed that Mr L. had been under an obligation to open fire at Mr Putintsev during his escape. Mr L. had complied, to the letter, with the rules regulating the use of firearms in such a situation. He had only shot at the applicant\u2019s son after he had exhausted other means of preventing an escape. He had warned Mr Putintsev that the firearm would be used and had made warning shots.", "19. On 1 March 2002 the investigator seized the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s personal belongings, including a number of letters to him from family members and letters in which Mr Putintsev had complained of being in poor health, extremely homesick and depressed, experiencing difficulties in adjusting to the army, degrading treatment of soldiers by officers, and forced labour for the officers\u2019 benefit to the point of being treated like a slave.", "20. On 11 March 2002 the military prosecutor of military unit no. 56681 assigned a group of investigators to take over the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s case.", "21. In March 2002 the investigators performed additional interrogations of a large number of witnesses, having attempted to clarify certain aspects of the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s military service, his relations with fellow soldiers and commanding officers, and so on.", "22. A month later the criminal proceedings were closed in view of the absence of criminal conduct on Mr L.\u2019s part. The investigator concluded that Mr L. had followed, to the letter, the rules regulating the use of firearms to prevent the escape of an arrestee. On 28 June 2002 the military prosecutor for the First Supervisory Division quashed that decision and reopened the criminal proceedings, having considered that the investigators had not sufficiently thoroughly studied alternative versions of the events of 15 February 2002, including one of intentional murder as a result of hazing in the military unit, and had omitted to perform a number of important investigative steps, including an expert examination of the machine gun and used cartridges seized from the scene, a reconstruction with the participation of Mr L., an expert examination of the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s clothes, and an assessment of the quality of the medical assistance provided to him in hospital after the shooting.", "23. Having fully complied with the instructions laid down in the decision of 28 June 2002 and having re-interviewed a large number of witnesses, on 14 September 2002 the investigator again closed the criminal proceedings, having considered that there was no evidence of a criminal offence. The final reasoning of the decision read as follows:", "\u201c[T]he actions of Mr L., who on 15 February 2002, while being on convoy duty... preventing the escape of Mr Putintsev, a detainee for a disciplinary offence, having [the character of] \u201cshoot to kill\u201d, [and] as a result of which Mr Putintsev was injured and soon died, contain the formal features of the criminal offence proscribed by Article 111 \u00a7 4 of the Russian Criminal Code. However, taking into account the fact that Mr L. used the weapon in compliance with Article 201 of the Statute of Garrison and Sentry Service in the Military Forces of the Russian Federation [...] and that he did not violate his responsibilities imposed on him by the [...] Statute, it is necessary to conclude that his actions do not constitute criminal conduct\u201d.", "24. On 10 February 2003, following the applicant\u2019s complaint, a deputy military prosecutor overturned the decision of 14 September 2002 and reopened the investigation. The deputy prosecutor held that the investigator\u2019s decision had been premature and ordered him to take a number of additional investigative measures.", "25. On 7 May 2003 a deputy military prosecutor of military unit no. 56681 closed the criminal proceedings, finding no case to be answered. The relevant parts of the decision read as follows:", "\u201cOn 15 February 2002, at 2.10 p.m., on an order of the military commandant [the applicant\u2019s son] was escorted by junior sergeant L. and an assistant to the head of the convoy regiment, senior lieutenant K., to the military hospital of military unit no. 93421 for a medical examination.", "On their way back to the detention unit, at 2.30 p.m., [the applicant\u2019s son] absconded near isolation wards situated in the grounds of the military hospital. In order to prevent [the applicant\u2019s son] committing any criminal acts, junior sergeant L. warned [him] by shouting: \u2018Stop, [I] will shoot\u2019, but the [applicant\u2019s son] did not obey the order. [Junior sergeant] L. disabled the safety device of his AK-74 submachine gun and changed the gun lever to trigger single shots. He put a bullet in the firing chamber and fired two warning shots in the air. [The applicant\u2019s son] did not react in any way and continued running.", "[Senior lieutenant] K. ran after [the applicant\u2019s son] to try to catch him, but he tripped and fell. Then junior sergeant L. ran after [the applicant\u2019s son] and, realising that he could not catch up with [him], stopped near the entrance gate to the military hospital and fired one shot at [the applicant\u2019s son], as a result of which [the applicant\u2019s son] sustained a bodily injury in the form of a perforating bullet wound to the right buttock, causing injuries to the main blood vessels, right hip and bone structure, accompanied by a disturbance of the blood flow to the right lower extremity with subsequent necrobiotic changes in the crus muscles and complications in the form of acute renal failure, the appearance of stress ulcers on the large and small intestines and their subsequent perforation, [and] the development of fecal peritonitis and general poisoning of his system, [resulting in] serious damage to his health.", "An ambulance took [the applicant\u2019s son] to the surgical department of the military hospital of military unit no. 93421, where he underwent surgery.", "On 18 February 2002 [the applicant\u2019s son] was taken to Krasnoyarsk Regional Hospital no. 1 where on 27 February 2002, at 8.45 a.m., he died from his injuries.", "[Junior sergeant] L., questioned as a witness during the pre-trial investigation, stated that ... on 14 February 2002 he had taken up convoy duty in the detention unit of the Uzhur Town Garrison. [The applicant\u2019s son], a soldier in military unit no. 39982, had been kept in the detention unit as a disciplinary detainee. On 15 February 2002, at 2.10 p.m., on an order from the military commandant, [the applicant\u2019s son], escorted by Mr L. and [officer] K., had been taken to the military hospital of military unit no. 93421 for a medical examination. After the examination, at 2.30 p.m., they had left the hospital and had headed back to the detention unit. Officer K. had slipped near the hospital isolation wards and at that moment [the applicant\u2019s son] had started running towards the checkpoint yelling \u2018try to catch me\u2019. Mr K. and Mr L. had run after him. In order to prevent [the applicant\u2019s son] from committing any criminal acts, Mr L. had warned [him] by shouting: \u2018Stop, [I] will shoot\u2019. However, [the applicant\u2019s son] had not complied with the order. Then Mr L. had stopped, disabled the safety device of his submachine gun, changed the gun lever to trigger single shots and fired a warning shot in the air. [The applicant\u2019s son] had not reacted and had continued running. Mr L. had run after him again. After ten metres, he had fired another warning shot in the air. [The applicant\u2019s son] had continued running. Then Mr L. had fired a single shot at him, aiming at his legs. [The applicant\u2019s son] had fallen down after the shot. Officer K ... had approached [the applicant\u2019s son] and had told Mr L. to call an ambulance. Junior sergeant L. had run to the hospital and then, together with a doctor on duty, had run to the place where [the applicant\u2019s son] was lying. The doctor had examined [the applicant\u2019s son], [had] placed him in the ambulance and [had] taken [him] to the hospital.", "Junior sergeant L. confirmed his statements during a reconstruction [conducted as part of the] investigation on 16 August 2002.", "Officer K., questioned during the pre-trial investigation as a witness, stated that he had been in contractual military service in military unit no. 12440. At night on 14 February 2002 he had gone on duty as a garrison guard in the detention unit of the Uzhur Garrison in the capacity of an assistant to the head of the convoy regiment ... On 15 February 2002, at 2.00 p.m., on the commandant\u2019s order, he and junior sergeant L. had escorted [the applicant\u2019s son] to the military hospital of military unit no. 93421 for a medical examination. After the examination, he, Mr L. and [the applicant\u2019s son] had left the hospital and had headed back to the detention unit. On their way to the detention unit, near the hospital isolation wards, [the applicant\u2019s son] had suddenly started running towards the hospital entrance gates and had yelled: \u2018Try to catch and hit me\u2019. At the same moment officer K. had slipped and had been unable to apprehend [the applicant\u2019s son]. Junior sergeant L. had immediately shouted to [the applicant\u2019s son]: \u2018Stop, [I] will shoot\u2019, but [the applicant\u2019s son] had continued running. Mr L. had fired a warning shot in the air and had run after [the applicant\u2019s son]. [The applicant\u2019s son] had not reacted in any way and had run through the hospital entrance gates and had continued running along the fence. Mr L. had stopped near the gates and had fired a second warning shot in the air. [The applicant\u2019s son] had continued running, not paying attention to the shots and shouts. After Mr L. had run through the hospital gates, he had fired at [the applicant\u2019s son] and had wounded him. At that moment officer K. had been 15-20 metres away from [the applicant\u2019s son]. After that he had approached [the applicant\u2019s son] and had immediately called an ambulance, which had taken [the applicant\u2019s son] to the hospital.", "Officer K. confirmed his statements during a reconstruction [conducted as part of the] investigation on 16 August 2002.", "N., questioned as a witness during the pre-trial investigation, stated that he had been in mandatory military service in military unit 12463.

On 15 February 2002, at 2.30 p.m., he had been outside, near the entrance gates of checkpoint no. 4, and had been inspecting ... cars ... He had been alone outside. When he had once again closed the gates ... he had heard someone shout \u2018Stop, [I] will shoot\u2019, from the direction of the hospital. He had noticed a soldier running from the hospital and two people, an officer and a soldier with a gun, running after him. The fleeing soldier had not reacted to the shouts ... and had continued running, then the soldier with the gun had fired a shot in the air, but [the applicant\u2019s son] had continued running and had not reacted in any way. Then [Mr N.] had heard another shot in the air but the situation did not change. The fleeing soldier had started running on the road alongside the fence and Mr N. had no longer been able to see [him] from where he had been standing at checkpoint no. 4; he had only been able to see when the soldier with the gun had run through the hospital gates and had fired at the fleeing [soldier]. [Mr L.] had fired once. After that Mr N. had gone onto the road and had looked in the direction where the soldier with the gun had fired. Mr N. had seen that the [soldier who had been fleeing] was lying on the verge of the road and that the officer was standing near him; [the officer] had told the soldier with the gun to run to the hospital for an ambulance. Approximately 5 or 10 minutes later a doctor, and then an ambulance, had arrived.

In particular, the Disciplinary Statute permitted detention for up to ten days of a soldier for a breach of military discipline or public order (\u00a7 51). A decision authorising the detention was to be taken by the commandant or head of the unit involved (\u00a7 85). An inquiry into the circumstances of an alleged disciplinary offence was to precede a decision by which a disciplinary penalty was imposed. The inquiry was to, inter alia, take account of the purpose for which the alleged disciplinary offence was committed, whether the soldier was guilty of the offence, what the consequences of the offence were and whether there were mitigating or aggravating circumstances (\u00a7 86). A decision to impose a disciplinary penalty was ordinarily to be taken within a day after the commandant had learned about the offence (\u00a7 88).", "32.
