The first applicant\u2019s mother was deprived of her land and other assets by the Soviet authorities in the 1920s.", "6. In 2004 the applicants brought an action against the relevant local authority, seeking restitution of their ancestral lands.

In a letter of 2 November 2005, the registrar replied that it was not possible to register the land in the applicants\u2019 name, as their documentation was incomplete. The lawyer was found to be at fault for the fact that the final judgment neither indicated the size of plot no. 604 nor specified its category: agricultural or non-agricultural. The lawyer was further invited to submit a copy of his identity document, the authority form proving his right to represent the applicants, the original enforcement writ and the cadastral plan of the land in question.", "10.

They claimed, inter alia, that they were not in a position to produce an amended final court decision. In reply, the Gurjaani Public Registry refused to register plot no. 604 for various reasons.", "11. The judgment of 31 January 2005 still remains unenforced.", "12.
