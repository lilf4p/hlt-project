On 12 March 2003 the \u0130zmir public prosecutor filed an indictment against ten police officers, accusing them of ill-treating the applicant. The applicant joined the proceedings as a civil party.", "15. On 29 June 2004 the \u0130zmir Criminal Court, on the basis of witness statements and medical reports, found four police officers guilty of illtreating the applicant under Article 245 of the Criminal Code. Six other police officers on duty that day were acquitted. The court found it established that when the applicant arrived at the police station he was drunk. He started swearing and threatening the officers, threw himself right and left and hit a couple of police officers. In order to stop him, the police officers handcuffed, blindfolded and gagged the applicant. One police officer, M.G.I., hit the applicant with a truncheon. He also told the other police officers to hit the applicant. Three other police officers consequently hit the applicant with truncheons. Based on this finding, the court held that the actions of the four police officers who had beaten the applicant had constituted a breach of Article 245 of the Criminal Code. Considering that the swearing and threats of the applicant amounted to provocation within the meaning of Article 51 of the Criminal Code, the court then reduced their sentences and accordingly sentenced each of them to a fine. Furthermore, the court decided to suspend the execution of their sentences pursuant to Section 6 of Law no. 647 on the basis that the accused officers did not show any likelihood of reoffending.", "16. On 7 March 2007 the Court of Cassation upheld the first-instance court\u2019s judgment as regards the acquittal decisions and quashed the judgment as to the convictions for a reconsideration of the case in the light of the new Code of Criminal Procedure (Law no. 5271) which had entered into force on 1 June 2005.", "17.

On 17 January 2008 the \u0130zmir Criminal Court once again found the four accused police officers guilty of ill-treating the applicant, and sentenced them each to a fine. The court further suspended the execution of their sentence pursuant to Law no. 647, considering that they were unlikely to break the law again. Upon appeal, on 17 September 2008 the Court of Cassation quashed that judgment as well, maintaining that the first-instance court should have considered whether the pronouncement of the judgment could have been suspended for a period of five years pursuant to Article 231 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.", "18.

Accordingly, pursuant to Article 245 of the Criminal Code it initially sentenced them each to three months\u2019 imprisonment. Considering that the swearing and threats of the applicant amounted to provocation within the meaning of Article 51 of the Criminal Code, the court then reduced their sentences to twenty five days\u2019 imprisonment and banned them from public service for twenty five days.
