If the law does not fix a time-limit for these purposes, it is considered that a violation of the duty to perform the act or give the decision within a reasonable time-limit is also considered as an irregularity in the conduct of proceedings. When using the notion of \u201creasonable time\u201d, the Act refers to Articles 5 and 6 of the Convention.", "Act no. 160/2006 also introduced a new section 31a which provides for a reasonable satisfaction for moral prejudice caused by an irregularity in the conduct of proceedings including non-compliance with the obligation to perform an act or to adopt a decision within a reasonable time.", "Under Article 305 of the Code of Civil Procedure the court shall notify the entitled party and the financial institution of the finality of the resolution whereby it has ordered the enforcement of a decision; it shall serve the notification on the financial institution by personal delivery.", "Article 307 \u00a7 3 provides, inter alia, that if the receivable being recovered, and incidentals thereto, the debt has not been paid in full, the financial institution shall carry out the enforcement of the decision also on the day following the day on which such an amount of funds is credited to the account, which is required for the entitled party\u2019s full satisfaction.
