ROMANIA (No. 2)", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 8;Violation of Art. 3;No violation of Art. 6-1 (access to court);Violation of Art. 6-1 (length of proceedings);Violation of Art. 14+6;Violation of Art. 14+8;Pecuniary damage - financial award;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["15. The applicants are Romanian nationals of Roma origin. They used to live in the village of H\u0103d\u0103reni, in the Mure\u015f district, and are agricultural workers. After the events described below, some applicants returned to live in H\u0103d\u0103reni, while others, who are homeless, live in various parts of the country. Mr Iulius Moldovan is currently living in Spain and Mrs Maria Floarea Zoltan is living in the United Kingdom.", "16. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows:", "17. On the evening of 20 September 1993 a row broke out in a bar in the centre of the village of H\u0103d\u0103reni (Mure\u015f district). Rapa Lupian L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f and Aurel Pardalian L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f, two Roma brothers, along with another Rom, Mircea Zoltan, began to argue with a non-Rom, Che\u0163an Gligor. The verbal confrontation developed into a physical one which ended with the death of Che\u0163an Cr\u0103ciun, who had come to the aid of his father. The three Roma then fled the scene and sought refuge in a neighbour's house.", "18. Soon afterwards, news of the incident spread and a large number of villagers learned of Che\u0163an Cr\u0103ciun's death. Enraged, they gathered together to find the Roma. The angry mob arrived at the house where the three were hiding and demanded that they come out. Among the crowd were members of the local police force in H\u0103d\u0103reni, including the Chief of Police Ioan Moga, and Sergeant Alexandru \u015eu\u015fc\u0103, who had heard of the incident. When the brothers refused to come out, the crowd set fire to the house. As the fire engulfed the house, the brothers tried to flee but were caught by the mob who beat and kicked them with vineyard stakes and clubs. The two brothers died later that evening. Mircea Zoltan remained in the house, where he died in the fire. It appears that the police officers present did nothing to stop these attacks. The applicants alleged that, on the contrary, the police also called for and allowed the destruction of all Roma property in H\u0103d\u0103reni.", "19. Later that evening the villagers decided to vent their anger on all the Roma living in the village and proceeded to burn the Roma homes and property in H\u0103d\u0103reni, including stables, cars and goods. The riots continued until the following day. In all, thirteen Roma houses belonging to the applicants were destroyed.", "The individual applicants made the following allegations:", "20. The applicant alleged that it was on his property that the three Roma were killed on 20 September 1993. His home and other property were set on fire and destroyed.", "21. The applicant alleged that her house and various personal possessions were destroyed by the fire.", "22. The applicant alleged that, on the evening of 20 September 1993, an angry mob had appeared at her door, entered the house and destroyed all her belongings. The mob had then proceeded to set fire to her home and she had watched as the flames destroyed it. The next day, when she had returned home with her husband and daughter, she had been met by an enraged mob of villagers who had prevented her from entering the house. Police officers Ioan Moga, Alexandru \u015eu\u015fc\u0103 and Florin Nicu Dr\u0103ghici had taken hold of her, sprayed pepper in her face and then proceeded to beat her badly. Costic\u0103 Moldovan had witnessed these events. Colonel Dr\u0103ghici had also fired at Costic\u0103 Moldovan and his family as they tried to return home to fetch their pigs. The applicant declared that her house had been damaged and that she had lost valuables and other possessions.", "23. The applicant alleged that on the evening of 20 September 1993 she had learned from her eleven-year-old daughter what was happening in H\u0103d\u0103reni. Her daughter had told her that a neighbour had said that the non-Roma villagers wanted to kill all the Gypsies in retaliation for the death of Che\u0163an Cr\u0103ciun.", "24. Fearing for the safety of her children, the applicant had taken them to her mother's house. Later that evening, when she returned, she witnessed several people gathered in front of the courtyard throwing stones and pieces of wood and eventually setting her house on fire. As she ran back to her mother's house, she saw three people armed with clubs, urging the mob to set fire to it. Within minutes, her mother's home was in flames.", "25. The following day the applicant had attempted to return to what was left of her home to assess the damage. As she approached her property, she had been threatened verbally and physically by an angry mob of non-Roma villagers and police officers. One villager had threatened her with a shovel and others had violently thrown rocks at her. The villagers, including the police officers present, had prevented her from entering what remained of her home. Fearing for her safety, the applicant and her children had left H\u0103d\u0103reni.", "26. Later that day she had once again attempted to return to her home along with other Roma villagers. This time the applicant had found the road to her house entirely blocked by an even larger crowd of villagers, all of whom had been carrying clubs. Police officers had also been among the crowd. Among the enraged mob of villagers, the applicant had recognised Officer Nicu Dr\u0103ghici, who was holding a truncheon. A police car had even pursued the applicant and other Roma trying to return to their homes, firing shots at them and shouting at them to leave the village. The applicant alleged that her house had been destroyed and that she had lost valuable goods.", "27. Petru (Gruia) L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f alleged that his house had been destroyed, as had the three cars he had had in the courtyard.", "28. The applicant stated that, on the night of 20 September 1993, her husband, Mircea Zoltan, and her two brothers, Rapa Lupian L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f and Aurel Pardalian L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f, had been brutally murdered in the H\u0103d\u0103reni pogrom. She alleged that one of the thirteen Roma houses set on fire that evening had belonged to her late mother, C\u0103t\u0103lina L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f.", "29. The applicant alleged that his house had been destroyed and that he had lost valuable goods. His wife had been pregnant at the time of the incident and, because she had been beaten and had experienced severe fear, the baby had been born with brain damage.", "30. In the aftermath of the incident the Roma residents of H\u0103d\u0103reni lodged a criminal complaint with the Public Prosecutors' Office. The complainants identified a number of individuals responsible for what had occurred on 20 September 1993. Among those identified were several police officers: Chief of Police Ioan Moga, his assistant Sergeant Alexandru \u015eu\u015fc\u0103, Colonel Florentin Nicu Draghici, a certain Panzaru from Ludu\u015f, and Lieutenant Colonel Constantin Palade, the Mure\u015f County Chief of Police.", "31. Thereafter, an investigation was initiated which identified the offenders who had actively participated in the killing of the L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f brothers and Mircea Zoltan, and the destruction of Roma houses and other property.", "32. On 21 July 1994 three civilians \u2013 P.B., I.B. and N.G. - were remanded in custody. They were charged with extremely serious murder (under Articles 174 and 176 of the Criminal Code) and arson (under Article 217 \u00a7 4 of the Criminal Code). However, a few hours later they were released and all warrants for their arrest were set aside by order of the General Prosecutor.", "33. By an order of 31 October 1994, on the basis of ample evidence that suggested police involvement in the incident, the case was sent to the T\u00e2rgu-Mure\u015f Military Prosecutors' Office, which had jurisdiction to investigate crimes committed by police officers. According to the order of the Public Prosecutors' Office of the T\u00e2rgu-Mure\u015f Court of Appeal, Lieutenant Colonel Palade had organised a small meeting with non-Roma villagers after the incident, advising them \u201cnot to tell anyone what the police had done if they wanted the incident to be forgotten and not have any consequences for themselves.\u201d", "34. By a resolution dated 15 November 1994, the T\u00e2rgu-Mure\u015f Military Prosecutors' Office ordered an extension of the investigation and the initiation of a criminal investigation in respect of Chief of Police Moga and Sergeant \u015eu\u015fc\u0103. According to the military prosecutor, the evidence produced so far indicated that these persons had incited the villagers to commit acts of violence against the L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f brothers and had even directly participated in setting fire to certain houses. On the basis of oral evidence, the prosecutor found that officers Moga and \u015eu\u015fc\u0103 had participated in the events and \u201crepeatedly\u201d incited the villagers to take action against the men barricaded in the house, telling them to \u201cset them on fire, because we cannot do anything to them\u201d. Moreover, he found that Lieutenant Colonel Palade had required the inhabitants of H\u0103d\u0103reni \u201cnot to tell anyone anything about the actions of the police officers, and everything will be forgotten and you shall bear no consequences.\u201d", "35. On 10 January 1995, having regard to the involvement of Colonel Palade, the T\u00e2rgu-Mure\u015f Military Prosecutor declined jurisdiction to investigate the case and referred it to the Bucharest Territorial Military Prosecutors' Office.", "36. On 22 August 1995 Colonel Magistrate M.S., the military prosecutor at the Bucharest Military Court, decided not to open a criminal investigation, stating that the evidence produced in the case had not confirmed the participation of Chief of Police Moga, Lieutenant Colonel Palade or Sergeant \u015eu\u015fc\u0103 in the crimes committed during the riots. As to the statements made by various witnesses confirming the involvement of these police officers, the prosecutor found that one of them had been made by the sister of two of the victims and, given the fact that the officers had punished the victims several times, her evidence was obviously tendentious. The prosecutor found the other oral evidence confused. He concluded that the police officers could not be accused of having committed crimes, \u201ceven though one should accept that during the events they had used words such as 'do what you want, I have a family to take care of' or 'they will come out immediately if you set the house on fire'. Moreover, we cannot consider the lack of initiative and the inability of the two policemen to influence the behaviour of the furious villagers as a form of participation \u2013 either in the form of instigation or as possible moral complicity.\u201d", "37. In September 1995, the Head of the Bucharest Territorial Military Prosecutors' Office upheld the decision, refusing to open an investigation, and all charges against the police officers were dropped. An appeal lodged by the injured parties was dismissed by the Military Prosecutors' Office of the Supreme Court of Justice.", "38. On 12 August 1997, the Public Prosecutor of the T\u00e2rgu-Mure\u015f Court of Appeal issued an indictment charging eleven civilians suspected of having committed crimes on 20 September 1993.", "39. Certain testimonies confirmed that the police had promised the villagers involved in the riot that they would help to cover up the entire incident. Several defendants testified that two police cars driving to the scene of the incident that night had ordered, over their loudspeakers, that the house where the three Roma victims were hiding be set on fire.", "40. On 11 November 1997 a criminal trial, in conjunction with a civil case for damages, began against the civilian defendants in the T\u00e2rgu-Mure\u015f County Court. During these proceedings, the applicants learned of the overwhelming extent of the evidence against the police. Various witnesses testified that police officers had not only been present that evening but had actually instigated the incident and then stood idly by as the two L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f brothers and Mircea Zoltan were killed and Roma houses destroyed. In this connection, witnesses cited the names of Chief of Police Moga, Colonel Dr\u0103ghici and Sergeant \u015eu\u015fc\u0103.", "41. In the light of numerous testimonies implicating additional individuals \u2013 both civilians and police officers \u2013 the applicants' lawyer asked the court to extend the indictment of 12 August 1997. As a result, the civilian prosecutor sent the relevant military prosecutor the information on which to base proceedings before a military court against the officers concerned.", "42. The applicants Iulius Moldovan and Floarea Zoltan asked the court in writing to extend the criminal charges. According to them, the prosecutor refused to do so.", "43. On 23 June 1998 the T\u00e2rgu-Mure\u015f County Court severed the civil and the criminal case because the criminal investigation had already lasted four years and the determination of the civil aspect would take even longer.", "44. On 17 July 1998 the T\u00e2rgu-Mure\u015f County Court delivered its judgment in the criminal case. It noted the following:", "\u201cThe village of H\u0103d\u0103reni, belonging to the commune of Che\u0163ani, is situated in the south-west Mure\u015f district on the main road between T\u00e2rgu-Mure\u015f and Cluj and has a population of 882 inhabitants, of which 641 are Romanians, 145 Hungarians and 123 Roma.", "The Roma community represents 14% of the total population and the marginal lifestyle of some categories of Roma, especially the ones who settled in the village after 1989, has often generated serious conflicts with the majority of the population.", "Due to their lifestyle and their rejection of the moral values accepted by the rest of the population, the Roma community has marginalised itself, shown aggressive behaviour and deliberately denied and violated the legal norms acknowledged by society.", "Most of the Roma have no occupation and earn their living by doing odd jobs, stealing and engaging in all kinds of illicit activities. As the old form of common property that gave them equal rights with the other members of the community was terminated, the Roma population were allocated plots of land. However, they did not work the land and continued to steal, to commit acts of violence and to carry out attacks, mainly against private property, which has generated even more rejection than before.", "Groups of Roma have started arguments with the young people in the village, attacked them or stolen their goods and money.", "Moreover, they ostentatiously use insults, profanities and vulgar words in public places. ...", "The records of the criminal-investigation authorities and of the courts of law in Mure\u015f County disclose that seven criminal cases were registered between 1991 and 1993, having as their object acts of violence ranging from simple blows to murder.", "In fact, the real number of the crimes committed by the Roma was much higher, but many of them were not judged in court because the injured parties did not file complaints, withdrew them or made peace with the perpetrators, for fear of vindictive threats by the Roma.", "The community feels that most of the disputes were solved in an unfair, unsatisfactory manner in favour of Roma and this has caused an increase in the number of personal or collective vindictive actions.\u201d", "45. The court went on to establish that, on the evening of 20 September 1993, the L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f brothers and Mircea Zoltan had been waiting at the village bus station and had quarrelled with Che\u0163an Gligor about the attempts made by the three Roma to attract the attention of a girl. Answering the Roma's mockery and insults addressed to him and to his cow, Che\u0163an Gligor started to threaten the Roma with his whip and even hit Pardalian L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f. A fight followed, during which Che\u0163an Cr\u0103ciun, who had intervened to defend his father, was stabbed in the chest by Rapa Lupian L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f. The Roma ran away, while Che\u0163an Cr\u0103ciun was brought to the hospital, where he died about half an hour later. During that time the Roma took refuge in the house of the applicants Lucre\u0163ia and Iulius Moldovan, while villagers gathered around the yard of the house. Two police officers, Chief of Police Moga and Sergeant \u015eu\u015fc\u0103, arrived at the scene of the incident minutes later, having been called by some villagers. The policemen were allegedly under the influence of alcohol. Before and after the arrival of the police, the villagers threw stones, pieces of wood and clods of earth at the house and shouted things like \u201cSet fire to the house! Let them burn like rats!\u201d A villager started to throw flammable materials at the house and was soon followed by others, including children. When the fire spread, two of the Roma men came out of the house. Rapa Lupian L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f was immediately immobilised by Mr Moga, while Pardalian L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f managed to run away. Mircea Zoltan was stopped from coming out of the house by a villager and was hit by another's fist and a shovel, which finally led to his dying in the fire. His carbonized body was found the following day in the burned-down house. The autopsy report established that he had died from respiratory failure, 100% carbonized.", "46. To escape the fury of the villagers, Chief of Police Moga took Rapa Lupian L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f to the cemetery, after trying in vain to enter several courtyards in the village, which were all locked. The court noted that \u201cthe policeman [Moga], realising his presence was useless, abandoned his prisoner to the infuriated crowd\u201d. According to the autopsy report, Rapa Lupian L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f died a violent death from shock and internal bleeding, with multiple traumatic injuries affecting his liver, a hemiperitoneum and peripheral haematoma on 70% of his body.", "47. Pardalian L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f was caught by the crowd near the cultural centre, where he was beaten to death. The autopsy report found that he had died as a result of direct blows from blunt objects causing eighty-nine lesions on his body (multiple fractures of his arms, ribs and thorax, and multiple traumatic injuries and contusions).", "48. During the trial, all the civilian defendants stated that, in addition to officers Moga and \u015eu\u015fc\u0103, two other policemen had arrived from the city of Ludu\u015f and encouraged the crowd to set fire to the houses. Two police cars had also arrived at H\u0103d\u0103reni, from which it was announced over loudspeakers that only the detached houses of the Gypsies should be set on fire in order not to cause accidents. At a meeting held the next day in the village square, Lieutenant Colonel Palade stated that the case would be covered up and a scapegoat found.", "49. All the accused stated that they had been arrested for the first time in 1994, but only for a few hours or days, after which they had been released in order to allow them to harvest the crops, a reason they found strange, since most of them were not farmers. They also stated that very few questions were put to them and that the prosecutor even tried to put pressure on them. They were not questioned further until 1997, when they were arrested again.", "50. The court further established that the villagers had declared that, on the night in question, the village was to be \u201cpurged of the Gypsies\u201d, an intention clearly put into action, and found that,", "\u201cThe majority of the population of H\u0103d\u0103reni was directly or indirectly supported by the representatives of the authorities who came to the village and not only did nothing to stop the houses being set on fire, but also surrounded the area with groups of gendarmes.\u201d", "51. The court found that the action was not premeditated, but that all those present had acted jointly, in different ways (assault, murder, fire, destruction, etc.), to reach their declared goal of eliminating the Roma community from the village.", "52. The court held that the preliminary investigation had been inadequate:", "\u201cWe deem that the inadequate manner in which the acts and ... procedures related to the investigation were performed reflect a negative attitude ... The same can be noted regarding the delayed submission of the autopsy reports on the victims (Che\u0163an Cr\u0103ciun, L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f Rapa Lupian and Zoltan Mircea died on 21 September 1993 and the forensic reports were drafted in November 1993; mention should be made of the fact that none of the four forensic reports gave specific dates, but only an indication of the month when they were drafted) ... [Moreover,] the electoral meeting organised at the village stadium, attended by politicians, representatives of the police and the law, ... asked the population not to tell the truth and to delay the resolution of the case.\u201d", "53. The court also noted that the prosecution had not agreed to an extension of the criminal investigation or to the initiation of criminal proceedings against \u201cother persons\u201d. Therefore, the court could only rule in respect of those perpetrators prosecuted in accordance with Article 317 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.", "54. The court convicted five civilians of extremely serious murder under Articles 174 and 176 of the Criminal Code and twelve civilians, including the former five, of destroying property, outraging public decency and disturbing public order. Among those convicted of destruction of property and disturbance was V.B., the Deputy Mayor of H\u0103d\u0103reni. The court pronounced prison sentences ranging from one to seven years, and noted that those given terms of less than five years had half the sentence pardoned under Law no. 137/1997. The court justified the sentences as follows:", "\u201cTaking into consideration the characteristics of this particular case, the punishments applied to the defendants might seem too mild compared to the gravity of the crimes. We consider that, as long as persons who contributed to a greater extent to the criminal actions were not prosecuted and were not even the subject of an investigation, although there was enough evidence to prove their guilt, the defendants who were prosecuted should not be held responsible for all the crimes committed, but only for that part for which they are liable.\u201d", "55. On 17 July 1998, the Public Prosecutors' Office appealed against this judgment, asking, inter alia, for heavier sentences. On 15 January 1999, the T\u00e2rgu-Mure\u015f Court of Appeal convicted a sixth civilian, P.B., of extremely serious murder under Articles 174 and 176 of the Criminal Code, sentencing him to six years' imprisonment. It also increased the sentence under Article 174 in respect of N.G. to six years' imprisonment. However, it reduced the other sentences under Articles 174 and 176: in respect of V.B. and S.I.P. from seven to six years' imprisonment, in respect of V.B.N. and S.F. from five to two years' imprisonment, and in respect of N.B., I.B. and O.V. from three to two years' imprisonment. Finally, it discontinued the criminal proceedings against the Deputy Mayor V.B.", "56. The Court of Appeal also reduced the sentences of those convicted of destruction of property under Article 217 of the Criminal Code.", "57. On 22 November 1999, the Supreme Court of Justice upheld the lower courts' convictions for destruction, but reduced the charges of extremely serious murder to a lesser charge of serious murder with extenuating circumstances for V.B., P.B. and S.I.P., sentencing them to five years' imprisonment. It acquitted P.B. and N.G.", "58. By a decree of 7 June 2000, the President of Romania issued individual pardons to S.I.P. and P.B., convicted of serious murder, whereupon they were released.", "59. On 22 August 1999, following new evidence brought to light in the criminal trial, the applicants lodged an appeal with the Military Prosecutors' Office of the Supreme Court of Justice against the decision of 22 August 1995 not to open an investigation against the police officers involved in the incidents of 20 September 1993.", "60. On 14 March 2000 the Chief Military Prosecutor of the Supreme Court of Justice upheld the military prosecutor at Bucharest Military Court's decision of 22 August 1995.", "61. By decision no. 636 of 19 November 1993, the Romanian Government allocated 25,000,000 Romanian lei (ROL) for the reconstruction of the eighteen houses destroyed by fire on 20 September 1993. The Government decided, moreover, that this amount could also be used as financial assistance for the families affected in order to help them replace items of strict necessity destroyed during the fire. However, only four houses were rebuilt with this money and none of the families received financial assistance.", "62. By a Government decision of 30 November 1993, a commission for the co-ordination of the reconstruction of the houses was created. Members of this commission included the mayor of Che\u0163ani, G.G., and his Deputy, V.B.", "63. In a letter of 30 June 1994 addressed to the Government, the Prefect of Mure\u015f indicated that an additional amount of ROL 53,000,000 was needed to rebuild the remaining ten houses.", "64. By decision no. 773 of 25 November 1994, the Government granted an additional sum of ROL 32,000,000 in funds, which had been earmarked for natural disasters occurring between March and September 1994. Four other houses were rebuilt. As shown in photographs submitted by the applicants, these constructions were defective, as there appear to be huge gaps between the window frames and the walls, and the roofs only partially cover the houses.", "65. In a letter dated 30 November 1994 addressed to the Prefect of Mure\u015f, Petru Rosta\u015f, the father-in-law of the applicant Otilia Rosta\u015f, requested that her house be rebuilt as a priority because, since the events, she had been living with her four children in a hen-house.", "66. In a letter dated 8 November 1995, Liga Pro Europa, a human-rights association based in T\u00e2rgu-Mure\u015f, informed the Prefect that six houses had still not been rebuilt, which meant that six families had to spend another winter without a dwelling. Moreover, according to the association, most of the victims had complained about the bad quality of the rebuilt houses and alleged that the money allocated for this purpose had been improperly used.", "In a letter addressed to the Prefect in 1995, the mayor of Che\u0163ani (of which H\u0103d\u0103reni is a part), G.G., a member of the reconstruction commission, reported that, of the fourteen houses destroyed by the fire, eight had been rebuilt or almost rebuilt. Concerning the remaining six houses, he reported that three of them posed \u201cspecial problems\u201d based in part on \u201cthe behaviour of the three families\u201d, \u201cthe seriousness of the acts committed and the attitude of the population of H\u0103d\u0103reni towards these families\u201d. In particular, one of the houses to be rebuilt was on land near the non-Rom victim's family (Che\u0163an Cr\u0103ciun), who refused to have Gypsy families living close by. Another problem mentioned by the mayor was the house of the late mother of two of the Roma \u201ccriminals\u201d who had died during the 1993 events. It appeared that, after the events, the L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f family had started living in the city of Ludu\u015f, so the mayor had proposed that a house be built for them at a place of their choice.", "67. To date, six houses have not been rebuilt, of which two belonged to the applicants Petru (D\u00eeg\u0103la) L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f and Maria Floarea Zoltan. According to an expert report submitted by the Government, the damage caused to the houses of Petru (Gruia) L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f and Moldovan Maria had not been repaired, whereas the houses of Iulius Moldovan and Otilia Rosta\u015f had been rebuilt but required finishing work.", "68. On 2 September 1997 the applicant Iulius Moldovan wrote a letter to the President of Romania, informing him that six houses, including his, had still not been rebuilt. He urged the President to grant the necessary funds for the reconstruction of the houses, since he and his family were living in very difficult conditions in the home of the Rosta\u015f family: fifteen people, including nine children, were living in two rooms and sleeping on the floor, which resulted in the children being continually ill.", "69. The applicants submitted that, in general, following the events of September 1993, they had been forced to live in hen-houses, pigsties, windowless cellars, or in extremely cold and deplorable conditions: sixteen people in one room with no heating; seven people in one room with a mud floor; families sleeping on mud or concrete floors without adequate clothing, heat or blankets; fifteen people in a summer kitchen with a concrete floor (Melenu\u0163a Moldovan), etc. These conditions had lasted for several years and, in some cases, continued to the present day.", "70. As a result, the applicants and their families fell ill. In particular, the applicant Petru (Gruia) L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f had developed diabetes and begun to lose his eyesight.", "71. Following the decision of 23 June 1998 to sever the civil and criminal proceedings, on 12 January 2001 the Mure\u015f Regional Court delivered its judgment in the civil case. The court noted that the victims had requested pecuniary damages for the destruction of the houses and their contents (furniture, etc.), as well as non-pecuniary damages. The court further noted that, during the events of 20 September 1993, eighteen houses belonging to the Roma population in H\u0103d\u0103reni had been totally or partially destroyed and three Roma had been killed, a criminal court having found twelve villagers guilty of these acts. Basing its decision on an expert report, the court awarded pecuniary damages for those houses which had not been rebuilt in the meantime, and maintenance allowances for the children of the Roma killed during the riots. On the basis of an expert report, the court awarded pecuniary damages in respect of the partial or total destruction of the houses of six Roma, including those of the third and fifth applicants. The court rejected the other applicants' request for pecuniary damages in respect of the rebuilt houses, finding, on the basis of the same expert report, that their value was either the same or even higher than the original buildings. It further refused all applicants damages in respect of belongings and furniture, on the ground that they had not submitted documents to confirm the value of their assets and were not registered as taxpayers capable of acquiring such valuable assets. The court stated, inter alia:", "\u201cMr Iulius Moldovan did not submit documents proving with certainty that he had any belongings. He claimed in particular that he was in the sheep business, from which he drew a substantial income, for instance, that he had a ton of wool in the attic of his house. However, from the information obtained by the court from the local tax office in Che\u0163ani, it appears that the civil party was not registered as having any income. ...", "The damage suffered because of the destruction of the chattels and furniture has not been substantiated. The civil parties consider that their own statements, the lists of the belongings destroyed submitted to the court and the statements of the other witnesses who are also civil parties should be enough to substantiate their claims. Having regard to the context in which the destruction occurred and to the fact that all civil parties suffered losses, the court will dismiss as obviously insincere the statements made by each civil party in relation to the losses suffered by the other civil parties.", "Last but not least, the type of belongings allegedly destroyed and the quantity of goods allegedly in the possession of each civil party show a much more prosperous situation than that which a family of average income could have. Neither civil party adduced proof of having an income such as to allow them to acquire so many goods. As noted previously, the parties had no income at all. Moreover, the shape of the houses, the materials used for their construction and the number of rooms show an evident lack of financial resources. It should be stressed in this context that only work can be the source of revenue, and not events such as the present one...\u201d", "72. The court finally rejected all the applicants' requests for non-pecuniary damages on the ground that they had not substantiated their claim, and that the crimes committed were not of a nature to produce moral damage.", "73. The court ordered the villagers convicted in the criminal trial to pay the damages awarded.", "74. Having regard to some procedural errors in the Mure\u015f Regional Court's judgment, the applicants lodged an appeal with the Mure\u015f Court of Appeal.", "75. On 17 October 2001 the Mure\u015f Court of Appeal found that a number of procedural errors had occurred during the public hearings on the merits before the Mure\u015f Regional Court: the hearings had been held in the absence of the accused and their lawyers; one of the original applicants, Adrian Moldovan, had not been summoned; the public prosecutor had not been given leave to address the court; a number of expert reports ordered by the court had not been completed, and confusion had been created as to the number and names of the victims and their children. The Court of Appeal concluded that these errors rendered the proceedings null and void. It therefore quashed the judgment of 12 January 2001 and ordered a new trial of the case.", "76. The Mure\u015f Regional Court delivered its judgment in the civil case on 12 May 2003. The court noted that the victims had requested pecuniary damages for the destruction of houses and their contents (furniture, etc.), as well as non-pecuniary damages. The court further noted that, during the events of 20 September 1993, eighteen houses belonging to the Roma population in H\u0103d\u0103reni had been totally or partially destroyed and three Roma had been killed. As a result of these events, the State had granted some money for the reconstruction of the houses.", "Basing its decision on an expert report drafted in 1999 and updated in 2003, the court ordered the following damages to be paid by the civilians found guilty by the criminal court:", "(a) Iulius Moldovan was awarded ROL 130,000,000 in pecuniary damages in respect of the destroyed house, to be revised to take account of any devaluation in the national currency. The court further heard evidence from witnesses confirming that various assets belonging to the applicant, including furniture, belongings and the proceeds from the sale of more than 260 sheep, had been destroyed during the fire. However, the court refused to award damages on the ground that it was impossible to assess the loss.", "(b) As regards Otilia Rosta\u015f, the court noted that her house did not appear on the list of the houses (totally or partially) destroyed drawn up by Che\u0163ani Town Hall. The court heard testimony confirming the destruction of part of the roof and of the wooden structure of her house, but noted that there was no evidence to evaluate the damage. Therefore, it rejected the request for pecuniary damages.", "(c) Petru (Gruia) L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f was awarded ROL 16,000,000 in pecuniary damages in respect of the destroyed house. The court noted the applicant's claim that various assets he had owned had been destroyed during the fire \u2013 furniture, three cars, jewellery and money \u2013 but rejected it as unsubstantiated.", "(d) As regards Melenu\u0163a Moldovan, the court awarded ROL 28,000,000 for the destroyed house. The court heard evidence from two witnesses confirming that the applicant had had various belongings which had been destroyed by the fire, but refused to award damages in that respect, as there was no evidence as to their value.", "(e) Maria Moldovan was awarded ROL 600,000 for the destroyed house. The court rejected her claim in respect of the destroyed belongings as there was no evidence as to their value.", "(f) Petru (D\u00eeg\u0103la) L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f was awarded, together with Floarea Maria Zoltan and Monica Simona L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f, as the brother and sisters of the deceased victims, ROL 60,000,000 for the destroyed house, to be revised to take account of any devaluation in the national currency. The court rejected their claim in respect of their destroyed belongings on the ground that the losses had not been substantiated. It also rejected as unsubstantiated the claim for the reimbursement of the money spent on the burial of the victims.", "(g) Floarea Maria Zoltan, the widow of one of the victims who had died burned alive during the riots, also requested a maintenance allowance for her minor child. The court noted that although the applicant claimed that her husband used to be a manufacturer of woollen coats, she had not submitted any evidence as to his income, and therefore decided to take the statutory minimum wage as the basis for the calculation of the allowance, namely, ROL 2,500,000. Moreover, it found that it was impossible to establish how much the applicant's husband used to spend on his child's maintenance, and applied the minimum granted by the Family Code, that is one quarter of the minimum wage, which amounted to ROL 625,000. Finally, the court took into account that the deceased victims had provoked the crimes committed and decided to halve the above-mentioned amount. It therefore awarded ROL 312,500 per month in maintenance allowance for the applicant's minor child.", "Finally, the court rejected all the applicants' requests for non-pecuniary damages on the ground that they had not substantiated their claim, and that the crimes committed were not of a nature to produce moral damage.", "77. On appeal by the persons convicted and the applicants, the T\u00e2rgu-Mure\u015f Court of Appeal gave judgment on 24 February 2004. The court recalled that, under the combined provisions of the Civil Code and the Codes of Criminal and Civil Procedure, it was bound by the ruling of the criminal court. Referring to recent publications by Romanian authors in the field of civil law and the Court's case of Akdivar v. Turkey (judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV), the court found that,", "\u201cBy their behaviour, the accused infringed the property rights of the complainants, for which pecuniary damages had already been awarded; however, some of the civil parties should also be awarded damages from a moral point of view. Some of the civil parties were deprived emotionally, as a result of the damage sustained, of the security which they had felt in the destroyed houses, of the comfort they had enjoyed as a result of the facilities of the houses, all these movable and immovable goods being the result of their work, which guaranteed them a normal standard of living, having regard to their personalities ...", "As shown above, the accused committed the crimes in a state of provocation, which led the court to apply the provisions of Article 73 of the Criminal Code [regarding extenuating circumstances]. For this precise reason, the civil parties enumerated below are entitled to a certain amount of damages, but not the amount requested...\u201d", "The court awarded the following amounts: ROL 100,000,000 to Floarea Maria Zoltan as it found that she had had to leave the village and wander homeless in the country and abroad; ROL 50,000,000 to Iulius Moldovan as he had been profoundly affected by the events, had lost his fortune and his health had deteriorated substantially; ROL 30,000,000 to Otilia Rosta\u015f as she had suffered psychological and emotional trauma for the same reasons; ROL 20,000,000 to Melenu\u0163a Moldovan for the same reasons as Otilia Rosta\u015f; ROL 15,000,000 to Maria Moldovan for the psychological trauma suffered as a result of the partial destruction of her house; and ROL 70,000,000 to Petru (D\u00eeg\u0103la) L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f since he had sustained deep emotional damage and felt insecure as a result of the burning of his parents' house. No award was made in respect of Petru (Gruia) L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f.", "78. The civil parties filed an appeal against this judgment, which was rejected by a final decision of the Court of Cassation, on 25 February 2005.", "79. Article 244 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as amended by Government Order no. 59/2001, provides that a court examining a civil action can suspend the proceedings:", "\u201c...2. if criminal proceedings have been instituted in relation to a crime, the determination of which is decisive for the outcome of the civil dispute.\u201d", "\u201cCriminal proceedings cannot be instituted and, if instituted, cannot be continued if ...", "c) the act was not committed by the defendant; ... \u201d", "\u201cThe person who has suffered civil damage can join the criminal proceedings...", "He or she can do so either during the criminal investigation... or before the court...\u201d", "\u201cThe findings contained in a final judgment of the criminal court concerning the issue whether the act in question has been committed, and the identification of the perpetrator and his guilt, are binding on the civil court when it examines the civil consequences of the criminal act.\u201d", "\u201cIn case of a conviction or an acquittal, or the termination of the criminal trial, the court shall deliver a judgment in which it also decides on the civil action.", "Civil damages cannot be awarded if an acquittal was decided on the ground that the impugned act did not exist or was not committed by the accused.\u201d", "80. Articles 999 and 1000 of the Civil Code provide that any person who has suffered damage can seek redress by bringing a civil action against the person who has negligently caused it.", "81. Article 1003 of the Civil Code provides that, where more than one person has committed an intentional tort, they shall be jointly and severally liable.", "82. The Government submitted a number of cases in which domestic courts had decided that the prosecutor's decision, based on Article 10 (b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, not to open a criminal investigation on account of the absence of intention \u2013 as an element of the offence \u2013 did not prevent the civil courts from examining a civil claim arising out of the commission of the act by the person in question.", "83. The Government submitted only one case, dating back to 1972, in which the Supreme Court had decided that the prosecutor's decision, based on Article 10 (a) and (c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, not to open a criminal investigation having regard to the fact that the acts were not committed at all or were not committed by the defendant, should not prevent civil courts from examining a civil claim arising out of the commission of the same act by the person in question. The Supreme Court's decision dealt solely with the competence issue and did not specify whether there was a legal provision offering a chance of success for such an action.", "84. The common view of the criminal-procedure specialists is that a civil court cannot examine a civil action filed against a person against whom the prosecutor has refused to open a criminal investigation on the grounds provided for in Article 10 (a) and (c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure that the acts were not committed at all or were not committed by the defendant (see Criminal Procedural Law \u2013 General Part, Gheorghe Nistoreanu and Others, p. 72, Bucharest 1994, and A Treaty on Criminal Procedural Law \u2013 General Part, Nicolae Volonciu, pp. 238-39, Bucharest 1996).", "85. The common view of the civil-procedure specialists and of some criminal-procedure specialists is that the prosecutor's decision refusing to open a criminal investigation on the grounds mentioned in the previous paragraph, does not prevent a civil court from examining a civil action brought against the defendant. In such a case, civil courts are entitled to decide whether the acts were committed and by whom, but have to rely on the findings of the prosecutor set out in the decision refusing to open a criminal investigation (see The Civil Action and the Criminal Trial, Anastasiu Cri\u015fu, RRD no. 4/1997, and Criminal Procedural Law, Ion Neagu, p. 209, Bucharest 1988)."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "3", "6", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
