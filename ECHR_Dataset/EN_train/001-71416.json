It appears that the judgment indicated the specific amounts due by the authority.", "Having examined the authority\u2019s appeal on 1 February 2000, the Supreme Court of the Republic of Udmurtiya upheld the judgment of 17 May 1999 with minor amendments. In particular, it replaced the specific amounts with a general indication that the authority ought to have re-calculated the applicant\u2019s social benefits using index \u201c6\u201d.", "On 22 February 2000 the first instance court issued the writ of execution in respect of the judgment of 17 May 1999.", "It appears that thereafter the applicant sent the writ to the bailiffs and on 20 March 2000 they opened the enforcement proceedings.", "Having received a letter from the authority confirming the compliance with the judgment, on 27 March 2000 the bailiff terminated the enforcement proceedings.

He also sought higher amount of social benefits and damages.", "By judgment of 23 December 2002 the Industrialnyy District Court of the town of Izhevsk partly granted the claim and ordered the authority to pay RUR 96,097.75 as a principal debt in respect of past payments and RUR 30,733.38 as damages in respect of inflation losses in the applicant\u2019s favour. The court clarified the judgment of 17 May 1999 and the decision of 1 February 2000, having ruled that the authority ought to have re-calculated the applicant\u2019s monthly payments for the period from March 1999 onwards and not from 21 August 1996 as indicated by the authority earlier.", "The judgment of 23 December 2002 was upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court of the Republic of Udmurtiya on 23 January 2003.", "The Government submits that the money due pursuant to the judgment of 23 December 2002 and the decision of 23 January 2003 was paid to the applicant in full on 22 May 2003.", "A special law adopted in 1995 entitles the participants of the liquidation of the consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear accident to additional social benefits, including monthly payments.", "Section 9 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings of 21 July 1997 provides that a bailiff\u2019s order on the institution of enforcement proceedings must fix a time-limit for the defendant\u2019s voluntary compliance with a writ of execution. The time-limit may not exceed five days. The bailiff must also warn the defendant that a coercive action will follow, should the defendant fail to comply with the time-limit.", "Under Section 13 of the Law, the enforcement proceedings should be completed within two months upon receipt of the writ of enforcement by the bailiff."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
