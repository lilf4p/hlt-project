The investigating judge ordered the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention on 12 August 1991 on the ground that he might abscond, collude or reoffend.

On 27 May 1992 the Osijek County Court ordered that the trial be held in the applicant\u2019s absence, since his whereabouts had remained unknown. On 27 June 1994 the court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. On the same day the court issued a new order on his detention.", "6. On 29 February 1996 the applicant was extradited from Australia to Croatia, where he was immediately detained, pursuant to the Osijek County Court\u2019s order.", "7. On 7 March 1996 the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) ordered the applicant\u2019s retrial, during which he was remanded in custody.", "8.

On 14 March 2001 the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske), acting on a constitutional complaint lodged by one of the victims\u2019 relatives, quashed the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 22 May 1997 and ordered a new trial.", "11.

On 11 April 2009 a three-judge panel of the Osijek County Court extended the applicant\u2019s detention for a further nine months under Article 109 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The relevant part of the decision reads:", "\u201cThe accused, Antun Gudelj, was detained ... between 29 February 1996 and 3 June 1997 and has been detained again... since 15 July 2007.", "... given that a non-final judgment had been adopted in this case, this panel has established that, under Article 109 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the overall duration of detention, which until the adoption of the first-instance judgment could have lasted up to three years (Article 109 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure), may be extended for one-quarter [of the maximum prescribed statutory limit] until the judgment becomes final. Thus the overall detention may last for three years and nine months. The overall duration of detention could be extended on condition that the three-year limit had not expired. In the present case, on 11 April 2009 the three-year limit had not yet expired, so the accused\u2019s detention was lawfully extended.\u201d", "17. On 14 April 2009 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court, arguing that the maximum period of his detention had in fact expired on 9 April 2009. This meant that the impugned decision by the Osijek County Court had been adopted with two days\u2019 delay and that therefore the extension of his detention had been unlawful.", "18.

On 9 December 2009 the Supreme Court, acting as the final court of appeal, dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal against the second-instance judgment, and the applicant\u2019s conviction thus became final.", "22. On 22 December 2010 the Constitutional Court declared the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint inadmissible on the ground that in the meantime, on 18 October 2010, the applicant had been sent to prison.", "23.
