As she was known by her maiden name in her academic and professional life, she continued to use it; however, she could not use it in any official documents.", "7. An amendment to Article 153 of the Civil Code on 14 May 1997 meant that married women acquired the right to put their maiden name in front of their husband\u2019s surname.
