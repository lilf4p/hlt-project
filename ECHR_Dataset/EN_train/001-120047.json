The applicant is the widow of Mr A. Gusar, a military official of the break-away \u201cMoldavian Republic of Transdniestria\u201d (the \u201cMRT\u201d) who was killed on 8 May 1992, during the military conflict in the MRT.", "4.

It appears from the written depositions, the information supplied by the Moldovan Government and the evidence given by the witnesses heard by the Court in Chi\u015fin\u0103u in March 2003, that the investigation ordered in the judgment of 3 February 1994 came to nothing (see Annex: Mr Postovan, \u00a7 184; and Mr Rusu, \u00a7 302).", "223.
