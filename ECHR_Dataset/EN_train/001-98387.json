On 4 September 2000 the applicant requested the Bytom District Court to seize his daughter's passport. He reasoned his request by a reasonable fear that M.N., who had many contacts in Scandinavian countries, could try to take their daughter to Norway. It is unclear from the case file whether the request was granted.", "12. On 29 September 2000, following an appeal by M.N., the Katowice Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) upheld the decision of the District Court of 6 July 2000.", "13. The court's order was not enforced and therefore, on 8 January 2001, the applicant requested the court to impose a fine on his former wife.", "14. In October 2000 the applicant's former wife and their daughter moved from Bytom to Zakopane, so the case file had to be transmitted to the court with jurisdiction there. The relevant decision was taken on 3 July 2001. However, the transfer did not take place until November 2001.", "15. On an unspecified date M.N. filed for divorce. The issue of the applicant's visiting rights was therefore examined by the divorce court.", "16. On 30 March 2001 the Katowice Regional Court gave a decision regulating the applicant's contact with his daughter. In particular, the court granted him the right to visit his daughter every Friday between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m. at a location other than the flat in which she lived with her mother. The applicant was also allowed to collect his daughter from kindergarten. The contact was to take place in the presence of a court officer (kurator s\u0105dowy).", "17.

Between 20 April 2001 and 8 March 2002 the applicant saw his daughter on 27 occasions.

On 28 November 2003 the Katowice Regional Court granted a divorce. It also indicated the manner in which the parental authority should be exercised. The court made a residence order under which the child was to live with her mother, but the applicant was granted visiting rights, in particular the right to visit his child on given days of the week, without the presence of the mother and the right to spend one month of summer holidays, one week of winter holidays and the second day of the Christmas holidays with his daughter. The court also ordered that all decisions crucial for the child's upbringing were to be taken by both parents.", "27. The judgment was not challenged by M.N.", "28. M.N. still did not comply with the court order. She prevented the applicant from collecting his daughter from kindergarten (by instructing the staff not to let the applicant collect the child) and organised the child's holidays in such a way that she was abroad with her mother or grandparents for the whole two months of the summer holidays.", "29.
