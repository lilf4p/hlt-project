On 1 September 1992 the District Court sent the action to the defendant for comments.", "7. Between 11 September 1992 and 5 May 1993 the District Court held several hearings.

On 9 September 1994 a different expert was asked to submit the opinion as the first expert was abroad. As the second expert did not proceed with the expert\u2019s report, the District Court appointed a third one on 12 October 1995.
