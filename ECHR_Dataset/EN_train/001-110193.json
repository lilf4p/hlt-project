He was represented before the Court by Odvetni\u0161ka Dru\u017eba Matoz O.P. D.O.O., a law firm practising in Koper. The Slovenian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mrs T. Miheli\u010d \u017ditko, State Attorney.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "The applicant was serving his sentence in the closed section of Dob Prison in the period between 24 February 2009 and 26 March 2011.", "As regards the facilities available in the cells and common areas, as well as the health care regime in the prison, the conditions regarding activities outside the cells and contact with the outside world, see the Court\u2019s decision in the case of Lali\u0107 and Others v. Slovenia (dec.), no. 5711/10 etc., 27 September 2011.", "Between 24 February 2009 and 2 June 2010 the applicant was held in Block 4, in cell no. 8 which measured 58.96 square metres and accommodated seventeen prisoners. After his brief hospitalisation (see below) he was returned to the same cell, which continued to accommodate seventeen prisoners. He therefore at all times had about 3.5 square metres of personal space while being held in the prison cell.", "At the beginning of his imprisonment the applicant participated in work therapy sessions, but soon dropped out for unspecified reasons.", "The applicant suffers from a large ulceration on his left tibia (the part of the leg below the knee), which had already appeared in 2003. According to the Government, in the period between 24 February 2009 and 9 July 2010, the applicant visited the prison clinic sixty-six times.", "The applicant\u2019s medical record shows that the wound was cleaned and dressed systematically (every few days and, during certain periods, every day) in the prison clinic. Medication was occasionally prescribed to the applicant. The applicant\u2019s comments concerning his condition, in particular as regards his pain and discomfort, were also noted in his medical record.", "Reports from the prison doctor, which appear to have been prepared at the Government\u2019s request, note that the applicant\u2019s ulcer was regularly cleaned by nurses under the supervision of a general practitioner, that he was also regularly treated by the prison psychiatrist, and was undergoing methadone substitution treatment. It was also noted in one of the reports that the medical assistance provided to the applicant was of a higher standard than that commonly received by individuals with a similar medical problem in Slovenia.", "During the period of his imprisonment the applicant was twice admitted to the Department for Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at the Maribor Hospital, in order to undergo surgical treatment for his ulcer. On both occasions it was envisaged that the surgery would be performed under general anaesthesia. The first time, on 1 December 2008, complications arose when the anesthetist was inserting the intravenous catheter. The applicant was given the option of the catheter being inserted through his inguinal canal (in the groin) or his neck, but he refused, and the surgery was aborted for that reason. The same occurred following the applicant\u2019s second admission to the aforementioned hospital on 2 June 2010. A hospital report dated 4 June 2010 notes that the applicant\u2019s ulcer was not infected. It also advised that the applicant\u2019s status in prison be appropriate to his state of health.", "For the relevant domestic law and practice, see paragraphs 33-35 and 3847 of the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of \u0160trucl and Others v. Slovenia (nos. 5903/10, 6003/10 and 6544/10, 27 September 2011), and paragraphs 34-36 of Mandi\u0107 and Jovi\u0107 v. Slovenia (nos. 5774/10 and 5985/10, 27 September 2011), as well as Lali\u0107 and Others, cited above.", "In addition, the Patient Rights Act (Official Gazette no. 15/2008, entry into force on 26 August 2008) provides for procedures for dealing with complaints concerning, inter alia, inadequate medical treatment or care. In accordance with the provisions of that Act, a patient can lodge a complaint directly with a health-care provider. If unsatisfied, he or she can complain to the Commission for Protection of Patients Rights. Ultimately, a patient whose complaint has been unsuccessful can challenge the decisions made in his or her case before the Administrative Court. The Act also regulates the work of the Representative for Patients\u2019 Rights, whose main role is to assist, provide advice to and represent patients in the exercise of their rights provided therein."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
