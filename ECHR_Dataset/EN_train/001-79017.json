On 15 April 1999 the applicant was detained on remand until 14 July 1999 on suspicion of two attempted murders. The court based its detention order on a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences, on the severity of the likely penalty, which gave rise to a fear that the applicant would obstruct the proceedings, and on the risk of the applicant\u2019s going into hiding as he had done previously.", "6. On an unknown date a bill of indictment was lodged. The applicant was charged with two attempted murders and possession of an unlicensed weapon.", "7.

In all the above-mentioned decisions the courts relied on the same grounds for detention as those given in the first detention order. In some of them the courts also referred to the complexity of the case, the need to conduct further investigations, the probability of collusion between the applicant and other co-accused and exertion of unlawful pressure on witnesses by the applicant. They also stressed that the applicant had previously gone into hiding.", "9. The applicant appealed against the decisions extending his detention on several occasions. All of his appeals were dismissed.", "10. On many occasions the applicant requested release from detention or the imposition of a more lenient preventive measure. His requests were dismissed.", "11.
