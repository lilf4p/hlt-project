This report was signed by eight police officers and Cemal U\u00e7ar.", "63. Mr \u0130. Sa\u011flam stated that Cemal U\u00e7ar sent a letter to his family, informing them that he had been taken into police custody and, subsequently, detained in Diyarbak\u0131r E-type prison. After having received the letter, the applicant went to the prison and saw his son. Subsequently, he asked Mr \u0130. Sa\u011flam to visit his son. On an unspecified date, Mr \u0130. Sa\u011flam visited Cemal U\u00e7ar, who maintained that he had been kidnapped by security forces and that he had made statements before the public prosecutor about his abduction. Cemal U\u00e7ar refrained from informing the public prosecutor about the place where had been kept for almost a month as he feared for himself and his family. Mr \u0130. Sa\u011flam further stated that he did not have the impression that Cemal U\u00e7ar was disturbed psychologically. However, he had feared the possibility of being taken to the security directorate again.", "64. Two reports were prepared on behalf of the applicant by Dr A.M. Anscombe, a consultant forensic pathologist practising in the United Kingdom. The applicant instructed Mr Anscombe to review the autopsy report on Cemal U\u00e7ar, the police reports on the inspection and verification of the scene of the incident, the plan of the ward, the video and photocopies of photographs of the scene, with the deceased in situ, and to comment on the adequacy of the autopsy examination.", "65. In his reports Dr Anscombe maintained that his main criticism was the absence of autopsy photographs. He stated that autopsy photographs were a standard part of any forensic post-mortem examination since without photographs, one was reliant upon the description by the pathologist and there was no other means of corroborating what the pathologist had found or described. He further maintained that the autopsy report would be considered to be inadequate in the United Kingdom because of its brevity and lack of detail. As regards the cause of death of Cemal U\u00e7ar, Dr Anscombe stated that there was nothing in the disposition of the body, the manner of dress, and disposition of the scene which raised suspicion of anything other than suicide. He however opined that it was possible that the deceased could have been suspended by another person or persons, the assessment of which likelihood in turn rested on the accuracy and reliability of the autopsy report. He concluded that that was why an adequate autopsy description with documentation, including photographs, was so important.", "66. At the time of the events, Turkish law did not contain any provision regulating communications between persons held in custody and their relatives.", "On 6 February 2002 the third paragraph of Article 128 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was amended by Law no. 4744 and currently reads as follows:", "\u201cWhen a person is arrested, following the public prosecutor\u2019s decision, a family member or another person designated by the arrested person shall be promptly informed of the arrest or the prolongation of the custody period.\u201d", "67.
