A moratorium on the enforcement of judgment debts has been introduced until such time as the mechanism for the forced sale of the property of such undertakings has been improved. No time-limit has been set. Article 2 of that Law provides that the prohibition on the forced sale of property includes the execution of writs by the State Bailiffs\u2019 Service on property belonging to such companies. The Law therefore stays the execution of all writs by the State Bailiffs\u2019 Service against the assets of or undertakings in which the State holds at least 25% of the share capital.", "19.

Under Article 85 of the Law, the creditor may file a complaint against actions or omissions of the State Bailiffs\u2019 Service with the head of the competent department of that Service or with a local court.

In its judgment, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine mentioned in particular:", "\u201cThe Constitutional Court considers that the Law [on the moratorium] does not violate the constitutional requirement about the binding nature of court judgments. Court judgments on the forced attachment of the property of enterprises, given both prior to and after the Law was adopted, have not been abolished by it; they remain in force, and their enforcement is suspended until the mechanism for the forced sale of property is improved. That means that the Law established an extended term of enforcement during this period....", "... the Constitutional Court of Ukraine has decided:", "1.
