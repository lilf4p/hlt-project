The respondent Government are represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "The applicant\u2019s mother, Mrs Lidiya Vasilyevna Korzhavina, born in 1922, and brother, Mr Anatoliy Nikolayevich Korzhavin, born in 1952, lived in Grozny, Chechnya.", "In 1999 the Russian Government launched a counter-terrorist operation in the Chechen Republic. The applicant lost contact with her relatives after November 1999.", "It appears that in April 2000 the applicant, who tried to obtain information about her relatives through the local police department, was informed by the Ministry of the Interior that her relatives had died in Grozny in January 2000.", "In July 2000 the head of the Oktyabrskiy district administration of Grozny informed the applicant that her relatives had been killed on 13 January 2000 as a result of a missile strike. The applicant was informed that the bodies of her relatives and of the third man who had died as a result of the same strike were buried in Grozny in July by the relatives of that man.", "In June 2001 a hospital in Grozny issued death certificates in respect of Mrs Korzhavina and Mr Korzhavin and indicated that the deaths had occurred on 13 January 2000 as the result of a missile attack.", "In March 2001 the applicant wrote to the prosecutor\u2019s office and informed them about her relatives\u2019 deaths. She sought the prosecutor\u2019s assistance in obtaining the death certificates from Grozny. It appears that in June 2001 the Chechnya Prosecutor\u2019s Office informed the applicant that they would examine her complaint about her relatives\u2019 deaths and notify her of the results. They also sent her copies of the death certificates obtained in the hospital in Grozny (see above).", "On 18 June 2001 the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office informed the applicant that the Grozny Prosecutor\u2019s Office had been instructed to establish the circumstances of her relatives\u2019 deaths.", "On 12 July 2001 the Grozny Town Prosecutor\u2019s Office, having conducted a check, decided not to open a criminal investigation into the applicant\u2019s relatives\u2019 deaths. The investigator collected several statements and found it established that the house at 71 Dalnaya Street had burned down in January 2000 and that there had been no eyewitnesses to the deaths. He concluded that no crime had been committed. The information was sent to the Chechnya Prosecutor\u2019s office in September 2001; it is unclear whether the applicant was notified at that time.", "It does not appear that after that date the applicant sought or received any information concerning the investigation from the prosecutor\u2019s office.", "In August 2001 the applicant wrote to the Chechnya Prosecutor\u2019s Office and sought their assistance in obtaining death certificates from the civil register office.", "On 6 November 2001 the district court in the Smolensk region certified the applicant\u2019s relatives\u2019 deaths.

On 28 May 2003 the District Court granted the request. It held that the applicant was the sole heir of her mother and brother and extended the time-limit for her to receive her inheritance for six months.

It is unclear if she received any response.", "The applicant then claimed compensation for the destroyed flat and other belongings under Government Decree no. 404 of 4 July 2003 (see below). Within the same proceedings the applicant also claimed non-pecuniary damages for the suffering caused by her relatives\u2019 deaths from the Russian Government.", "On 16 March 2005 the Presnenskiy District Court of Moscow issued its judgment. The court held that the compensation constituted a personal entitlement payable to the residents of Chechnya who had lost their houses and other property, but not to their heirs. In any event, the applicant had not applied to the Commission set up to consider compensation claims. The court further observed that the right to sue for compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage inflicted to life or health was not heritable. The court reiterated that the applicant\u2019s claim for non-pecuniary damages could not be directed against the Government, in the absence of a proven causal link between the actions of the Government and the damage claimed. It dismissed the applicant\u2019s claims. It stressed that she was still able to bring a tort action against the State. On 4 August 2005 the Moscow City Court upheld that judgment.", "In 2005 the applicant attempted to sue the Ministry of Finance for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages caused by the actions of State agents. On 12 April 2005 the Smolensk Regional Court, as the final level of jurisdiction, refused to accept the claim, for lack of territorial jurisdiction. On 1 July 2005 the Promyshlenny District Court in Smolensk refused to consider a similar claim, for lack of substantiating documents and failure to pay a reduced court fee of 500 roubles (RUB). The applicant did not appeal.", "The Government submitted 117 pages from the criminal investigation file opened into the deaths of Mrs Korzhavina and Mr Korzhavin. These documents can be summarised as follows.", "Following the communication of the applicant\u2019s complaint to the Government, on 26 February 2009 the Chechnya Prosecutor\u2019s Office quashed the decision of 12 July 2001 not to open a criminal investigation.

The applicant was informed the same day.", "In August 2009 the applicant was questioned and granted victim status in the proceedings.", "The investigators identified and questioned several neighbours and other witnesses, including the relatives of the third person who had died on 13 January 2000, together with the applicants\u2019 relatives. They also examined the site of the house and found some metal objects there, which were identified by an expert report as parts of a mine. They sought information from various military and other agencies about the location and actions of military units in January 2000, but it does not appear that anything of relevance was obtained. On 9 November 2009 the investigation was adjourned for failure to identify the culprits; the applicant was informed on the same day but did not appeal against that decision. It appears that on 17 November 2009 the investigation was reopened, of which the applicant was informed.", "Article 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides as following:", "\u201cArticle 125.
