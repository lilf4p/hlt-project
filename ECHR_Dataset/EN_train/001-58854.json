The applicant is a Lithuanian national, born in 1960. He lives in Klaip\u0117da, Lithuania.", "9. In May 1997, an owner of a caf\u00e9 alleged that the applicant had beaten him and threatened to take over the control of his property.", "10. The applicant was arrested on 19 May 1997. On 21 May 1997 he was brought before the Klaip\u0117da City District Court which issued a detention order against him. The court reasoned that the applicant might commit further crimes while under this current suspicion.", "11. On 22 May 1997 the applicant was indicted for attempting to obtain property by threats of force.", "12. On 27 June 1997 the applicant appealed against the decision to remand him in custody, claiming inter alia that there was no reason for his detention and asking for bail.", "13. On 3 July 1997 the Klaip\u0117da Regional Court dismissed the appeal. The applicant was not present at the hearing, but his counsel was. The Regional Court noted that the applicant had been brought before the District Court which had issued the detention order, and that the first instance court could therefore assess the need for him to be held in custody inter alia on the basis of his personality and attitude. The appellate court concluded that the first instance court had properly specified the danger of the applicant committing further crimes as the reason for his remand in custody.", "14. On 17 July 1997 the Klaip\u0117da City District Court extended the term of the applicant\u2019s detention, in his absence but with his counsel present. The court no longer held that the applicant might commit further crimes, but specified fresh grounds for the detention, namely that the applicant could abscond and influence witnesses.", "15. On 5 September 1997 the applicant appealed, claiming inter alia that his detention on remand was unlawful under domestic law and the Convention. He alleged in particular that the decision was arbitrary, as the court had presented no facts in support of its conclusion that he might abscond or influence witnesses. He requested bail.", "16. On 9 September 1997 a judge of the Klaip\u0117da Regional Court returned the appeal without examination. The judge informed the applicant by letter that the Code of Criminal Procedure did not provide for an appeal against a decision extending the term of detention.", "17. On 16 October 1997 a judge of the Klaip\u0117da City District Court committed the applicant to trial in the absence of the parties. In his decision the judge also decided that the applicant should remain in custody. No grounds or term for that detention were specified. The judge did not mention the applicant\u2019s complaints regarding the lawfulness of his detention.", "18. The charges against the applicant were subsequently replaced as he was indicted for affray. On 24 February 1998 the Klaip\u0117da District Court convicted him. He was sentenced to 1 year and 4 months\u2019 imprisonment. He did not appeal against the first instance judgment.", "19. The applicant has now been released from prison after having completed his sentence.", "II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW", "<Translations are given>", "20.
