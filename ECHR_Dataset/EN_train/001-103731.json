He is a professor of law at the University of Athens and is represented before the Court by Mr N. Alivizatos and Mr E. Malios, lawyers practising in Athens. The Greek Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) are represented by their deputy Agents, Mr G. Kanellopoulos, Adviser, State Legal Council, and Mr I. Bakopoulos, Legal Assistant, State Legal Council.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "In 1989 the applicant bought an apartment of a total surface area of 168.37 square metres, situated on the fifth floor of a block of flats on Mitsaion Street, in the centre of Athens. Mitsaion Street is just off the pedestrian precinct that surrounds the Acropolis and serves as the main access to the broader archaeological site.", "On 28 January 1997 the block of flats, including the applicant\u2019s apartment, was expropriated by a joint ministerial decision, for the purpose of building the new Acropolis Museum.", "On 23 February 2001 the Minister of Finance issued a decision revaluing the \u201cobjective value\u201d of the properties in the zone where the applicant\u2019s flat was situated, setting it at 360,000 drachmas (around 1,056 euros) per square metre (decision no. 1015544/770/00/\u03a4\u03a5\u0394/23-2-2001).", "On 16 May 2001 the applicant applied to the Supreme Administrative Court for judicial review of the above-mentioned ministerial decision, claiming that the amount of the objective value was extremely low.", "On 29 May 2002 the Supreme Administrative Court annulled the ministerial decision on the grounds that it had not taken into consideration the specific features of the area and that it was not clear from the case file that the decision had a solid basis and sufficient justification (judgment no. 1585/2002).", "On 28 February 2002 the Greek State and the Archaeological Receipts Fund (\u03a4\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03bf \u0391\u03c1\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03a0\u03cc\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u0391\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ce\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd) lodged an action with the Athens Court of First Instance for the assessment of a provisional unit amount for compensation per cubic metre. They submitted that the figure of 1,320.62 euros (EUR) per cubic metre corresponded to the value of the applicant\u2019s apartment. In his submissions, the applicant proposed the sum of EUR 2,050 per cubic metre.", "On 7 June 2002 the case was heard before the Athens Court of First Instance. On 19 September 2002 the court delivered its judgment, assessing the provisional unit amount for compensation at EUR 1,400 per cubic metre (judgment no. 1885/2002). After taking into consideration a technical report drawn up by an architect, K.C., and two valuations, drafted by B.P and P.K. and submitted by the parties, the court stated that", "\u201c... The building is situated in a privileged location near the centre of Athens and has an excellent view of the Acropolis ... It is a fact that the building in issue, like all the buildings that have been expropriated for the construction of the new Acropolis Museum, is in a prime location on account of its proximity to the historical centre of the city of Athens, [where] real estate demand exceeds existing supply.\u201d", "The court also relied on comparative data, such as the compensation awarded for the expropriation of two adjacent and three neighbouring buildings and the price obtained from the sale of three neighbouring buildings.", "On 26 February 2003 the Greek State and the Archaeological Receipts Fund lodged an action with the Athens Court of Appeal for the assessment of the final unit amount for compensation, claiming that the amounts awarded by judgment no. 1885/2002 were excessive. With regard to the applicant\u2019s apartment, they claimed that its real value was estimated at EUR 1,320.62 per square metre (corresponding approximately to EUR 412.7 per cubic metre).", "In reply, the applicant alleged abuse of process by the State since it was proposing an amount considerably lower than the one it had proposed before the Court of First Instance. He maintained, further, that all the relevant reports had been drawn up by the administrative authorities using cubic metres as the unit of measurement of the expropriated apartments, so the calculation ought to have been made in cubic metres. Lastly, the applicant contended that the cadastral plan showing the apartments that were to be expropriated expressed the volume in cubic metres and not the surface area in square metres. Accordingly, the applicant argued that were the Court of Appeal to estimate the value of his apartment in square metres, the administrative authority concerned would be unable to calculate and pay adequate compensation.", "On 27 May 2003 the case was heard before the Athens Court of Appeal. On 10 September 2003 that court delivered its judgment. After having referred to the testimonies of the witnesses who gave evidence before the court and those of the witnesses who had appeared before the Athens Court of First Instance, to three reports drawn up by qualified surveyors, to the technical report drawn up by the architect K.C. and to two valuations submitted by B.P and P.K., the court considered that the following was proven:", "\u201c... Mitsaion Street is part of the historical centre of Athens and is included in the \u201cUnification of Archaelogical Sites of Athens\u201d programme. It is tree-lined, with zero traffic and no noise ... The wider area, defined as a traditional zone of the city of Athens, is characterised by the co-existence of older, protected buildings and more modern dwellings with a view of the Acropolis, such as the fifth and sixth floors of the building in issue. In the technical report, dated 3 July 2002, K.C. certified that the interiors of the apartments are luxurious and in very good condition ...", "The objective value of the building amounts to 360,000 drachmas (around EUR 1,056) per square metre according to ministerial decision no. 1015544/770/00/\u03a4\u03a5\u0394/23-2-2001 revaluing the \u201cobjective value\u201d of the properties in the zone where the applicant\u2019s flat is situated [decision of 23 February 2001]. However, following an application for judicial review submitted before the Supreme Administrative Court, the latter annulled the above ministerial decision on the grounds that it did not state that the specificities of the zone had been taken into consideration (...)", "As far as the market value is concerned, according to the experts appointed by the expropriated party ... it varies between EUR 4,500 and 7,000 per square metre. According to their technical expertise the value of the ground floor amounted to EUR 1,050 per cubic metre, to EUR 1,700 per cubic metre as regards the first floor, to EUR 1,870 per cubic metre as regards the second floor and to EUR 1,050 per cubic metre as regards the third floor. The witness called by the expropriating party referred only to the objective value of the building, which amounted to EUR 1,050 per square metre; as far as the market value was concerned he merely noted that the buildings situated in D.Areopagitou Street were in a more privileged location than the ones in Mitsaion Street ... whereas another witness called by [the expropriating party] declared during the proceedings for the assessment of the provisional unit amount for compensation that he agreed with the market value proposed by the State ... The Athens Court of First Instance assessed the provisional unit amount for compensation ... for the fifth floor at EUR 1,400 per cubic metre ...", "As far as the market value of the apartments is concerned, it should be noted, however, that the fact that the amounts assessed by the Athens Court of First Instance were only 5% higher than the amounts proposed by the State and the Archaeological Receipts Fund was obviously because they [the State and the Archaeological Receipts Fund] had requested, clearly in error (\u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03ae), the assessment in cubic metres, influenced by the measurements used in the cadastral report, which gives the volume [of the apartments] in cubic metres ...", "In support of their arguments the parties referred to and submitted the following evidence and comparative information.", "The State submitted judgment no. 3195/2001 of the Athens Court of Appeal determining the final unit amount at ... 50,000 drachmas [approximately EUR 146] per square metre for the building situated at 7\u03b3\u03b4 Hatzihristou Street; judgment no. 2558/2001 of the same court determining the final unit amount of the building situated at 5 Hatzihristou Street at 400,000 drachmas [approximately EUR 1,173] for the third floor; judgments nos. 861/2000 and 1130/2000 of Athens First Instance Court ... determining the unit amount of two buildings situated at 55 and 76 Hatzihristou Street respectively at ... 85,000 drachmas [approximately EUR 248] for the ground floor and 60,000 drachmas [approximately EUR 176] per square metre ... All the foregoing comparative data concern less privileged properties than the building in issue, because Hatzihristou Street is noisier than Mitsaion Street and, moreover, does not have a direct view of the Acropolis. [The State also submitted] judgment no. 3170/2001 of the Athens Court of Appeal determining the final unit price for a building situated in Mitsaion Street at 80,000 drachmas [approximately EUR 234] per square metre. This comparative data concerns a less privileged dwelling than the building in issue ... [The State also submitted] judgment no. 1582/2002 of the Athens Court of Appeal which had determined the final unit price of a building situated in 14 Mitsaion Street at EUR 587 per square metre. This comparative element concerns a less privileged building than the one in issue because it does not have a direct view of the Acropolis and Lycabettus hill ... [The State also produced] judgment no. 3963/2002 of the Athens Court of Appeal determining the final unit amount for a building situated at 15 Dionysiou Areopagitou Street at ... 650,000 drachmas [approximately EUR 1,907] per square metre for the third floor. This comparative data concerns a more privileged building than the one in issue as it is related to one of the most expensive, if not the most expensive, streets in Athens with an \u201cobjective value\u201d of 800,000 drachmas [approximately EUR 2,347] per square metre, whereas the objective value of Mitsaion Street amounts to approximately 360,000 drachmas [EUR 1,056] per square metre ... [The State also submitted] judgments nos. 1633/2001 and 1113/2002 of the First Instance Court of Athens which had determined the provisional unit price of buildings situated in 15 and 5-5 \u03b1 Hatzihristou Street at (...) EUR 733 per cubic metre as regards the ground floor, EUR 880 per cubic metre as regards the first floor and EUR 1 027 per cubic metre as regards the second floor. These judgments do not constitute solid evidence as the prices included are not definitive.", "[The expropriated party] submitted judgment no. 8747/2001 of the Athens Court of Appeal determining the final unit amount of a building situated in 12 Mitsaion Street at ... EUR 1,526 per square metre. This comparative data concerns a less privileged building than the one in issue ... [The expropriated party also produced] a sale contract ... of a building ... located at the junction of Dionysiou Areopagitou Street and Mitsaion Street, ... for the price of 1,130,000 drachmas [approximately EUR 3,316] per square metre, namely, 4.5 times higher than the \u201cobjective value...\u201d. Finally, [the expropriated party] submitted price values taken from small ads published in the newspaper \u201cI Kathimerini\u201d, namely (...) 440,200 drachmas (EUR 1,334) per cubic metre for an apartment of 110 square metres located in Mitsaion Street. These prices may only be indicative of the real value of the properties concerned as it is not certain that they will constitute the final price agreed upon by the contracting parties\u201d.", "The Court of Appeal concluded, having regard to the aforementioned evidence that the real value of the applicant\u2019s apartment amounted to EUR 600 per cubic metre (judgment no. 6821/2003).", "On 7 September 2004 the applicant appealed to the Court of Cassation on points of law. The applicant alleged, inter alia, that the Athens Court of Appeal had taken into consideration the ministerial decision revaluing the \u201cobjective value\u201d of the properties in the zone where his flat was situated even though that decision had been annulled by the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s judgment no. 1585/2002. He claimed, further, that the Court of Appeal had distorted the content of judgment no. 1885/2002 of the Court of First Instance, considering that the assessment in cubic metres had been made in error. According to the applicant, that consideration allowed the Court of Appeal to attach less importance to the assessment made by the Court of First Instance and to avoid giving sufficient and solid reasons for the large divergence from its findings.", "On 25 April 2007 the Court of Cassation delivered its judgment, dismissing the applicant\u2019s appeal (judgment no. 877/2007). It stated, inter alia, that", "\u201cIn the present case the Court of Appeal considered that ... a report drawn up by the evaluation committee under section 15 of Law no. 2882/2001 did not need to be submitted since the expropriated property was included in the \u201cobjective value determination\u201d system; furthermore, it took into consideration the objective value of the expropriated building, which amounted to 360,000 drachmas per square metre, as had been determined by ministerial decision no. 1015544/770/00/\u03a4\u03a5\u0394/23-2-2001, even though that decision had been annulled by judgment no. 1585/2002 of the Supreme Administrative Court. These considerations were sufficiently and clearly reasoned and contained no contradictions ... [the judgment in issue] did not infringe Article 17 of the Constitution or Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention, and did not deal with the latter at all.", "...", "[T]he Court of Appeal did not alter the content of that document, since it copied into its judgment in issue ... the operative part of the Athens Court of First Instance\u2019s judgment no. 1885/2002. Furthermore, it is true that it provides some explanation (which was not necessary) and notes that: \u201cAs far as the market value of the apartments is concerned, it should be noted, however, that the fact that the amounts assessed by the Athens Court of First Instance were only 5% higher than the amounts proposed by the State and the Archaeological Receipts Fund was obviously due to the fact that they [the State and the Archaeological Receipts Fund] had requested, clearly in error (\u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03ae), the assessment in cubic metres\u201d; however, this does not mean that the Court of Appeal misinterpreted the operative part of the aforementioned judgment or distorted its content by replacing the unit for measuring volume (cubic metres) with the unit for measuring surface area (square metres).", "...", "The request before the Court of Appeal is autonomous and is not a remedy against the judgment delivered by the Court of First Instance. Furthermore, in the above-mentioned explanatory note, the Court of Appeal considered that it had been \u201cclearly in error\u201d that the State had requested, before the Court of First Instance, the assessment of a provisional unit amount for compensation per cubic metre, thus Article 116 [abuse of process by the parties] of the Code of Penal Procedure was not infringed.\u201d", "The relevant parts of the Greek Constitution provide as follows:", "\u201c1.

Moreover, Law no. 2882/2001 provides that after an expropriation order has been issued, a three-member committee composed of civil servants shall estimate the value of the expropriated properties and the amounts of compensation due.
