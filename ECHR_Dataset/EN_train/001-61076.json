The applicant\u2019s brother Mehmet Salim Acar was a farmer living in Ambar, a village in the Bismil district in south-east Turkey. On 20 August 1994, while Mehmet Salim was working in a cotton field near Ambar, a white or grey Renault car without any registration plates stopped. Two armed men in plain clothes \u2013 claiming to be police officers \u2013 got out of the car and asked Mehmet Salim to accompany them in order to help them find a field. When Mehmet Salim refused to get into the car, the two men threatened him with their weapons.

When we went to sit under a tree to have lunch, \u0130lhan Ezer, who was working in the field, joined us. There was a twenty-metre distance between my father and me. At this point, a grey-coloured taxi with no number plates came and stopped near my father. The persons in the car spoke with my father. I saw them take the identity cards of my father and of the person called \u0130lhan and then return \u0130lhan\u2019s identity card, and I saw my father get into the taxi. This taxi immediately headed towards the village of Ambar. Later, I went home and informed my mother.

That is all I know and what I have witnessed.\u201d", "52. \u0130lhan Ezer\u2019s statement of 2 September 1994 to the public prosecutor, which was read out to him before he signed it, reads:", "\u201cOn the day of the incident, while Mehmet Salih Acar and I were having lunch in the field below the village of Ambar, a Renault TX model grey taxi without number plates approached us.

Both of them were about 25 or 26 years old. One of them was wearing glasses. They did not give back Mehmet Salih\u2019s identity card.
