On 29 June 1989, on an appeal by the applicant against the judgment of 4 May 1988, in which the Commercial Court had not rescinded the bankruptcy order, the Ghent Court of Appeal, exercising its power to determine also the merits of the case, upheld the judgment of 6 May 1987 (see paragraph 10 above), having heard the submissions to that effect of the deputy procureur du Roi that had been read out at the hearing of the case on 27 April 1989.", "13.
