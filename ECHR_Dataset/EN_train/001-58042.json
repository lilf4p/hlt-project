By an order of 1 August 1990 the Supreme Military Council (Y\u00fcksek Askeri S\u00fbrasi), composed of the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defence, the Chief of Staff and the eleven highest-ranking generals in the armed forces, ordered the compulsory retirement of three officers, including Mr Kala\u00e7, and twenty-eight non-commissioned officers for breaches of discipline and scandalous conduct. The decision, which was based on section 50 (c) of the Military Personnel Act, section 22 (c) of the Military Legal Service Act and Article 99 (e) of the Regulations on assessment of officers and non-commissioned officers, made the specific criticism, in the applicant\u2019s case, that his conduct and attitude \"revealed that he had adopted unlawful fundamentalist opinions\".", "9.

In a judgment of 30 May 1991 the Supreme Administrative Court of the Armed Forces ruled by four votes to three that it did not have jurisdiction to entertain the application to set aside the order of 1 August 1990, on the ground that under Article 125 of the Constitution the decisions of the Supreme Military Council were final and not subject to judicial review. In that connection it observed that under the Military Legal Service Act members of the military legal service had the status of military personnel. Their compulsory retirement for breaches of discipline was regulated in the same manner as that of other army officers.", "In their dissenting opinion the three members of the minority referred to the principle of the independence of the judiciary enunciated in Article 139 of the Constitution.
