UKRAINE", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant, Ms Liliya Nikolayevna Anisina, is a Ukrainian national who was born in 1952 and lives in Makyiyvka. The Ukrainian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agents, Mrs I. Shevchuk and Mr Y. Zaytsev.", "The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Makyiyvka.", "In April 2001 she instituted proceedings in the Sovetskyy District Court of Makyiyvka against Mr M., seeking recovery of a debt and compensation for non-pecuniary damage. The applicant submitted that on 10 June 2000 Mr M. had borrowed USD 3,000 from her, which he had undertaken to give back in two months. In September 2000 the applicant asked him to return the money, but Mr M. refused.", "In the course of the proceedings, Mr M. confirmed that he had received the money from the applicant. He however stated that the applicant had given him the money for the use in commercial transactions under the condition that he would pay her 60% of his monthly income. Mr M. further stated that by November 2000 he had given the full amount back to the applicant.", "On 9 July 2001 the court ruled in part for the applicant. It found that the parties had reached an oral agreement on the money loan, which was evidenced by their submissions before the court. The court also noted that in 2000 Mr M. had made similar written submissions to the police, confirming that he had taken the money from the applicant for the use in his commercial transactions.", "The court further found that the submissions of Mr M. that he had paid back the money were unsubstantiated, as they were not supported by any documentary evidence.", "It ordered Mr M. to pay the applicant the equivalent of USD 3,000 in the Ukrainian national currency (hryvnya). The court also awarded her UAH 2,000 in compensation for non-pecuniary damage.", "Mr M. appealed, alleging that the first instance court had erred in establishing the facts of the case. In particular, he stated that, since the court had found that there had been a debt without having any documentary evidence before it, it should not have rejected his submissions that the debt had been paid in full.", "On 20 September 2001 the Donetsk Regional Court of Appeal (the Donetsk Court) quashed the judgment of 9 July 2001. It held, referring to Article 375 of the Civil Code of 1963, that Mr M. should not have been required to provide documentary evidence to establish that he had fulfilled the obligation deriving from the contract which had been concluded orally. Such a requirement existed in respect of written contracts. Since the applicant failed to provide any documentary evidence to demonstrate that there was an outstanding debt, which was contested by Mr M., her claim for the recovery of that debt was rejected as unsubstantiated.", "By the same judgment, the court of appeal ordered the applicant to pay the State the court fee of UAH 181.40.", "The applicant appealed in cassation, alleging that the judgment of the Donetsk Court was arbitrary. On 11 January 2002 the panel of three judges of the Supreme Court rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal, finding that the judgment of the court of appeal was lawful.", "On 28 March 2002 the Donetsk Court adopted a supplementary decision, by which it rejected the applicant\u2019s claim for compensation for non-pecuniary damage as unsubstantiated. The applicant did not appeal in cassation against that decision, as, according to her, it was not to be appealed under Ukrainian law.", "The relevant provisions of the Code read as follows:", "\u201c[The following] should be concluded in writing:", "2) agreements between citizens concerning a sum of more than 100 karbovantsiv[]...", "3) other agreements between citizens which the law requires to be concluded in a written form...\u201d", "\u201cThe parties shall have no right to refer to witnesses\u2019 statements to prove the existence of a contract in case of a dispute, if that contract was not put in writing, which was required by the law[.
