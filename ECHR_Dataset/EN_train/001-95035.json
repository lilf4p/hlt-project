The applicant was born in 1943 and lives in Solone Ozero.", "6. In April 1993 the administration of Penitentiary no. 314/60, where the applicant was serving a prison sentence at the time, submitted to the Slovyanoserbsk Department of the Ministry of the Interior a list of prisoners, with their former Soviet passports, who, following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, had expressed a wish to become Ukrainian citizens. The applicant's name was among them.", "7. A stamp reading \u201cAnnulled\u201d was put in the applicant's old Soviet passport.", "8. According to a letter written on an unspecified date by the administration of Penitentiary no. 60 to the applicant, the latter acquired Ukrainian citizenship in 1993.", "9. On an unspecified date in 1999 the applicant was detained on suspicion of attempted murder and robbery. According to him, he was beaten in police custody. On 10 November 1999 the Kherson Regional Court sentenced the applicant to fifteen years' imprisonment and ordered the confiscation of all of his personal property following his conviction for these offences.", "10. On 21 December 1999 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant's cassation appeal against this conviction. However, it reduced the sentence to thirteen years' imprisonment.", "11. Shortly after the ruling of the Supreme Court, the applicant was transferred to Penitentiary no. 45 in the Dnipropetrovsk region to serve his sentence.", "12. In 2007 the applicant complained to the prosecution authorities about his alleged ill-treatment during the pre-trial investigation in 1999. In reply, he was informed that his complaint had been lodged too late and could not be investigated given the considerable lapse of time and that all the relevant documents had been destroyed.", "13. During 2007 and 2008 the applicant unsuccessfully sought the overturning of his conviction through an extraordinary review procedure.", "14. In September 2008 the applicant was released on parole.", "15. On 15 June 1999 a forensic psychiatric examination was held to establish whether the applicant could be held criminally liable for the charges brought against him. Along with finding the applicant sane, it noted that he had complained of pain in his legs, weakened eyesight and dizziness, had painless concussion caused by a past head injury, had a diminished ankle reflex, and suffered from encephalopathy, a degenerative disease of the brain, caused by a trauma and atherosclerosis.", "16. On 17 February 2005 the applicant was examined by a group of disability experts in Penitentiary no. 45 and recognised as falling into the \u201csecond category\u201d of invalidity for a one-year period on account of stable moderate hypertension, hypertensive retinal angiopathy of both eyes, ischaemic heart disease, stable stenocardia, diffuse cardiosclerosis, Leriche's syndrome, cerebral atherosclerosis, phaco-sclerosis (cataracts), and chronic hepato-cholecystitis (inflammation of the gall bladder and liver).", "17.

In 2006 the applicant complained to the prosecution authorities that although, according to him, he suffered from certain illnesses which he believed made him eligible for early release, on 17 February 2005 the medical experts had wrongly established his diagnoses because they were biased against him. He requested another medical examination to be held in any other region. The prosecution found the applicant's complaint unsubstantiated. The Dnipropetrovsk Regional Department of the State Department for Enforcement of Sentences (hereinafter \u201cthe SDES\u201d) offered him the opportunity to undergo another medical examination by independent doctors in the Dnipropetrovsk region, which he refused.", "19. On 18 August 2006 the SDES informed the applicant, following his request, that there were no medical reasons to seek his early release before the court and that he was being \u201cprovided medical treatment in accordance with the established diagnoses\u201d. The applicant commented that it was not the medical treatment that he was complaining about, but the alleged inaccuracy of his medical diagnoses, due to which he had not been qualified for early release on health grounds.", "20. According to the information provided by the applicant, in 2008 the prison doctors treated him for atherosclerosis of the lower limbs with nicotinic acid injections, which he found to be of little help. The applicant alleged that the treatment was insufficient and therefore, following his release in September 2008, he was in need of surgery.", "21. On 1 October 2008 a Doppler sonography of the applicant's lower limbs was performed in the Chernigiv Hospital no. 2, which diagnosed him with blockage of the left and right iliac arteries.", "22.

On 13 March 2006 the Registry received from the applicant the application form dated 3 March 2006, in which he maintained that he was unable to send copies of all the documents he needed to substantiate his complaints as the penitentiary authorities had allegedly refused to provide him with those copies.", "25. In a letter of 24 March 2006 the Registry of the Court informed the applicant that under Article 34 of the Convention, State bodies are under an obligation not to create obstacles to the effective exercise of the right of individual petition. The letter also stated that the refusal of the prison administration to provide copies of the relevant documents could be examined by the Court from the point of view of compliance of its acts with the obligations of the State under Article 34 of the Convention. The letter also contained a copy of Order no. 13 of the SDES of 25 January 2006 \u201cOn Approval of the Instruction on Review of Correspondence of Persons Held in Penitentiaries and Pre-trial Detention Facilities\u201d.", "26. On 28 April and 24 May 2006 the applicant informed the Court that the penitentiary authorities had refused to hand the attachment sent by the Registry of the Court with the letter of 24 March 2006 over to him. He further stated that he still did not have access to copies of all the documents he needed.", "27. The applicant complained about the above to the prosecution authorities.", "28. On 28 September 2006, following the communication by the Court of the application to the Government, the applicant, at the request of the prison administration, wrote \u201can explanatory note\u201d, in which he noted, inter alia: that starting from \u201cmid 2006\u201d he had been provided with the possibility to copy documents from his case file by hand; that the attachment sent by the Registry of the Court on 24 March 2006 had never been served on him; and that he had no complaints regarding the dispatching of his correspondence to the Court by the prison authorities.", "29. According to the applicant, he was able to copy documents from his case file by hand twice a week for twenty to thirty minutes.", "30. From 15 December 2006 to 24 May 2007 the applicant was represented before the Court by a lawyer.", "31. On 31 July 2007 the Prosecutor of the Dnipropetrovsk Region found unsubstantiated the applicant's complaint concerning the seizure by the prison administration of the attachment sent to him by the Court. The prosecutor referred to the Prisons' Internal Regulations of 25 December 2003 (see paragraph 41 below), according to which convicts were entitled to keep copies of verdicts and judicial rulings. Thus, since the document at issue had been outside that category, its seizure did not amount to a violation on the part of the prison administration.", "32. On 12 March 2008 the applicant received the attachment at issue from the prison administration.", "33. On the same day the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Prosecutor's Office reaffirmed its earlier finding that by having seized the above document, the prison administration had not committed any violation.", "34.
