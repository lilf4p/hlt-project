{"ITEMID": "001-60450", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 2002, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF McVICAR v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["8. The applicant is a British national, born in 1940 and living in London.", "9. The applicant, who has a sociology degree, is a journalist and broadcaster. He has written for many national newspapers and magazines and has made a number of appearances on radio and television.", "In September 1995 an article was published in Spiked magazine in which the applicant suggested that the athlete Linford Christie used banned performance-enhancing drugs. The article stated, inter alia:", "\u201cOn the basis of circumstantial evidence many believe, but cannot prove that Christie has been taking performance-enhancing drugs ... If he has been outwitting the testers for years, it is extremely unlikely that Christie will be caught in the few months left before his likely retirement from competitive sprinting. Nevertheless, there is no bloody hypodermic needle, and no direct evidence that points the finger at Christie. ...", "Certainly the ten days between injuring himself in Gothenburg and winning in Zurich would have allowed Christie to recover from a slight hamstring injury and, without fear of a random test, put in seven days intensive training, boosted by banned drugs, and perhaps human growth hormone, that would give him the explosiveness and power to run 10.03 seconds into a headwind. We don't know. ...", "Christie exhibits a number of other possible effects of these performance-enhancing drugs. His remarkable physique, in regard to both its bulk and definition, is consistent with the use of anabolic steroids. ... Similar considerations apply to speed (sic) with which he put on weight. In the early part of his career, he was a beanpole sprinter but between 1986 and 1988 he put on 13 kg in bodyweight to come in at the 70 kg powerhouse that he has stayed at since. Steroids have other side-effects ... Three of the commonest are grandiosity, fixated delusions and a persecution complex. Linford genuinely seems to think that running a hundred metres faster than anyone else is rather more than an exciting, even unique spectacle, but some kind of monumental contribution to human culture. ...", "Human growth hormone ... costs \u00a31,200 for a week's supply. Miboerone is a steroid that is even more expensive ... Christie is rich. He also shows most of the physical, behavioural and psychological features of an athlete that regularly uses steroids. This conclusion is reinforced generally by the performances that he continues to turn in at an age when psychologically he should be in decline and specifically by his uncanny quick recovery from his injury at Gothenburg. ...", "Aside from all the non-testing criteria that provide circumstantial evidence to suggest that Christie may be a regular user, the final clinching one is Christie's own character and attitude to competition. He is a win-at-all-cost athlete and his determination to succeed may lead people to believe that he would not deprive himself of an advantage enjoyed by some of his rivals, thereby denying himself his only chance of fame and fortune.\u201d", "10. In December 1995 Mr Christie commenced an action in the High Court for defamation against the applicant, the magazine's editor and the publishing company. The editor and publishing company were represented by a solicitor-advocate specialising in defamation and media litigation, Mr David Price. Mr Price had advised the publishing company prior to publication about the legality of the article in question. A separate action was launched by Mr Christie against the printers and various distributors of the magazine.", "11. During the greater part of the proceedings the applicant represented himself because he could not afford to pay legal fees and because, under Schedule 2, Part II, of the Legal Aid Act 1988, legal aid was not available for defamation actions. His defence was that the allegations made in the article were true in substance and in fact.", "In a newspaper article among the papers submitted by the applicant to the Court, it was reported that the applicant had, in June 1996, successfully defended himself in criminal proceedings concerning a charge of assaulting a neighbour.", "12. On 28 June 1996 there was a directions hearing at which Mr Price (on behalf of the editor and publishing company), the applicant and counsel for Mr Christie made representations. An order was made requiring, inter alia, that the plaintiff and the defendants should exchange statements of witnesses of fact by 2 October 1996, and could each call four expert witnesses (a physiologist, a pharmacologist, a psychologist and an athletics coach), but only if the substance of each expert's evidence was disclosed in a report to be exchanged by 30 October 1996. These time-limits were subsequently extended by consent to some time in December 1996 and April 1997 respectively.", "13. The applicant wished to rely on the evidence of an athlete, Geoffrey Walusimbi, who had allegedly told the applicant that Mr Christie had introduced him to performance-enhancing drugs. In respect of Mr Walusimbi the applicant served the following document dated 19 December 1996, which purported to be a statement of the nature of the evidence intended to be adduced under the Rules of the Supreme Court (RSC), Order 38, Rule 2A(5) (see below):", "\u201cThe second defendant has issued a subpoena on Mr Geoffrey Walusimbi ... He intends to adduce evidence from him concerning:", "(a) his masked appearance on the Panorama [television] programme 'Drug Olympics' ... in which he admitted taking performance-enhancing drugs;", "(b) his training relationship with Linford Christie;", "(c) his trips abroad with Linford Christie to various Sports Clinics, in particular one in Florida, 'First Medical';", "(d) his knowledge of Linford Christie's own use of performance-enhancing drugs.\u201d", "14. One of the expert witnesses whom the applicant wished to call was an osteopath called Terry Moule. Mr Moule had been involved in sports medicine for over twenty years and had treated Mr Christie. He allegedly told the applicant that as a result of his experience he was able to tell by the look and feel of an athlete's body whether that athlete had taken performance-enhancing drugs, and that he was certain that Mr Christie had been a regular user. However, because of his previous association with Mr Christie, Mr Moule did not wish to give a statement. The applicant did not, therefore, serve any form of report in respect of Mr Moule's expert evidence as required by the order for directions. Instead, in April 1997, he served the following document, which he mistakenly believed to be acceptable under the RSC, Order 38, Rule 2A(5) in place of an expert's report:", "\u201cTerry Moule is a professional physiotherapist and went to the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games as team physiotherapist for the athletics squad. He is conversant with the effects of steroids on the body and talks about 'steroid feel' and the particular look of a body that has been built up using anabolic-androgenic steroids. He is an expert on how the body responds to these drugs when supplemented by power lifting. He understands the effects of ageing on the performance of 'fast-twitch' muscle. He has massaged the Plaintiff in the early part of his career.", "A subpoena has been taken out for Terry Moule.\u201d", "15. The trial was listed to start on 15 June 1998. By this time, the applicant was the sole defendant in the proceedings because the editor had been killed in a traffic accident in September 1996 and the publishing company had become insolvent. On 30 April 1998 the applicant instructed Mr Price, who had had no involvement in the case since the death of the editor, to represent him as his solicitor-advocate. Mr Price had previously given advice to the editor and the publishing company both prior to, and following, publication of the article and had drafted a defence to Mr Christie's action on the limited information then available.", "16. Mr Christie applied to prevent Mr Price from acting on the grounds that he had previously been responsible for the decision to publish the article concerned, having given legal advice to the editor, and that the legality of that decision was itself now at issue. As a result, Mr Christie argued that Mr Price had a conflict of interest. Mr Christie's application was granted by the trial judge, Mr Justice Popplewell, in the High Court on 8 June 1998, but his decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal three days later. The applicant was represented by Mr Price at both hearings.", "17. About a week before the trial Mr Christie's solicitors indicated that they intended to make an application to the trial judge seeking to prevent the applicant from calling a number of witnesses, including Mr Moule and Mr Walusimbi. Mr Price had, since being instructed by the applicant, made efforts to secure full statements from those witnesses. Following the indication received from Mr Christie's solicitors, Mr Moule agreed to make a signed statement, in which he described, inter alia, the effects of steroids and the high level of usage amongst athletes, and stated that \u201cit would be almost impossible to succeed at the highest levels in the 100 metre [event] without the use of banned performance-enhancing drugs\u201d. This statement was served on Mr Christie's solicitors at 3 p.m. on Friday 12 June 1998, one working hour before the trial was due to commence.", "18. On 15 and 16 June 1998 Mr Justice Popplewell heard preliminary submissions from Mr Price on behalf of the applicant and counsel for Mr Christie as to the admissibility of the evidence of the witnesses concerned. On 15 June 1998, in relation to the admissibility of the expert evidence of Mr Moule and a Professor Beckett on behalf of the applicant, he ruled as follows:", "\u201cThe rules [on disclosure of evidence] are designed to avoid an ambush. ... They are not to beat inefficient litigants. There is provision for the Judge in exercise of his duty to give leave for evidence to be called. Mr Price at the forefront of his argument says the obligation was on the Plaintiff to ensure that the Plaintiff was not taken by surprise. That is a misunderstanding of the rules of the Court. The rules provide that if the party wants to call an expert he should provide the substance of the expert's report. Mr Price contends that Mr Moule's expert statement leads to one conclusion; having observed the Plaintiff and massaged his body, everybody should understand what Mr Moule was going to say. I think there is another way of reading the evidence. The Plaintiff might have concluded that it was useless evidence. This is compounded by the fact that Mr Moule's statement deals with the ability to observe the effect of anabolic steroids but nowhere does he say that about the Plaintiff. The nearest he gets is at paragraph 8 where he says that at least 70% of athletes use steroids systematically. That statement adds nothing to the defence as pleaded.", "There is no obligation on a party to draw the attention of the other party to the defect in its witness statements. At trial the admissibility of statements is often dealt with. There is criticism of the Plaintiff on this point but it is false. The obligation is on the party to make sure that it complies with Orders. It has not been suggested that the Defendant was unable to obtain written statements. The fact that he has statements suggests quite the contrary. The Defendant was a litigant in person but Mr Price acted for a period of time and Mr McVicar is not inexperienced. He has very much in mind what is involved. It may be said that Mr Price did not have full conduct but he has had since 30 April 1998. A review would have revealed that the statements did not comply with the Orders made. ... That I have discretion is clear. The exercise of that discretion is to ensure a fair disposal. ...\u201d", "The judge continued that he had to balance the prejudice that would be suffered by the applicant if the evidence were excluded against that which would be suffered by Mr Christie if Mr Moule's testimony were admitted. It would be unfair to allow Mr Moule to give evidence at trial without giving Mr Christie time to call counter-evidence, but to order an adjournment for this purpose would itself be prejudicial to Mr Christie because the applicant did not have sufficient means to provide an indemnity for the extra costs which would be incurred as a result. The judge concluded: \u201cIf there is more prejudice to the Defendant than the Plaintiff he is the person who is responsible. The fault lies with him. I will not allow Mr Moule's evidence.\u201d He also refused the applicant leave to adduce that part of Professor Beckett's evidence which dealt with the efficacy of drug testing and the ease with which the ban on drug taking could be evaded on the basis that these issues were not pleaded by the applicant and an amendment to the pleading should not be allowed.", "19. On 16 June 1998 the judge refused to grant the applicant's request for leave to admit Mr Walusimbi's evidence, on the ground that it would be unfair to Mr Christie to be faced with wide allegations about his drug taking, the details of which he would not know until Mr Walusimbi took the stand.", "20. The applicant appealed against these rulings to the Court of Appeal. He was again represented by Mr Price at the appeal hearing, which took place on 18 June 1998. Lord Justice May, delivering the judgment of the court, commented, as had the trial judge, that the interests of the applicant were \u201cidentical\u201d to those of his previous co-defendants, the editor and the publishing company. He went on:", "\u201cI deal with Mr Moule's statement first. The gist statement served in April 1997 relating to Mr Moule contained very little detail of the substance of the evidence that he might give. It refers only to Mr Moule's experience and qualifications as a physiotherapist and then says baldly that he massaged the plaintiff during the early part of his career. The witness statement now served gives a more detailed account of his experience and names some of the sportspeople, including the plaintiff, whom he has treated. It refers to the benefit and effect of anabolic steroids for athletes, particularly in the 100 metres event. It states that in Mr Moule's experience a large proportion of professional athletes use steroids. It says that from his experience Mr Moule is generally able to tell by looking whether an athlete is taking steroids and that he can also tell this if he manipulates their muscles. ...", "Mr Price accepts that the gist statement did not put forward any affirmative version of what Mr Moule might say, but he submits that it could be inferred that Mr Moule would give the evidence that the look and feel of the plaintiff's body indicates use of banned drugs. I do not accept this submission. This gist statement is not even inferentially a statement of the evidence intended to be adduced such as is referred to in Order 38, Rule 2A(5). ...", "Matters which Mr Price would have us infer are intended to be said by Mr Moule are neither pleaded nor the subject of any previously served witness statement or expert's report and I see no reason why the plaintiff should have anticipated the sudden arrival of this material at the very last moment.", "Mr Price says that there is a strong public interest in allowing all relevant and probative evidence to be adduced lest there may be a verdict which is contrary to the truth. ... The judge took this important submission into account and so do I. The fact is that there are competing public interests, one of which is that parties to litigation should not turn up at the very last moment with unheralded evidence which puts another party at a disadvantage, and another of which is that the general administration of justice demands, for reasons which have been articulated frequently by this court, that fixed trial dates should not be abandoned at the last moment other than in quite exceptional circumstances. ...", "It seems to me that the case for exercising the judge's discretion in relation to Mr Moule as he did is clear and overwhelming. Mr Moule's evidence was not heralded in the gist statement. The statement was served at the latest possible moment before the start of the trial. Without an adjournment of the trial (which the judge rightly regarded as out of the question and which would in any event have prejudiced the plaintiff) the plaintiff would be prejudiced by not being able properly to deal with the evidence. Any prejudice to the defendant was his own fault.", "The judge had to make a balancing judgment, which in my view he did upon proper and unassailable principles. Accordingly, I would not disturb the judge's finding in relation to Mr Moule's evidence.\u201d", "In relation to Mr Walusimbi's evidence, he said:", "\u201cA gist statement was served in relation to Mr Walusimbi and referred to what he had said in a Panorama programme. A transcript of the programme was provided on discovery. The [applicant] now wants to call Mr Walusimbi to say that the use of performance-enhancing drugs by athletes is widespread and that there are means of evading tests. Before the judge, he wanted to call Mr Walusimbi to give first-hand evidence that the plaintiff had taken drugs. This was neither pleaded nor included in the Panorama material. The judge rightly excluded it and there is no application for leave to appeal against that part of the decision. The judge held that the general evidence added little or nothing to the issue of widespread drug taking. I agree, not least since I would permit Professor Beckett's evidence to be adduced and this deals with the same topic. Further general evidence about widespread drug use by athletes does not go to establish that the plaintiff has taken drugs or that he is reasonably suspected of having done so. This again was very late evidence tendered in breach of court orders and the rules, and I consider that the judge exercised his discretion correctly to exclude it.\u201d", "21. The main trial commenced on the same day, 18 June 1998. The applicant represented himself as his funds were exhausted. On 3 July 1998 the jury found, by a majority of ten to two, that the article complained of bore the meaning that", "\u201cMr Christie is a cheat who regularly used banned performance-enhancing drugs to improve his success in athletic competition.\u201d", "It found also that the applicant had not proved that the article as so interpreted was substantially true.", "Although Mr Christie did not seek damages, the applicant was ordered to pay the costs of the action and was made subject to an injunction", "\u201c... restraining the [applicant] whether by himself, his servants, agents or otherwise howsoever from further publishing or causing the publication of the allegation (express or by implication) that the plaintiff is a cheat who has regularly used performance-enhancing drugs to improve his success in athletic competition or any words to the same or similar effect ...\u201d", "22. Following the verdict, the distributors and printers involved in the separate action reached a settlement with Mr Christie which required the payment of damages to him (see paragraph 10 above).", "23. Under English law the object of a libel action is to vindicate the plaintiff's reputation and to make reparation for the injury done by the wrongful publication of defamatory statements concerning him or her. A defence of justification applies where the defamatory statement is substantially true. The burden is on the defendant to prove the truth of the statement on the balance of probabilities.", "24. Throughout the relevant time, the allocation of civil legal aid in the United Kingdom was governed by the Legal Aid Act 1988. Under Schedule 2, Part II, paragraph 1, of that Act, \u201cproceedings wholly or partly in respect of defamation\u201d were excepted from the scope of the civil legal-aid scheme.", "25. At the relevant time, civil procedure before the High Court was governed by the Rules of the Supreme Court (RSC).

According to the RSC, Order 38, Rule 37:", "\u201c(1) ... in respect of expert oral evidence, then, unless the Court considers that there are special reasons for not doing so, it shall direct that the substance of the evidence be disclosed in the form of a written report or reports to such other parties and within such period as the court may specify.\u201d", "As in Rule 2A(10) in respect of witness statements (see above), the court may, pursuant to a general power set out at RSC, Order 3, Rule 5, grant leave to allow expert evidence to be adduced late when the order for directions has not been complied with by either party.", "27. In New York Times v. Sullivan ((1964) 376 US 254), the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that a State could not, under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, award damages to a public official for defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proved \u201cactual malice\u201d. This was shown where the statement concerned had been made with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard as to whether it was true or false. In delivering the judgment of the court, Mr Justice Brennan commented:", "\u201cAllowance of the defence of truth, with the burden of proving it on the defendant, does not mean that only false speech will be deterred. Even courts accepting this defence as an adequate safeguard have recognised the difficulties of adducing legal proof that the alleged libel was true in all its factual particulars. ... Under such a rule, would-be critics of official conduct may be deterred from voicing their criticism, even though it is believed to be true and even though it is in fact true, because of doubt whether it can be proved in court or fear of the expense of having to do so. They tend to make only statements which 'steer far wider of the unlawful zone'.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
