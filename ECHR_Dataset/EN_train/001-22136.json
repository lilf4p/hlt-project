He is represented before the Court by Ms T. Caul, a lawyer practising in Belfast. The applicant has requested anonymity and the Court has granted this request, under Rule 33 \u00a7 3 of the Rules of Court.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.", "On 20 June 1999 the applicant and his cousin were arrested on suspicion of car theft and damage and, at 5 p.m., taken to Antrim police station, where they were detained for questioning.", "The custody record shows that the applicant was given a meal at 6 p.m. He spoke with two of his sisters on the telephone, but transport difficulties prevented any member of his family from attending. He was interviewed in the presence of a social worker and a solicitor, both of whom advised the police that they did not consider that the applicant should be detained overnight because he had threatened to harm himself. The responsible police officer, however, decided that unless an appropriate adult could be found to ensure that the applicant would appear in court the following day, it would not be possible to release him. No adult could be found to provide the required surety.", "Shortly after midnight the applicant was charged with theft, taking and driving away a car and criminal damage. The police did not seek the applicant\u2019s consent to take fingerprint and DNA samples, due to his \u201cage and tearful condition\u201d.", "At 1 a.m. the applicant and his cousin were taken to Lisnevin Juvenile Justice Centre, which is situated in Millisle, County Down, some 45 miles (72 kilometres) from Antrim police station.", "On arrival, at 2.30 a.m., the applicant was searched and told to undress and take a shower.

There was a plastic mattress on the floor, a blanket and a pillow. The floor was uncovered and there was one small window above head height. The applicant was frightened and did not know how long he would be held in the cell.", "Later that morning, around 10.30 a.m., the applicant was taken to Magistrates\u2019 Court, where he was released on bail.", "Pursuant to Article 39 of the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Children) (Northern Ireland) Order 1998, the police are empowered to send a juvenile offender to a place of safety, which is defined as any juvenile justice centre, hospital, surgery or other suitable place.

In particular every child deprived of liberty shall be separated from adults unless it is considered in the child\u2019s best interest not to do so and shall have the right to maintain contact with his or her family through correspondence and visits, save in exceptional circumstances.", "(d) Every child deprived of his or her liberty shall have the right to prompt access to legal and other appropriate assistance, as well as the right to challenge the legality of the deprivation of his or her liberty before a court or other competent, independent and impartial authority, and to a prompt decision of any such action.\u201d", "Article 40(1) provides:", "\u201cStates Parties recognise the right of every child alleged as, accused of, or recognised as having infringed the penal law to be treated in a manner consistent with the promotion of the child\u2019s sense of dignity and worth, which reinforces the child\u2019s respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of others and which takes into account the child\u2019s age and the desirability of promoting the reintegration and the child\u2019s assuming a constructive role in society.\u201d", "The Beijing Rules were adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 29 November 1985.
