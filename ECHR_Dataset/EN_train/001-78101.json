TURKEY", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 11;Not necessary to examine Art. 14;Pecuniary damage - financial award;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["9. The applicants, Kemal Demir and Vicdan Baykara, were born in 1951 and 1958 and live in Gaziantep and Istanbul respectively. The first applicant was a member of the trade union T\u00fcm Bel Sen and the second applicant was its president.", "10. The trade union T\u00fcm Bel Sen was founded in 1990 by civil servants from various localities under the Civil Servants Act (Law no. 657). Under Article 2 of its constitution its objective is to promote democratic trade unionism to further the aspirations and claims of its members. Its head office is located in Istanbul.", "11. On 27 February 1993 T\u00fcm Bel Sen entered into a collective agreement with Gaziantep Municipal Council for a period of two years from 1 January 1993. The agreement concerned all aspects of the working conditions of Gaziantep Municipal Council\u2019s employees, including salaries, allowances and welfare services.", "12. As the Municipal Council had defaulted on certain of its obligations under the agreement, in particular those of a financial nature, the first applicant, as a representative of the union, brought civil proceedings against it in the Gaziantep District Court (the \u201cDistrict Court\u201d) on 18 June 1993.", "13.

On 13 December 1994 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the court below. It found that, even though there was no legal bar preventing civil servants from forming unions, they were not, as the law stood, authorised to enter into collective agreements.", "15. In a judgment of 28 March 1995 the District Court confirmed its earlier judgment on the ground that, despite the fact that the domestic statute contained no express provision affording unions formed by civil servants the right to enter into collective agreements, this omission had to be remedied in the light of international treaties such as the relevant convention of the International Labour Organisation, which had already been ratified by Turkey.", "16. On 6 December 1995 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the court below. It ruled that, at the time the union was formed, the applicable law did not permit civil servants to form trade unions. The union T\u00fcm Bel Sen could not rely on the international labour conventions that dealt with such matters as they had not yet been incorporated into domestic law and no implementing legislation had been enacted. The Court of Cassation concluded that the union did not have legal personality or the capacity to enter into a collective agreement.", "17. An application for rectification lodged by representatives of the union was dismissed by the Court of Cassation on 10 April 1996.", "18. Following an audit of Gaziantep Municipal Council\u2019s accounts by the Audit Court, the State asked the members of the union T\u00fcm Bel Sen to reimburse the additional income they had purportedly received as a result of the defunct collective agreement.", "19.
