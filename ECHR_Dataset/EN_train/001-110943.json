In the meantime, on 30 April 2009, the first applicant lodged a length complaint with the Supreme Court. On 3 July 2009 the court established that the enforcement proceedings, at that moment, had been pending for ten years before the first-instance court and had not yet ended. The court found that there was a violation of the first applicant\u2019s right to a hearing within a reasonable time. It set a six-month time-limit for the first-instance court to bring the enforcement proceedings to a conclusion and awarded the first applicant the equivalent of 325 euros (EUR) by way of just satisfaction. In the absence of an appeal, this decision became final on 22 October 2009.", "7.
