In connection with an ongoing investigation against activist members of the illegal armed organisation Devrimci-Sol (the \u201cRevolutionary Left\u201d), on 17 April 1992 police officers from the Anti-Terrorism Branch of the Istanbul Security Directorate conducted an operation in three buildings located in different areas of Istanbul. The applicants\u2019 daughter, Ay\u015fe G\u00fclen Uzunhasano\u011flu, was killed during this operation. According to the police reports, police officers arrived at the building located in Erenk\u00f6y at about 2.30 a.m. Ay\u015fe G\u00fclen Uzunhasano\u011flu was living on the third floor of this building. The police officers, wearing bulletproof vests, took the necessary safety measures outside the building. Four of the officers went upstairs to flat no. 9 and rang the bell. There was no answer, and the officers forced the door open. Shots were fired from one of the rooms. Despite the officers\u2019 call to surrender, the firing continued and a clash broke out, lasting approximately thirty minutes. When the firing ceased, the police found the dead bodies of two women; one in the bathroom and another in the living room, the latter being later identified as Ay\u015fe G\u00fclen Uzunhasano\u011flu. It was observed that there was a Beretta gun next to Ay\u015fe G\u00fclen Uzunhasano\u011flu\u2019s body. As the police also found explosives in the flat, a bomb disposal team was called to the scene and the flat was evacuated. Once the apartment was secured, the Kad\u0131k\u00f6y public prosecutor was informed about the incident. The prosecutor arrived at the scene of the incident at about 9.30 a.m. and prepared a scene of incident report in which he noted that photographs of the bodies had been taken; that a sketch map of the flat had been drawn and that fingerprints of the bodies had been taken. The report further indicated that a semi-automatic Italian Beretta 7.65 mm pistol, its magazine and cartridges, 3 Kalashnikov cartridges, 90 cartridges of 7.62 mm, 7 bullet cases of 7.65 mm, 23 bullet cases of 5.56 mm, 90 bullet cases of 9 mm, several hand made bombs and material to manufacture explosive devices had been found. The prosecutor further examined the bodies in the presence of a medical expert. The preliminary examination of the bodies revealed that there were several bullet entry and exit holes on both corpses. The bodies were subsequently taken to the Istanbul Forensic Medicine Institute for autopsy. Following the inspection of the flat by the public prosecutor, the premises were sealed by the police.", "7. On 27 April 1992 ballistic examinations of the Beretta pistol, the bullet cases and cartridges collected from the incident scene were conducted by two experts from the Regional Criminal Police Laboratory.
