{"ITEMID": "001-58598", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "FRA", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 2000, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF MOREL v. FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1 concerning the right to a fair hearing;No violation of Art. 6-1 concerning the right to an impartial tribunal", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["9. The applicant formed five construction companies to build catering and accommodation facilities at the request of the Olympic Games Organisation Committee ( \u201cthe OGOC\u201d). He was the manager of the companies. He held 99% of the shares in one of the companies, which was the sole shareholder in the other four. He also acted as guarantor of virtually all the companies' debts.", "10. As the works were not completed within the agreed period, the OGOC suspended payment for them. On 24 February 1992 the applicant lodged a declaration of insolvency on behalf of the companies with the registry of the Nanterre Commercial Court.", "11. On 25 February 1992 the Nanterre Commercial Court made an order for the judicial reorganisation of the applicant's five companies. It named Mr A. as the insolvency judge, and also appointed a deputy insolvency judge, a judicial administrator and a creditors' representative. It ordered a six-month observation period during which the judicial administrator was to draw up a report on the companies' finances and labour force with his recommendations as to whether the companies should continue or cease trading. The observation period was renewed twice.", "12. During the observation period, the insolvency judge made various orders, namely: orders for the appointment of an expert on management supervision (11 March 1992), a valuer (6 April 1992) and an accountant (22 April 1992); orders declaring claims time-barred (two orders were made on 13 October 1992 and others on 16 November 1992, 17 February 1993, 10 and 30 March 1993, 5 May 1993, 1 June 1993 and 25 March 1994); orders for the restitution of equipment (on 8 September, 14 December 1992 and 30 March 1993); an order authorising the applicant's intervention in the management of the hotels (on 15 September 1992); an order dismissing applications for the restitution of equipment (16 November 1992); orders for an action to be brought against one of the other contracting parties and for other measures (on the same date) and for the restitution of equipment (30 March 1993); orders dismissing thirteen members of staff (7 April 1992) and a further member of staff (8 September 1992); and lastly an order for the freezing of accounts (8 September 1992).", "13. On 23 September 1993 the judicial administrator asked the Commercial Court to decide whether to accept the applicant's proposals for its recovery through continued trade.", "14. The applicant appeared at the hearing and gave evidence as the manager of the companies concerned. The judicial administrator and the creditors' representative also made oral submissions. The judicial administrator presented a report in which he explained to the Commercial Court the history of the dealings which had led to the applicant's filing in insolvency. He then related to the court events during the observation period. He stressed that the applicant's recovery plan had been accepted by a majority of the creditors. He raised doubts over certain issues and said that it was for the applicant to dispel those doubts by putting up financial and professional guarantees.", "15. The Commercial Court decided (on application by State Counsel's Office) that before approving the applicant's proposed recovery plan, it needed to be satisfied that the companies' continued economic activity would be permanent. For that purpose, it needed financial and professional guarantees from the applicant. It therefore asked him to produce certain additional documents so that it could be sure that the guarantees existed. The applicant lodged an additional file in response to that request. In the light of the new file lodged by the applicant, the administrator filed a supplemental report.", "16. On 26 October 1993 the Commercial Court terminated the observation period and put the five companies into compulsory liquidation. It held that the proposed recovery plan was not accompanied by sufficiently reliable guarantees to ensure that the companies could continue as a going concern. The judgment contained, inter alia, the following passages:", "\u201cConsequently the Court must find that the proposed plan is not accompanied by the guarantees required to ensure its future economic activity in a difficult sector.", "Pursuant to the provisions of sections 1, 36 and 146 of Law no. 85-98 of 25 January 1985, it therefore orders the compulsory liquidation of the aforementioned companies in accordance with the provisions of Chapter III of that statute and holds as follows.", "FOR THESE REASONS", "The Court, sitting in public and as a court of first instance,", "Having examined the insolvency judge's report,", "Having examined the judicial administrator's report ...", "Terminates the observation period ...\u201d", "17. The Commercial Court reassigned the case to the insolvency judge, decreed that the administrator's mission had been completed and appointed the creditors' representative as liquidator of the companies. The insolvency judge sat on the bench that delivered that judgment in his capacity as President of the Chamber. He was assisted by the Vice-President of the Commercial Court and another judge.", "18. In a judgment of 31 January 1994, the Versailles Court of Appeal upheld the Commercial Court's judgment in its entirety. It delivered its decision after examining the applicant's recovery plan, the judicial administrator's report and the liquidator's submissions. The applicant attended the hearing and made oral observations.", "On 7 April 1994 the applicant appealed to the Court of Cassation. He put forward two grounds of appeal based on Article 6 of the Convention. On 23 January 1996 the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal. The applicant had argued that the Commercial Court had not been impartial because the insolvency judge had sat on the bench of the Commercial Court that had ordered the companies' liquidation after playing an active role in the period of observation of the companies. The Court of Cassation met the argument as follows:", "\u201c... the fact that, in accordance with Article 24 of the decree of 27 December 1985, the insolvency judge sat on the bench that made the order for compulsory liquidation is not contrary to the provisions of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights; that ground of appeal is unfounded; ...\u201d", "The applicant's second ground of appeal read as follows:", "\u201c... the insolvency judge's report and accompanying documents were not communicated to the appellants. In that regard the hearing was not fair for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and the rights of the defence were not respected within the meaning of Article 16 of the New Code of Civil Procedure. A hearing can only be said to be fair \u2013 again for the purposes of the European Convention \u2013 if equality of arms is ensured, in other words, if each party is aware of all the matters on which the court will rely in coming to its decision. Among those matters, the insolvency judge's report plays a paramount role in helping the court to reach its decision. However, it is deemed privileged information to which the debtor is unable to have access (it is not communicated, does not appear in the official case file which may be communicated and is not read out at the hearing). Nor, consequently, may he contest it. The principle of a fair hearing is thus infringed for the purposes of the Convention and the rights of the defence under the New Code of Civil Procedure denied.", "The Court of Cassation answered that argument as follows:", "\u201c... Article 111 of the decree of 27 December 1985 provides that the insolvency judge's report may be presented orally; that provision is not contrary to Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Accordingly, since the applicant has not submitted that the insolvency judge did not present his report orally, this ground of appeal cannot succeed ...\u201d", "The applicant also raised a ground of appeal based on the fact that the Court of Appeal had failed either to summons the other party to a contract to appear or to take evidence from it. The Court of Cassation dismissed that ground of appeal, holding:", "\u201c... other contracting parties are only required to be summonsed to appear before the court of appeal when assignment of the contract as part of a plan for the sale of the undertaking is envisaged. There is no provision requiring other contracting parties to be summonsed to appear when an order for compulsory liquidation is made. This ground of appeal is therefore unfounded ...\u201d", "Concurrently, on 27 February 1995 the applicant lodged an application with the President of the Commercial Court for an order for the communication of the insolvency judge's report. On 15 March 1995 the President of the Nanterre Commercial Court dismissed the application, holding:", "\u201c... the insolvency judge's report is clothed in the secrecy of the deliberations and cannot be communicated to anyone.\u201d", "Section 1 \u2013 \u201cThis Act institutes a new procedure of judicial reorganisation proceedings with the aim of preserving undertakings, maintaining their activities and employment and clearing their debts.\u201d", "Judicial reorganisation shall take place in accordance with a plan approved in a judicial decision at the end of an observation period. The plan shall provide for the continuation or the sale of the activity of the undertaking. When neither alternative appears possible, the undertaking shall be put into compulsory liquidation.\u201d", "Section 8 \u2013 \u201cWhen an order for judicial reorganisation is made an observation period shall commence so that a report can be prepared on the company's finances and labour force and proposals made for the continuation or sale of the undertaking. If neither alternative appears possible, the court shall make an order for compulsory liquidation.\u201d", "Section 10 \u2013 \u201cIn the insolvency order the court shall designate the insolvency judge [from a list compiled by the president of judges with at least two years' experience] and two court officers, namely the administrator and the creditors' representative.

The same judge had sat as president and insolvency judge in two sets of proceedings in which first the company's judicial reorganisation and then its compulsory liquidation had been ordered. He had subsequently served a summons on the manager of the company to appear before the commercial court (the summons contained a recommendation that the manager should be declared personally bankrupt) and presided over that court, which made an order declaring the manager personally bankrupt. The Court of Appeal quashed the judgment of the commercial court on the ground that there had been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. It found that the fact that the insolvency judge had sat on the bench that heard the case was inconsistent with the principle that the investigation and trial stages should be kept separate and could legitimise the appellant's concerns regarding the objective impartiality of the court that had delivered the impugned decision (Recueil Dalloz 1998, jurisprudence, pp. 128 et seq.). The Court of Appeal relied essentially on the role of appearances and expressly followed the judgments in Delcourt v. Belgium of 17 January 1970, Series A no. 11, p. 17, \u00a7 31, and De Cubber v. Belgium of 26 October 1984, Series A no. 86, p. 14, \u00a7 26."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
