The applicant, a Turkish citizen of Kurdish origin, was born in 1963 and lives in the United Kingdom. He is the brother of H\u00fcseyin Koku, who was allegedly detained by the police on 20 October 1994 and whose body was found in a location outside the town of P\u00f6t\u00fcrge, in south east Turkey on 26 April 1995.", "10. The facts of the case, particularly concerning events which occurred between 20 October 1994 and 26 April 1995, are disputed by the parties.", "11. The facts as presented by the applicant are set out in Section B below (paragraphs 12-41). The Government\u2019s submissions concerning the facts are summarised in Section C below (paragraphs 42-58). The documentary evidence submitted by the applicant and the Government is summarised in Sections D (paragraphs 59-87) and E (paragraphs 88-93) respectively.", "12. The applicant\u2019s brother, H\u00fcseyin Koku, was born in the town of Elbistan in south-east Turkey, in 1958. In 1978 he married Fatma Koku (n\u00e9e G\u00fczel) and by 1994 they had had six children, aged at that time between 6 and 15 years.", "13. H\u00fcseyin Koku and his family were active in local politics in Elbistan. H\u00fcseyin became an active member of the pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP). Following the closure of DEP by the Constitutional Court in 1994 and the arrest of the DEP Members of Parliament, the People\u2019s Democracy Party (HADEP) was set up as a successor to DEP. H\u00fcseyin Koku was one of the founding members of HADEP\u2019s Elbistan district organisation and he became the chairman of HADEP\u2019s Elbistan branch.", "14. At the end of March 1994, or the beginning of April 1994, H\u00fcseyin Koku was arrested, taken into custody and placed in detention on remand. He was accused of membership of, and helping and abetting, the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK). During his time in prison he was kept blindfolded, given electric shocks, subjected to falaka and to Palestinian hanging, hosed down with ice cold water, deprived of water and sleep and beaten with truncheons and iron bars. On 10 May 1994 he was released pending trial and was acquitted on 17 May 1994 due to a lack of evidence against him.", "15. As a prominent local HADEP politician, H\u00fcseyin Koku was the subject of harassment and intimidation by the police, and, in particular, by the Governor of Elbistan, Mr \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc G\u00f6r\u00fcc\u00fc. Mr G\u00f6r\u00fcc\u00fc threatened to kill him and alleged that he was a traitor to the State and further alleged that HADEP was a terrorist party. Mr G\u00f6r\u00fcc\u00fc also told H\u00fcseyin Koku that \u201che would be removed quickly\u201d. H\u00fcseyin took this threat seriously and discussed it with other HADEP party officials. In an article published in the \u00d6zg\u00fcr \u00dclke newspaper on 11 November 1994, the president of HADEP\u2019s Kahramanmara\u015f branch was reported as saying that H\u00fcseyin Koku had told him about the threats made by the local Governor in Elbistan.", "16. At this time, H\u00fcseyin Koku was also regularly followed by plain-clothes police officers and received anonymous telephone calls and threats. Another brother of H\u00fcseyin\u2019s and the applicant\u2019s, Ali Koku, who worked closely with H\u00fcseyin for HADEP, left Turkey because of political persecution and is currently living in the United Kingdom.", "17. On or about 17 October 1994, a number of Kurds from the Cumhuriyet neighbourhood in Elbistan went to the local HADEP office and informed HADEP officials that plain-clothes security forces were painting red crosses on houses belonging to Kurdish families in the neighbourhood and were taking down house numbers and personal details of everyone in the area. This was of concern to the families because there had been a massacre of Alevi Kurds in Kahramanmara\u015f in the late 1970s, prior to which houses had been marked in a similar way. H\u00fcseyin Koku made a statement about this to the \u00d6zg\u00fcr \u00dclke newspaper.", "18. On the following day, that is on 18 October 1994, H\u00fcseyin Koku was summoned to the office of the Elbistan Mayor. The Mayor told him that, when they had previously arrested and imprisoned him, they had thought that he would not continue with his political activities in the area. He warned H\u00fcseyin to resign from the party, close down the branch and leave the area. The Mayor also told him that if he listened to his advice, nothing would happen to him, but if he did not, the Mayor could not be responsible for what happened to him. The Mayor also told H\u00fcseyin that he believed that H\u00fcseyin and other HADEP members were assisting the PKK. H\u00fcseyin replied that he was an elected representative and that he was not doing anything illegal. H\u00fcseyin later reported this meeting to the administrative board members of the Elbistan branch of HADEP, including Mustafa Yeter, the local HADEP deputy chairman.", "19. On 20 October 1994 H\u00fcseyin was walking along Malatya Street in Elbistan between midday and 1 p.m., accompanied by his wife Fatma, when he was abducted by plain-clothes police officers carrying walkie-talkies, who then drove him away in a white Renault. The incident was witnessed by Fatma Koku, who was three to four metres away from H\u00fcseyin at the time. The three men had introduced themselves as police officers and told H\u00fcseyin that he would be going with them to the police station.", "20. Another eye-witness to the abduction was Mr Bulut Y\u0131lmaz who was also active within the HADEP party in Elbistan at this time and who knew H\u00fcseyin well. Mr Y\u0131lmaz recognised one of the plain-clothes police officers as one who had previously confiscated newspapers from his shop.", "21. Later on 20 October 1994 Fatma Koku went to the HADEP office to tell her husband\u2019s colleagues what had happened.", "22. On 21 October 1994 Fatma Koku went to the Elbistan Police Headquarters, accompanied by Mustafa Yeter, to obtain information about her husband\u2019s whereabouts. She was told that H\u00fcseyin had not been taken into custody. She was then referred to the gendarmerie and subsequently to the Prosecutor\u2019s office. Further inquiries were made by other members of the family, but no information was given to them. Fatma Koku also contacted the applicant to inform him that her husband \u2013 his brother \u2013 had been taken into custody on the previous day.", "23. Ali Koku accompanied Fatma Koku to five or six police stations in Elbistan shortly after the abduction, but at each station they were told that H\u00fcseyin Koku was not being detained there.", "24. On 31 October 1994 a statement made by the Elbistan Governor, \u015e\u00fckru G\u00f6r\u00fcc\u00fc, was published in the local newspaper, Elbistan\u0131n Sesi. In this statement Mr G\u00f6r\u00fcc\u00fc denied that H\u00fcseyin had been detained.", "25. On 1 November 1994 Fatma Koku lodged a criminal complaint with the Elbistan Prosecutor about the disappearance of her husband. She provided a photograph of him and requested that the matter be investigated. Her petition was counter-signed by both the Prosecutor and the Security Director on 1 November 1994.", "26. Also on 1 November 1994 Amnesty International published an \u2018Urgent Action\u2019 bulletin in respect of the disappearance of H\u00fcseyin Koku.", "27. On 3 November 1994 Fatma Koku and a number of HADEP executives petitioned the Elbistan Governor and requested him to carry out an investigation into H\u00fcseyin\u2019s disappearance.", "28. One evening on or about 5 November 1994, a telephone call was made to H\u00fcseyin Koku\u2019s house which was answered by his 13-year old daughter, \u00d6zlem. During the telephone call, she was made to listen to the voice of her father whilst he was being tortured. Fatma Koku went immediately to the police station to complain about this telephone call, but the police were not interested and even made fun of her. A complaint about the call was lodged with the Prosecutor but, as far as the applicant was aware, no steps were taken by the Prosecutor to investigate the matter. About two and a half months later the Koku family were called to the Cumhuriyet neighbourhood police station in Elbistan where they were asked questions about the telephone call. Fatma Koku asked the police officers why they had not investigated her husband\u2019s case before. One of the police officers replied to Fatma, \u201cI knew H\u00fcseyin well, but if I saw him now, I would not recognise him and neither would you\u201d. She asked what he meant by this, but was sent away.", "29. Fatma Koku and other family members went to meet with \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc G\u00f6r\u00fcc\u00fc, but he provided them with no information about H\u00fcseyin Koku\u2019s whereabouts and instead he insulted and threatened Fatma.", "30. Following H\u00fcseyin Koku\u2019s abduction, Mustafa Yeter and Hasan G\u00fcner were made temporary leaders of HADEP\u2019s Elbistan branch. They were later arrested and subjected to torture. Mr Yeter was threatened by the police not to talk about H\u00fcseyin Koku\u2019s case or to ask further questions about him or highlight the case abroad. He was told to resign or he would suffer the same fate as others.", "31. On 24 April 1995 the Elbistan Prosecutor called Fatma Koku to his office and questioned her about her husband. He asked her whether H\u00fcseyin could have been killed by the PKK. Fatma replied that her husband had never had any contact with the PKK and that there was no reason to believe that he had been abducted or killed by them. She said that her husband had previously been detained for alleged involvement with the PKK but had been released. She told the Prosecutor that neither she nor her husband\u2019s family had ever had any problems with anyone.", "32. On or about 27 April 1995 Fatma Koku was informed by the police that a body had been found near the town of P\u00f6t\u00fcrge, in Malatya province, about 150 kilometres from Elbistan. Fatma and members of the Koku family went to P\u00f6t\u00fcrge to see the decapitated body of H\u00fcseyin Koku, which had been separated into three or four pieces. Most of the body was in a state of decomposition.", "33. The P\u00f6t\u00fcrge Prosecutor took statements from the Koku family members present. The security forces told the relatives that an autopsy would be carried out within 15 days and that the body would be released afterwards.", "34. On 28 April 1995 Fatma Koku made several formal complaints to the Prosecutor, requesting that the murder of her husband be investigated and the necessary action be taken.", "35. On 12 May 1995 Amnesty International published another \u2018Urgent Action\u2019 bulletin about H\u00fcseyin Koku.", "36. According to the autopsy report drawn up by the Forensic Medicine Directorate on 29 June 1995, there were two bullet wounds in the body, including one in the skull.", "37. In July 1995 Fatma Koku was summoned to the police station and was asked about the petitions she had made in respect of her husband. While at the police station, she signed a document which she believed confirmed that she had submitted those petitions.", "38. The Koku family have not been informed by the Prosecutor or any other official about any investigation being undertaken into her husband\u2019s disappearance and murder.", "39. On 23 August 1995 H\u00fcseyin Koku\u2019s body was released to the family\u2019s lawyer. The body was buried the same day. Members of the security forces surrounded the area during the burial to prevent anyone other than close family from entering.", "40. The applicant kept in contact with Mr Mehmet Kaya, another member of HADEP\u2019s Elbistan branch, throughout this period. Mr Kaya told the applicant in 1996 that HADEP would be making a statement about the abduction and murder of his brother during the forthcoming annual general meeting of HADEP. Mr Kaya and two other local HADEP politicians were shot and killed on their way back from that annual general meeting.", "41. The applicant took up the matter with various international organisations, including Amnesty International. He sought advice from his MEP, Mr Alf Lomas, who petitioned the European Parliament concerning H\u00fcseyin Koku\u2019s death. At this time, while making telephone calls to Turkey, the applicant would on several occasions be cut off and a Turkish-speaking voice would interrupt and threaten him.", "42. The Court notes that the Government did not submit observations on the merits of the case (see paragraph 7 above). The following submissions are therefore taken from the observations submitted to the Commission on 15 May 1996 and from the additional observations submitted on 10 April 1997, i.e. prior to the application being declared admissible.", "43. According to the Government, the authorities first became aware of the disappearance of Mr H\u00fcseyin Koku on 3 November 1994, following the receipt of the petition submitted by Mrs Fatma Koku to the Kahramanmara\u015f Governor (see paragraph 91 below). Upon receipt of this petition, the Deputy Governor of Kahramanmara\u015f requested information from a number of authorities.", "44. On 7 November 1994 the Elbistan Gendarme Headquarters sent a reply to the Deputy Governor. According to this reply, H\u00fcseyin Koku had not been taken into the custody by the gendarmerie.", "45. Also on 7 November 1994 the Police Headquarters informed the Deputy Governor that H\u00fcseyin Koku had not been detained by them on or around 20 October 1994.", "46. On 9 November 1994 the Kahramanmara\u015f Governor sent his report to the Ministry of the Interior, according to which a number of newspapers had carried reports of the alleged disappearance of H\u00fcseyin Koku. On 23 October 1994 the \u00d6zg\u00fcr \u00dclke newspaper had run the headline, \u201cDirector of HADEP\u2019s Elbistan Branch Taken into Custody\u201d. On 5 November 1994 the same newspaper had reported, \u201cHADEP\u2019s Elbistan Director Missing\u201d and asked, \u201cWas HADEP Director Killed?\u201d. On 29 October 1994 the Nevroz newspaper had carried the headline, \u201cCustody in Elbistan\u201d. The accuracy of these articles had been assessed by the Kahramanmara\u015f security units and it had been established that H\u00fcseyin Koku had not been taken into custody. He had, however, been arrested in 1982 and 1994 in connection with his alleged membership of outlawed organisations. On the basis of his past activities, the Kahramanmara\u015f Governor concluded in his report that it was possible that H\u00fcseyin Koku had left the country through illegal means in order to join the PKK or to carry out activities on behalf of the PKK.", "47. On 10 November 1994 a reply was given to the Secretary of State for Human Rights, who had apparently enquired on 2 November 1994 whether H\u00fcseyin Koku had been treated at the Kahramanmara\u015f State Hospital for injuries sustained as a result of torture. The reply stated that between the dates of \u201c20 November 1994 and 10 November 1994\u201d, H\u00fcseyin Koku had not requested any kind of treatment from this hospital and neither had he been brought there by the police.", "48. On 11 November 1994 the chief of the Elbistan Police Headquarters sent a letter to the chief of the Kahramanmara\u015f Police Headquarters in which he wrote that he had questioned a number of persons who owned shops on Malatya Street where H\u00fcseyin Koku had allegedly been taken away by the police. None of these persons had any information about such an incident. On the basis of this information and also on the basis of statements taken from Fatma Koku and \u00d6zlem Koku, the Elbistan police chief concluded that the allegation was one of many similar allegations made with the aim of dishonouring the security forces.", "49. On 26 June 1995 the Chief Public Prosecutor of Elbistan sent to the Ministry of Justice\u2019s International Law and Foreign Relations Directorate (hereinafter \u201cthe Directorate\u201d) a letter in which reference was made to information sent to the Ministry previously. This letter informed the Directorate of the discovery of H\u00fcseyin Koku\u2019s body, together with three keys, on 26 April 1995; one of these keys had been for the door to the HADEP party office building, one for H\u00fcseyin Koku\u2019s house and the third one for a briefcase belonging to H\u00fcseyin Koku.", "50. In view of the contents of the briefcase, it had been established that H\u00fcseyin Koku was conducting an extramarital affair with a certain C.E., who was a married woman. Adultery being an offence at the relevant time, C.E.\u2019s husband had made a complaint to the authorities against H\u00fcseyin Koku which had resulted in a decision not to prosecute, taken by the Elbistan Prosecutor on 20 December 1993. A number of letters found in the briefcase revealed the unfaithful acts of C.E.", "51. The Chief Public Prosecutor further referred to a statement taken from Ahmet G\u00fczel, Fatma Koku\u2019s brother, by the P\u00f6t\u00fcrge Prosecutor on 28 April 1995. According to this statement, Mehmet \u00c7olak, the father of C.E., had told Mr G\u00fczel on 22 October 1994 that, \u201c... they fucked him up and got rid of him ...\u201d. This had been understood to be a reference to H\u00fcseyin Koku.", "52. The Chief Public Prosecutor, taking into account the above information, concluded in his letter to the Directorate that the death of H\u00fcseyin Koku was closely connected to his extra-marital affair with C.E.", "53. According to the autopsy report of 26 June 1995, drawn up by the Forensic Medicine Directorate in Istanbul, there were two bullet wounds on the body and another one in the skull.", "54. In a letter of 8 September 1995 the Elbistan Prosecutor informed the Directorate of all the facts and evidence collected until that date.", "55. On 1 March 1996 the Elbistan Prosecutor sent another letter to the Directorate. Referring to the application lodged with the Commission, the Prosecutor informed the Directorate that the death of H\u00fcseyin Koku would be explained when the preliminary investigation, which had been started by the P\u00f6t\u00fcrge Prosecutor after the discovery of the body, was completed.", "56. On 21 March 1996 the Ministry of Justice sent a letter to the Directorate, informing the latter of the above mentioned correspondence. According to this letter, the allegations directed against State officials were illusory and had been made for propaganda purposes.", "57. A letter drawn up on 22 March 1996 by the Ministry of Interior\u2019s General Security Directorate referred to the above mentioned facts and reports and stated that the body of H\u00fcseyin Koku had been buried by his family in Elbistan on 23 August 1995.", "58. In their additional observations submitted to the Commission on 10 April 1997, the Government finally submitted that the P\u00f6t\u00fcrge Prosecutor\u2019s investigation into the death of H\u00fcseyin Koku was still pending under file no. 1995/42 and that it would continue until the expiry of the statutory limitation period.", "59. The following information appears from the documents submitted by the Government.", "60. Pursuant to an interim decision adopted by the Malatya State Security Court (hereinafter \u201cthe Malatya Court\u201d) on 10 May 1994, the applicant\u2019s brother, H\u00fcseyin Koku, was released from prison pending the outcome of criminal proceedings brought against him on account of his alleged PKK membership and on suspicion of aiding and abetting that organisation.", "61. On 17 May 1994 the Prosecutor at the Malatya Court decided to discontinue the prosecution of the applicant\u2019s brother on account of a lack of sufficient evidence to show his involvement in such offences.", "62. At 1 p.m. on 26 April 1995 Emin Ziya Keke\u00e7, a village guard, informed the commander of the Tepehan Gendarme Station of his discovery of a dismembered body in a location near Argu\u00e7a hamlet of Sinan village, situated within the administrative jurisdiction of the town of P\u00f6t\u00fcrge. The commander of the Tepehan Gendarme Station, together with a number of soldiers under his command, went to the location where the body had been found by Mr Keke\u00e7. They were unable to find any bullets at the scene.", "63. Mr Zeki Polat, the Prosecutor of the town of P\u00f6t\u00fcrge, arrived at the scene shortly after the gendarmes and recorded his findings in a report. Mr Polat also instructed a photographer to photograph the body. The soil under and around the body parts was searched for bullets, spent bullet cases and for similar evidence, but none were found.", "64. A wallet, found in the deceased\u2019s jacket pocket, contained an electricity bill and a piece of scrap paper. Noting that these papers were very wet and risked being torn, a decision was taken to read them at a later stage when they were dry. A key for a door lock, a small, rusty flick-knife and two rusty telephone tokens were also found in the jacket pocket.", "65. Dr Ka\u011fan Denge and Dr Naim \u00d6zata, who had arrived at the scene together with the Prosecutor, detailed their findings in a report drawn up during the examination of the body. According to this report, the body was badly decomposed and body parts and bones were lying around. The head was missing. Bones had been scattered around the body, possibly by wild animals. The examination carried out on the body parts did not reveal any firearm injuries. The internal organs had all disappeared. The doctors were unable to establish the cause of death and a decision was therefore taken to send the remains of the body to the Forensic Medicine Directorate in Istanbul.", "66. On 27 April 1995 the P\u00f6t\u00fcrge Prosecutor sent a fax message to his colleague in the town of Elbistan, asking the latter to help establish the identity of the body by checking the information found in the jacket pocket.", "67. On 28 April 1995 Fatma Koku examined the clothes found on the body and concluded that they belonged to her husband H\u00fcseyin Koku. The P\u00f6t\u00fcrge Prosecutor then sent the remains of the body, together with the reports drawn up at the site where it had been found, to the Forensic Medicine Directorate and asked for the cause of death to be established.", "68. Also on 28 April 1995, a report was drawn up by two gendarmes. According to this report, the key found on the body belonged to a briefcase owned by H\u00fcseyin Koku which was being kept in the house of his brother-in-law, Ahmet G\u00fczel. The briefcase was opened by the gendarmes who found a number of documents in it. These documents related, inter alia, to the criminal proceedings brought against H\u00fcseyin Koku on account of his alleged adultery with C.E.", "69. On 29 April 1995 a number of soldiers and village guards once more visited the site where the body had been found and searched for the missing head. They found the skull in three pieces.", "70. Later that same day, the P\u00f6t\u00fcrge Prosecutor and Dr Denge visited the area and examined the bones found by the soldiers earlier that day. Dr Denge observed that the posterior part of the skull had a bullet entry, measuring 1 x 1 centimetre. This bullet had also caused a fracture in the skull. The Prosecutor forwarded the skull pieces to the Forensic Medicine Directorate in Istanbul.", "71. Between 28 and 30 April 1995 statements were taken by the authorities from members of H\u00fcseyin Koku\u2019s family, who stated that they had heard that H\u00fcseyin Koku had been having an extra-marital affair with C.E. and that C.E.\u2019s family were angry with H\u00fcseyin.", "72. On 1 May 1995 Fatma Koku submitted a petition to the Elbistan Prosecutor and asked for the remains of her husband to be returned to her after they had been examined in Istanbul.", "73. On 25 May 1995 the Forensic Medicine Directorate began its examination of the remains of the body. The Ballistics Department was asked to establish whether the clothes worn by the deceased bore any damage caused by a bullet or sharp objects. In case bullet damage was found, the Ballistics Department was requested to establish the distance from which the bullet had been fired.", "74. On 26 May 1995 the P\u00f6t\u00fcrge Prosecutor, Zeki Polat, sent a letter to his colleague in the town of Elbistan, stating that, in his opinion, the affair H\u00fcseyin Koku had being conducting with C.E. could be connected with his death in October 1994. Mr Polat asked the Elbistan Prosecutor to take statements from members of C.E.\u2019s family who lived in the town of Elbistan.", "75. The P\u00f6t\u00fcrge Prosecutor also sent a letter to the Forensic Medicine Directorate on 26 May 1995 and urged them to expedite the examination of the remains of H\u00fcseyin Koku\u2019s body.", "76. On 1 June 1995 P\u00f6t\u00fcrge Prosecutor Mr Polat drew up a report in which he detailed the developments that had taken place in the investigation. According to this report, H\u00fcseyin Koku, chairman of HADEP\u2019s Elbistan branch, had been found dead on 26 April 1995 with a possible bullet entry wound on his skull. Mr Polat had also found out from the Elbistan Prosecutor that the disappearance of H\u00fcseyin Koku in October 1994 had been brought to the attention of that Prosecutor. The husband of C.E. had also disappeared 15-20 days prior to the disappearance of H\u00fcseyin Koku and C.E. had then started living with another man in Gaziantep. H\u00fcseyin Koku had gone to Gaziantep prior to his disappearance and had had a row with that man.", "77. On 13 June 1995 the Ballistics Department concluded that the large number of cuts and other damage on the clothes had been caused by rotting.", "78. On 29 June 1995 the Forensic Medicine Directorate recorded in their report that H\u00fcseyin Koku had been shot in the head from behind. It was also observed that another bullet had gone through the spine. It was concluded that the two bullets had caused the death but that it was not possible to establish the distance from which the bullets had been fired. The report contains no information as regards the time of death.", "79. In a letter of 18 August 1995 the Prosecutor in Elbistan requested the Prosecutor in the city of Gaziantep to question C.E. in order to establish whether she had any information about the death of H\u00fcseyin Koku.", "80. On 23 August 1995 the remains of H\u00fcseyin Koku\u2019s body were returned to the P\u00f6t\u00fcrge Prosecutor, who then handed them over to the family\u2019s lawyer for burial.", "81. On 5 September 1995 a statement was taken from C.E. by the Prosecutor in Gaziantep.
