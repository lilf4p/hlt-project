From 1991 to 1994 the \u201cEkolog\u201d company was a party to several disputes before the commercial courts. The disputes concerned office premises acquired by the \u201cEkolog\u201d company from a municipal enterprise. On 1 November 1993, 23 May, 11 July and 26 August 1994 the Voronezh Commercial Court, by final judgments, ruled in favour of the \u201cEkolog\u201d company's adversaries.", "7.

She sought compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage.", "9. Following the applicant's complaint to the Voronezh Regional Court about the excessive length of the proceedings in the case, on 26 August 1999 the President of the Leninskiy District Court informed the applicant that the first hearing was listed for 28 September 1999. That hearing was adjourned until 6 October 1999 because the Council had not received a copy of the statement of claim.", "10. The following two hearings fixed between 6 October 1999 and 2 June 2000 were postponed owing to the absence of the Council's representative.", "11. On 23 July 1999 the applicant and the \u201cEkolog\u201d company sued the Voronezh Town and Leninskiy District Councils for correction of registration logs in respect of the office premises.

Of the three hearings fixed between 3 December 2001 and 24 June 2002, two were adjourned because the defendants had defaulted and one was postponed for the purpose of obtaining information from the commercial courts.", "18. On 2 October 2002 the Leninskiy District Court discontinued the proceedings because the case was within the subject-matter jurisdiction of a commercial court. That decision was quashed on 27 February 2003 by the Voronezh Regional Court. The case was remitted to the Leninskiy District Court for a fresh examination on the merits.", "19. On 19 March 2003 judge Y. received the case file and listed the first hearing for 24 April 2003. That hearing was adjourned because the defendants did not attend.", "20.

The District Court held that in 1993 and 1994 the commercial courts had invalidated the sales-purchase agreement between the municipal enterprise and the \u201cEkolog\u201d company in respect of the premises. Mr B. had lawfully acquired the title to the premises in 1994 and thus he was their legitimate owner. The District Court also noted that the applicant had never lived in the premises.", "22.
