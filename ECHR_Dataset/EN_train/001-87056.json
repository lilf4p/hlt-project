The applicant worked as General Manager of a bank, \u201cK.B.\u201d (\u201cthe bank\u201d).", "6. On 25 April 1996 the Governor of the National Bank (\u201cthe Governor\u201d) issued an order preventing the applicant from working as the bank\u2019s General Manager and from exercising other duties associated with special responsibilities for an indefinite period of time (\u201cthe order\u201d). The order was based on findings as to the applicant\u2019s unlawful business conduct and irregularities in the bank\u2019s operation under his management. On 22 May 1996 the Council of the National Bank (\u201cthe Council\u201d) dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal and confirmed the order.", "7.

On 9 June 1997 the plenary session of the Supreme Court (\u043e\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430) granted the public prosecutor\u2019s request for the protection of legality (\u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0448\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430) and quashed the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 12 September 1996. The court referred in its decision to the National Assembly\u2019s authentic interpretation of section 70 of the Banks and Savings Institutions Act (\u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u0448\u0442\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0438), according to which the manager of a bank was to be considered \u201ca person with special responsibilities\u201d.", "11. On 4 February 1998 the Supreme Court, relying on the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 18 June 1997, accepted the applicant\u2019s appeal and annulled the Council\u2019s decision of 22 May 1996.", "12.

It found that the facts had been re-established without a hearing.", "18. On 11 September 2003 the Supreme Court finally dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal. It based its decision, inter alia, on the Banks and Savings Institutions Act of 1993, in accordance with which the National Bank supervised the lawfulness of a bank\u2019s operation and accordingly had been authorised to prevent, fully or partially, persons with special responsibilities from exercising their duties. It also referred to section 50 \u00a7 2 of the National Bank Act of 1992 and ruled that the latter had lawfully prevented the applicant from working as General Manager of the bank due to irregularities in the operation of the bank under his management.", "19.
