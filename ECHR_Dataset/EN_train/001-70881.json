In June 2001 the applicant instituted proceedings in the City Court against the Bailiffs\u2019 Service in respect of its alleged inactivity. On 23 August 2001 the City Court rejected this complaint, stating, inter alia, that no fault was attributable to the bailiffs, who had undertaken all necessary measures to secure the execution of the judgment of 15 March 2001 and that the non-enforcement of this judgment was caused by the Coal Mine\u2019s lack of funds. The City Court also indicated that the enforcement proceedings were further impeded by a bankruptcy case pending against the Coal Mine before the Donetsk Regional Court of Arbitration, which on 14 May 2001 prohibited the Bailiffs\u2019 Service from performing any activity that involved the forced sale of the Coal Mine\u2019s assets. On 5 November 2001 the Donetsk Regional Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the City Court. On 18 February 2002 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal.", "7.

On 1 September 2003, following the transfer of the Coal Mine\u2019s funds to the Selydivvugilia State Company, the Bailiffs\u2019 Service suspended the enforcement proceedings pending the replacement of the debtor in the applicant\u2019s case. On 24 October 2003 the Bailiffs\u2019 Service applied to the City Court for a direction to that effect. On 31 October 2003 the City Court ordered that the debtor in the case be replaced by the Selydivvugilia State Company. On 19 November 2003 the enforcement case was transmitted to the Selidvivske City Bailiffs\u2019 Service.", "10.
