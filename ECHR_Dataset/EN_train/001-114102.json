During the investigation the applicant was detained under Article 102 \u00a7 1(3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (risk of reoffending and gravity of charges).", "8.

The applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention was extended and he remained in detention throughout the trial.", "10. On 17 April 2009 a three-judge panel of the Zagreb County Court extended the maximum statutory limit of the applicant\u2019s detention under Article 109 \u00a7 1(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure for a further six months. This decision was based on section 28(3) of the Office for the Suppression of Corruption and Organised Crime Act, which provides for a possibility to extend the maximum duration of pre-trial detention for a further six months in cases of corruption and organised crime.", "11. On 21 April 2009 the Zagreb County Court found the applicant guilty of armed robbery and aggravated murder, and sentenced him to thirty years\u2019 imprisonment.

On 21 September 2009 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) against the first-instance judgment.", "13. On 6 November 2009 a three-judge panel of the Zagreb County Court extended the applicant\u2019s detention for a further nine months, basing its decision on Article 109 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The relevant part of the decision reads:", "\u201cBy the first-instance judgment of this court of 21 April 2009 ... the accused, Ognjen Grubi\u0107, was found guilty of offences under Article 218 \u00a7 2 of the [Criminal Code] and was sentenced to long-term imprisonment of thirty years ...", "By order of this court ... of 21 April 2009 under Article 102 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the accused, Ognjen Grubi\u0107, has been detained since 8 May 2006.", "...", "Article 109 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that in cases where a non-final judgment has been adopted the maximum period of detention, until the judgment becomes final, may be extended by one quarter of the term when the maximum period of detention is three years, if [the offence at issue] carries a long-term prison sentence.", "Since under the above-mentioned Article the maximum period of detention under Article 109 \u00a7 1(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure against the accused, Ognjen Grubi\u0107, may be extended for a further nine months, it has been decided as noted in the operative part of this decision.\u201d", "14. On 18 November 2009 the applicant lodged an appeal against the above decision, arguing that he had not been given an opportunity to be heard when his detention had been extended and that the decision to extend his detention was not sufficiently reasoned.", "15. The Supreme Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal on 25 November 2009. The relevant part of the decision reads:", "\u201cThe accused has been detained since 8 May 2006. Under Article 109 \u00a7 1(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure the maximum period of his detention expired on 8 May 2009. Thereafter the first-instance court extended his detention under section 28(3) of the Office for the Suppression of Corruption and Organised Crime Act ... for a further six months until 8 November 2009. By the impugned decision the detention was extended under Article 109 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for one quarter, namely nine months. Therefore under this provision he may be detained until 8 August [2010].\u201d", "16.

On 24 June 2010 the applicant lodged a further appeal with the Supreme Court against its judgment of 16 December 2009.", "18. On 6 August 2010 a three-judge panel of the Zagreb County Court extended the applicant\u2019s detention under Article 109 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for a further three months.

He can therefore be detained until 8 August 2010.", "Given that the accused personally and through his defence lawyer ... lodged appeals against the judgment of the Supreme Court ... of 16 December 2009, and in view of the provision of Article 109 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the fact that his detention expires on 8 August 2010, [this] panel has found that the conditions for extending his detention under Article 109 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure have been met.\u201d", "19. The applicant lodged an appeal against the above decision on 17 August 2010. He argued that his detention after 16 March 2010 had been unlawful since under Article 109 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the detention should have lasted for a maximum of three months following the adoption of the judgment against which an appeal was allowed. He pointed out that the judgment of the Supreme Court, against which an appeal was allowed, was adopted on 16 December 2009 and that therefore his detention should have lasted only until 16 March 2010.", "20. The Supreme Court dismissed his appeal on 25 August 2010.

On 6 November 2009 the Zagreb County Court extended his detention for a further nine months and the detention under that decision lasted until 8 August 2010. The second-instance judgment in this case was adopted on 16 December 2009. Under Article 109 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, from the date of adoption of the second-instance judgment against which an appeal is allowed, as in the present case, the accused may be detained until the judgment becomes final but not for more than three months. However, the case file reveals that the first-instance judgment, and the second-instance judgment against which an appeal is allowed (and [the appeal] was lodged in this case) were adopted within the period of detention under Article 109 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Under Article 109 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and according to the conclusions of the meeting of the Supreme Court Criminal Division on 23 March 2006, the maximum period of detention can be extended after the period under Article 109 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In this case this means beyond 8 August 2010 and not, as suggested by the accused, after the date of the second-instance judgment. Thus all the accused, regardless of the date of the second-instance judgment, are in the same position.\u201d", "21.
