On 23 March 1999 the County Court quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case.", "9. In the resumed proceedings, the Municipal Court held a hearing on 7 December 1999 at which it requested the applicant to provide the minutes drawn up by the labour inspectorate concerning the incident resulting in his injury or to indicate a person or authority who possessed that document. On 12 June 2000 the court repeated its request.", "10. On 16 June 2000 and 3 January 2001 the applicant requested the court to invite the employer to produce the above evidence. On 26 June 2001 the court did so.", "11. At the hearing held on 14 December 2001 the court decided to effect an in situ inspection (o\u010devid) on 15 February 2002 with the assistance of an expert, and invited the applicant to advance the costs. Since the applicant did so only on 19 February 2002, the inspection did not take place.", "12. On 3 January 2002 the Zagreb Commercial Court (Trgova\u010dki sud u Zagrebu) decided to open bankruptcy proceedings against the employer. It invited the creditors to report their claims by 28 February 2002 and scheduled a hearing, at which the reported claims were to be examined, for 20 March 2002. In accordance with the Bankruptcy Act, the decision was published in the \u201cOfficial Gazette\u201d no. 6/02 of 21 January 2002.", "13.

It examined the length of the proceedings in their part following the Convention\u2019s entry into force with respect to Croatia. The Constitutional Court held that the delay was attributable to the complexity of the case and the applicant\u2019s conduct. It found that the applicant had contributed to the length of the proceedings in that he had not responded to the Municipal Court\u2019s request of 7 December 1999 for more than six months, that he had failed to advance the inspection costs in due time and that he had failed to request the Municipal Court to invite the bankruptcy manager to take over the civil proceedings which would have resulted in their resumption.", "20.
