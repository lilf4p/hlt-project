On 18 June 1996 the applicant company brought civil proceedings against a private individual (\u00d6.L.\u00d6.) before the Ka\u015f Civil Court of First Instance, claiming unjust enrichment.", "3. The first hearing scheduled for 24 September 1996 was postponed for administrative reasons. At the next hearing, which was held on 22 October 1996, both parties requested an adjournment to present their evidence.", "4. At the following hearing on 20 December 1996 the applicant company explained that it wished to adduce as evidence the entire case-file of a pending claim for reimbursement it had lodged against \u00d6.L.\u00d6. The court therefore decided to await the outcome of the proceedings concerning the reimbursement claim and adjourned the case to 2 April 1997. The case-file indicates that the judgment in respect of the applicant company\u2019s reimbursement claim was delivered on 22 October 1996, in accordance with an agreement that had been reached between the applicant company and \u00d6.L.\u00d6. This judgment was served on the applicant company on 7 May 1997 and became final in the absence of any appeal.", "5. As neither party attended the following two hearings on 2 April 1997 and 28 May 1997 the court decided to discontinue the proceedings unless asked to reinstate them.

The court awarded the applicant company 8,754,110,491 Turkish liras. Both parties appealed. On 21 March 2001 the Court of Cassation quashed that judgment on the ground, inter alia, that the applicant company had not presented material evidence as proof of its alleged loss. The applicant company\u2019s rectification request was dismissed on 17 September 2001.", "9. The case was remitted to the Ka\u015f Civil Court of First Instance, which abided by the decision of the Court of Cassation and dismissed the case on 21 November 2001. The applicant company appealed. On 10 June 2002 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment.", "10. The applicant company then sought rectification.
