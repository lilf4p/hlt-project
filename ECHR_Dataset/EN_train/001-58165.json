A test carried out on 28 October 1985 showed that the applicant had been infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). He is classified as having reached stage II of the four stages of infection on the scale of the Atlanta Center for Disease Control.", "11. On 12 December 1989 the applicant submitted a preliminary application for compensation to the Minister for Solidarity, Health and Social Protection. He sought compensation for the medical disorders of all kinds he had suffered on account of his infection. This application was rejected on 30 March 1990.", "12. On 25 May 1990 the applicant lodged an appeal against the above decision with the Versailles Administrative Court, seeking compensation for the damage sustained as a result of the State\u2019s failure to take appropriate measures to prevent his infection with HIV. On 16 October 1990 he produced a supplementary pleading.", "13. The Minister of Health lodged his defence on 22 April 1991. This was communicated to the applicant on 12 June 1991.", "14. On 11 July 1991 the applicant was served with an order referring the case to the Conseil d\u2019Etat. The Paris Administrative Court was then designated as the competent court. The application was registered at the Paris Administrative Court on 14 August 1991.", "15. On 25 March 1992 the Administrative Court gave an interlocutory judgment, holding that \u201cthe State is liable in respect of haemophiliacs who were infected with HIV in the course of transfusion of non-heat-treated blood products during the period of liability defined above, that is between 12 March and 1 October 1985\u201d and that \u201cthere are grounds for the Administrative Court to order the State to pay compensation for the whole of the damage suffered\u201d.", "16. The Administrative Court also ordered a medical report to determine when it had been discovered that Mr Leterme was HIV-positive and whether he had received blood derivatives during the period of the State\u2019s liability. The expert filed his report on 16 July 1992.", "17. By a judgment of 3 March 1993 the court dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim, on the ground that no causal connection had been proved between his infection and the administration of non-heat-treated blood products during the period of the State\u2019s liability, between 12 March and 1 October 1985.", "18. On 9 April 1993 the Judicial Assembly of the Conseil d\u2019Etat gave three landmark judgments, fixing 22 November 1984 as the start of the period of the State\u2019s liability and awarding the victims compensation at a flat rate of 2,000,000 French francs (FRF) (see paragraph 39 below).", "19.

However, since he had accepted an offer of FRF 1,293,000 made to him in respect of the same damage by the Compensation Fund for Transfusion Patients and Haemophiliacs, the Administrative Court of Appeal decided that the balance of the compensation owed was FRF 707,000. It calculated interest on the basis of that sum with effect from 12 December 1989 (see paragraphs 33\u201336 below).", "21. On 2 May 1994 the applicant appealed on points of law to the Conseil d\u2019Etat. He complained in particular of the way the Administrative Court of Appeal had calculated the interest.", "22. On 27 January 1995 Mr Leterme lodged an application (no. 26387/95) with the European Commission of Human Rights, complaining of the length of the compensation proceedings and relying on Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. On 4 July 1995 the Commission adopted a report pursuant to Article 28 \u00a7 2 of the Convention noting that the parties had reached agreement on a friendly settlement of the case (see paragraph 43 below).", "23. On 1 December 1995 the reporting judge at the Conseil d\u2019Etat filed his report. On the same day the case was allocated to a government commissioner.", "24. The case was listed for a hearing on 19 December 1995.", "25. On 31 January 1996 the Conseil d\u2019Etat gave a judgment quashing the Administrative Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment of 1 March 1994 in so far as that court \u2013 notwithstanding the Conseil d\u2019Etat\u2019s case-law on the question (see paragraph 40 below) \u2013 had deducted from the sums the State was to pay Mr Leterme the amount of compensation to be paid by the Compensation Fund for Transfusion Patients and Haemophiliacs in the event of Aids being diagnosed. It remitted the case to the Paris Administrative Court of Appeal.", "26. The file was received by the Paris Administrative Court of Appeal on 27 February 1996.", "27. In a letter of 13 March 1996 the senior registrar at the court informed the applicant that the case had been remitted to that court by the Conseil d\u2019Etat and asked him to submit his observations within one month.

On 26 September 1996 the court decided to proceed without waiting for observations from the Minister of Health, the Yvelines Health Insurance Office and the Compensation Fund for Transfusion Patients and Haemophiliacs.", "29.

In separate proceedings the applicant had submitted a claim to the Compensation Fund for Transfusion Patients and Haemophiliacs that had been set up by the Act of 31 December 1991 (see paragraph 38 below).", "33. In a decision of 29 June 1992 the Fund awarded Mr Leterme compensation of FRF 1,293,000, of which FRF 969,750 were to be paid in three equal annual instalments and FRF 323,250 if and when Aids was diagnosed. From that sum FRF 100,000 already paid out by the haemophiliacs\u2019 public and private solidarity funds was to be deducted.", "34. On 6 October 1992 the applicant appealed to the Paris Court of Appeal.", "35. On 26 February 1993 the Paris Court of Appeal gave a judgment in which it ruled that the Fund\u2019s offer was satisfactory, formally noted that it undertook to pay the sum of FRF 969,750, subject to deduction of FRF 100,000, and specified that payment of the additional compensation would be conditional on the onset of Aids being diagnosed.", "36. On 9 March 1993 the Compensation Fund paid the applicant FRF 874,706.", "37. On 2 February 1994 the Court of Cassation dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant against the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment of 26 February 1993.", "38.

The Fund shall be subrogated, for an amount no higher than the sums paid out, to the victim's rights against the person liable for the damage and against persons required, for whatever reason, to make full or partial reparation for that damage, within the limits of those persons' liabilities. However, the Fund may institute proceedings on the basis of that subrogation only where the damage is attributable to negligence.", "The Fund may intervene in proceedings in the criminal courts, even if it does not do so until the appeal stage, where the victim or his heirs have claimed compensation as a civil party in proceedings pending against the person or persons responsible for the damage defined in subsection I. In such cases it shall be considered a full party to the proceedings and may have recourse to all the remedies available in law.", "If the acts which caused the damage have given rise to criminal proceedings, the civil court shall not be required to defer its decision until there has been a final decision by the criminal court.", "X.

In a series of landmark judgments of 24 March 1995 the Conseil d\u2019Etat ruled that payment of the sum proposed by the Compensation Fund for Transfusion Patients and Haemophiliacs in the event of Aids being diagnosed was \u201ca latent possibility subject to the onset of the disease\u201d and that accordingly the Paris Administrative Court of Appeal had \u201cmade an error of law in deducting it from the sums it ordered the State to pay in compensation for the same damage\u201d.", "41.
