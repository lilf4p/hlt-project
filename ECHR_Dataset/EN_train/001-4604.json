The applicant was brought before the Helsinki District Court four days later, i.e. on 23 May 1994.

The case was adjourned until 19 July 1994.", "On 19 July 1994 the applicant\u2019s case (R 94/3064) was again heard separately from N.\u2019s case. The applicant denied all the charges and stated that they were all based solely on N.\u2019s statements made in the course of a police investigation and a hearing at which the applicant was not represented and that there was no other evidence against him. He requested to be released as he had not been given an opportunity to question N. He also submitted that N. had changed his statements to the police so that these could not be found credible. The public prosecutor objected to the applicant\u2019s request, stating that the applicant would, if released, interfere with the investigations which had not yet finished. The case was adjourned until 2 August 1994.", "By this time there was also a hearing in case R 94/1409 against N. and eighteen other accused (not including the applicant).

The public prosecutor stated that the investigations were still unfinished and requested that the case should be adjourned. The applicant stated that he would respond to the charges in detail as soon as N. can be questioned. H. denied that the applicant had had anything to do with the narcotics. The case was adjourned until 16 August 1994.", "On 2 August 1994 there was also a hearing in case R 94/1409 against N. and several other accused.

The case was adjourned until 30 August 1994.", "On 30 August 1994 there was a hearing in both cases (R 94/1409 and R 94/3270) which were now joined. There was a total of 20 accused including the applicant, N. and H. The public prosecutor asked N. whether the applicant had been with H. collecting the drugs from N. N. answered \u201cno\u201d. N. also stated that at his stage he did not want to repeat everything he had said about H., the applicant and two other accused. The public prosecutor withdrew a part of the charges (concerning five kilos of cannabis at the end of 1993) against the applicant but stated that the applicant had dealt in two kilos of cannabis on 11 February 1994. The applicant\u2019s legal counsel asked N. questions about the latter\u2019s health. After this questioning the counsel stated that N. was ill and could not properly concentrate on the questions put to him during this hearing. She also submitted that there were several discrepancies between N.\u2019s various statements and that N.\u2019s statements did not support the charges against the applicant. The case was adjourned until 13 September 1994.", "On 13 September 1994 there was another hearing in case R 94/1409 before the District Court. The public prosecutor submitted several police investigation reports to the court. The case was adjourned until 27 September 1994.", "On 27 September 1994 the case was heard again. The public prosecutor submitted new police investigation reports to the court. N. refused to comment on any of his statements and stated that he would remain silent. He also stated that he would not answer any questions put to him as he \u201cwanted to reserve an opportunity for all the innocent co-accused to tell the truth\u201d. The applicant\u2019s legal counsel stated that she had prepared questions for N. but could not put them to him at the moment as N. had said that he would not answer any questions. The case was adjourned until 11 October 1994. The applicant was ordered to be released from detention.", "At the District Court hearing on 11 October 1994 N. again refused to repeat his statements concerning the applicant, H. and two others as he could not \u201ctake the responsibility if innocent men were convicted on the basis of his statements\u201d. The applicant\u2019s legal counsel put a question to N. (the question and any answer to it is not on the file). The case was adjourned until 25 October 1994.", "On 25 October 1994 the case was heard again. The applicant submitted that the only evidence against him was the earlier statements of N. and that N. had withdrawn them. N. was convicted of 13 aggravated narcotics offences and two counts of possession of an illegal firearm and sentenced to twelve years and six months\u2019 imprisonment. Two other accused were convicted of different narcotics offences and sentenced to imprisonment. The rest of the case was adjourned until 8 November 1994, including the applicant\u2019s case.", "On 8 November 1994 the case was heard again. The public prosecutor submitted a report, dated 7 November 1994, to the court concerning telecommunications between the accused. The report had been served on the applicant\u2019s legal counsel the previous afternoon. The public prosecutor submitted a complete list of the telephone calls, with details of their duration and dates, but the legal counsel was provided only with a list concerning the number of the phone calls. The applicant\u2019s counsel commented telecommunications between the accused, without requesting a further adjournment on the basis of the new report. The counsel gave her closing speech in which the fact that the report concerning telecommunications had been submitted to the counsel only on the previous day was not raised. The District Court convicted the applicant of eight aggravated narcotics offences and illegal possession of a firearm and sentenced him to eight years and six months\u2019 imprisonment. The applicant was detained on remand. The reasoning of the court reads as follows:", "(translation from Finnish)", "\u201c[The applicant] has denied all the charges except for charge number 31 [concerning illegal possession of a firearm]. ...", "The conviction is based on N.\u2019s statements. The District Court has stated above why it has found N.\u2019s statements credible. N. told about the applicant\u2019s participation at a fairly early stage of the investigations and in a fairly detailed manner. N. revealed that [the applicant] had assisted H. when H. collected the cannabis from N. N. identified the suitcase confiscated from [the applicant] as similar to the suitcase used by [the applicant] when collecting the cannabis from him. H. stated that [the applicant] had taken care of certain things for him. N.\u2019s statement concerning the close co-operation between H. and [the applicant] is also supported by the fact that [the applicant] has lived with his girlfriend in a flat rented by H. from the City of Helsinki. Also Mrs H. has testified that [the applicant] had helped H. with all kinds of things. [The applicant] has, inter alia, witnessed H.\u2019s signature to a deed concerning H.\u2019s flat in Porvoo. One of the witnesses, M., has testified that [the applicant] had been \u201changing around\u201d a garage owned by N. [The applicant] had been there fairly often either alone or with H. [The applicant\u2019s] girlfriend has had a car put to her disposal by H. [The applicant] has stated that a mobil phone line was opened in his name in the spring 1994. The mobile phone was, however, in the use of H. and was also left with H. This has also been certified by Mrs H.", "36,000 Finnish Marks (FIM) was confiscated from [the applicant] when he was arrested. FIM 25,000 of the above-mentioned money was hidden in the body of a car. Considering that [the applicant] has testified that he has been unemployed for quite some time now it is not credible that the money was earned by him as a locksmith.", "H. has had much more telephone connections with [the applicant] than any other accused in this case. In addition to that [the applicant] has been in close contact with the rest of the accused.", "It must be found that [the applicant] has received at least FIM 36,000 as the illegal profit of his actions.\u201d", "On 7 December 1994 the applicant appealed to the Helsinki Court of Appeal (hovioikeus, hovr\u00e4tt), requesting an oral hearing before the Court of Appeal. He stated that he should not have been found guilty on the basis of N.\u2019s statements as there was no other evidence against him and as N. had withdrawn his statements as far as the applicant was concerned. The applicant and N. did not appear before the court at the same hearing until 30 August 1994. At that hearing N. did not repeat his statements concerning the allegations against the applicant. The additional investigations did not finish until 27 September 1994, when N. declared that he would remain silent from then onwards. N. did not repeat his statements at the later stages of the proceedings and, thus, no questions were put to N. either by the applicant\u2019s counsel or by the public prosecutor. According to the applicant, N.\u2019s statements could not be regarded as credible and therefore, there was no evidence at all against him. He also pointed out that the report concerning telecommunications between the accused was finished on 7 November 1994 and submitted to the court and to the accused\u2019s legal counsel on 8 November 1994, i.e. on the day of the conviction.", "On 27 April 1994 the Court of Appeal upheld the District Court\u2019s judgment without holding an oral hearing. On 8 September 1995 the Supreme Court (korkein oikeus, h\u00f6gsta domstolen) refused the applicant leave to appeal."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
