The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Bucharest.", "7. As a member of the Association of Italians of Romania, he stood as a candidate in the parliamentary elections of 26 November 2000 for the Italian Community of Romania, one of the organisations representing the Italian minority in Romania. That organisation submitted a single-candidate list containing the applicant\u2019s name in nineteen of the forty-two constituencies.", "8. Once the votes had been counted, the Central Electoral Office decided, on the basis of Article 4 of Law no. 68/1992 on elections to the Chamber of Deputies and to the Senate (\u201cLaw no. 68/1992\u201d), to allocate the parliamentary seat belonging to the Italian minority to the Italian Community of Romania, which had secured 21,263 votes at national level.", "9. Although at national level the applicant had secured 5,624 votes out of a total of 21,263, the Central Electoral Office allocated the parliamentary seat to another member of the Italian Community of Romania, Ms Ileana Stana Ionescu, who had stood for election on another single-candidate list and had secured only 2,943 votes, but in a single constituency.", "10. On 1 December 2000 the applicant challenged the decision allocating the parliamentary seat before the Central Electoral Office. On 2 December 2000 the Office dismissed his challenge by a majority. That decision was signed by six judges and six representatives of political parties.", "11. The relevant parts of that decision read:", "\u201cIn accordance with Article 4 \u00a7 2 of Law no. 68/1992, as amended and supplemented, organisations of citizens belonging to national minorities participating in elections are accorded the same legal status as political parties for the purposes of the electoral process.", "With regard to the Italian minority, the votes were centralised and the parliamentary seats were allocated, in accordance with Article 66 of the Law, to the organisation having secured the greatest number of votes and on the basis of the order of candidates appearing on that organisation\u2019s winning list, there being no provision in law for individual nomination.", "It should be specified that the government\u2019s Emergency Ordinance no. 165 of 15 [sic] October 2000 granting national minorities the right to submit the same list of candidates for the Chamber of Deputies in more than one constituency does not infringe the principle of parliamentary seats being allocated by constituency, the basis of that regulation being to determine, in such instances, the ethnic minority organisation having the largest number of votes, and not to breach the principle of territorial representation in elections.\u201d", "12. In a dissenting opinion, a representative of a political party submitted that Article 68 \u00a7 1 (g) of Law no. 68/1992 should be interpreted to mean that in the case of a given ethnic minority, the parliamentary seat should be allocated to the first candidate on the organisation\u2019s national list having gained the most votes, again at national level.", "13. On 2 December 2000 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Central Electoral Office against its decision of the same date. On 3 December 2000 the Office, sitting as a panel composed of six judges and twelve representatives of political parties, declared the appeal inadmissible on the ground that its decisions were final.", "14. On 4 December 2000 the applicant submitted his case to the Constitutional Court. By a letter of 11 December 2000, in which reference was made to Article 21 of the Romanian Constitution guaranteeing free access to the courts, the court informed the applicant that it did not have jurisdiction in matters concerning electoral disputes.", "15. On 4 December 2000 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court of Justice. By a decision of 13 December 2000, that court declared the appeal inadmissible on the ground that the decisions of the Central Electoral Office were final.", "16. On 8 December 2000 the applicant repeated his challenge in a submission to the Chamber of Deputies Validation Commission, but was unsuccessful. The transcript of the Chamber of Deputies\u2019 session of 15 December 2000, published on the website of that institution, shows that the applicant\u2019s challenge was rejected on the same ground as that put forward by the Central Electoral Office.", "17.

This applies in particular to the election results: individual citizens may challenge them on the grounds of irregularities in the voting procedures.

There is much to be said for this latter system in that the commissions are highly specialised whereas the courts tend to be less experienced with regard to electoral issues. As a precautionary measure, however, it is desirable that there should be some form of judicial supervision in place, making the higher commission the first appeal level and the competent court the second.", "Appeal to parliament, as the judge of its own election, is sometimes provided for but could result in political decisions. It is acceptable as a first instance in places where it is long established, but a judicial appeal should then be possible.", "Appeal proceedings should be as brief as possible, in any case concerning decisions to be taken before the election. On this point, two pitfalls must be avoided: first, that appeal proceedings retard the electoral process, and second, that, due to their lack of suspensive effect, decisions on appeals which could have been taken before, are taken after the elections.", "In addition, decisions on the results of elections must also not take too long, especially where the political climate is tense. This means both that the time-limits for appeals must be very short and that the appeal body must make its ruling as quickly as possible. Time-limits must, however, be long enough to make an appeal possible, to guarantee the exercise of rights of defence and a reflected decision. A time-limit of three to five days at first instance (both for lodging appeals and making rulings) seems reasonable for decisions to be taken before the elections. It is, however, permissible to grant a little more time to Supreme and Constitutional Courts for their rulings.", "The procedure must also be simple, and providing voters with special appeal forms helps to make it so. It is necessary to eliminate formalism, and so avoid decisions of inadmissibility, especially in politically sensitive cases.", "It is also vital that the appeal procedure, and especially the powers and responsibilities of the various bodies involved in it, should be clearly regulated by law, so as to avoid any positive or negative conflicts of jurisdiction. Neither the appellants nor the authorities should be able to choose the appeal body. The risk that successive bodies will refuse to give a decision is seriously increased where it is theoretically possible to appeal to either the courts or an electoral commission, or where the powers of different courts \u2013 e.g. the ordinary courts and the Constitutional Court \u2013 are not clearly differentiated ...", "Disputes relating to the electoral registers, which are the responsibility, for example, of the local administration operating under the supervision of or in cooperation with the electoral commissions, can be dealt with by courts of first instance.", "Standing in such appeals must be granted as widely as possible. It must be open to every elector in the constituency and to every candidate standing for election there to lodge an appeal. A reasonable quorum may, however, be imposed for appeals by voters on the results of elections.", "The appeal procedure should be of a judicial nature, in the sense that the right of the appellants to proceedings in which both parties are heard should be safeguarded.", "The powers of appeal bodies are important too. They should have authority to annul elections, if irregularities may have influenced the outcome, i.e. affected the distribution of seats. This is the general principle, but it should be open to adjustment, i.e. annulment should not necessarily affect the whole country or constituency \u2013 indeed, it should be possible to annul the results of just one polling station. This makes it possible to avoid the two extremes: annulling an entire election, although irregularities affect a small area only, and refusing to annul, because the area affected is too small. In zones where the results have been annulled, the elections must be repeated.", "Where higher-level commissions are appeal bodies, they should be able to rectify or annul ex officio the decisions of lower electoral commissions.\u201d", "23. The Report on electoral law and electoral administration in Europe (\u201cSynthesis study on recurrent challenges and problematic issues\u201d) was adopted by the Council for Democratic Elections at its 17th meeting (Venice, 8-9 June 2006) and by the Venice Commission at its 67th plenary session (Venice, 9-10 June 2006). The relevant parts thereof read as follows:", "\u201c167. Complaint and appeals procedures must be open at least to each voter, candidate, and party. A reasonable quorum may, however, be imposed for appeals by voters on the results of election (CDL-AD(2002)023rev, para. 99). In order to comply with international standards, the complaint and appeals procedures should clearly provide the following rights for voters, candidates, and political parties: the rights to file a complaint, to present evidence in support of the complaint, to a public and fair hearing on the complaint, to an impartial and transparent proceedings on the complaint [sic], to an effective and speedy remedy, as well as to appeal an appellate court if a remedy is denied (see for example CDL-AD(2004)027, para. 111). In practice, however, these rights are not always respected. At times, even credible complaints are left without any legal redress.", "168. Due to different legal and political traditions, a variety of procedures are used in the resolution of election disputes. In many established democracies in western Europe (like France, Germany, Italy, or the United Kingdom) election appeals are heard by ordinary administrative and judicial bodies operating under special procedures. In contrast, in most emerging and new democracies in central and eastern Europe (and in other regions of the world), the responsibility for deciding on election complaints and appeals is shared between independent electoral commissions and ordinary courts ...\u201d", "24. The Report on electoral law and national minorities was adopted by the Venice Commission on 25 January 2000. It concerns the central element of public life \u2013 participation in a State\u2019s elected bodies, especially the national legislature. Such participation is studied through electoral law and the possibilities it gives members of national minorities of being present in elected bodies.", "Rules of electoral law which provide for special representation of minorities are an exception. Of the States which replied to the Commission\u2019s questionnaire, only three (Croatia, Romania and Slovenia) provided for the election of deputies intended to represent national minorities. According to the report, Romania is the country where the largest number of minority parties or organisations (treated as political parties for electoral purposes) took part in elections and have deputies and senators in the parliament.", "Other systems, while not necessarily guaranteeing the presence of members of national minorities in the elected bodies, facilitate the representation of minority organisations. In Germany and Poland, threshold rules do not apply to such organisations.", "The Belgian system is specific. The body of institutions is conceived in such a way as to establish a balance between the different linguistic groups (rather than between minorities in the strict sense). Moreover, in certain areas which are mixed from a linguistic point of view, adjustments have been made so that electors from different linguistic communities are represented in the elected body.", "In most cases, however, the representation of minorities in an elected body is achieved through the application of the ordinary rules of electoral law, which treat people belonging to national minorities and others in the same way.", "25. The Lund recommendations were adopted in Lund (Sweden) in September 1999 by a group of international experts under the aegis of the High Commissioner on National Minorities of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). The relevant parts of those recommendations read as follows:", "\u201c(7) Experience in Europe and elsewhere demonstrates the importance of the electoral process for facilitating the participation of minorities in the political sphere. States shall guarantee the right of persons belonging to national minorities to take part in the conduct of public affairs, including through the rights to vote and stand for office without discrimination.", "(8) The regulation of the grouping and activity of political parties shall comply with the international law principle of freedom of association. This principle includes the freedom to establish political parties based on communal identities as well as those not identified exclusively with the interests of a specific community.", "(9) The electoral system should facilitate minority representation and influence.", "\u2013 Where minorities are concentrated territorially, single-member districts may provide sufficient minority representation.", "\u2013 Proportional representation systems, where a political party\u2019s share in the national vote is reflected in its share of the legislative seats, may assist in the representation of minorities.", "\u2013 Some forms of preference voting, where voters rank candidates in order of choice, may facilitate minority representation and promote inter-communal cooperation.", "\u2013 Lower numerical thresholds for representation in the legislature may enhance the inclusion of national minorities in governance.", "(10) The geographic boundaries of electoral districts should facilitate the equitable representation of national minorities.\u201d", "The Lund recommendations are set out in the \u201cGuidelines to Assist National Minority Participation in the Electoral Process\u201d published in January 2001 under the aegis of the OSCE.", "26. Despite differences in the organisation and characteristics of the electoral administration responsible for declaring results and the distribution of seats (independent electoral commissions, government structures, temporary polling stations, courts), the information available to the Court concerning the legislation of a large number of Council of Europe member States shows a degree of convergence as regards the existence of a post-electoral system of appeals. In certain States it is possible to lodge an appeal with a recognised court or tribunal body, be it an ordinary court, a special electoral court or a Constitutional Court. While certain countries make provision for up to two stages of appeal before the judicial authorities, others envisage only one such appeal, at first instance. The three countries that envisage no judicial remedy beyond validation of powers by the legislative chamber are in western Europe (Belgium, Italy and Luxembourg). The tendency towards investing courts with jurisdiction for post-electoral disputes is in line with the European standards recommended by the Venice Commission, which points out that in all cases there must be a judicial remedy available, since an appeal to the parliamentary validation commission or an electoral commission does not offer sufficient guarantees.", "27. This is the system used by Romania and Albania. In Albania, decisions relating to the declaration of results may be challenged before the central electoral commission itself. However, the losing parties may subsequently appeal against the decision before a court (the electoral chamber of the Tirana Court of Appeal).", "28. While such a practice is fairly widespread, three countries (Belgium, Italy and Luxembourg) stand out because the only post-election remedy available is validation by parliament, the decisions of the electoral offices being deemed to be final. That said, those three countries have enjoyed a long tradition of democracy which would tend to dissipate any doubts as to the legitimacy of such a practice. The Venice Commission in general has reservations as to the effectiveness of this type of remedy, however, as there could be doubts as to the impartiality of such bodies (see paragraph 22 above).", "29. The French example may be held up in this regard: when the validation commission (which at the time was the only body authorised to hear appeals) excluded twenty-five Poujadist MPs from parliament in 1956, the Constitutional Council created by the 1958 Constitution was tasked with avoiding such pitfalls and the practice of validation purely and simply disappeared from the French parliamentary landscape. It may also be useful to point out that in 2005, Switzerland created the possibility of an appeal to the Federal Court (while previously, the verification of powers by the National Council served as the only appeal process).", "30. Nevertheless, that practice remains the norm in certain States. Furthermore, various countries, including Switzerland, continue to use a dual system. Judicial review does not de facto prevent validation by parliament, in so far as their objectives remain separate. The purpose of the first is to settle potential disputes through the courts while the purpose of the second is to validate mandates by means of political supervision. This type of validation acknowledges the specific nature and independence of the legislature in relation both to the executive and the judiciary.", "31. One type of appeal is that lodged with an \u201cordinary\u201d court. The competent authorities may be administrative courts and courts of appeal, as in the following countries: Andorra, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia (Tbilisi Court and Court of Appeal), Hungary, Latvia (Department of Administrative Affairs of the Senate of the Supreme Court), Spain (Administrative Appeals Division of the Supreme Court) and the United Kingdom (Election Court of the High Court and appeal to the Court of Appeal).", "32. Many countries confer jurisdiction for post-electoral disputes on the Constitutional Court. However, that court may not necessarily have the same powers of review from one system to another. It may merely review constitutionality (Georgia) or it may verify and approve the results submitted by the electoral commission (Azerbaijan).", "33. Certain countries have adopted this type of remedy either at first or last instance: Andorra (second instance), Armenia (first instance), Croatia (first instance), Estonia (first instance, before the Supreme Court as the Constitutional Court), France (first instance), Georgia (only where issues of constitutionality arise), Malta (first instance), Spain (second instance and protection of fundamental rights) and Switzerland (second instance before the Federal Court).", "34. Lastly, some systems include courts which deal only with electoral disputes. They are composed of judges who are generally from other jurisdictions and they have a limited lifespan (the time-limit for an appeal following the publication of the results), but they enjoy exclusive jurisdiction in electoral disputes. Specific bodies of this kind have been set up in the following countries: Albania (electoral chamber of the Tirana Court of Appeal), Greece (Special Supreme Court, specialising in certain types of dispute, including electoral disputes), Sweden (Electoral Review Board) and the United Kingdom (Election Court).", "35. Only one case is known \u2013 that of Switzerland (challenge before the cantonal government). This is the result of the country\u2019s history and federal tradition; however, the powers of the cantonal government go hand in hand with validation by the Conseil national (Parliament) of its own powers and appeal to the Federal Court since 2005."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
