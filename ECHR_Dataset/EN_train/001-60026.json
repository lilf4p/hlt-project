BELGIUM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Preliminary objection rejected (non-exhaustion of domestic remedies);Violation of Art. 5-1;No violation of Art. 5-2;Violation of Art. 5-4;Violation of P4-4;No violation of Art. 13+3;Violation of Art. 13+P4-4;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["7. Mr J\u00e1n \u010conka, Mrs M\u00e1ria \u010conkov\u00e1, Miss Nad'a \u010conkov\u00e1 and Miss Nikola \u010conkov\u00e1 are Slovakian nationals of Roma origin who were born in 1960, 1961, 1985 and 1991 respectively. The first two applicants are the parents of the third and fourth applicants.", "8. The applicants say that on several occasions between March and November 1998 they were violently assaulted by skinheads in the Slovak Republic. Indeed, in November 1998 Mr \u010conka had been so seriously injured in an assault that he had had to be hospitalised. The police had been called but had refused to intervene. Several days later Mr and Mrs \u010conka had been subjected to renewed insults and threats by skinheads, but the police had again refused to intervene.", "As a result of those constant threats, the applicants had decided to flee Slovakia and travel to Belgium, where they had arrived at the beginning of November 1998: Mr \u010conka and the two minor children on 6 November and Mrs \u010conka two days later.", "9. On 12 November 1998 the applicants requested political asylum in Belgium.", "10. On 3 March 1999 their applications for asylum were declared inadmissible by the Minister of the Interior through the Directorate-General of the Aliens Office on the ground that they had not produced sufficient evidence to show that their lives were at risk in Slovakia for the purposes of the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. The decisions refusing permission to remain in Belgium were accompanied by a decision refusing permission to enter the territory itself, endorsed with an order to leave the territory within five days.", "11. On 5 March 1999 the applicants lodged an appeal under the urgent-applications procedure with the Commissioner-General for Refugees and Stateless Persons (\u201cthe Commissioner-General\u201d) against the decisions refusing them permission to remain in Belgium.", "12. On 14 April 1999 Mr \u010conka was invited to attend the Commissioner-General's Office to set out his grounds for seeking asylum. He failed to keep the appointment.", "13. On 23 April 1999 Mrs \u010conkov\u00e1, assisted by an interpreter, was heard by representatives of the Commissioner-General's Office at Ghent Prison, where she was in custody pending trial. On 17 May 1999 she was sentenced to eight months' imprisonment for theft by the Ghent Criminal Court.", "14. On 18 June 1999 the Commissioner-General's Office upheld the decision of the Aliens Office refusing the applicants permission to remain. Its decision in Mr \u010conka's case was based on his failure to attend his appointment without showing due cause. As regards Mrs \u010conkov\u00e1, in some two pages of reasons the Commissioner-General pointed out major discrepancies in her deposition and expressed serious doubts about her credibility.", "For example, Mrs \u010conkov\u00e1 had declared among other things that on 4 November 1998 her husband, Mr \u010conka, had been assaulted by skinheads so violently that he had had to be taken to hospital. The police had been called but had not come out. That incident had been the direct cause of their decision to flee Slovakia. However, the Commissioner-General considered that statement to be refuted by the fact that the travel tickets had been issued before the above incident of 4 November: Mrs \u010conkov\u00e1's plane ticket on 2 October and her husband's and their children's bus tickets for the journey to Belgium on 2 November 1998. Furthermore, Mrs \u010conkov\u00e1's account of the incident did not match her stepdaughter's, in particular on the important issue of whether the police had attended the scene.", "The Commissioner-General stipulated in his decisions that the applicants could be deported to the country from which they had fled (Slovakia), and that for the purposes of calculating the five-day period for leaving the territory, which had been suspended by the application under the urgent procedure, time began to run again from the date of service of the decisions on the applicants.", "15. On 24 June 1999 Mrs \u010conkov\u00e1 was released and a new order was served on her to leave the territory within five days, that is to say by midnight on 29 June.", "16. On 3 August 1999 the applicants lodged applications with the Conseil d'Etat for judicial review of the decision of 18 June 1999 and for a stay of execution under the ordinary procedure. They also applied for legal aid.", "17. On 23 September 1999 the Conseil d'Etat dismissed the applications for legal aid on the grounds that they had not been accompanied by the means certificate required by Article 676-3 of the Judicial Code, a photocopy, rather than the original, of the certificate having been enclosed with Mrs \u010conkov\u00e1's application. Consequently, the applicants were invited by the orders refusing legal aid to pay the court fees within fifteen days after service. As they failed to respond to that invitation, their applications for judicial review and for a stay of execution were struck out of the list on 28 October 1999.", "18. At the end of September 1999 the Ghent police sent a notice to a number of Slovakian Roma families, including the applicants, requiring them to attend the police station on 1 October 1999. The notice was drafted in Dutch and Slovak and stated that their attendance was required to enable the files concerning their applications for asylum to be completed.", "19. At the police station, where a Slovak-speaking interpreter was also present, the applicants were served with a fresh order to leave the territory dated 29 September 1999, accompanied by a decision for their removal to Slovakia and their detention for that purpose. The documents served, which were all in identical terms, informed the recipients that they could apply to the Conseil d'Etat for judicial review of the deportation order and for a stay of execution \u2013 provided that they did so within sixty days of service of the decision \u2013 and to the committals division (chambre du conseil) of the criminal court against the order for their detention. According to the Government, some of the aliens concerned were nevertheless allowed to leave the police station of their own free will on humanitarian grounds or for administrative reasons.", "20. A few hours later the applicants and other Roma families, accompanied by an interpreter, were taken to a closed transit centre, known as \u201cTransit Centre 127 bis\u201d, at Steenokkerzeel near Brussels Airport. It appears that the interpreter only remained at the centre briefly. According to the Government, he could have been recalled to the centre at the applicants' request. The applicants say that they were told that they had no further remedy against the deportation order.", "21. While at the centre, the Slovakian families received visits from a delegation of Belgian members of Parliament, the Slovakian Consul, delegates of various non-governmental organisations and doctors. At 10.30 p.m. on Friday 1 October 1999 the applicants' counsel, Mr van Overloop, was informed by the President of the Roma Rights League that his clients were in custody. Taking the view that he was still instructed by them, Mr van Overloop sent a fax on 4 October 1999 to the Aliens Office informing it that the applicants were in Transit Centre 127 bis awaiting repatriation to Slovakia. He requested that no action be taken to deport them, as they had to take care of a member of their family who was in hospital. However, Mr van Overloop did not appeal against the deportation or detention orders made on 29 September 1999.", "22. On 5 October 1999 the families concerned were taken to Melsbroek Military Airport, where the seat numbers allocated to them in the aircraft were marked on their hands with a ballpoint pen. The aircraft left Belgium for Slovakia at 5.45 p.m.", "23. Shortly afterwards the Minister of the Interior declared in reply to a parliamentary question put on 23 December 1999:", "\u201cOwing to the large concentration of asylum-seekers of Slovakian nationality in Ghent, arrangements have been made for their collective repatriation to Slovakia. ... Reports I have received from the mayor of Ghent and the Director-General of the Aliens Office indicate that the operation was properly prepared, even if the unfortunate wording of the letter sent by the Ghent police to some of the Slovaks may have been misleading. Both the Aliens Office and the Ghent Police Department were surprised by the large number of Slovaks who responded to the notice sent to them. That factual circumstance resulted in their being detained in Transit Centre 127 bis for deportation a few days later. ...\u201d", "24. The procedure relating to the recognition of refugee status is governed under Belgian law by the Law of 15 December 1980 on the entry, residence, settlement and expulsion of aliens (\u201cthe Aliens Act\u201d) and by the Royal Decree of 8 October 1981 on the entry, residence, settlement and expulsion of aliens.", "The procedure for according refugee status is in two stages. The first concerns admissibility for refugee status, while the second concerns eligibility for such status.", "The authorities with jurisdiction to take part in the examination of the issue of admissibility are the Aliens' Office and, on appeal, the Commissioner-General for Refugees and Stateless Persons, as administrative authorities, and the Conseil d'Etat, which hears applications for judicial review. The relevant authorities at the eligibility stage are the Commissioner-General for Refugees and Stateless Persons, as the administrative authority, the Permanent Tribunal for Refugees' Appeals, as an administrative tribunal, and the Conseil d'Etat, which hears administrative appeals on points of law. Lastly, the committals division (chambre du conseil) of the criminal court has jurisdiction to hear appeals against orders depriving aliens of their liberty during or at the end of the proceedings (see below).", "25. The provisions of the Aliens Act applicable in the instant case read as follows:", "\u201cExcept where permitted by international treaty, statute or royal decree, aliens may not stay more than three months in the Kingdom, unless a different period is stipulated in the visa or the authorisation in lieu stamped in their passport or on the travel document issued in lieu thereof.", "...\u201d", "\u201cWithout prejudice to any more favourable provision in any international treaty, the Minister or his or her delegate may order an alien who is not authorised or has not been given permission to remain for more than three months or to settle in the Kingdom to leave the territory before a set date:", "...", "(2) if the alien has stayed in the Kingdom beyond the period fixed in accordance with section 6, or is unable to establish that the period has not expired;", "...", "In the same sets of circumstances, if the Minister or his or her delegate considers it necessary, they may have the alien deported.", "The alien may be detained for that purpose for the time strictly necessary for the execution of the measure provided that the period of detention shall not exceed two months.\u201d", "\u201cAny order to leave the territory or deportation order shall state which provision of section 7 is being applied.\u201d", "Section 57/2", "\u201cThe Commissioner-General's Office for Refugees and Stateless Persons is hereby established. It shall be attached to the Ministry and shall comprise a Commissioner-General for Refugees and Stateless Persons and two deputies. The Commissioner-General and his or her deputies shall be wholly independent in taking their decisions and expressing their opinions.\u201d", "\u201cThe Commissioner-General shall be in charge of the Commissioner-General's Office for Refugees and Stateless Persons.", "The Commissioner-General shall be appointed by the King by a decree approved by the Cabinet on a proposal by the Minister.", "The Commissioner-General shall be appointed for a period of five years. His or her term in office may be renewed.", "...\u201d", "\u201cAn appeal under the urgent-applications procedure shall lie to the Commissioner-General for Refugees and Stateless Persons against decisions of the Minister or his or her delegate pursuant to section 52 refusing aliens claiming refugee status permission to enter, remain or settle in the Kingdom.\u201d", "\u201cAliens against whom a measure has been taken depriving them of their liberty pursuant to sections 7, 25, 27, 29, second paragraph, 51/5(3), fourth paragraph, 52 bis, fourth paragraph, 54, 63/5, third paragraph, 67 and 74/6 may appeal against that measure by lodging a notice of appeal with the committals division of the criminal court with jurisdiction for the place where they reside in the Kingdom or the place where they are found.", "...", "They may renew the appeal referred to in the preceding paragraphs at monthly intervals.", "...\u201d", "\u201cThe committals division shall deliver its decision within five working days from the date an appeal is lodged after hearing the submissions of the alien or his or her counsel and the opinion of State Counsel's Office.", "... If the committals division fails to deliver its decision within the period fixed, the alien shall be released.", "The committals division shall review the legality of the detention and deportation orders but shall have no power to review their reasonableness.", "An appeal shall lie against orders of the committals division by the alien, State Counsel's Office and, in the circumstances set out in section 74, the Minister or his or her delegate.", "The procedure shall be the same as that applicable under the statutory provisions on pre-trial detention, with the exception of the provisions relating to arrest warrants, investigating judges, prohibitions on communications, release on licence or on bail, and the right to inspect the administrative file.", "Counsel for the alien may consult the case file at the registry of the relevant court during the two working days preceding the hearing.", "The registrar shall notify counsel of the decision by registered letter.\u201d", "\u201cIf the committals division decides that the alien shall not remain in custody, he or she shall be released as soon as the decision has become final.", "The Minister may order the alien to reside in a designated place either until the deportation order has been executed or until his or her appeal has been decided.\u201d", "26. In a judgment of 14 March 2001 the Court of Cassation reversed a decision of the Indictment Division of the Liege Court of Appeal ordering an alien's release. The Indictment Division had held that, contrary to Article 13 of the Convention, the authorities had deprived the alien of an effective remedy in law by interpreting the fact that appeals to the Conseil d'Etat had no suspensive effect as meaning that it was lawful for illegal immigrants to be forcibly expelled. The Court of Cassation held that, on the contrary, the issue whether an alien who had applied for refugee status had an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 13 had to be examined in the light of the procedure as a whole. After observing that appeals to the Commissioner-General for Refugees and Stateless Persons under the urgent procedure were of suspensive effect and that aliens were entitled, when lodging applications with the Conseil d'Etat for judicial review, to apply at the same time for a stay of execution under the ordinary or extremely urgent procedure, it concluded that those remedies taken as a whole satisfied the requirements of Article 13 of the Convention.", "27. The relevant provisions of the Royal Decree of 5 December 1991 laying down the urgent procedure in the Conseil d'Etat read as follows:", "\u201cIn cases certified to be extremely urgent, Article 7 and 11 to 14 shall not be applicable.", "In such cases, the president may issue a summons ordering the applicants, the respondent, any intervening party and any persons with an interest in the outcome of the case to attend a hearing (which may be held at the president's home) at the time indicated, including on bank holidays and on a few days' or a few hours' notice.", "The order shall be served on Crown Counsel or on a designated member of Crown Counsel's Office.", "The notice shall, if applicable, indicate whether the administrative file has been lodged.", "If the opposing party has not communicated the administrative file beforehand, it shall produce it to the president at the hearing and the president may suspend the hearing to allow the representative of Crown Counsel's Office, the applicants and any intervening party to inspect it.", "The president may order immediate execution of the judgment.\u201d", "\u201cApplications for provisional measures shall be made separately from applications for a stay of execution or for judicial review.", "The application shall be signed by a party, a person with an interest in the outcome of the case or a lawyer satisfying the conditions laid down by section 19, second paragraph, of the consolidated Acts.\u201d", "\u201cIf an applicant for a stay of execution also seeks extremely urgent provisional measures, Article 25 shall apply to his or her application. Articles 29 to 31 shall not be applicable.", "In cases certified to be extremely urgent, the president may issue a summons ordering the parties and any persons with an interest in the outcome of the case to attend a hearing (which may be held at the president's home) at the time indicated, including on bank holidays and on a few days' or a few hours' notice.", "The order shall be served on Crown Counsel or on a designated member of Crown Counsel's Office.", "The notice shall, if applicable, indicate whether the administrative file has been lodged.", "The president may order immediate execution of the judgment.\u201d", "28. The Conseil d'Etat's practice direction on the \u201cprocedure to be followed by duty staff at weekends\u201d includes the following passage concerning \u201cthe receipt of applications for stays under the extremely urgent procedure\u201d:", "\u201cThe caretaker shall contact the duty judge, the representative of Crown Counsel's Office and the registrar so that the degree of urgency can be determined and a hearing date agreed. In cases concerning 'aliens', the registrar shall, at the judge's request, contact the Aliens Office to ascertain the scheduled repatriation date and shall seek confirmation by fax. It is advisable in all cases concerning 'aliens' for the Minister of the Interior and the Commissioner-General for Refugees and Stateless Persons to be recorded as the opposing parties. It is also prudent in cases involving imminent repatriation to order the applicant's appearance in person.\u201d", "29. There are a number of examples in the case-law of the Conseil d'Etat of cases in which it ordered a stay of execution of a deportation order on the same day as the application for a stay under the extremely urgent procedure or on the following day, or, in any event, before the time-limit for leaving the territory expired. These are to be found in the following judgments: nos. 40.383 of 20 September 1992, 51.302 of 25 January 1995, 57.807 of 24 January 1996, 75.646 of 2 September 1998, 81.912 of 26 July 1999, 84.741 of 18 January 2000 and 85.025 of 1 February 2000.", "The Conseil d'Etat has also ruled that it may entertain applications for judicial review of deportation orders (see, for instance, the following judgments: nos. 56.599 of 4 December 1995, 57.646 of 19 January 1996, 80.505 of 28 May 1999 and 85.828 of 3 March 2000).", "30. In August 1999 there was a sharp increase in the number of asylum-seekers from Slovakia. While the average for the first seven months of 1999 had been 22 applications monthly, including 51 applications in July alone, no less than 359 applications were made between 1 and 24 August 1999. On that latter date, the Director-General of the Aliens Office wrote to the Minister of the Interior and the Commissioner-General for Refugees and Stateless Persons to inform them of his intention to deal with asylum applications from Slovakian nationals rapidly in order to send a clear signal to discourage other potential applicants.", "31. A \u201cNote providing general guidance on overall policy in immigration matters\u201d approved by the Cabinet on 1 October 1999, contained, inter alia, the following passage:", "\u201cA plan for collective repatriation is currently under review, both to send a signal to the Slovakian authorities and to deport this large number of illegal immigrants whose presence can no longer be tolerated.\u201d", "32. The report on Slovakia of 15 June 1998 of the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance contains the following passage:", "\u201cIn Slovakia as in several other countries of central and eastern Europe, Roma/Gypsies belong to the most disadvantaged sections of society. Apart from a few isolated cases, they live outside the public arena, cut off from decision-making centres and the main currents of political opinion. They are often the victims of skinheads' violence and are regularly subjected to ill-treatment and discrimination by the authorities.\u201d", "33. A further report produced by the applicants and drawn up after a joint mission to Slovakia in February 1999 of the Aliens Office and the Commissioner-General's Office for Refugees and Stateless Persons appears to confirm the existence of serious discrimination against Roma, who are treated as a lower class."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "5", "P4"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-4", "P4-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3", "5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-2"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
