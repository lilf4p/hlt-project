FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Ledi Bianku;Neboj\u0161a Vu\u010dini\u0107;Nicolas Bratza;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Sverre Erik Jebens;Vincent A. De Gaetano;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["1. The applicant, Ms Ulla Annikki Karttunen, is a Finnish national who was born in 1956 and lives in Helsinki.", "2.", "3. The applicant is an artist who exhibited her work \u201cthe Virgin-Whore Church\u201d in an art gallery in Helsinki. On 14 February 2008 the exhibition was opened for invited guests and on 15 February 2008 it was opened to the public. The work included hundreds of photographs of teenage girls or otherwise very young women in sexual poses and acts. The pictures had been downloaded from free Internet pages and some of them were extremely violent or degrading.", "4. On 15 February the police seized the pictures and the exhibition was closed down. On 21 February 2008 the police seized the applicant\u2019s computer.", "5. On 14 March 2008 the public prosecutor pressed charges against the applicant on two counts. His decision to press charges was based on the Deputy Prosecutor General\u2019s (apulaisvaltakunnansyytt\u00e4j\u00e4, bitr\u00e4dande riks\u00e5klagaren) decision to press charges in the matter. He also requested, inter alia, that the seized pictures be confiscated.", "6. On 21 May 2008 the Helsinki District Court (k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus, tingsr\u00e4tten) convicted the applicant of possessing and distributing sexually obscene pictures depicting children. The court found, by referring, inter alia, to Article 10 of the Convention and other Council of Europe conventions, that everybody had the right to freedom of expression as well as to freedom of the arts unless the exercise of these rights constituted a crime. Finding the applicant guilty was justified for the protection of morals. Moreover, the faces of many of the children or young women in the pictures were clearly recognisable and their reputation and right to private life had to be protected. Even though the applicant\u2019s intention had not been to commit a criminal act but, on the contrary, to criticise easy access to child pornography, possessing and distributing sexually obscene pictures depicting children were still criminal acts. Their criminalisation was based on the need to protect children against sexual abuse as well as against violation of their privacy. As to the sanctions, the court noted that the applicant had intended to provoke general discussion about child pornography. Taking into account also the other circumstances, inter alia, that the crimes were minor and excusable, the court did not impose any sanctions on the applicant. Instead, the court ordered all the pictures to be confiscated.", "7. By letter dated 19 June 2008 the applicant appealed to the Helsinki Court of Appeal (hovioikeus, hovr\u00e4tten), requesting that the charges be dismissed. She claimed that her work as an artist had to be equated with the work of a journalist or a scientist, and that she had therefore had a justification for the possession and distribution of the pictures in question.", "8. On 6 March 2009 the Helsinki Court of Appeal upheld the District Court\u2019s judgment. It found, inter alia, that the protection of the privacy of children took precedence over the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression. The fact that the identity of the children was not known or that the pictures could be illegally obtained elsewhere did not remove the applicant\u2019s criminal liability nor justify her acts.", "9. By letter dated 5 May 2009 the applicant appealed to the Supreme Court (korkein oikeus, h\u00f6gsta domstolen), reiterating the grounds for appeal already presented before the Court of Appeal.", "10. On 29 June 2009 the Supreme Court refused the applicant leave to appeal.", "11. The Constitution of Finland (Suomen perustuslaki, Finlands grundlag, Act no. 731/1999) provides in its section 12 the following:", "\u201cEveryone has the freedom of expression.
