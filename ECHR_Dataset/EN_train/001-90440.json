On 6 May 2004 it found the applicant guilty as charged.

The applicant\u2019s offence was punishable with two to eight years\u2019 imprisonment. The District Court took account of the protraction of the proceedings as an important mitigating factor and sentenced him to three and a half years\u2019 imprisonment and a four-year prohibition on driving.", "9.
