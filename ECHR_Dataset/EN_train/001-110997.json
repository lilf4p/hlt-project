The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "2. The applicant, a former customs officer, was charged with accepting a bribe from another customs officer, P.D., in 2004.", "3. On 29 August 2006 P.D. was convicted by the Przemy\u015bl Regional Court of, inter alia, offering a bribe to the applicant in 2004. The court was composed of Judge A.S., and two lay judges, D.B. and C.J.", "4. Subsequently, on 9 November 2006, the same court, in the same composition, convicted the applicant of accepting the same bribe from P.D.", "5. On an unspecified date the applicant\u2019s lawyer appealed against the firstinstance judgment. In his appeal he did not raise a complaint regarding the composition of the court.", "6. On 26 April 2007 the Supreme Court adopted a resolution and held that in circumstances such as those in the present case, where evidence which had constituted the basis for the conviction of one of the perpetrators of a crime was also to be the basis for the conviction of another perpetrator of the same offence, the judge who had examined the evidence against the convicted perpetrator should be withdrawn from examining the cases against the remaining perpetrators (see \u201cRelevant domestic law and practice\u201d below).", "7. On 17 August 2007 the applicant\u2019s lawyer sent a letter to the secondinstance court and, relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s resolution of 26 April 2007 submitted that the judges who had convicted the applicant should have been withdrawn from the proceedings.

It admitted that the three judges should not have examined the applicant\u2019s case. However, it found that the complaint had not been raised in the appeal and therefore could not be taken into account as one of the bases of the appeal. It also considered that the shortcoming in the proceedings before the first-instance court did not constitute one of the specific grounds for appeal referred to in Article 439 of the Code, which the court of appeal had to take into account ex officio. The Court of Appeal further noted that the only way to amend the first-instance judgment was to apply Article 440 of the Code; however, it found no grounds to do so.", "9.

Article 433 of the Code provides as follows:", "\u201cThe appellate court shall examine the case within the framework of an appeal.
