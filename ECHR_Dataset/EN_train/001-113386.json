The applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Szeksz\u00e1rd.", "6. The applicant, a retired senior police officer, was at the material time the chairperson of Tettrek\u00e9sz Police Trade Union. Between May 2007 and July 2009 she published a number of writings on the Trade Union\u2019s website, which was effectively under her editorial control, concerning outstanding remunerations due to police staff, alleged nepotism and undue political influence in the force, as well as dubious qualifications of senior police staff.", "7. The applicant was indicted for instigation to insubordination. On 29 April 2010 the Military Bench of the Budapest Regional Court found her guilty as charged and sentenced her to a fine and demotion. The court did not sustain the applicant\u2019s defence according to which the publication of such allegations belonged to the core of a trade union\u2019s activities. It held that those allegations were capable of causing insubordination and as such were hardly or not at all susceptible to any proof of their veracity.", "8. The Regional Court based its judgment inter alia on the following statements published by the applicant on the Internet:", "(1) \u201cThe staff are regularly required to work overtime without remuneration...\u201d \u201cFor years, clearly due allowances have not been paid to low-ranking staff...\u201d \u201cCurrently it is almost a prerequisite of becoming a senior police officer to have a political background or to be a relative or a descendant of other senior police officers.\u201d \u201cThe senior police officers\u2019 obvious violations of the law set a bad example for the force.\u201d \u201cThis is typical of senior police officers: they commit violations and infringements, and then, if we point this out, their reaction is striking back without any principles, suing and accusing of incitement in order to counter our suggestions to renew and clean up the force.\u201d \u201cWhy are we wondering at the infringements of police officers if law-breaking and tyrannising senior police officers go unpunished?\u201d", "(2) \u201cThe uninhibited infringements of the law committed by senior police officers placing themselves above the law go unpunished, and what is more, they are even decorated when, on order of the political authority in power, thousands, tens of thousands of discontented and underprivileged people are beaten by jaded police officers on the streets.\u201d \u201cThe \u2018Tettrek\u00e9sz\u2019 Police Trade Union commiserates with those Hungarian citizens whose human dignity and human rights were violated and affronted by acts of a prostituted leadership and of our criminal \u2018colleagues\u2019 and apologises for that.\u201d", "(3) \u201cPolice staff are getting more and more underprivileged and humiliated by their own leaders.\u201d \u201cSome senior police officers are active in trying to obtain that average citizens be punished rather than \u2018served and protected\u2019 by the police officers on the streets.\u201d \u201cSome well-paid senior police officers unprofessionally incite ordinary citizens and police officers against each other.\u201d \u201cWe constantly request the review of the often unprofessional selection procedure of senior police officers, but to no avail, because there is apparently no need for a citizen-friendly police.\u201d", "(4) \u201cThe senior police officers again demonstrated that they were incapable of upholding the public order in a party-neutral and politically neutral way... It is proven again that the Hungarian Police\u2019s primary objective is first and foremost not to maintain public order for the taxpaying citizens but to uphold the reign of current political leaders who have led Hungary into economic and moral distress.\u201d \u201cThe reputation of the Police has reached previously unseen depths because of the acts of the unprofessional and anti-national senior police officers non-complying with the spirit of the police oath.\u201d \u201cIt is obvious that the Police\u2019s core leadership is, in an unacceptable way, politically committed to the government of the country and that of the capital.\u201d", "(5) \u201cThe Head of the National Police Department is demonstrating every day that he is much more able to write obscene poems than to lead the Police; moreover, he is considerably much better in being an obstacle to the work of \u2018Tettrek\u00e9sz\u2019 Police Trade Union and in managing a police pop band than in cooperating with a representative trade union of the Police with the highest number of police officer members.\u201d \u201cA chaotic and highly unprofessional leadership is ruining the rest of the Police\u2019s reputation from day to day.\u201d", "9. On 8 December 2010 the Military Bench of the Budapest Court of Appeal upheld the applicant\u2019s conviction under section 357 of the Criminal Code. It held that the publication of the documents by the applicant had gone beyond her freedom of expression, given the particularities of the armed body to which she belonged. In the court\u2019s opinion, the views contained in the documents constituted one-sided criticism whose truthfulness could and should not be proven.", "10.

Such checks may not endanger or hinder the performance of the service tasks.", "(4) The trade union may draw the attention of the head of the organ in charge of the implementation of the rules to the shortcomings and omissions perceived in the course of the check. If the head fails to take the necessary action in due time, the trade union may institute appropriate proceedings. The body having conducted the proceedings shall be obliged to inform the trade union of the findings of the proceedings.", "(5) The rights specified under subsections (3)-(4) shall, in respect of issues falling into the supervisory bodies\u2019 scope of direction, be vested in the representative trade union within the given organisation. ...\u201d", "\u201c(1) While performing their service, members of professional staff shall be obliged to execute the orders of a supervisor or the instructions of a superior officer, unless they would commit a criminal offence thereby.", "(2) Except for the case specified in subsection (1), members of professional staff may not refuse the execution of an unlawful order. Where, however, the unlawful nature of the order was recognised, it shall immediately be drawn to the superior officer\u2019s attention.

In other cases service complaints shall be filed within the period of limitation applicable to the enforcement of the claim at issue.", "(3) The complaint shall be filed with the supervisor who took (omitted to take) the decision and who shall \u2013 in case he fails to grant it \u2013 transfer the case, together with the case files, to the supervisor-commander without delay.
