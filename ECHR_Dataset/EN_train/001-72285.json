GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant, Mr Werner Petersen, is a German national who was born in 1947 and lives in Neustadt. He is represented before the Court by Mr G. Rixe, a lawyer practising in Bielefeld.", "The applicant is the father of the child S., born out of wedlock on 3 May 1985. He had been living with Ms B.-K., the child\u2019s mother, from May 1980 to November 1985. After their separation S. lived with his mother. The applicant had contacts with S. until autumn 1994, when Ms B.K. prohibited further visits. He subsequently instituted numerous court proceedings concerning access to and custody of his son.", "The applicant\u2019s repeated motions to be granted access to S. by a court order were to no avail. From April 1998 until S. attained the age of majority on 3 May 2003 proceedings concerning the applicant\u2019s renewed request to be granted access to S. were pending in the Bremen Regional Court.", "Likewise, the applicant\u2019s motion lodged in 1995 to withdraw or restrict Ms B.-K.\u2019s right of custody in order to prevent her from moving abroad for three years with S. and her family was dismissed. The national courts found that there were no indications that there were risks for the child\u2019s well-being which could justify an interference with Ms B.-K.\u2019s right of custody. The applicant\u2019s motion lodged in 1999 to be granted joint custody of S. was equally rejected.", "Two joint applications (nos. 38282/97 and 68891/01) concerning the said access and custody matters are pending with this Court.", "On 6 December 2001 the Court declared inadmissible Mr Petersen\u2019s application no. 31178/96 concerning the change of S.\u2019s surname after Ms B.K.\u2019s marriage and compensation for financial losses because of an undue refusal of access.", "On 19 August 2000 the applicant lodged a request with the Kirchhain District Court partly to withdraw Ms B.-K.\u2019s custody of S. in order to secure the preparation of an expert report in the access proceedings pending in the Bremen Regional Court since April 1998. He also applied for interim measures to be taken.", "On 1 March 2001 the Frankfurt (Main) Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s motion for bias against District Court judge S. It found that there were no indications whatsoever that the judge challenged was biased. On 15 August 2001 the Frankfurt (Main) Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s objections against its decision.", "On 3 December 2001 the Kirchhain District Court conducted a hearing attended by the applicant and S.\u2019s guardian ad litem. It imposed a coercive penalty of 200 Deutschmarks on Ms B.-K. for failure to attend the hearing. It suspended the proceedings in order to await the outcome of the access proceedings pending in the Bremen Regional Court.", "On 21 January 2002 the Frankfurt (Main) Court of Appeal, following the applicant\u2019s and Ms B.-K.\u2019s appeals, quashed the District Court\u2019s order against Ms B.-K. to pay a coercive penalty for failure to attend the hearing because of a formal mistake.

The date for the hearing was then postponed until June 2002. On 3 June 2002 the Frankfurt (Main) Court of Appeal dismissed as inadmissible the applicant\u2019s appeal against the fixing of the dates for a hearing, as no appeal lay against these orders.", "On 9 July 2002 the Kirchhain District Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s further motion for bias against District Court judge S. as ill-founded. It found that the judge\u2019s conduct of the proceedings disclosed no indications of bias on her part. The applicant\u2019s objections were to no avail.", "On 30 August 2002 the Frankfurt (Main) Court of Appeal, endorsing the reasons given by the District Court, dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal against the District Court\u2019s decision of 9 July 2002.", "On 28 April 2003 the Federal Constitutional Court refused to admit the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint (1 BvR 1825/02) against the decisions of the Kirchhain District Court and the Frankfurt (Main) Court of Appeal concerning the applicant\u2019s motions for bias against District Court judge S. and the length of the proceedings.", "On 3 May 2003 S. attained the age of majority. At that time, the proceedings in the Kirchhain District Court had not yet been terminated.", "In previous proceedings brought by the applicant (3 F 563/99), the Frankfurt (Main) Court of Appeal found on 5 July 2000 that the applicant was entitled to obtain certain information about his son\u2019s development. Ms B.-K. was ordered to inform him about the type of school which S. attended, his class and his results, his interests in sports and music and any serious diseases, and to give him a recent photograph of his son.

It found that the applicant had inspected the entire case-files in November 2000 and therefore had no legitimate interest in being granted access again.", "On 22 April 2002 the Federal Constitutional Court refused to admit the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaints (nos. 1 BvR 278/02 and 1 BvR 406/02) against decisions concerning the applicant\u2019s request for access to his son and a request lodged in 2001 for information about his son\u2019s development. It imposed a fine of 500 euros (EUR) respectively for abuse of petition on the applicant.", "On 18 June 2002 the Registry of the Federal Constitutional Court informed the applicant that the court had decided not to modify its decision of 22 April 2002."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
