Four months later he was transferred to Austria and remanded in custody by the Feldkirch Regional Court (Landesgericht) on suspicion of murder and aggravated robbery.", "On 14 November 1996 the Feldkirch Regional Court sitting as an assize court (Geschwornengericht) acquitted the applicant of all the charges against him. Upon the pronouncement of the acquittal, the applicant was released. The judgment was served on the applicant on 2 December and became final on 30 December 1996.", "Immediately after the pronouncement of the acquittal, at the same hearing, the applicant requested compensation for his detention on remand.", "The Feldkirch Regional Court, with the same composition as above, dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim. It found that the suspicion against the applicant had not been dispelled and that, thus, the requirements of section 2 (1)(b) of the Compensation (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1969 (Strafrechtliches Entsch\u00e4digungsgesetz 1969 - \u201cthe 1969 Act\u201d) were not met.

Consequently, it quashed the acquittal of 14 November 1996. According to section 359 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the proceedings were resumed at the stage of preliminary investigations.", "On 9 February 2000 the Public Prosecutor filed the indictment, charging the applicant again with murder and aggravated robbery.", "On 25 February 2000 an international arrest warrant was issued.
