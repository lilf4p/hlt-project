On 27 December 1977 he applied to the Friuli-Venezia Giulia Regional Administrative Court (\u201cthe RAC\u201d) for judicial review of a decision of his employer\u2019s board of governors, which, on 6 September 1997, in adopting the staff regulations, had assigned to him a level of remuneration lower than that to which he considered himself to be entitled on the basis of the collective agreements on contracts of employment negotiated at national level by the unions concerned (accordi nazionali di lavoro del personale degli enti locali). He also contested the discrimination between himself and other employees, who were paid on the basis of the salary scales laid down in the contracts in question.", "9. On 10 March 1982 the RAC ordered the municipal welfare agency to file certain documents. In a judgment of 17 November 1982, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 16 May 1983, it dismissed the applicant\u2019s application as being ill-founded.", "10. On 28 June 1984 Mr De Santa appealed to the Consiglio di Stato. On 12 December 1984 Udine District Council, which had by then succeeded the municipal welfare agency, lodged a counter-appeal. It contended, as a preliminary point, that the applicant\u2019s appeal was inadmissible for failure to comply with the time-limit; as regards the merits, it argued that the appeal should be dismissed as being ill-founded.", "11.
