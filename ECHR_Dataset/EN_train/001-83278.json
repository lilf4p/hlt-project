The investigation was then stayed on 1 April and 21 August 2006 and resumed on 21 July 2006 and 16 January 2007 respectively.", "57. According to the applicant, in March 2006 he was summoned to the Zavodskoy District Prosecutor's Office and informed that the investigation had been resumed. The applicant was not given access to the case file, let alone allowed to make copies of any documents.", "58. Referring to the information provided by the Prosecutor General's Office, the Government submitted that, on 13 December 2000, the authorities had commenced an investigation into the abduction of the applicant's son and D. and subsequently, following the discovery of their bodies, into their murder and the theft of D.'s car. The investigation had been suspended and resumed on several occasions, but to date had failed to identify the alleged perpetrators. The investigation had been reopened most recently on 16 January 2007 and was being supervised by the Prosecutor General's Office. According to the Government, the applicant was duly informed about all decisions taken during the investigation.", "59. The Government further submitted that the applicant had been questioned on 27 January and 30 April 2001 and on 20 December 2005 and that his wife, Aslanbek Kukayev's mother, had been questioned on 21 December 2005.

Relatives of other persons kidnapped on 26 November 2000 had also been questioned.", "60. The investigating authorities had also questioned four persons, including Mr Dzh., all of whom, in the Government's words, \u201cwere apprehended by the federal forces on 26 November 2000 during a special operation and were later released\u201d, as well as four police officers, including Mr G., and the servicemen who had found the bodies of the applicant's son and D.

The Government stated that the investigating authorities had sent a number of queries to various State bodies on 19 December 2000, 3 January, 18 April, 8 May and 28 May 2001, and 18 December 2005. In their submission, on 3 March 2006 the investigators had sent a request to the Novosibirsk prosecutor's office to question the officers of the Novosibirsk special police unit who had served in Chechnya between 20 and 28 November 2001 (rather than 2000). It is unclear whether any reply was received to this query.

They, however, agreed to produce several documents, \u201cdisclosure of which did not contravene the requirements of Article 161\u201d. In February 2006 the Court reiterated its request and suggested that Rule 33 \u00a7 3 of the Rules of Court be applied.

Article 161 of the new Code enshrines the rule that data from the preliminary investigation may not be disclosed. Paragraph 3 of the same Article provides that information from the investigation file may be divulged with the permission of a prosecutor or investigator but only in so far as it does not infringe the rights and lawful interests of the participants in the criminal proceedings and does not prejudice the investigation. It is prohibited to divulge information about the private life of the participants in criminal proceedings without their permission."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "2", "3", "38"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
