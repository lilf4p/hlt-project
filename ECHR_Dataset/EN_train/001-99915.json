The first applicant, Mr Milan Makuc, was a Croatian citizen. He was born in 1947 and lived in Portoro\u017e. He died in the course of the proceedings before the Court. The second applicant, Mr Mustafa Kuri\u0107, was born in 1935 and lives in Koper. He is a stateless person. The third applicant, Mr Ljubomir Petre\u0161, was born in 1940 and lives in Piran. According to the applicant, he is a stateless person. The respondent Government claimed, however, that he was a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The fourth applicant, Jovan Jovanovi\u0107, was born in 1959 and lives in Ljubljana. He is a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The fifth applicant, Mr Velimir Dabeti\u0107, was born in 1969 and lives in Italy. He is a stateless person. The sixth applicant, Ms Ana Mezga, is a Croatian citizen. She was born in 1965 and lives in Portoro\u017e. The seventh applicant, Mrs Ljubenka Ristanovi\u0107, is a Serbian citizen. She was born in 1968 and lives in Serbia. The eighth applicant, Mr Tripun Ristanovi\u0107, the son of the seventh applicant, was born in 1988 and lives in Serbia. He is a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The ninth applicant, Mr Ali Berisha, was born in 1969 in Kosovo. According to the most recently available data he is a Serbian citizen. The tenth applicant, Mr Ilfan Sadik Ademi, was born in 1952. He lives in Germany and is a stateless person. The eleventh applicant, Mr Zoran Mini\u0107, was born in 1972. According to the respondent Government, he is a Serbian citizen.", "15. Before 25 June 1991, the day Slovenia declared independence, the applicants were citizens of both the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (\u201cthe SFRY\u201d) and one of its constituent republics other than Slovenia. They had acquired permanent resident status in Slovenia as SFRY citizens, a status which they retained until 26 February 1992. On that day they became subject to the Aliens Act (Zakon o tujcih) and their names were deleted from the Register of Permanent Residents (Register stalnega prebivalstva, \u201cthe Register\u201d) (see paragraph 39 below).", "16. In 2009, further to a change in government policy, the applicants Mr Petre\u0161 and Mr Jovanovi\u0107, who were already in possession of permanent residence permits valid from the date of issue in 2006, were issued supplementary residence permits awarding them residence status from 26 February 1992 on the basis of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision (see paragraphs 103 and 118 below). The applicant Mr Makuc, who died on 2 June 2008, would also have been entitled to such a permit. The applicant Ms Mezga, who is now in possession of a temporary residence permit valid until 13 September 2012, is not entitled to a supplementary residence permit.", "17. The applicants Mr Kuri\u0107, Mr Dabeti\u0107 and Mrs and Mr Ristanovi\u0107 have not applied for residence permits under the existing legislation.", "18. Finally, the applicants Mr Berisha, Mr Sadik and Mr Mini\u0107 have applied for residence permits and the respective proceedings are still pending.", "19. From the First World War until 1991, the territory comprising the modern Republic of Slovenia was incorporated into a union of Slav nations of South-East Europe (mostly of the western Balkans). On 1 December 1918 the first union \u2013 the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs \u2013 joined with the Kingdom of Serbs and became the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. In 1929 the latter was renamed as the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.", "20. A new entity was subsequently formed during the Second World War. This common State first bore the name of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, then of the Federal People\u2019s Republic of Yugoslavia, which in 1963 was renamed as the SFRY. It was a federal State composed of six republics: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia (with two autonomous regions, Kosovo and Vojvodina), Slovenia, Montenegro and Macedonia.", "21. SFRY nationals had \u201cdual citizenship\u201d for internal purposes, that is, they were citizens both of the SFRY and of one of the six republics (see paragraphs 193-207 below).", "22. The first Constitution after the Second World War was adopted in 1946. In 1974, under the new Constitutions of the SFRY and of the then Socialist Republic of Slovenia, the whole system of government shifted from strict centralism to greater autonomy for the constituent republics. The preamble to the Constitution of the SFRY introduced the right of every nation to self-determination, including to secession. Until 1974, federal citizenship prevailed over republic citizenship: republic citizenship could only be held by a Yugoslav citizen (see paragraphs 194-198 below).", "23. The regulation of citizenship was similar in all republics of the SFRY, with the basic principle of acquiring citizenship by blood (ius sanguinis). In principle, a child followed his parents\u2019 citizenship; if parents were citizens of different republics, they jointly agreed on their child\u2019s citizenship. This basic principle was combined with the principle of place of birth (ius soli) or of residence (ius domicilii), of granting of republic citizenship to a citizen of another republic upon application, of naturalisation and recognition under international agreement. Moreover, on the date of admission into the citizenship of another republic, a person\u2019s prior republic citizenship came to an end.", "24. From 1947 a separate Register of Citizenship was kept at the level of the republics and not at the level of the federal State. It follows from the documents at the Court\u2019s disposal that those Registers were not always accurate, since different authorities were responsible for keeping them, the rules governing citizenship were not always strictly respected and republic citizenship was not regarded as crucial during the existence of the SFRY since all republic citizens also had SFRY citizenship. Moreover, in a limited number of cases republic citizenship was not even entered in the Register of Citizenship.", "25. SFRY citizens had freedom of movement within the federal State and could register permanent residence wherever they settled on its territory. Full enjoyment of various civil, economic, social and even political rights for SFRY citizens was linked to permanent residence.", "26. SFRY citizens living in the then Socialist Republic of Slovenia who were citizens of one of the other SFRY republics, such as the applicants, registered their permanent residence there in the same way as Slovenian nationals. Foreign citizens could also acquire permanent residence in the SRFY under a separate procedure (see paragraph 208 below).", "27. In the 1980s the SFRY faced a serious political and economic crisis, with many ethnic tensions which eventually led to the end of the communist regime and the break-up of the SFRY (see, Kova\u010di\u0107 and Others v. Slovenia, nos. 44574/98, 45133/98 and 48316/99, \u00a7 44, 6 November 2006).", "28. As a consequence of the crisis, numerous amendments to the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia were made in the years 1989 to 1991, aimed at a peaceful dissolution of the federal State and the establishment of an independent democratic Slovenia. In particular, Amendment X emphasised the right of the Slovenian nation to self-determination and provided a legal basis for calling a plebiscite and for the secession of Slovenia (see paragraph 206 below).", "29. On 6 December 1990, in the course of the preparations for the plebiscite on the independence of Slovenia, the then Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia (Skup\u0161\u010dina Republike Slovenije) adopted the so-called Statement of Good Intentions (Izjava o dobrih namenih), guaranteeing that all persons with permanent residence on Slovenian territory would be enabled to acquire Slovenian citizenship if they so wished (see paragraph 212 below).", "30. On 23 December 1990 the plebiscite was held. The right to vote had been granted to all adult inhabitants with registered permanent residence in Slovenia. 1,361,369 out of 1,457,020 eligible voters voted. 88.5 per cent of voters were in favour of independence and 4 per cent voted against.", "31. On 25 June 1991 Slovenia declared its independence. In order to set the legal framework of the new sovereign State, the Fundamental Constitutional Charter on the Sovereignty and Independence of the Republic of Slovenia (Temeljna ustavna listina o samostojnosti in neodvisnosti Republike Slovenije) (see paragraph 213 below) and a series of laws termed \u201cthe independence legislation\u201d (osamosvojitvena zakonodaja) were passed.", "32. This included the 1991 Constitutional Law relating to the Fundamental Constitutional Charter on the Sovereignty and Independence of the Republic of Slovenia (Ustavni zakon za izvedbo Temeljne ustavne listine o samostojnosti in neodvisnosti Republike Slovenije, \u201cthe 1991 Constitutional Law\u201d), the Citizenship of the Republic of Slovenia Act (Zakon o dr\u017eavljanstvu Republike Slovenije, \u201cthe Citizenship Act\u201d), the Aliens Act (see paragraphs 221-223 below), the National Border Control Act (Zakon o nadzoru dr\u017eavne meje) and the Passports of the Citizens of Slovenia Act (Zakon o potnih listinah dr\u017eavljanov Republike Slovenije).", "33. At the material time, in contrast with some other former SFRY republics, the Slovenian population was relatively homogeneous, as roughly 90 per cent of the 2 million residents had Slovenian citizenship. Approximately 200,000 Slovenian residents (or 10 per cent of the population), including the applicants, were citizens of the other former SFRY republics. This proportion also broadly reflects the ethnic origin of the Slovenian population at that time.", "34. In accordance with the Statement of Good Intentions, section 13 of the 1991 Constitutional Law provided that those citizens of other republics of the former SFRY who, on 23 December 1990, the date of the plebiscite, were registered as permanent residents of the Republic of Slovenia and in fact lived there, held equal rights and duties as the citizens of the Republic of Slovenia, with the exception of the acquisition of property, until they acquired citizenship of the Republic of Slovenia under section 40 of the Citizenship Act or until the expiry of the time-limit set out in section 81 of the Aliens Act (see paragraph 214 below).", "35. Section 40 of the Citizenship Act, which entered into force on 25 June 1991, provided that citizens of the former SFRY republics who were not citizens of Slovenia (\u201ccitizens of the former SFRY republics\u201d) could acquire Slovenian citizenship if they met three requirements: they had acquired permanent resident status in Slovenia by 23 December 1990 (the date of the plebiscite), were in fact residing in Slovenia, and applied for citizenship within six months after the Citizenship Act entered into force (see paragraph 217 below). The deadline expired on 25 December 1991.", "36. The respondent Government maintained that it was not necessary to enclose any official documents from other former SFRY republics when an application for citizenship was filed; this was only necessary at a later stage of the proceedings. The applicants however maintained that in practice such documents were required from the outset.", "37. According to the official data, 171,132 citizens of the former SFRY republics living in Slovenia applied for and were granted citizenship of the new State under section 40 of the Citizenship Act. Estimations are that additional 11,000 persons left Slovenia.", "38. Under second paragraph of section 81 of the Aliens Act, citizens of the former SFRY republics who either failed to apply for Slovenian citizenship within the prescribed time-limit or whose requests were not granted became aliens. The provisions of the Aliens Act became applicable to the former SFRY citizens either two months after the expiry of the time-limit for filing the requests for citizenship under section 40 of the Citizenship Act, that is, 26 February 1992, or when a decision issued in administrative proceedings dismissing their application for citizenship became final (see paragraph 221 below).", "39. On or shortly after 26 February 1992 the municipal authorities removed those concerned by the second paragraph of section 81 of the Aliens Act from the Register of Permanent Residents and, according to the respondent Government, transferred them into the Register of Aliens without a Residence Permit.", "40. On 27 February 1992 the Ministry of the Interior (Ministrstvo za notranje zadeve, \u201cthe Ministry\u201d) sent \u201cInstructions on the implementation of the Aliens Act\u201d to the municipal authorities, indicating that it would be necessary to regulate the legal status of the persons affected by the Aliens Act after the expiry of the time-limits in section 81. It drew attention to the fact that problems were expected to arise with regard to persons from other republics of the former SFRY who would become aliens on 26 February 1992 and had not lodged an application for citizenship. In addition, it pointed out that the papers of such persons, even if issued by the Slovenian authorities and formally valid, would in fact be invalid owing to the person\u2019s change in status ex lege. Some of those concerned would be required to leave Slovenia in accordance with sections 23 and 28 of the Aliens Act.", "41. The applicants stated that persons whose names were removed from the Register received no official notification. They pointed out that no special procedure was provided for to that effect and no official documents were issued. They only subsequently became aware that they had become aliens, when, for example, they attempted to renew their personal documents (personal identification card, passport, driving licence). On the other hand, the respondent Government maintained that, in addition to the publication in the Official Gazette, the Slovenian population was informed about the new legislation through public media and notices. In some municipalities, personal means of notification were allegedly also used.", "42. Until recently, according to the official data from 2002, the number of former SFRY citizens who lost their permanent residence status on 26 February 1992 amounted to 18,305 (see paragraph 65 below), of whom approximately 2,400 had been refused citizenship. Their names were erased, ex lege, from the Register of Permanent Residents on or shortly after 26 February 1992 and entered into the Register of Aliens without a Residence Permit. They became known as \u201cthe erased\u201d (izbrisani), and included the applicants in the present case.", "43. As a result, \u201cthe erased\u201d became aliens or stateless persons illegally residing in Slovenia. In general, they had difficulties in keeping their jobs, driving licences and obtaining retirement pensions. Nor were they able to leave the country, because they could not re-enter without valid documents. Many families became divided, with some of their members in Slovenia and others in one of the other successor States to the former SFRY. Among \u201cthe erased\u201d were a certain number of minors. In most cases their identity papers were taken away. Some of \u201cthe erased\u201d voluntarily left Slovenia. Finally, some were served removal orders and deported from Slovenia.", "44. After the expiry of the six-month period set by section 40 of the Citizenship Act, the less favourable conditions for acquisition of citizenship by naturalisation provided for by its section 10 became applicable also for citizens of other former SFRY republics (see paragraph 217 below).", "45. After 26 February 1992 the registration of permanent residence of citizens of other former SFRY republics was terminated if they had not acquired a new residence permit. On the other hand, under section 82 of the Aliens Act, permanent residence permits issued to foreigners with citizenship of other States than the former SFRY republics continued to be valid after the entry into force of the Aliens Act (see paragraph 221 below).", "46. The respondent Government maintained that, in view of the large number of persons from the other republics of the former SFRY living in Slovenia with non-regulated status, on 3 September 1992 the Government decided also to take into account the period before the entry into force of the Aliens Act for the purposes of calculating the required period of three-year residence in Slovenia for issuing a permanent residence permit under section 16 of the Aliens Act (see paragraph 222 below). A total of 4,893 permanent residence permits were thus issued in the period 1992-1997.", "47. On 28 June 1994 the Convention took effect in respect of Slovenia.", "48. Moreover, on 20 November 1995, further to a request submitted by Parliament for a referendum on the question whether or not the citizenship awarded to former SFRY citizens on the basis of section 40 of the Citizenship Act should be withdrawn, the Constitutional Court held that the request was unconstitutional.", "49. In the following years, several non-governmental organisations, including Amnesty International and Helsinki Monitor, and the Slovenian Human Rights Ombudsman issued reports drawing attention to the situation of \u201cthe erased\u201d.", "50. On 24 June 1998 the Constitutional Court (Ustavno sodi\u0161\u010de) declared admissible a challenge to the constitutionality of sections 16(1) and 81 of the Aliens Act, lodged in 1994 by two individuals whose names had been removed from the Register in 1992 (see paragraph 236 below).", "51. On 4 February 1999 the Constitutional Court held that section 81 of the Aliens Act was unconstitutional. However, no such problems arose with section 16(1). It ordered the legislature to regulate, within six months, the special legal status of citizens of the former SFRY republics who had acquired permanent residence in Slovenia before its independence and in fact lived in Slovenia, but either had not applied for Slovenian citizenship or had had their applications dismissed.", "52. As a consequence, the Act on Regularisation of the Legal Status of Citizens of Other Successor States to the Former SFRY in Slovenia (Zakon o urejanju statusa dr\u017eavljanov drugih dr\u017eav naslednic nekdanje SFRJ v Republiki Sloveniji, \u201cthe Legal Status Act\u201d) was passed to regulate the legal status of \u201cthe erased\u201d. It simplified the requirements for acquiring a permanent residence permit. In particular, section 13 of the Aliens Act was no longer applicable to this group of persons. Under this Act, residence permits were granted ex nunc to those fulfilling the conditions (see paragraphs 225-226 below).", "53. Ruling on another constitutional challenge, on 18 May 2000 the Constitutional Court set aside some of the provisions of the Legal Status Act as unconstitutional because it found that the requirements for the acquisition of permanent residence set forth in these provisions were stricter than the grounds for revoking a permanent residence permit under the Aliens Act (see paragraphs 248-249 below).", "54. According to the respondent Government, 13,355 applications were lodged under the Legal Status Act by 30 June 2007. As a result, 12,236 permanent residence permits were issued.", "55. In 2002, the Citizenship Act was also amended in order to enable the acquisition of Slovenian citizenship under more favourable conditions to all aliens who had permanent residence in Slovenia on 23 December 1990 and had since lived uninterruptedly in Slovenia (see paragraph 220 below). The deadline for filing of applications expired on 29 November 2003. By that time, 2,959 applications were lodged and by 30 June 2007 1,747 persons had acquired Slovenian citizenship.", "56. On 3 April 2003, deciding on a challenge to the constitutionality of the Legal Status Act, the Constitutional Court (decision no. U-I-246/02) again found that Act unconstitutional. It held, firstly, that it did not afford permanent residence retroactively from the date on which the name of the person concerned was removed from the Register. Secondly, it failed to regulate the acquisition of permanent residence for citizens of former SFRY republics who had been forcibly removed from Slovenia. And, thirdly, it did not define the meaning of the words \u201cin fact residing\u201d in its section 1. It also struck down the three-month time-limit for lodging an application for permanent residence. It ordered the legislature to rectify the unconstitutional provisions within six months.", "57. In point no. 8 of the operative part of the decision, the Constitutional Court ordered the Ministry to issue, ex proprio motu, to those who already had (non-retroactive) permits, supplementary decisions establishing permanent residence in Slovenia with effect from 26 February 1992, the date on which their names were deleted from the Register (see paragraphs 250-255 below). In 2004, the Ministry issued 4,093 retroactive permits to the erased, solely on the basis of the above-mentioned Constitutional Court\u2019s decision.", "58. Following the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 3 April 2003, the Government initially prepared two Acts in order to comply with it which were eventually never enacted.", "59. On 25 November 2003, Parliament enacted the Act on the Application of Point No. 8 of the Constitutional Court\u2019s Decision no. U-I-246/02-28 (Zakon o izvr\u0161itvi 8. to\u010dke odlo\u010dbe Ustavnega sodi\u0161\u010da Republike Slovenije \u0161t. U-I-246/02-28), also known as the \u201cTechnical Act\u201d (see paragraph 57 above).", "60. This Act laid down the procedure for issuing permanent residence permits to citizens of the former SFRY republics who were registered as permanent residents in Slovenia on both 23 December 1990 and 25 February 1992 and had already acquired a permanent residence permit under the Legal Status Act, the Aliens Act or the 1999 Aliens Act.", "61. However, those parliamentarians who voted against the Technical Act sought a referendum on whether or not it should be implemented. The referendum was held on 4 April 2004. The turnout was 31.54%; 94.59% of voters were against its implementation, and therefore the Act never entered into force.", "62. In addition to the \u201cTechnical Act\u201d, an \u201cAct on Permanent Residence in Slovenia of Foreigners Having Citizenship of the Other Successor States to the SFRY who were Registered as Permanent Residents in Slovenia on 23 December 1990 and 25 February 1992\u201d (Zakon o stalnem prebivanju tujcev z dr\u017eavljanstvom drugih dr\u017eav naslednic nekdanje SFRJ v Republiki Sloveniji, ki so imeli na dan 23.12.1990 in 25.02.1992 v Republiki Sloveniji prijavljeno stalno prebivali\u0161\u010de) \u2013 a so-called systemic Act \u2013 was drafted but never adopted by Parliament.", "63. In November 2007 the Government sent a draft Constitutional Law amending section 13 of the 1991 Constitutional Law to Parliament. However, this law \u2013 subject to a heated political debate since it was regarded by the then parliamentary opposition as an attempt to overrule the Constitutional Court\u2019s decisions \u2013 was never enacted and the parliamentary procedure terminated on completion of the Parliament\u2019s term.", "64. Following the parliamentary elections held on 21 September 2008, a new Government was appointed in November 2008. The regulation of the status of \u201cthe erased\u201d in compliance with the Constitutional Court\u2019s decisions was established as one of its priorities.", "65. Further to an upgrading of the IT system, the Ministry collected new data on \u201cthe erased\u201d and issued a report stating that on 24 January 2009 the number of the people removed from the Register of Permanent Residents on 26 February 1997 amounted to 25,671, of whom 7,899 had subsequently acquired Slovenian citizenship; 7,313 of them were still alive. A further 3,630 had acquired a residence permit. 13,426 of \u201cthe erased\u201d did not have a regulated status in Slovenia on that date and their current residence was unknown.", "66. On 23 February 2009 the Ministry started issuing ex officio supplementary decisions further to point no. 8 of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 3 April 2003 to those who were already in possession of permits or had acquired Slovenian citizenship (see paragraph 57 above). According to the Ministry, approximately 3,000 such permits should have been issued. On 3 March 2009 the applicants Mr Petre\u0161 and Mr Jovanovi\u0107 were issued with supplementary permanent residence permits (see paragraphs 103 and 118 below).", "67. On 1 April 2009 the National Assembly voted on a motion of confidence filed against the Minister of the Interior on account of the issuing of retroactive residence permits with effect from 1992. The Minister won the vote of confidence.", "68. Subsequently, the Ministry prepared amendments and supplements to the Legal Status Act, regulating the remaining incompatibilities between the Legal Status Act and the Constitution, following the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 3 April 2003. On 8 March 2010 the amendments and supplements to the Legal Status Act were passed.", "69. On 12 March 2010 a group of parliamentarians requested that a referendum be held on the implementation of the amendments and supplements to the Legal Status Act, thus postponing their entry into force. On 10 June 2010 the Constitutional Court held that rejecting the law in a referendum would produce unconstitutional consequences. At the time of the consideration of this judgment, the new Act has not yet entered into force.", "70. The applicant Mr Makuc was born on 11 February 1947 in Ra\u0161a, Croatia. He was a Croatian citizen. His family moved to Slovenia when he was seven years old. He was registered as a Slovenian resident from 1 January 1955 to 26 February 1992 and considered himself Slovenian. The applicant stated that he had worked in Slovenia for twenty-one years and paid contributions to the national health insurance and pension schemes.", "71. During the ten-day war which followed the declaration of independence in 1991, Mr Makuc joined the Slovenian defence forces. He stated that he believed that he would be granted Slovenian citizenship but he did not receive any communication to that effect.", "72. As a result of the deletion of his name from the Register on 26 February 1992, the applicant allegedly lost his job and the benefit of pension contributions. He could no longer afford to pay rent for the apartment owned by his former employer, International Shipping and Chartering Ltd. (Splo\u0161na plovba), a State-owned company, or to buy it in the privatisation process. He was evicted from the apartment in 1994 or 1995, and lost all his personal possessions, including his documents. He had been living in shelters and municipal parks. His health seriously deteriorated as a result but he no longer had access to medical care.", "73. The applicant stated that he had visited the Piran Administrative Authority (Upravna enota v Piranu) several times in an attempt to regularise his status, but was repeatedly sent away.", "74. On 1 March 2006 he lodged an application for a permanent residence permit under the provisions of the Legal Status Act.", "75. On 15 May 2006 the Piran Social Work Centre (Center za socialno delo Piran) asked the Ministry to expedite the examination of the applicant\u2019s request in view of his difficult social and health condition.", "76. On 12 July 2006 the Ministry issued a residence permit to the applicant and served it on him on 28 July 2006.", "77. According to the respondent Government, the applicant never applied for Slovenian citizenship.", "78. On 20 December 2006, with the help of the Piran Social Work Centre (Center za socialno delo Piran) the applicant was awarded a monthly social assistance allowance amounting to 205.57 euros (EUR).", "79. Further to a proposal by the applicant\u2019s physician, on 20 September 2007 the Koper Unit of the Institute of Pension and Invalidity Insurance (Zavod za pokojninsko in invalidsko zavarovanje Slovenije, Obmo\u010dna enota Koper) issued a decision classifying him in category I of invalidity with a right to a monthly invalidity pension amounting to EUR 351.73 from 3 September 2007 onwards.", "80. On 2 June 2008 Mr Makuc died.", "81. The applicants\u2019 representatives first asked the applicant Mr Makuc\u2019s brother whether he wished to pursue the proceedings before the Court. The latter did not express such an intention.", "82. On 16 January 2009 his cousin, Ms Marija Ban, informed the Court that she wished to pursue his application before it. As far as the Court is aware, the relevant inheritance proceedings are still pending.", "83. The applicant Mr Kuri\u0107 was born on 8 April 1935 in \u0160ipovo (Bosnia and Herzegovina). According to the respondent Government, he is of unknown citizenship. He moved to Slovenia at the age of twenty and settled in Koper in 1965. He is a trained shoemaker. In 1976 he rented a small workshop from the Koper Municipality (Ob\u010dina Koper) and established a private business there. He was registered as a permanent resident in Slovenia from 23 July 1970 until 26 February 1992.", "84. In 1991 he fell seriously ill, was hospitalised for three months, and allegedly failed for that reason to lodge an application for Slovenian citizenship. The respondent Government confirmed that the applicant had been hospitalised. However, he had already been released from hospital on 15 June 1991.", "85. In 1993 the applicant\u2019s home caught fire and he lost most of his papers. When he applied for replacement papers to the Koper Municipality (Ob\u010dina Koper), he was informed that his name had been deleted from the Register.", "86. The applicant continued with his business and was paying the rent until the late 1990s when he started experiencing financial difficulties. Since he could no longer pay the rent, he lost the right to remain in the premises. Without any papers, he was at risk of being expelled if he travelled outside the local community where the police tolerated his presence.", "87. The applicant stated that at a later stage he tried on various occasions to regularise his status with the Koper Administrative Authority, including in October 2006, but allegedly received no reply. On the other hand, the respondent Government maintained that Mr Kuri\u0107 had never applied for a residence permit in Slovenia.", "88. The applicant further maintained that in 2006 he had started proceedings for pension rights with the Institute of Pension and Invalidity Insurance.

On 24 June 1998 the Constitutional Court declared partly admissible a challenge to the constitutionality of the Aliens Act, lodged by two individuals whose names had been removed from the Register in 1992.", "237. In a decision of 4 February 1999 (U-I-284/94) the Constitutional Court declared that section 81 of the Aliens Act was unconstitutional since it had not set out the conditions for acquisition of permanent residence for those subject to its second paragraph. It noted that the authorities had deleted the names of citizens of the former SFRY republics who had not applied for Slovenian citizenship from the Register and entered them ex officio in the register of foreigners, without any notification. It further found that there was no legal basis for this measure; the Inhabitants\u2019 Residence Evidence and Population Registry Act did not provide for an ex lege deregistration.", "238. The Constitutional Court stated that the provisions of the Aliens Act were, in general, designed to regulate the status of foreigners who entered Slovenia after independence, not of those who were already living there. While section 82 of the Aliens Act did regulate the legal status of foreigners originating from outside the former SFRY republics, no similar provision existed in respect of people from the former SFRY. As a consequence, the latter were in a less favourable legal position than foreigners who had lived in Slovenia since before independence. Failing to regulate the legal status of these people was contrary to Article 14 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution.", "239. The Constitutional Court noted in this respect that a proposal had been made in the legislative process in 1991 for a special provision regulating the temporary situation of former SFRY citizens living in Slovenia who had not applied for Slovenian citizenship. The legislature had maintained that their situation should not be regulated by the Aliens Act but rather by an agreement between the successor States to the former SFRY. Since those agreements had not been concluded, notably because of the state of war in Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina, their situation remained unaddressed. In the Constitutional Court\u2019s view, in the light of modern developments in human-rights protection, the situation of persons having held the nationality of the predecessor but not of the successor State, with permanent residence on the territory of States disintegrated after 1990, had become a matter of international agreements.", "240. Furthermore, the provisions of the Aliens Act regulating the acquisition of permanent and temporary residence (sections 13 and 16 of the Aliens Act) could not be used to remedy the status of citizens of the former SFRY republics because permanent residence and the fact of actual residence in Slovenia were particular circumstances requiring special consideration. Citizens of the former SFRY republics had a reasonable expectation that the new conditions for retaining permanent residence in Slovenia would not be stricter than those set forth in section 13 of the Constitutional Act relating to the Fundamental Constitutional Charter on the Sovereignty and Independence of the Republic of Slovenia and section 40 of the Citizenship Act, and that their status would be determined in accordance with international law.", "241. Section 81 was therefore declared unconstitutional as it did not prescribe the conditions under which persons subject to this section who either failed to apply for or were denied Slovenian citizenship could apply for permanent residence after the expiry of the prescribed time-limit. A legal void was thus constituted and the principles of the rule of law, of legal certainty and equality breached.", "242. The Constitutional Court further found that section 16(1) of the Aliens Act was not unconstitutional, because it applied only to foreigners entering Slovenia after independence.", "243. The legislature was given six months in which to modify the unconstitutional provisions. In the meantime, the Constitutional Court ruled that no citizen of the former SFRY who was registered as a permanent resident in Slovenia on 23 December 1990, the day on which the plebiscite on independence was held, and was living in Slovenia when the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment was issued, could be forcibly removed from Slovenia pursuant to section 28 of the Aliens Act.", "244. The Constitutional Court also pointed out that the unregulated situation of citizens of the former SFRY republics who have found themselves in a precarious legal position could lead to a violation of the right to respect for family life, as protected by Article 8 of the Convention.", "245. In a decision of 1 July 1999 (Up-333/96) the Constitutional Court referred to its findings in the decision of 4 February 1999 and reiterated that citizens of the former SFRY republics were in a less favourable position than other foreign citizens who were living in Slovenia on the date of independence. It noted that following its decision of 4 February 1999 a Bill the Legal Status Act had been drafted, but had not yet been adopted, for the purpose of addressing the issue raised by that judgment.", "246. In the case before it, the claimant, whose name had been deleted from the Register in 1992, had been refused the renewal of his driving licence, because he was considered a foreigner without lawful residence in Slovenia. The Constitutional Court ordered that, until the Legal Status Act entered into force, he should enjoy the status he would have had under section 13 of the Fundamental Constitutional Charter on the Sovereignty and Independence of the Republic of Slovenia before the expiry of the time-limit set forth in section 81 of the 1991 Act. The authorities were ordered to register the claimant as a permanent resident at the address where he was living before his name was illegally deleted from the Register. They were also ordered to renew his driving licence.", "247. In a decision of 15 July 1999 (Up-60/97), the claimants, who were members of the same family and citizens of one of the former SFRY republics, were denied permanent residence under section 16 of the Aliens Act, because the father had lost his job. The Constitutional Court, for reasons similar to those in case no. Up-333/96, held that until the Legal Status Act entered into force, the authorities should register them as permanent residents at the address where they were living before their names were illegally deleted from the Register.", "248. In a decision of 18 May 2000 (U-I-295/99) the Constitutional Court set aside the first, second and third sub-paragraphs of section 3 of the Legal Status Act. It found that the requirements for the acquisition of permanent residence set forth in these provisions were stricter than the grounds for revoking a permanent residence permit under the Aliens Act.", "249. It went on to hold that the legal status of citizens of the former SFRY republics should be regulated on the basis of the position the individuals concerned would have had, but did not have, because of the legislature\u2019s failure to regulate it. It reiterated that the legal status of citizens of the former SFRY republics should not be essentially different from that enjoyed by foreign citizens who had acquired permanent resident status in the Republic of Slovenia before independence.", "250. In case no. U-I-246/02 the Constitutional Court reiterated its ruling in its decision of 4 February 1999. It found the Legal Status Act unconstitutional because, firstly, it did not grant retrospective permanent residence from the date of the erasure of the names of those concerned from the Register; secondly, it failed to regulate the acquisition of permanent residence for citizens of former SFRY republics who had been forcibly removed from Slovenia pursuant to section 28 of the Aliens Act; and, thirdly, it did not define the meaning of the words \u201cin fact residing\u201d in section 1. The Constitutional Court also struck down the three-month time-limit for submitting applications for permanent residence because it was unreasonably short. It ordered the legislature to rectify the unconstitutional provisions of the impugned act within six months.", "251. In point no. 8 of the operative part of the decision, it held that permanent residence permits already issued to citizens of the former SFRY republics in accordance with the Legal Status Act, the Aliens Act or the 1999 Aliens Act would be effective from 26 February 1992, if their names had been erased from the Register on that date. It also ordered the Ministry to issue, ex proprio motu, supplementary decisions establishing the permanent residence of those concerned retrospectively, since that date. Once this was done, those who had had permanent residential status until 26 February 1992 but had not been able to enjoy certain rights after that date owing to their unregulated legal status, would be able to invoke their rights in accordance with the relevant legislation.", "252. In addition, special provisions were needed to address the situation of those who had been forcibly removed from Slovenia, although the Constitutional Court suspected that the numbers of individuals affected would probably be low, since the unregulated status of these people had generally been tolerated.", "253. Moreover, the Constitutional Court said that, when determining a new time-limit for applications for permanent residence, assuming such a time-limit should be provided, the legislature should take into consideration personal and other circumstances that might have impeded the persons concerned from lodging their application in time. Until such a time-limit was set, those concerned could continue to lodge applications for permanent residence.", "254. Lastly, the Constitutional Court observed that by 10 February 2003 11,746 citizens of the former SFRY republics had been granted permanent residence status on the basis of the Legal Status Act, that 385 applications had been dismissed or rejected, 980 applications were pending and that approximately 4,300 citizens of former SRFY republics had not applied for permanent residence. The decisions concerning the first group of persons concerned were of a constitutive nature and thus only had ex nunc effect. The Constitutional Court further observed that permanent residence was important in securing certain rights and benefits. A lack of permanent residence status resulted in citizens of the former SFRY republics being deprived of certain rights enjoyed by foreigners with permanent residence status, for example, the right to a military pension, and to certain retirement benefits and the right to renew a driving licence.", "255.

In its first Opinion on Slovenia, the Advisory Committee noted with concern the problematic situation of a number of former citizens of other republics of former Yugoslavia (SFRY), who found themselves foreigners in the territory they were living in and without confirmed legal status, following their removal from the register of permanent residents, in 1992.", "Present situation", "a) Positive developments", "55. The Advisory Committee notes that a number of positive developments have taken place in this area. For instance, the Constitutional Court has taken a stand on these issues by clearly stating the need to restore, without further delay and retrospectively, the rights of non-Slovenian former Yugoslav citizens who were, according to the Court, illegally removed from the register of permanent residents. The Advisory Committee also notes that efforts have been made at the legislative level to regularise the legal status of these persons, and that most of them have been granted permanent resident status in recent years on the basis of individual decisions issued by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.", "b) Outstanding issues", "56. The Advisory Committee notes with concern that, despite the relevant Constitutional Court decisions, several thousand persons whose names were deleted from the registers of permanent residents on 26 February 1992, and automatically transferred to the registers of foreigners, are still, more than ten years on, awaiting clarification of their legal status. This concerns citizens of other former Yugoslav republics, including a number of Roma, who were legally resident in Slovenia and, for various reasons, did not wish \u2013 or were unable \u2013 to obtain Slovenian citizenship within the short time-limit allowed by the authorities after the country\u2019s independence.", "57. In many cases, the lack of citizenship or of a residence permit has had a particularly negative impact on these persons\u2019 situation. It has, in particular, paved the way for violations of their economic and social rights, with some of them having lost their homes, employment or retirement pension entitlements, and has seriously hindered the exercise of their rights to family life and freedom of movement.", "58. The Advisory Committee notes that more recent government initiatives have sought, in accordance with the relevant decisions of the Constitutional Court, to restore these persons\u2019 rights retrospectively. It finds it disturbing that these initiatives have been stalled for over a year, and that the social climate in Slovenia has not been conducive to a speedier resolution of these matters. In the referendum held in April 2004 on the Act on Application of Point No. 8 of Constitutional Court Decision no. U-I-246/02 (the so-called \u2018Technical Act on Erased Persons\u2019), 94.7% of participants (representing 31.45% of voters) expressed their opposition to this Act (see also comments under Article 6 below).", "59. The Advisory Committee notes that the authorities are in the process of drafting, at the governmental level, a new normative text expected to provide solutions to the problems mentioned above. Insofar as this new initiative is not yet in the public domain, it is difficult to ascertain, at this stage, whether the measures envisaged \u2013 legislative or other \u2013 will be likely to resolve the situation in a comprehensive manner once and for all.", "Recommendations", "60. Without further delay, the authorities should find solutions to the problems faced by non-Slovenians from former Yugoslavia (SFRY) who have been deleted from the register of permanent residents, in connection with the regularisation of their legal status, including access to citizenship and social and economic rights.", "61. At the same time, they should assist these persons in their efforts to overcome the difficulties arising from this situation, and facilitate their effective participation and integration in the Slovene society by means of targeted measures.\u201d", "263. On 14 June 2006 the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted Resolution ResCMN(2006)6 on the implementation of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities by Slovenia. It noted as an issue of concern the situation of those non-Slovenes from former Yugoslavia (SFRY) whose legal status had still not been resolved, which raised substantial problems in terms of access to social and economic rights, including educational rights, and effective participation. The Committee invited the Slovenian authorities to find without further delay solutions to the situation of non-Slovenes from SFRY whose legal status had still not been regularised and take specific measures to assist those persons on the social and economic front.", "264. On 29 March 2006 a Follow-up Report on Slovenia (2003-2005) was published, assessing the progress made in implementing the recommendations of the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights. In the relevant part it states as follows:", "\u201c46. The issue of erased persons continues to be a divisive and politically charged issue in Slovenia and is the subject of heated debate. Regrettably, the issue has been frequently used by some political factions as a campaign tool. Especially during the period leading to the October 2004 general elections, many politicians made xenophobic statements when referring to the issue of the erased persons and to others considered non-Slovene or otherwise different.", "47. In a ruling of April 2003, the Constitutional Court declared the 1999 law aimed at remedying the situation of the erased persons to be unconstitutional. The Court ordered that those who had already acquired permanent residency on the basis of the law, be granted permanent residence permits retroactively for the period from 26 February 1992 to the date of its formal acquisition. It also ordered the legislator to amend the law within six months to determine a new time limit for possible new applications for permanent residence permits.", "48. The Constitutional Court\u2019s decision imposed a duty on the Ministry of Internal Affairs to issue supplementary decisions giving retroactive effect to the residence permits to all those citizens of other former Yugoslav Republics, who were, on 26 February 1992, removed from the register of permanent residents, but who had since acquired a permit for permanent residence. The Constitutional Court\u2019s position was made clear in a further decision issued in December 2003 stating that the decision of April 2003 could be considered as sufficient legal basis for issuing decisions on permanent residence with retroactive effect, without there being any need for specific legislation. Following the Constitutional Court\u2019s decisions, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, after some delay, started issuing permanent residence decrees with retroactive validity. Approximately 4,100 such decrees have since been issued, but at the time of the follow-up visit, it appeared that the issuance of decisions was suspended.", "49. According to the information received from the Association of Erased, out of the 18,305 erased persons, some 12,000 have over time either obtained citizenship or received a permanent residence permit. All of these 12,000 persons, according to the 2003 decision of the Constitutional Court, should have had their permanent residence status recognised with retroactive effect.", "50. Regarding the enactment of the law required to regulate the status of those erased persons who had been expelled from or had left Slovenia, the issue is still unresolved. There has been an ongoing and heated discussion regarding this issue, which \u2013 quite apart from what the criteria for legitimate absence from Slovenia and the situation of the expelled should be \u2013 has focused also on whether the law should be enacted in the normal legislative process or adopted as a constitutional act.", "Conclusions", "51. The Commissioner urges the Ministry of Internal Affairs to immediately continue and finalise the issuance of supplementary decisions giving retroactive effect to the permanent residence permit of all those persons, who are entitled to it.", "52. As regards the enactment of the law regulating and reinstating the status of the remaining erased persons, the Commissioner urges the Slovenian government to definitely resolve the issue in good faith and in accordance with the decisions of the Constitutional Court. Whatever the appropriate legislative solution may be, the current impasse reflects poorly on the respect for the rule of law and the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgements in Slovenia.", "53. The Commissioner is extremely concerned about the continuous public manifestations of hate speech and intolerance by some politicians. The Commissioner calls for greater responsibility of politicians and media in this regard and for the full respect of the rights and values laid down in European Convention on Human Rights and other international instruments.\u201d", "265. On 6 and 7 October 2009 the Commissioner visited Slovenia and, inter alia, discussed the issue of the \u201cerased\u201d with the Slovenian authorities.", "266. On 13 February 2007 the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (\u201cECRI\u201d) published its third report on Slovenia, which was adopted on 30 June 2006. This report described the situation of \u201cthe erased\u201d as follows:", "\u201c109. In its second report, ECRI dealt at length with the situation of those citizens of other ex-Yugoslav countries who were removed ex officio from the register of permanent residents of Slovenia in 1992 and who since then, are often referred to as the \u2018erased\u2019. As explained in that report, following the armed conflict in Slovenia in 1991 and the ensuing independence of the country, over 170 000 of the approximately 200 000 permanent residents of Slovenia from other ex-Yugoslav countries obtained Slovenian citizenship on the basis of the 1991 citizenship law. This law allowed for a six-month window to apply for citizenship. Of the remaining 30 000 persons, approximately 11 000 left Slovenia around that time. However, for a number of reasons, including the war between other successor States of the former Yugoslavia, the uncertain situation prevailing in other such States, and the destruction, loss or inaccessibility of personal documents, 18 305 permanent residents did not or could not apply for Slovenian citizenship or applied and were rejected. As mentioned, these persons were struck off the register of permanent residents on 26 February 1992. Many of these persons \u2013 for the most part reportedly persons without good levels of education \u2013 had been living in Slovenia for a long time and some of them were even born in the country. However, as a result of the erasure from the registers, they became foreigners without legal status in Slovenia from one day to the next, in many cases without being aware of it. Loss of legal status meant for them loss of access to fundamental rights attached to residence, including the right to work and access to healthcare and other social rights, along with the annulation of personal documents and exposure to a risk of deportation.", "110. In its second report, ECRI noted that a law had been passed in 1999 to open the possibility for the \u2018erased\u2019 to apply for permanent residence. It also noted however, that the time-limit of three months to do so and the requirement that applicants prove that they had lived in Slovenia since 1991 without interruptions of longer than three months seriously limited the effectiveness of this law. ECRI notes that approximately 12 000 people have obtained permanent residence permits on the basis of that law. However, such residence permits were not granted with effect from the date of erasure (26 February 1992), but from the date of formal acquisition of these permits, i.e. in a majority of cases, 1999.", "111. ECRI notes that in April 2003, the Constitutional Court declared the 1999 law unconstitutional, inter alia because: it did not give retroactive effect to residence permits; it did not regulate the obtaining of residence permits for those \u2018erased\u2019 who had been forcibly deported from Slovenia; it did not prescribe criteria for the fulfilment of the requirement of continuous residence in Slovenia. The Constitutional Court therefore established that the Ministry of Interior must issue supplementary administrative decisions whereby residence permits already granted were given retroactive effect from 26 February 1992 to the date of formal acquisition. It also established that the 1999 law must be amended within six months to determine a new time limit for possible new applications.", "112. Concerning the first point, ECRI notes that following initial delays, the Ministry of Interior under the former Government started to issue supplementary administrative decisions giving residence permits retroactive effect at the end of 2004. ECRI notes however, that only approximately 4 100 such decisions have been issued. The representatives of the Ministry of Interior under the current Government have stated that they consider that these supplementary decisions do not rest on a sufficiently strong legal basis, and that a general law establishing conditions and criteria for issuing of residence permits should be passed first. ECRI notes however, that in December 2003 the Constitutional Court made it clear that its decision of April 2003 constituted a sufficient legal basis for issuing such decisions and that, in fact, the 4 100 administrative decisions already issued were issued on such a basis. ECRI expresses serious concern at the fact that approximately two-thirds of the \u2018erased\u2019 who, since 26 February 1992, have secured citizenship or permanent residence of Slovenia are still not in a position to see their rights linked to permanent residence restored with effect from the date of erasure.", "113. The situation as concerns the implementation of the other parts of the decision of the Constitutional Court appears very unclear and uncertain at the time of writing and is a cause for serious concern to ECRI. The issue essentially relates to the enactment of a law to regulate the status of approximately 6 000 \u2018erased\u2019 who have not yet secured Slovenian citizenship or permanent residence permits and whose current position varies from holders of temporary permits (an estimated 2 500 persons) and persons still living in Slovenia without legal status to persons who have left Slovenia or have been deported. The Slovenian authorities have reported to ECRI their decision to adopt such a law in the form of a constitutional law. ECRI notes that this decision has been widely criticised both within the Parliament and in civil society for effectively and deliberately leading to non-implementation of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision, inter alia as it entails the use of constitutional means and relative procedures (including the need for a qualified majority in Parliament) in order to deal with matters that should be regulated through primary legislation. ECRI is not aware of the exact content of the law, which is reportedly in the drafting process, nor has it been possible to clarify the envisaged timetable for adoption. In any event, ECRI deplores the fact that, as a result of the non-implementation by the Slovenian authorities of the decision of the Constitutional Court, it is still not possible for approximately 6 000 people to regain the rights of which they were unlawfully stripped over fifteen years ago.", "114. More generally, ECRI is deeply concerned at the tone prevailing in Slovenian public and political debate concerning the \u2018erased\u2019 since its last report. It regrets that this part of the Slovenian population has in many occasions fallen hostage to merely political considerations, including the exploitation of their situation as a vote gainer, and that the debate around the position of these persons has steadily moved away from human rights considerations. It is particularly regrettable that racism and xenophobia have been encouraged and fostered as part of this process, including through generalisations and misrepresentations concerning the loyalty of these persons to the Slovenian State or the economic burden that restoration of their rights would entail.", "Recommendations", "115. ECRI urges the Slovenian authorities to restore the rights of persons erased from the registers of permanent residents on 26 February 1992. To this end, it strongly recommends that the Slovenian authorities implement the April 2003 decision of the Constitutional Court in good faith and without further delay. This includes the immediate resumption and finalisation of the process of issuing supplementary decisions granting retroactive permanent residence rights, and the adoption of a legal framework enabling those \u2018erased\u2019 persons who have not yet secured permanent residence or Slovenian citizenship to have their rights reinstated in a manner that is as fair and generous as possible.", "116. ECRI urges the Slovenian authorities to take the lead in placing public debate on the situation of the \u2018erased\u2019 securely in the realm of human rights and to refrain from generalisations and misrepresentations concerning these persons which foster racism and xenophobia.\u201d", "267. In 1961 the United Nations adopted the Convention on the Reduction of Statelesness. Slovenia has not ratified it.", "268. On 2 June 2003 the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination issued concluding observations under Article 9 of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination stating, inter alia:", "\u201c13. The Committee is encouraged by the steps taken by the State party to address the long-standing issue of persons living in Slovenia who have not been able to obtain citizenship. It is nevertheless concerned that many of the persons who have not acquired Slovene citizenship may still experience administrative difficulties in complying with the specific requirements contained in the law. The Committee recommends that the State party give priority to addressing this issue and, taking into account the difficulties which have arisen, ensure that the new citizenship legislation is implemented in a non-discriminatory manner.", "14. The Committee is concerned that a significant number of persons who have been living in Slovenia since independence without Slovene citizenship may have been deprived under certain circumstances of their pensions, of apartments they were occupying, and of health care and other rights. The Committee takes note of the efforts undertaken by the State party to address these issues and requests the State party to provide, in its next periodic report, specific information on these issues and on any remedies provided.\u201d", "269. On 30 January 2004 the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child issued concluding observations made under Article 44 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child which, in the relevant part, state as follows:", "\u201c26. The Committee notes the rulings of the Constitutional Court (U-I-284/94 of 4 February 1999 and U-I-246/02 of 2 April 2003) that the erasure of about 18,300 people originating from other parts of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from the Register of Permanent Residence in 1992 had no legal basis and that the permanent residence status should be restored to the affected persons retroactively. The Committee is concerned that many children were negatively affected by this erasure, as they and their families lost their right to health care, social assistance and family benefits as a consequence of losing permanent residence status and children born in Slovenia after 1992 became stateless.", "27. The Committee recommends that the State party proceed with the full and prompt implementation of the decisions of the Constitutional Court, compensate the children affected by the negative consequence of the erasure and ensure that they enjoy all rights under the Convention in the same way as other children in the State party.\u201d", "270.

As a result of this, they have lost their Slovene nationality and their right to reside in the State party. The Committee observes that this situation entails violations of these persons\u2019 economic and social rights, including the rights to work, social security, health care and education.

While noting that bilateral agreements were concluded in this regard, the Committee strongly recommends that the State party should restore the status of permanent resident to all the individuals concerned, in accordance with the relevant decisions of the Constitutional Court.
