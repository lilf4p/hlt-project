The method and the basis of calculation of the pension to which the applicant is entitled have been modified several times by a series of regional laws.", "10. Amongst others, according to Regional Law No. 145/1980, the applicant's pension was recalculated and increased. Further modifications in the determination of the applicant's pension were made on the basis of Regional Law No. 41/1985.", "11. In July 1990 the applicant filed an application with the Court of Audit seeking recognition and payment of the increase of pension granted by Regional Law No. 41/1985. On 23 November 1993 the Court of Audit admitted the claim and ordered that the Sicily Region pay the applicant the increases of pension he was entitled to, the revaluation of the amounts due and the statutory interest, accrued from November 1985 to the date on which the applicant would actually receive them.", "12. In relation to the delays in complying with the decision of the Court of Audit of 23 November 1993, the applicant filed \u201ccompliance\u201d proceedings (\u201cricorso per l'ottemperanza\u201d) with the Sicily Regional Administrative Court (RAC).", "13. On 11 July 1997 the Sicily RAC granted the claim and ordered the competent regional administration to comply fully with the above-mentioned judgment within 60 days from the date when the decision would be served or communicated to the applicant. The Sicily RAC also nominated a special commissioner (\u201ccommissario ad acta\u201d) who was to intervene if, upon expiration of the 60 day-period, the administration of the Region had not paid. The commissioner was empowered to take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with the decision within further 30 days at the latest.", "14.

However, on 4 August 1998 the Presidency of the Sicily region urged the competent regional administration to speed up the compliance with a series of judgments favourable to the applicant, including the one at issue. Subsequently, on 21 June 1999 the applicant received 4 030 000 ITL. Yet the applicant contested this sum and complained that the competent administration had used a different method of calculation than the one envisaged by the RAC judgment of 11 July 1997.", "16.
