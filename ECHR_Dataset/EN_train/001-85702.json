He was represented before the Court by Mr F. Kollman, a lawyer practising in N\u00e1chod. On 27 November 2003 the applicant died. By a letter of 1 April 2005 the late applicant\u2019s lawyer informed the Court that his late client\u2019s wife Mrs Ludmila Kudrn\u00e1\u010dov\u00e1 wished to pursue the application in his stead. The Czech Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr V.A. Schorm, from the Ministry of Justice.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "On 28 March 1992 the applicant lodged a restitution action with the Strakonice District Court (okresn\u00ed soud).", "By a judgment of 8 September 1993, the District Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s action. On 18 February 1994 the \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice Regional Court (krajsk\u00fd soud) partly upheld and partly modified the first instance judgment.", "On 2 October 1997 the Supreme Court (Nejvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed soud) dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law (dovol\u00e1n\u00ed).", "On 5 February 1998 the applicant filed a constitutional appeal (\u00fastavn\u00ed st\u00ed\u017enost) through the District Court. However, the constitutional appeal never reached the Constitutional Court.", "On 27 November 2003 the applicant died.", "On 6 September 2006 the late applicant\u2019s wife applied for compensation pursuant to Act no. 82/1998 as amended. She claimed CZK 34,741,000 (EUR 1,343,145) in respect of pecuniary damage, CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 38,662) in respect of non-pecuniary damage and CZK 50,000 (EUR 1,933) in respect of fees incurred in the proceedings before the national courts.", "In a letter of 30 October 2006 the Ministry of Justice informed the deceased applicant\u2019s widow that her compensation claim for non-pecuniary damage was statute-barred, the proceedings having terminated in the High Court\u2019s decision of 2 October 1997. The Ministry specified that under section 27(2) of the Constitutional Court Act, the proceedings before the Constitutional Court commence on the day on which the constitutional appeal is submitted to the court. Having regard to the fact that her late husband had filed his constitutional appeal through the District Court, the constitutional proceedings had never been instituted and, therefore, could not be pending before the Constitutional Court as she argued. Moreover, the Ministry found unsubstantiated the widow\u2019s compensation claims in respect of pecuniary damage and court fees.", "The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the allegedly excessive length of judicial proceedings are set out in the Court\u2019s decision in the case of Vokurka v.
