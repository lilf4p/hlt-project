The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Pyatigorsk, Stavropol region.", "7. On 16 June 2000 criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant, a police investigator. The investigating authority charged him with taking a bribe involving a large sum of money, aggravated by extortion, under Article 290 \u00a7 4 (c) and (d) of the Criminal Code, together with a number of other offences.", "8. The applicant and his lawyer were present at the hearings before the Stavropol Regional Court.", "9. On 2 October 2000 the Stavropol Regional Court delivered a judgment. In respect of the legal characterisation of the acts the applicant was found to have committed, it held as follows:", "\u201c... the court finds the classification of the acts of Abramyan E.N. by the preliminary investigation authorities to have been erroneous and classifies his acts under Articles 30 \u00a7 3 and 159 \u00a7 3 (b) of the UK RF [Criminal Code of the Russian Federation]. It was established that Abramyan, through the abuse of official authority and with a view to misappropriating another\u2019s property, misled witness [L.], claiming that he would forward her case to a court. He then fraudulently obtained two thousand US dollars from [L.], via [D.], having kept from [D.] and [L.] the fact that the proceedings had already been terminated. Taking into account the amount that was stolen and the fact that Abramyan had no real opportunity to dispose of the money, having been arrested at the scene, the court regards his acts as attempted misappropriation, through the abuse of official authority, of another\u2019s property, involving a large sum of money, since he committed all the acts necessary in order to misappropriate another\u2019s property and failed to complete the crime due to circumstances beyond his control.\u201d", "10. The court convicted the applicant under Articles 30 \u00a7 3 and 159 \u00a7 3 (b) of the Criminal Code, acquitted him on the remaining charges and sentenced him to seven years\u2019 imprisonment and imposed a confiscation order.", "11. According to the record of the hearing, after pronouncing the judgment the presiding judge explained to the applicant the procedure and time-limit for appealing against the judgment. He explained that convicted persons could participate in the examination of their case by an appeal body.", "12. The applicant appealed against the judgment. In particular, he complained that the court\u2019s classification of his actions had been erroneous. In his appeal against the judgment the applicant did not request that he be summoned to the hearing before the appeal court or that he be informed of the date of the hearing. Nor did he or his lawyer lodge a separate request to that effect.", "13. On 27 December 2000 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation held an appeal hearing at which neither the applicant nor his counsel were present. The Supreme Court heard a prosecutor K. who argued that the judgment should be upheld. It examined the applicant\u2019s points of appeal, reviewed the judgment and found that the trial court had correctly established the facts based on the evidence examined by it and had given the correct legal classification of the acts which the applicant had been found to have committed. The Supreme Court upheld the judgment.", "14. On an unspecified date in 2003 the applicant was released on parole.", "15. Under Article 335 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1960 (\u201cthe CCP\u201d), in force at the material time, the public prosecutor would state his or her opinion at an appeal hearing as to whether a judgment was lawful and wellfounded. Defence counsel could participate in the hearing. A decision about the defendant\u2019s participation at the hearing was taken by the appeal court. A defendant who appeared before the court was always entitled to give evidence.", "16. In Decision no. 27-P of 10 December 1998, the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation declared Article 335 \u00a7 2 of the CCP incompatible with the Constitution on the grounds that this provision enabled appeal courts to take a final decision where a defendant\u2019s request to attend the appeal hearing had been rejected and where a defendant had not been given an opportunity to study the materials of the hearing and communicate in writing his or her opinion on the issues raised before the appeal court.", "17. Article 336 of the CCP provided that persons who had submitted appeals were to be apprised of the appeal hearing if it was held before courts lower than the Supreme Court of Russia.

Notification of the time of the hearing on appeal was to be displayed at the court not later than three days before the hearing.", "18. In Decision no. 200-O of 17 October 2001, the Constitutional Court held that the provisions of Article 336 of the CCP could not serve as a basis for failing to inform persons entitled to appeal against judgments about the date of examination of their appeals by a court of any level.", "19. Article 338 of the CCP required that, at the beginning of an appeal hearing, the presiding judge should verify who was present and the court should decide whether to proceed with the hearing.", "20. The appeal courts considered, on the basis of the materials in the case file and newly submitted materials, whether a first-instance judgment was lawful and well-founded.

Article 254 of the CCP required the court to examine the case on the basis of the charges brought against the defendant. The charge could be amended by the court provided that such amendment did not aggravate the situation of the defendant or violate his right to defend himself. If the amendment entailed a violation of the defence rights, the court had to remit the case for additional investigation. It did not have powers to prefer a more serious charge or a charge based on substantially different factual circumstances. The court could continue the trial if the amendment related only to the deletion of certain counts or aggravating circumstances.", "24.
