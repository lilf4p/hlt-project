As regards the conduct of the police in Ve\u013ek\u00e9 Kapu\u0161any, the public prosecutor stated that they had photographed the applicant\u2019s flat and examined it for fingerprints and any other relevant evidence. A record was drawn up which indicates that the police did not use a dog with a view to tracing the scent of the perpetrator as the traces had been destroyed, in the meantime, by the other inhabitants of the house. Furthermore, the police had heard sixty-two persons before they adjourned the case. The public prosecutor admitted, however, that the police in Ve\u013ek\u00e9 Kapu\u0161any had acted erroneously in that they had failed to transfer the case to an investigator of the District Office of Investigation in Michalovce immediately after the examination of the flat.", "The letter by the public prosecutor further stated that the delay in hearing the applicant was due to a mistake by the Ko\u0161ice-Juh police who had been asked to do so while the applicant had been in a hospital.", "The public prosecutor informed the applicant that in the proceedings there had been no substantial shortcomings which would affect the lawfulness of the decisions taken.", "On 5 March 2001 the applicant challenged the above conclusions before the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office.", "In a letter of 28 May 2001 the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint with reference to the documents included in the case file.

A number of the applicant\u2019s acquaintances, neighbours and colleagues had been heard subsequently, however to no avail.", "The letter further stated that the applicant could not be heard immediately after the incident due to the state of her health. Following her transfer to the hospital in Ko\u0161ice the police in Ve\u013ek\u00e9 Kapu\u0161any had asked the Ko\u0161ice-Juh police department, on 15 June 1998, to hear her in the hospital. On 17 June 1998 the latter had replied that the applicant had had an operation on her jaw and that, according to doctors, she could be examined in six weeks at the earliest. Following her release from the hospital the applicant had been heard by policemen from the Ve\u013ek\u00e9 Kapu\u0161any police department in her flat on 28 September 1989. The applicant had stated that she had had no conflicts with other persons and that she could not indicate who could be interested in causing injuries to her. There was no indication that the decision to adjourn the case had been arbitrary or erroneous.", "The General Prosecutor\u2019s office noted that the case had been proceeded with following the applicant\u2019s criminal complaint against three persons filed on 1 March 2000.

The letter concluded that the proceedings would be resumed should such facts be subsequently established.", "On 7 June 2001 the applicant sent a letter to the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office in which she alleged that the police and public prosecutors dealing with the case had intentionally kept secret the identity of the perpertrators of the offence. She complained that her flat had not been examined by the criminal police immediately after the assault and that the latter had failed to hear her. The applicant further complained that the police had examined her for the first time four months after the assault had taken place and that she had not been confronted with the three persons against whom she had filed a criminal complaint. Finally, the applicant alleged that the police in Ve\u013ek\u00e9 Kapu\u0161any had refused to come to her flat and to draw up a record of her statement that an unknown person had asked her on the telephone, on 11 February 1999, whether she wanted to know the identity of the perpetrator.", "On 18 June 2001 the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office replied to the applicant that her above letter contained no new relevant information.", "The following provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure are relevant in the present case.", "Pursuant to Article 159(4), as in force until 30 October 1999, the police or investigator shall adjourn proceedings when the facts established by them do not suffice for criminal proceedings to be brought.

Once the reasons for adjourning the case have ceased to exist, it should be proceeded with in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.", "Article 173(1)(e) provides that a police investigator shall suspend the proceedings when it has not been possible to establish facts permitting the prosecution of a particular person."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
