He used this plot for growing vegetables.", "In 1993 the unfinished house, located at the address specified in the construction contract, was allocated to the R. family, who had advanced funding for the construction of a house in 1991.

This judgment was not appealed against, became final and the enforcement proceedings were instituted to effect the house transfer to the applicant.", "The R. family refused to leave the house, referring to the lack of any decision in respect of their rights, particularly, on reimbursement of their investments and provision of an alternative residence.

The court instructed the first-instance court to explore further whether the applicant could claim entitlement to the house at the address in question, particularly, in view of the unclear contractual language concerning an obligation to obtain a bank loan for construction and considering that the applicant had also been allocated a plot of land for construction under a different address.", "Between 12 May and 19 August 1998 the proceedings were suspended at the applicant\u2019s request in view of his business trip.", "In February 1999 the applicant amended his claims, seeking punitive damages from the Zarichny Farm in addition to the house transfer and joining his eviction claims to the main proceedings.", "On 25 February 1999 the court dismissed the applicant\u2019s claims and the Farm\u2019s counterclaim.

Based on the findings of the expert assessment, it awarded the applicant against the Zarichny Cooperative 36,523.24 hryvnyas (UAH) as the equivalent to his investment into the construction and UAH 365.23 in court fees. The applicant appealed in cassation to the Supreme Court of Ukraine, seeking a higher payment.", "On 24 October 2001 the Supreme Court heard the case on the merits and upheld the judgment of 21 May 2001.", "On an unspecified date the enforcement proceedings were instituted to collect the debt due to the applicant pursuant the judgment of 21 May 2001.
