The applicant was born in 1978 and is currently serving a sentence in Rivne Regional Penitentiary no. 76.", "8. According to the applicant, he was detained and ill-treated in police custody from 19 to 21 October 2003. There are no further details or documents.", "9. In the evening of 31 October 2003 the applicant, together with another person, was arrested by the Fontanka police unit of the Kominternovo District Police Department in flagrante delicto on the scene of a robbery and car hijacking. As it would later be confirmed by at least two eye-witnesses (see paragraph 23 below), the applicant attempted escaping from and showed resistance to the police.", "10. According to the applicant, he pleaded guilty to several counts of robbery under torture. He alleged in particular that he had been heavily beaten with rubber truncheons, hanged with his arms twisted behind him and administered electric shocks.", "11. On 1 November 2003 the applicant signed the arrest report in confirmation that his procedural rights had been explained to him.", "12. On the same day the applicant was taken to the Kominternovo Temporary Detention Facility, where a doctor examined him and made a note that he had a bruise under his left eye.", "13. On 4 November 2003 the investigator submitted to the Kominternovo Town Court (\u041a\u043e\u043c\u0456\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0434 \u2013 \u201cthe Kominternovo Court\u201d) a motion on the applicant's detention as a preventive measure pending trial. The investigator noted that the applicant was suspected of having committed serious crimes (three counts of robbery with violence on 22, 26 and 31 October 2003), had no permanent place of residence and had a criminal record, and thus could hinder the investigation or abscond if at liberty. According to the investigator, the applicant had fully admitted his guilt.", "14. On the same date the Kominternovo Court remanded the applicant in custody, having upheld the investigator's reasoning.", "15. On 26 December 2003 the Kominternovo Court extended the term of the applicant's detention to four months, having referred to the necessity to complete the investigation.", "16. On 15 June 2004 the applicant was committed for trial.", "17. No further documents concerning the applicant's detention are available in the case file.", "18.

Each of the cells had a toilet separated from the living area, sufficient natural and artificial light, operational heating, ventilation, water supply and sewage system.", "20. As it transpires from a note by the Odesa SIZO administration issued on an unspecified date, disinfection, disinsection and rat extermination were regularly carried out on the SIZO premises.", "21. The Government provided seven colour photos of the cells the applicant had been detained in. The photos showed that the cells were clean and looked as if they had been repaired not long before the photos had been taken. They had sufficient natural light; the lavatories were separated from the living area and appeared to be clean.", "22. The applicant contested the accuracy of the information submitted by the Government in so far as the number of inmates per cell was concerned and alleged that there had been more detainees in the cells than indicated by the Government. He also alleged that he had not been detained in the cells shown in the photos.", "23. On 23 March 2006 the Malynovskyy District Court of Odesa (\u041c\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0434 \u2013 \u201cthe Malynovskyy Court\u201d), to which the case had been transferred from the Kominternovo Court on an unspecified date, found the applicant guilty of three counts of robbery with violence, committed on 22, 27 and 31 October 2003 by a group of persons acting in concert, and sentenced him to fourteen years' imprisonment with confiscation of all his personal property. The court based its findings, inter alia, on the testimonies of the victims of all three instances of robbery, medical reports concerning the injuries they sustained during those robberies, as well as material evidence (certain items seized from the applicant and recognised by the victims as the stolen ones; two knives, a hammer and a sack discovered in the car, which the co-defendants had left immediately before their arrest). The court also heard two eye-witnesses of the applicant''s face noted on 1 November 2003 might have been sustained in the course of his fight with the police prior to his arrest.", "24. On 22 May 2007 the Odesa Regional Court of Appeal (\u0410\u043f\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0446\u0456\u0439\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0434 \u041e\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0457 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0456) upheld that verdict.", "25.
