After the incident the prisoner was transferred, disciplinary proceedings were instituted against him and the District State Prosecutor\u2019s Office was informed of the incident. The applicant sustained a fracture of nasal bones and consequently had difficulties with breathing. He later rejected reposition of the nasal bones and the operation; however after few months he asked for a corrective operation and was referred to a plastic surgeon. Prior to the incident the applicant never informed prison staff about feeling threatened by this prisoner or asked for a transfer due to feeling threatened by this or any other prisoner. The Government submitted the incident was therefore unpredictable for prison staff and that they could not have had prevented it. However, they reacted immediately and took the applicant to health centre for a medical examination and to general hospital for medical treatment.", "As regards an incident on 9 July 2009 the Government submitted that there was a physical conflict between the applicant and another prisoner. On 5 July 2009 the other prisoner had supposedly provoked the applicant; they ended up in several fights, with the applicant allegedly hitting the other prisoner in the eye, which led to the incident on 9 July. The applicant however never informed prison staff about these fights and never informed them that he felt threatened by this prisoner or asked for a transfer due to feeling threatened by this or any other prisoner, therefore again the incident was unpredictable and unpreventable. After the incident prison staff promptly took the applicant to a health centre for a medical examination and the same day to general hospital, where he was admitted for 24-hour medical monitoring. On the return to prison, the applicant was transferred to another section and on the request of a nurse put under higher supervision of prison guards. The other prisoner was placed in a special room under video surveillance and disciplinary and criminal proceedings were instituted against him.", "After the two events, no further incidents occurred between the applicant and these two prisoners. According to the Government\u2019s submissions on 16 June 2011 prison staff, when conflicts are detected, conduct a talk with prisoners who have conflicts and makes an official note about it. However, until the incident on 14 November 2008, no conflict between the applicant and a prisoner was detected or recorded by prison staff.", "According to a doctor\u2019s report dated 13 August 2010 the applicant was treated on seventy-five occasions, mostly for his back pain.", "For the relevant domestic law and practice, see paragraphs 33-35 and 3847 of the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of \u0160trucl and Others v.
