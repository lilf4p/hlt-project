Pursuant to Article 132 of the Federal Constitution, the Austrian law no application may be lodged with the Administrative Court against the administrative authorities' failure to decide (S\u00e4umnisbeschwerde) in administrative criminal proceedings. This provision was adopted in 1984 (BGBl. 296/1984). The legislative committee stated in its respective report (AB 345, XVI. GP), referring to the Code of Administrative Offences (Verwaltungsstrafgesetz), that the exclusion of this remedy was justified as the administrative authorities had to decide on appeals within a short time-limit. The provisions to which the legislative committee referred provide as follows:", "22. Pursuant to Section 51 \u00a7 7 of the Code of Administrative Offences, administrative authorities have to decide on appeals within fifteen months and if they do not comply with this time-limit the proceedings have to be discontinued.

Periods during which proceedings before the Constitutional Court, the Administrative Court and the European Court of Justice are pending shall not be counted for the purpose of the period of prescription.", "25. In administrative criminal proceedings in which more than one party has the right to appeal, e.g. in proceedings where also the Labour Office has locus standi, legal protection against the authorities' failure to decide is only safeguarded by the limitation of the period of three years within which a penal order has to be issued. The public pronouncement of the decision is considered to be sufficient for complying with this time-limit.", "26. Pursuant to Section 19 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Administrative Offences in connection with Sections 32 to 35 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessordnung), the administrative authorities have to consider an unreasonable length of the proceedings as mitigating circumstance."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
