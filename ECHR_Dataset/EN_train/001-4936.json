THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The first applicant is a citizen of Austria and of the United States of America. He was born in Hungary in 1935 and is currently living in London, England.", "The second applicant, the first applicant\u2019s son, is a British national, born in 1962 and living in London.", "Both applicants are represented before the Court by Isadore Goldman, Solicitors, London, and by Mr J.P. Gardner, a lawyer practising in London.", "A.", "The applicants were directors of the Kensington Property Management Ltd (Kensington), which was responsible for managing various companies operating in the property investment sector. As a result of the property collapse from 1989 onwards, Kensington\u2019s various sources of property-based income suffered and it ceased trading in January 1993. Kensington was placed into Creditors\u2019 Voluntary Liquidation on 17 February 1993.", "The management functions of Kensington were thereafter carried out by Westminster Property Management Ltd (Westminster) of which the applicants became directors on 13 February 1990. In 1994 Westminster agreed a schedule of payments of outstanding income tax but as trading conditions continued to deteriorate the agreed schedule of conditions could not be met and on 15 August 1994 the Inland Revenue presented a winding up petition to the court and a winding-up order was made on 26 October 1994.", "The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry subsequently appointed an Official Receiver who became Liquidator on an interim basis. As such, he had various obligations under the provisions of the Insolvency Act 1986 (\u201cthe 1986 Act\u201d) to look into the affairs of Westminster and in particular its causes of failure.", "The applicants, as well as a number of officers of companies within Westminster\u2019s management remit, were interviewed by an Examiner from the Official Receiver\u2019s Office in connection with Westminster\u2019s affairs. The persons interviewed were required to give written statements.", "The first applicant was interviewed on 9 January and 12 December 1995 and the second applicant on 7 February and 15 December 1995. The statements were given pursuant to the provisions of sections 131, 132 and 235 of the 1986 Act. The first applicant states that the first interview was unfair and oppressive and that the questioning was conducted in a peremptory and police-like manner. He was not advised that he had the right to have a legal adviser during interview. The first applicant signed a written statement in connection with this interview on 31 January 1995. He was accompanied by his solicitor at the second interview.", "The second applicant also states that his first interview was conducted in an oppressive, intense and accusatory manner. He was not informed of his right to have his lawyer present at the interview and many of the questions put to him were not within his personal knowledge. His solicitor was present at the second interview, which was conducted smoothly, speedily and in a dignified and business-like manner.", "On 24 October 1996 the Official Receiver acting on behalf of the Secretary of State issued proceedings against the applicants under the Company Directors\u2019 Disqualification Act 1986 (\u201cthe CDDA\u201d) asserting that they were unfit to be company directors and should be disqualified from that competence.", "The proceedings were founded on a report made to the court by the Deputy Official Receiver on 23 October 1996 which drew extensively on the statements made by the applicants in interviews as well as materials which they and others produced to the Examiner acting under compulsory powers.", "On 6 November 1996 a national newspaper published an article stating that proceedings had been issued against the applicants on 24 October 1996.", "The disqualification proceedings were served on the applicant on 7 or 8 November 1996 and alleged, inter alia, that the applicants allowed Kensington and Westminster to continue to trade without there being any commercial prospect of the companies meeting their liabilities, misapplication of company funds and unlawful payments to directors. The applicants state that the criticism levelled against them is based on information obtained unfairly in the exercise of compulsory powers and that difficulties which Kensington and Westminster encountered are to be explained in terms of the exceptional cash flow problems due to market forces at the relevant time.", "B.
