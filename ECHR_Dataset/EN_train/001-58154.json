After verifying that the applicant had been arrested lawfully, the judge ordered that he should be detained pending trial.", "12. On 9 July 1992 the Supreme Court (Supremo Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a) refused an application for a writ of habeas corpus made by the applicant in person.", "13. On 9 October 1992 the public prosecutor made his submissions. These were served on the lawyer on 12 October and on the applicant on the 13th.", "14. On 15 October 1992 Mr Daud himself requested that a judicial investigation should be commenced. On 26 October the investigating judge, citing Article 92 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, refused the request, on the ground that it did not satisfy the minimum formal requirements laid down by law, in particular because it was written in Spanish.", "15. On 16 November 1992 the file, together with the public prosecutor\u2019s submissions, was sent to the Third Division of the Lisbon Criminal Court (tribunal criminal).", "16. In an order of 30 November 1992 that was served on Mr Daud on 9 December the judge in charge of the case set it down for hearing on 26 January 1993.

In a letter of 15 December 1992, which was registered on 22 December, the applicant asked the court to hear a number of witnesses and to order an examination of the suitcase in issue, which he denied was his. He also sought the assistance of an interpreter other than Mr C.M. and asked to meet his officially assigned lawyer, who had not yet contacted him.", "18. In an order of 22 December the judge in charge of the case, citing Article 92 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, declined to consider the application, on the grounds that it was \u201cdifficult to read\u201d, written in Spanish and unaccompanied by any translation.", "19.

On the very same day that he was convicted, the applicant, represented by his officially assigned lawyer, appealed to the Supreme Court. In his pleadings, drawn up and submitted by Ms C.G., he complained that the court below had not acceded to his request for a judicial investigation. In his submission, the investigating judge had misinterpreted the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure; his refusal to consider the request and the lack of an investigation rendered the proceedings null and void.", "23. In a judgment of 30 June 1993 the Supreme Court, relying on Article 412 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, held that the appeal was inadmissible on account of an inadequate presentation of the grounds. The submissions did not indicate either the statutory provisions that had allegedly been contravened or the way in which, in the appellant\u2019s view, they should have been interpreted or applied.", "24.
