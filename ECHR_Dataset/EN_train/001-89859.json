On 15 March 2002 the Kerch Court extended the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention for up to a total of four months. It found that there was sufficient evidence on which to found a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed serious offences.", "10. In April 2002 the applicant\u2019s lawyer requested the investigator to replace the applicant\u2019s detention with a less restrictive preventive measure. By a ruling of 28 April 2002, the request was rejected on the ground that the applicant was suspected of having committed serious crimes and might prevent the establishment of the truth in the case.", "11. On 13 May 2002 the Kerch Prosecutor (\u041f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0440 \u043c\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u041a\u0435\u0440\u0447) sent the case file, together with the bill of indictment, to the Kerch Court for the trial proceedings.", "12. On 27 May 2002 the judge of the Kerch Court held a committal hearing at which the applicant\u2019s lawyer lodged a new request for release, stating that the applicant was a minor; had no previous convictions; could not obstruct the collection of evidence or destroy it; had positive aspects to his character; permanently resided in Kerch; did not \u2013 and could not \u2013 try to abscond due to the lack of resources or relatives in other parts of the country; and, lastly, that there was no indication that he would reoffend if released.

In its committal order the court also rejected the applicant\u2019s request for release and extended his detention during the trial proceedings without giving any grounds.", "13. On 23 August 2002 the applicant\u2019s lawyer lodged another request with the Kerch Court for the applicant\u2019s release on the same grounds as the one of 27 May 2002.

In December 2002 the applicant\u2019s lawyer lodged two requests with the investigator for the applicant\u2019s release.

On 28 December 2002 the Crimea Court of Appeal (\u201cthe Crimea Court\u201d) considered the investigator\u2019s request for the applicant\u2019s further detention. The court decided that further investigative actions were required in respect of the applicant and his co-accused and, given that the applicant was accused of serious crimes, there were sufficient grounds for his further detention. The court accordingly extended the applicant\u2019s detention to 10 March 2003.", "17.

In March 2003 the investigation was completed and the case was referred to the Kerch Court.", "20. On 27 March 2003 the applicant\u2019s lawyer requested the Crimea Court to replace the applicant\u2019s detention with an obligation not to abscond as there was not enough evidence on which to found a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed a crime. He also reiterated the arguments in support of the applicant\u2019s release set out in his previous requests of 27 May and 23 August 2002 (see paragraphs 12 and 13 above).", "21. At a committal hearing of 3 April 2003, the Crimea Court rejected the request on the ground that the reasonableness of the suspicion could be verified only during the trial proceedings.

On 20 May 2002 the applicant\u2019s lawyer filed a request for the applicant\u2019s release with the Governor of the Simferopol Pre-Trial Detention Centre (the Simferopol SIZO). The request was based on the argument that the term of the applicant\u2019s detention pending trial, as authorised by the Kerch Court in the detention order of 15 March 2002, had expired on 19 May 2002 (four months after his arrest) and that no new decision had been taken extending this term.", "30. In a letter of 30 May 2002 the Governor of the Simferopol SIZO informed the applicant\u2019s lawyer that the applicant had been moved to the Kerch temporary detention centre (\u201cthe Kerch ITU\u201d) on 20 May 2002. He further stated \u2013 referring to Article 156 of the Code of Criminal Procedure \u2013 that in any event there were no grounds for the applicant\u2019s release as the time-limit referred to in the above request was applicable only to pretrial proceedings. However, as from 13 May 2002, the date when the bill of indictment was sent to the court (see paragraph 11 above), the applicant\u2019s detention had been classified as detention during trial. Consequently, the applicant could not be released on the ground of the expiry of the four-month time-limit referred to.", "31. On 29 May 2002 the applicant lodged two administrative complaints: one with the Simferopol Zheleznodorozhny District Court against the Simferopol SIZO and the other with the Kerch Court against the Kerch ITU in respect of his allegedly unlawful detention after 19 May 2002.", "32. On 1 October 2002 the Simferopol Zheleznodorozhny District Court rejected the applicant\u2019s administrative complaint against the administration of the Simferopol SIZO about his allegedly unlawful detention after 19 May 2002 on the ground that a complaint of that nature should be considered in the criminal proceedings and not in administrative proceedings.", "33. On 26 March 2003 the Crimea Court upheld the decision of the first-instance court.", "34. On 26 September 2007 the Higher Administrative Court quashed the decisions of the lower courts and remitted the case to the first-instance court for consideration on the merits on the ground that criminal procedural law did not provide for the possibility of challenging the failure of a prison administration to release a suspect or accused.", "35. The proceedings are still pending.", "36. On 10 October 2003 the Kerch Court considered the administrative complaint brought by the applicant against the Kerch Police Department for being held in their temporary detention centre (\u201cthe Kerch ITU\u201d) from 20 to 27 May 2002. The court found in part for the applicant, having established that his detention there without a valid court order was contrary to Article 29 of the Constitution and Article 5 of the Convention and therefore unlawful. The court rejected the applicant\u2019s request for release, however, stating that at the time of consideration of the case the applicant\u2019s detention was maintained by a court order and that it could not decide the issue in civil (administrative) proceedings.", "37. On 12 July 2004 the Crimea Court set aside the decision of the first-instance court on the ground that Article 156 of the Code of Criminal Procedure obliged the head of a penitentiary institution to free a detainee only if no decision on continued detention was made during the pre-trial investigation. It further noted that:", "\u201cThe law does not require the head of the pre-trial detention facility to free an accused in respect of whom the term of pre-trial detention has expired but no decision of the court has arrived imposing a preventive measure in the form of detention during the trial proceedings in the case.\u201d", "The court concluded that the administration of the Kerch ITU could act only within its competence and had done so. The court further noted that the reference by the first-instance court to a violation of Article 5 of the Convention was unsubstantiated and that the applicant\u2019s detention between 20 and 27 May had not been contrary to Article 29 of the Constitution and Article 5 of the Convention.", "38. On 30 November 2007 the Zaporizhzhzya Court of Appeal, acting as a court of cassation, upheld the decision of the Crimea Court.", "39.
