He is a businessman. He is represented by Mrs. G. Futaki, a lawyer practising in B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba, who was his defence counsel throughout the criminal proceedings outlined below.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "A.", "On 31 March 1994 the applicant was arrested by the B\u00e9k\u00e9s County Police Department. Upon his arrest, the Police Department's decision was communicated to him, which he acknowledged by signing the document. According to the decision, there was a strong suspicion that the applicant had participated in the murder of Z. D., an offence under S. 166 \u00a7 1 of the Hungarian Criminal Code. The applicant was committed to the prison of the B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba Police Department.", "On the same day, the B\u00e9k\u00e9s County Police Department searched the applicant's home and business premises and seized cash belonging to him, in the amount of 3,946,950 Hungarian forints (HUF), in pursuance of S. 101 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. His complaint was to no avail.", "On 1 April 1994 the Police Department heard the applicant. On this occasion he was again informed that there was a strong suspicion that he had participated in the murder of Z. D., a businessman.", "On 3 April 1994 the B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba District Court heard the applicant who denied the charge. The District Court ordered his detention on remand, holding that there was a strong suspicion that on 18 March 1994 the applicant and two further suspects had murdered Z. D. by means of multiple battery and shooting. This suspicion relied on, inter alia, witness evidence and preliminary forensic pathology expertise. The District Court found that, in the light of the serious charge against him and in accordance with S. 92 \u00a7 1 (a)-(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, there was a risk of the applicant's absconding or of collusion, if he had been left at large.", "On 18 April 1994 the B\u00e9k\u00e9s County Regional Court dismissed the applicant's appeal against the detention order of 3 April 1994. The Regional Court found that the District Court had ordered the applicant's detention on remand on proper grounds.", "On 25 April 1994 the B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba District Court prolonged the detention on remand until 3 July 1994, at the latest. The District Court observed that the applicant was suspected of murder. The Court considered that, had the applicant been left at large, there was a serious risk that he would hide from the authorities, abscond or obstruct the proceedings by co-operating with his accomplices. The prolongation was ordered in accordance with S. 95 \u00a7 1 and S. 379/A \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. On 9 May 1994 the Regional Court dismissed the applicant's appeal.", "On 13 May 1994 the B\u00e9k\u00e9s County Public Prosecutor's Office heard the applicant. On this occasion he said that he was satisfied with the conditions of his detention. Still on the same day he was transferred to the prison of the Szentes Police Department.

The Regional Court, referring to the state of the investigations, held that further acts of investigation of crucial importance should take place in the case and that, although the applicant denied the charge against him, a strong suspicion of his guilt prevailed. In its decision, the Regional Court referred to S. 92 \u00a7 1 (a)-(b), S. 95 \u00a7 1 and S. 379/A. \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. On 19 July 1994 a panel of the Regional Court dismissed the applicant's appeal as well as his complaint about the lack of reasonable suspicion against him and about the alleged failure to inform him of the charges brought against him.", "On 16 August 1994 the B\u00e9k\u00e9s County Police Department impounded, invoking S. 106 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the applicant's seized money. His complaint in this respect was to no avail.", "On 6 September 1994 two officers of the Szentes Police Department carried out a control of the local prison premises, on which occasion the applicant requested that the time allowed for taking baths be extended. His request was admitted.", "On 14 October 1994 the Criminal Expertise and Research Institute of the National Police Department presented the opinion of an expert serologist.", "On 17 October 1994 the B\u00e9k\u00e9s County Public Prosecutor's Office informed the applicant's lawyer that the forensic experts' opinions which had been completed by then were accessible for her to consult. Furthermore, the Public Prosecutor's Office, in reply to the lawyer's complaint of 7 July 1994 about the prohibition of contacts between the applicant and his concubine, permitted that these contacts be resumed.", "On 2 November 1994 a single judge of the B\u00e9k\u00e9s County Regional Court prolonged the detention on remand until 3 April 1995, at the latest, finding that the results of the investigation - including witness testimonies, expertise from a mobile phone company and fire-arm tests carried out by the Criminal Expertise and Research Institute - had confirmed the strong suspicion against the applicant. The judge, referring to the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, considered that the reasons, which had initially necessitated the applicant's detention on remand, persisted. On 17 November 1994 a panel of the Regional Court dismissed the applicant's appeal, finding that the single judge's reasoning was correct. In particular, the Regional Court held that the risk of the applicant's collusion was considerable in the light of an incident in June 1994, when it had been established by the police that he had attempted to persuade one of the co-accused to revoke a testimony.", "On 14 November 1994 the applicant was again committed to the prison of the B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba Police Department. In mid-December 1994, the applicant unsuccessfully complained to the Head of Investigations about the fact that he had to share his cell with a \u201cgipsy\u201d person.", "On 25 January 1995 the Supreme Court rejected the complaints of the applicant's lawyer about the lawfulness of the investigation. Also on 25 January 1995 the Szeged Public Prosecutor's Investigation Office forwarded the submissions of the applicant's lawyer, questioning the lawfulness of the investigation, to the B\u00e9k\u00e9s County Public Prosecutor's Office.", "On 20 March 1995 the Attorney General's Office informed the applicant's lawyer that her complaint of 4 August 1994 - in which she had alleged that there had been no reasonable suspicion of the applicant's guilt, that the authorities had failed to properly inform the applicant of the charges and that his detention on remand had lasted unreasonably long - had been forwarded to the B\u00e9k\u00e9s County Public Prosecutor's Office for further action and that a hearing of the applicant in that respect had not been considered necessary.", "On 23 March 1995 the Supreme Court prolonged the detention on remand until 3 October 1995, at the latest. The Supreme Court, referring to the relevant legal provisions, stated that the reasons for detaining the applicant on remand persisted.", "On 22 May 1995 the B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba District Court dismissed the applicant's request for release. On 30 May 1995 the B\u00e9k\u00e9s County Regional Court dismissed the applicant's appeal.", "On 11 July 1995 the B\u00e9k\u00e9s County Public Prosecutor's Office heard the applicant.

Whilst admitting that the general conditions of the applicant's detention in the B\u00e1cs-Kiskun County Prison were good, the lawyer requested that the applicant be granted access to the shower facilities more often than once a week. In its answer dated 8 September 1995 the Head of the Department explained that the relevant rules in force provided that inmates should have access to shower or bathing facilities at least once a week and no exceptional treatment could be granted to the applicant in this respect.", "On 15 August 1995 the B\u00e9k\u00e9s County Public Prosecutor's Office preferred a bill of indictment against the applicant, charging him with instigation to premeditated murder and, moreover, with abuse of fire-arms and of ammunition, an offence under S. 263/A of the Criminal Code. The indictment involved three further defendants. The Public Prosecutor's Office was relying on the results of the investigation, which involved, inter alia, the following items: findings of the inspection of the murder premises; evidence given by some sixty witnesses; forensic pathology, chemistry, toxicology, psychiatry, serology and dactylography expertise; consultants' opinions concerning physical evidence, documents, fire-arms and other weapons; and minutes of confrontation.", "On 8 September 1995 the applicant's lawyer requested the B\u00e9k\u00e9s County Regional Court to order the applicant's release. On 15 September 1995 the Regional Court decided that the applicant's detention on remand be prolonged until the first instance court decision would be taken.

The Regional Court established the facts relying upon, inter alia, statements made by the four co-accused as well as upon testimonies made by more than seventy witnesses and some twenty experts. Having examined the entirety of the evidence at its disposal, the Regional Court held that the applicant had not been involved in the murder. At the same time, the Regional Court convicted him of abuse of fire-arms and of ammunition and sentenced him to a fine of HUF 200,000. The Regional Court declared that the fine in question was to be regarded settled, having regard to the applicant's detention on remand between 31 March and 17 October 1994. The Regional Court also ordered that the money, which had been seized from the applicant and had subsequently been impounded, be returned to him.", "On 29 January 1997 the Supreme Court, upon the applicant's appeal, re-qualified his offence as abuse of ammunition only and reduced his sentence to a fine of HUF 100,000.
