In the evening I poured out thirty litres of fuel from the tank of my service vehicle. I have previously brought the cans, ten and twenty litres each, from home.

I have no requests or motions. I do not require legal assistance; this decision is based on reasons unrelated to lack of means. I will defend myself at the trial.", "[the applicant's] signature\u201d", "14. At the trial the applicant was represented by Mr Adamchik, a lawyer practising in Birobidjan. As follows from the trial judgment and the trial record, the applicant contended at the trial that he had purchased the fuel on or around 15 February 2001 at a petrol station; on 21 February 2001 he had put the cans in his car intending to exchange it for firewood later and went to his work; after the working day he was stopped by the police on his way home; when stopped he had not told about the purchase of the fuel because he felt intimidated and had no receipt to prove the purchase. He contended that Mr Kh, who was in his car on 21 February 2001, had seen the applicant purchase the fuel at the petrol station. At the trial the applicant was asked if the inspection record had been drawn up on the spot or in Birofeld. The applicant replied as follows:", "\u201c[The police] started to draw up the inspection record on the spot. Then a bus arrived. There was a tense situation so we left. The bus was also inspected...", "The inspection record was signed in Birofeld. It was started on the spot but was not finished there.\u201d", "15. On 20 March 2001 the applicant submitted to the court an invoice for the purchase of diesel. The court refused to accept the invoice in evidence considering that the applicant did not specify why he had not adduced that evidence at the initial stage of the questioning by the police or at the opening of the trial. The applicant, however, indicated that the invoice had been kept by his wife. It also appears that he specified the name and location of the petrol station where he had allegedly bought it and asked the court to verify this fact. It appears that the court did not follow up his request.", "16. The trial court heard the applicant's wife, who claimed that she had purchased the fuel and had given one petrol can to the applicant and that the applicant had purchased the remainder. The court also questioned Mr Kh who claimed to have seen the applicant purchasing diesel. Mr Kh was with the applicant on 21 February 2001 and told the court that he had not witnessed any threats to the applicant from the police officers. The trial court refused to take those testimonies into consideration, considering that those persons were in close or friendly relationship with the defendant and that their testimonies would therefore be prejudiced.", "17. Instead, the trial judge relied on the inspection record and the written statement made by the applicant on 21 February 2001, testimonies from the attesting witnesses who had been present during the inspection and seizure of fuel from the applicant's car. The court also examined a Mr F who explained there had been cases of workers pouring out diesel from their service vehicles, and thus the company's director had asked the competent authorities to carry out checks. The applicant's car was apparently stopped during one of the checks.", "18. Having examined the evidence, the judge considered that as followed from the inspection record, the applicant had admitted to \u201chave stolen\u201d the diesel from the company premises. By a judgment of 20 April 2001, the Birobidjan District Court convicted the applicant of theft and sentenced him to a suspended sentence of six months' imprisonment. The court held as follows:", "\u201cIt follows from the inspection record that two cans of diesel (thirty litres) were seized from [the applicant's] car...The applicant explained that he had stolen the diesel from the company premises...", "Assessing the defendant's testimony at the trial, the court considers that it is made-up with a view to avoiding criminal responsibility for the crime committed; this testimony has not been supported by any objective evidence. The court takes into account his pre-trial testimony, from which it follows that on 21 February 2001 after the end of his working day he had poured out fuel from his service vehicle and was stopped on his way back home. This testimony is logical and corresponds to witness statement by Mr F, Mr K and Mr P, as well as to the materials in the case file.\u201d", "19. The applicant and his counsel appealed alleging that there was no proof that any diesel had been stolen from the company and that the applicant had not been apprised of the privilege against self-incrimination while the court then relied on his admissions made on 21 February 2001. In his appeal, the prosecutor considered that the applicant's acts should be reclassified as misappropriation of property. On 24 May 2001 the Court of the Jewish Autonomous Region dismissed the appeals and upheld the judgment. The court confirmed that the applicant had been convicted on the basis of his own pre-trial admission and other evidence obtained by lawful means, including the inspection record. The applicant's allegation of self-incrimination had been rightly rejected as unfounded.", "20. Article 48 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution provides that an arrested or detained person or a person accused of a criminal offence should have a right to legal representation from the moment of his or her arrest, placement into custody or when charges are brought.", "21. Article 51 of the Constitution provides that no one should be obliged to give evidence against himself or herself, his or her spouse or close relative. Other exemptions from the obligation to testify may be authorised by a federal statute.", "22. Pursuant to Article 47 \u00a7 1 of the Code, counsel could participate in the proceedings from the date when charges were brought or when the person was arrested or detained. If no preliminary inquiry or investigation was required in the case, counsel could participate in the proceedings from the date when the case was submitted for trial (Article 47 \u00a7 2). On 27 June 2000 the Constitutional Court declared Article 47 \u00a7 1 unconstitutional as regards the limitation on legal representation before charges were brought. The Constitutional Court decided that until the relevant legislation was amended, Article 48 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution should be directly applicable with due regard to the interpretation given by the Constitutional Court.", "23. Chapter 13 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure provided for a record-based pre-trial procedure in respect of a number of criminal offences. The general provisions of the Code were applicable in this procedure unless Chapter 13 of the Code otherwise provided (Article 414). 's or court'put in writing in a report.", "24. Having examined the report, the inquiring authority should open a criminal case. The person concerned should be informed of the nature of the accusation and be apprised of his right to legal representation and to have access to the file.", "25. Having received the file, the prosecutor should (i) submit the case to a court or (ii) order an inquiry or preliminary investigation or (iii) discontinue the case.", "26. An investigator could carry out an inspection of a crime scene, location, premises, physical objects or documents in order to detect traces of the crime or other physical evidence or to determine the relevant circumstances (Article 178 of the Code). In urgent cases, the inspection could be carried out before opening a criminal case. In such cases, the case was to be opened immediately after the inspection of the crime scene.", "27. A record had to be drawn up and signed by all persons who took part in the investigative measure (Articles 141 and 182 of the Code). Those persons were to be informed that they had a right to make comments (Article 141). If the suspect, accused or another participant refused to sign the record, a note to this effect should be included in the record (Article 142).", "28.
