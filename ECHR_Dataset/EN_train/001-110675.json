The applicant provided the following description of the appeal hearing:", "\u201cThe appeal hearing was conducted by means of a video link. The video link was of poor quality. The image [quality] remained unchanged, but there were interruptions in the sound and not everything that was said was understandable. ... After the court opened the hearing I was invited to make a statement. Then I asked the court to admit to the case-file the documents that proved my innocence. These were the documents showing that secretary G. had not been present at a number of trial hearings and that my lawyer had been absent from one of the court hearings. Despite that, the court hearing had not been adjourned and the court had proceeded with the examination of the witnesses. The [trial] court had not respected my right to defend myself and had proceeded with the examination of the case when I had a fracture [of the toe]. The court interrupted me, saying that I was deliberately delaying the proceedings and that they had other cases to consider after mine.", "After the judge rapporteur had presented the case I was invited to present my complaint. However, when I started reading out my statement of appeal the judge interrupted me, saying that those issues had been already considered in the previous appeal hearing or had been submitted in the statements of appeal. The court heard the prosecutor and [my] counsel, who failed to present any argument in my defence. He merely suggested that the charges [of illegal possession of firearms and disturbance of the peace] should be dropped owing to the expiry of the statutory time-limit for prosecution or decriminalisation of the offence. Then the judges exited to the deliberations room without giving me a chance to make my final statement. When the judges returned and pronounced their decision, I realised that neither counsel, the prosecutor, nor the court had studied my case. They were simply giving the appearance of a hearing.\u201d", "22. According to the applicant, in 2001 numerous newspapers and television channels covered his case. In one article the applicant was referred to as \u201ca gang leader\u201d.
