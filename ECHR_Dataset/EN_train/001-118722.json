THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE", "5. The applicants were born in 1966 and 1993 respectively, and live in Bayrakl\u0131/\u0130zmir.", "A. The circumstances surrounding the death of Mrs Menek\u015fe \u015eent\u00fcrk", "6. On Saturday 11 March 2000, at about 10.30 a.m., Mrs Menek\u015fe \u015eent\u00fcrk, wife of Mehmet \u015eent\u00fcrk (\u201cthe first applicant\u201d) and mother of Bekir \u015eent\u00fcrk, who was then thirty-four weeks pregnant, went to the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka Public Hospital with her husband because she was experiencing pain. She was examined by a midwife, G.E., who decided that Mrs \u015eent\u00fcrk was not yet at the end of her term and that there was no point calling a duty doctor to examine her.", "7. The first applicant then drove his wife to the \u0130zmir Public Hospital Nevval Salih Alsancak \u0130\u015fg\u00f6ren (\u201cAlsancak Public Hospital\u201d), where they arrived between 11 and 11.30 a.m. Mrs \u015eent\u00fcrk was examined by a midwife, A.Y., who, noting that the applicant\u2019s wife was not yet at the end of her term and that there were no complications, did not call the duty gynaecologist for an examination.", "8. In view of his wife\u2019s continued pain, the first applicant drove her to the Atat\u00fcrk Research and Teaching Hospital, where they arrived at about 2 p.m. Mrs \u015eent\u00fcrk was examined by Dr F.B., an assistant doctor in the emergency department, then transferred to the urology department, where she was examined by Dr \u00d6.\u00c7., a urologist. He diagnosed renal colic, prescribed medication, decided to administer an analgesic and advised her to come back for a consultation after she had given birth.", "9. As his wife\u2019s pain did not lessen on returning home, the first applicant drove her that evening to the Ege University Medical Faculty Hospital. There, she was initially examined by Dr S.A.A., an emergency doctor, then transferred to the gynaecology and obstetrics department, where she was placed in the care of a team of doctors. After conducting an ultrasound scan, they established that the child she was carrying had died and that immediate surgery was necessary to remove the child. She was then informed that hospitalisation and surgery had to be paid for, and that a deposit of 600 or 700 million Turkish lira was to be paid into the hospital\u2019s operating fund. As the first applicant stated that he did not have the requested sum, his wife could not be hospitalised.", "The emergency doctor, Dr S.A.A., arranged for the first applicant\u2019s wife to be transferred to the \u0130zmir (Konak) Gynaecology and Obstetrics Hospital in a private ambulance in which no medical staff were present.", "10. Mrs \u015eent\u00fcrk died at about 11 p.m. while being transferred by ambulance.", "B. The investigation by the Ministry of Health", "11. Between 26 October and 23 November 2000, the investigation committee at the Ministry of Health conducted an investigation into the circumstances of Mrs \u015eent\u00fcrk\u2019s death, in the course of which the following persons were questioned: the first applicant, the individuals who had accompanied Mrs \u015eent\u00fcrk to the hospitals, the members of the medical teams (midwives and doctors) in the various hospitals to which the deceased woman had been taken, and the ambulance driver who had driven her to the \u0130zmir (Konak) Gynaecology and Obstetrics Hospital.", "12. On 30 October 2000 statements were taken, inter alia, from two midwives working at the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka district medical centre where Mrs \u015eent\u00fcrk was monitored throughout her pregnancy. Their witness statements indicated that Mrs \u015eent\u00fcrk had gone to the centre on 3 March 2000 for a check-up; the child\u2019s heartbeat had not been heard, as a result of which the midwives advised her to go to a hospital as soon as possible for an ultrasound scan.", "13. On 31 October 2000 a statement was taken from G.E., the midwife at Kar\u015f\u0131yaka Public Hospital who had examined Mrs \u015eent\u00fcrk. Evidence taken on that occasion indicates that she had heard the child\u2019s heartbeat and that the child was alive when she examined the mother. In this connection, she specified that she had listened to the child\u2019s heartbeat with a Doppler foetal monitor, so that it would have been impossible to miss the sound, as this machine provided information on the number of heartbeats per minute. Having decided that Mrs \u015eent\u00fcrk\u2019s condition was normal, she had not seen the point of carrying out an ultrasound or having her examined by the duty doctor.", "14. On 1 November 2000 a statement was taken from A.Y., midwife at the Alsancak Public Hospital, who stated that she had heard the child\u2019s heartbeat when examining the mother, that the child had been alive at that point and that, having found no complications, she had not requested the on-call duty gynaecologist.", "15. On 9 November 2000 statements were taken from T.K., S.A. and \u00d6.\u00d6., doctors in the gynaecology and obstetrics department at the Ege University Medical Faculty Hospital, who stated that they had informed the first applicant of the need to remove the child by Caesarean section. They denied having told the patient or her husband that they had to pay 600 or 700 million Turkish lira into the operating fund and said that they did not know who could have done so. They also claimed that they had explained the patient\u2019s situation to the duty specialist, S.\u00d6., who had not examined her but had seen her, and who had available to him all of the information on her case. Each of them also stated, in particular, that:", "\u201c... it was explained to the patient\u2019s husband that the baby was dead and that it was necessary to remove him or her by Caesarean section ... I never said to the patient that she had to pay 600-700 million Turkish lira into the operating fund for this surgery ... I don\u2019t know who said that ... The signature under the note [stating that] hospitalisation was not accepted is that of the patient Menek\u015fe \u015eent\u00fcrk ... I never said to the patient and her relative that if they did not pay into the operating fund ... we could not operate on her ... It was the patient herself who refused to be hospitalised, who said that she could not pay this sum and who signed the papers. Her husband took the patient away, saying that he could not accept this cost, that he refused hospitalisation and that he was going to take her to the Konak maternity unit ... My colleagues and I, as a team, explained ... to the husband that it was absolutely essential to remove the baby and that he should not take the patient away, but we were unable to persuade him ...\u201d", "In a statement taken on the same date, S.\u00d6., a gynaecology and obstetrics specialist at the Ege University Medical Faculty Hospital, who had been the duty doctor on the evening in question, said that he had been informed by T.K. about the patient\u2019s situation and had recommended that she be admitted to hospital. He also claimed not to have spoken with the patient\u2019s husband, not to have instructed him to make a contribution to the operating fund, and to have been informed by the team which had examined the patient that hospitalisation had been recommended but refused by her husband.", "16. On 23 November 2000 a committee of medical experts issued a report with the following conclusions:", "\u201c1. Nurse G.E. examined Menek\u015fe \u015eent\u00fcrk and stated that her condition did not necessitate calling the duty doctor. Although this should have been done, the nurse did not feel the need to do so. In such a case, the principle is that patients are to be examined by a specialist doctor, since a nurse does not have a [sufficient] level of knowledge to assess the seriousness of the situation. The nurse should call the specialist for every patient [who comes to the hospital].", "2. The midwife and nurse A.Y. did not have sufficient knowledge to make a diagnosis as to the patient\u2019s [condition]. She should have been examined by a specialist. In fact, for a correct diagnosis to be made, all patients who come to a polyclinic should be examined by a specialist.", "The duty doctor in the emergency department, F.B., ought to have asked for a KHD [Kad\u0131n Hastal\u0131klar\u0131 ve Do\u011fum \u2013 gynaecology and obstetrics] consultation. Only a doctor who examined the patient in this way would have been able to determine whether her symptoms at that time indicated a complication of pregnancy.", "The duty urologist, \u00d6.\u00c7., examined the patient from a purely urological perspective. However ... he ought to have conducted a general examination and asked for a KHD consultation. Only a doctor who examined the patient in this way would have been able to determine whether her symptoms at that time indicated a complication of pregnancy.", "3. In the light of the patient\u2019s clinical symptoms, the specialist duty doctors at the Ege University Medical Faculty Hospital ought to have insisted that she be hospitalised.", "4. The presence of medical staff in the ambulance would have made no difference to the outcome.", "In the light of the information available to date, the causes of death cannot be truly determined. [This will be possible] in a definite manner after the autopsy, the results of which will enable the [possible] liabilities for negligence of the above-mentioned members of staff to be established with certitude ...", "Causes of death: 1. Rupture of the uterus. 2. Embolism of the mesoderm. 3. Detached placenta. 4. Low probability of aggravated pre-eclampsia.\u201d", "17. On 24 November 2000, in the light of this expert report and the statements given by the various parties involved, the head inspector of the Ministry of Health drew up a report concluding that the midwives G.E. and A.Y., employed in the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka Public Hospital and the Alsancak Public Hospital respectively, had failed in the duties attached to their functions, in that they had sent the patient home in spite of her continuing pain and without having had her examined by a duty doctor. He also considered that doctors F.B. and \u00d6.\u00c7., employed at the Atat\u00fcrk Teaching and Research Hospital, had failed in the duties attached to their functions, in that they had not requested a consultation with a gynaecology and obstetrics specialist, nor indicated to the patient that she should seek such a consultation. Furthermore, the investigation concluded that a complaint report had been drawn up concerning the issue of the liability of T.K., H.V., S.A. and \u00d6.\u00d6., doctors in the gynaecology and obstetrics department at the Ege University Medical Faculty Hospital, so that it was not necessary to rule again in their respect. The head inspector reached the same conclusion as to the liability of the impugned ambulance company, and a separate report had been transmitted on this matter to the \u0130zmir Directorate of Health.", "The investigation report noted, however, that doctors T.K., H.V., S.A., and \u00d6.\u00d6. had failed in their obligations and thus caused, by their negligence, imprudence and lack of experience, the death of Mrs \u015eent\u00fcrk. Finally, the committee considered that Dr S.A.A. from the Ege University Medical Faculty Hospital had committed no error in transferring Mrs \u015eent\u00fcrk to the gynaecology and obstetrics department.", "The report on the findings of the investigation into the events which occurred at the Ege University Medical Faculty Hospital include the following points:", "\u201cAfter her examination in the emergency department ..., Menek\u015fe \u015eent\u00fcrk was transferred to the obstetrics department ... Menek\u015fe \u015eent\u00fcrk, who was 34 weeks pregnant, was examined by the duty team at the obstetrics department. During the ultrasound carried out by the duty team ..., the child\u2019s heartbeat was not heard and it was ascertained that he or she was dead ... The patient\u2019s relatives [were informed] that it was necessary to remove the child, for the sake of the mother\u2019s health ... However, as the patient\u2019s relatives had stated that they did not have the resources to pay hospital fees ... the duty team did not admit the patient to hospital and transferred her to the \u0130zmir gynaecology and obstetrics hospital in this condition, after obtaining her signature attesting that she was refusing hospitalisation ... Although by law they ought to have dealt with the procedures concerning costs [only] after admitting the patient to hospital, examining her, reaching a diagnosis and providing care [to the patient], it is understood that the doctors failed in their duty by transferring her without treatment, [although she] was in an emergency situation and suffering persistent pain, and thus caused her death.\u201d", "Various witness statements were cited in this investigation report. In particular, some of them read as follows:", "\u201cStatement by Mehmet \u015eent\u00fcrk: ... on Saturday 11 March 2000, at about 10 a.m., I drove my wife ..., who was eight months pregnant, to the emergency department at the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka Public Hospital because of the violent pain she was feeling. Our neighbour N.S. was with us ... My wife was examined at the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka Public Hospital ... they told me that they could not do anything, that the ultrasound machine was turned off ... [and] that it would be preferable that I drive [her] to the Alsancak Public Hospital ... I drove my wife to the emergency department at the Alsancak Public Hospital at about 11.15 a.m. There, the people in charge of the emergency department ... told me that they were short of staff and that the ultrasound machine was turned off ... the staff on duty then told me to take [her] to another hospital. On hearing that, I took my wife to the Atat\u00fcrk Ye\u015filyurt Teaching and Research Hospital ... It was about midday when I accompanied her to the obstetrics department ... The doctor told me to take her to the urology department ... I took her to the urology department. They asked for urological examinations and a renal USG test ... [My wife] waited three or four hours on a stretcher in the emergency department at Atat\u00fcrk Teaching and Research Hospital. Her pains had become even stronger. On seeing this, I went to see the head of the emergency department. I told him that my wife was feeling very unwell and I asked that she be examined by a doctor from the urology department ... the urologist examined her ... After examining her, he said: \u201cthere is still time before the birth, at the moment there is nothing we can do, tell the emergency department to give her painkillers and take her home\u201d, and he issued a prescription ... I said to the doctor that my wife was eight months pregnant and asked him whether the medicines were harmful. He said that it was not necessary to take them all the time, but only if the pain got worse ... Painkillers were administered, but I don\u2019t know what type ... the pain did not go away ... I took [my wife] back home ... it was about 6.30 p.m. when I took her home ... In the evening, at about 8.30 p.m., I saw that my wife\u2019s condition had worsened and, accompanied by \u00d6.A.G. ..., I drove her to the Ege University Hospital ... The doctor who examined my wife ... told me that the baby had died ... I told him to save my wife ... The doctor told me that I had to pay 600-700 million lira into the operating fund to have the baby removed from the mother by surgery ... I replied that I did not have that amount at that time, but to operate [on my wife] and I would sign a paper [undertaking] to pay. The doctor told me that I had to pay the money ... I asked him to tell me what to do ... They then told me to take her immediately to the Konak maternity hospital ... We called an ambulance ... I asked a woman who was present whether a nurse should accompany [my wife]. She replied \u201cthey haven\u2019t sent a nurse\u201d ... We started driving ... We arrived at the Konak Hospital ... the duty staff told me that my wife was dead ... My wife was not cared for with diligence in the hospitals I took her to. If at least an ultrasound had been carried out at the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka Public Hospital, the Alsancak Public Hospital or the Atat\u00fcrk Teaching and Research Hospital, and had I been told that the child was dead, then, given that it was still daytime, I could have got the money together for the operation and saved my wife. I was not informed that my wife had been examined on 3 March 2000 at the Bayrakl\u0131 medical clinic and that the child\u2019s heartbeat had not been heard ... A day or two before 3 March 2000, she told me that she had twisted her ankle on the last two steps of the staircase and had hit the banister ... but that she was not in pain and did not need to go to the doctor ...", "Statement by \u00d6.A.G.: ... we drove the patient to the emergency department at the Ege Hospital ... One of the doctors told me that her condition was serious. He said to go and pay 700 million lira into the operating fund ... I don\u2019t know the name of that doctor. It was about 10 p.m. at that stage. I had 150 million lira with me. I told the doctor that I had that amount, that I [could] pay it and [could] sign a paper for the remainder ... He said that this would not do, that he could not operate. I insisted that he operate. He refused again. I then asked what [we] should do ... He told us to take her to the Konak maternity hospital. At the same time, he asked us, under duress, to sign a document certifying that we were taking the patient out of hospital of our own free will ...", "Statement by Ahmet Y.: ... We took Menek\u015fe \u015eent\u00fcrk to the Ege University Hospital at about 9 p.m. They admitted us immediately to the emergency department. A woman doctor examined her ... she told us that the baby was dead ... The doctor told us that the baby had to be removed by emergency surgery ... The doctor said that we had to pay the hospital about 700 million [lira] for the operation. The patient\u2019s husband said that he could not pay the entire amount immediately, that he could pay some of it but would sign a paper and pay later. The doctor said to talk to the cashier\u2019s desk [vezne]. The people at the cashier\u2019s desk told us that we had to pay the entire amount. We then spoke again with the doctor who had examined the patient. We told her that we had not been able to pay all of the money and asked her what we should do. She told us to take the patient immediately to the Konak maternity hospital ...", "Statement by S.A.A.: ... Menek\u015fe \u015eent\u00fcrk came to the emergency department on 11 March 2000, complaining about stomach pains ... I met the patient ..., [and] carried out an examination ... I sent her to the gynaecology and obstetrics department. About half an hour after being examined in the obstetrics department, the patient came back to the emergency department ... The patient\u2019s husband told me that the obstetrics doctors had informed him that the baby was dead ... and that she had to be hospitalised. I asked why they had not hospitalised her instead of taking her back to the emergency department. The patient\u2019s husband told me that they had been asked to pay fees ... and as he could not pay that amount he wanted to take his wife to the Konak maternity hospital. At this point he was in a state of panic and emotional. I told him calmly that the baby had to be removed immediately from the mother\u2019s stomach, [that he had] to take her back and have the patient hospitalised immediately ... [so that] the child could be removed, otherwise the mother\u2019s life could be in danger ... In spite of what I said, the patient\u2019s husband wrote on the patient\u2019s examination form: \u201cIn spite of the doctor\u2019s advice, we have refused hospitalisation\u201d and signed it. I exerted no pressure ... to have this statement written ... The patient\u2019s husband told me that the doctors in the [gynaecology and obstetrics department] had told him that he had to pay a deposit, if my memory serves me correctly, of 400 million lira ...", "Statement by M.D., driver from the private ambulance company: ... at about 10.30 p.m. on 11 March 2000 I collected the patient from the obstetrics department and drove her to the emergency department. There, I told the head nurse, S.T., to assign a nurse for the ambulance. She said that that was impossible. Later, I asked the doctor in the emergency department which was transferring the patient if I could have a nurse for the ambulance. But she too said that it was impossible, that the baby was dead in the mother\u2019s stomach and that I had to drive her immediately to the Konak Hospital ... I put the patient in the ambulance ... The patient\u2019s husband got in beside her ... There was no nursing staff in the ambulance ... Before we put her in the ambulance, in front of the Ege Hospital emergency department ..., the patient told me not to take her away ... That must have been about 10.40 p.m. When we arrived at Konak ... I saw that the patient had died ... As I had explained [to her] ..., the reason that there was no nursing staff in our ambulance ... was because our duty nurse was occupied with the transfer of another patient ... The doctors and a nurse at the hospital told me that the patient had been dead on arrival. They told me that they had no morgue and that we ought to take her back to the Ege University morgue ...\u201d", "According to the statements as recorded, four doctors from the Ege University Medical Faculty Hospital, namely T.K., S.A., \u00d6.\u00d6. and S.\u00d6., denied having told the applicant or the deceased woman that they would have to pay a sum of money in order for the surgical procedure in question to be carried out.", "C. The criminal proceedings brought against the medical staff", "1. The proceedings against doctors T.K., H.V., S.A. and \u00d6.\u00d6.", "18. On 26 February 2001 the management of the Ege University medical faculty opened an investigation in respect of the doctors T.K., H.V., S.A. and \u00d6.\u00d6.", "19. On 10 September 2001 it decided that there were no grounds for bringing proceedings against those doctors.", "20. On 26 August 2002 a committee of investigation, composed of doctors, issued a report concluding that the doctors in question had not committed any error and that, accordingly, there were no grounds for bringing proceedings against them.", "21. On 24 October 2002, on the basis of Article 2 of the Convention, Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 17 of the Turkish Constitution, provisions which concern the right to life, the first applicant lodged an objection against that decision. He alleged, inter alia, that the committee ought to have verified the legislation in force and Ege University\u2019s practice in cases requiring emergency hospitalisation where hospital fees could not be paid.", "22. On 22 January 2003 the Supreme Administrative Court set aside the conclusions contained in the investigation report. It noted that the committee had not examined which criteria had to be met in hospitals in order to begin treating a patient whose life was in danger and whose condition required urgent medical intervention. It also noted that the committee had not asked for the investigation to be widened to include Dr S.\u00d6., gynaecology and obstetrics specialist at the Ege University Medical Faculty Hospital, who had been on duty on the night in question, in order to determine his responsibility with regard to the disputed events. It considered that those shortcomings should be addressed.", "23. On 23 January 2004, considering that there had been neither negligence nor carelessness on the part of the doctors in question, the investigation committee adopted a new report, concluding that there was no case to answer. It specified that the case file did not make it possible to determine what should be done in medical emergencies requiring hospitalisation where the corresponding fees were not paid.", "24. On 25 February 2004, relying on Article 2 of the Convention, Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 17 of the Constitution, provisions concerning the right to life, the first applicant again lodged an objection against those conclusions. He alleged, in particular, that the fact of not including S.\u00d6. in the investigation proceedings amounted to a failing in that investigation, and asked that Dr S.\u00d6. be included in the proceedings.", "25. On 14 April 2004 the Supreme Administrative Court sent the case back to the Ege University Rector\u2019s Office.", "26. On 16 May 2005 the investigation committee adopted a new report, which again concluded that there was no case to answer, in the absence of negligence or carelessness that was imputable to the doctors T.K., H.V., S.A., \u00d6.\u00d6. and S.\u00d6.", "27. On 13 June 2005 the first applicant submitted an appeal against those conclusions to the Supreme Administrative Court.", "28. On 27 September 2005 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld that appeal, considering that there was sufficient evidence that the accused doctors had committed the acts for which they were criticised. It based this finding on the report drawn up on 20 and 21 May 2004 by the General Medical Council (Y\u00fcksek Sa\u011fl\u0131k \u015euras\u0131, see paragraph 45 below), stating that the named doctors were four-eighths liable for Mrs \u015eent\u00fcrk\u2019s death. It therefore held that they should be subjected to criminal proceedings and transmitted the file to the prosecution service.", "29. On 17 November 2005 the \u0130zmir Criminal Court noted that the Supreme Administrative Court had transmitted the case to it directly in the absence of an indictment from the prosecution service, and consequently decided to discontinue the proceedings brought against T.K., H.V., S.A., \u00d6.\u00d6. and S.\u00d6., since the opening of proceedings was subject to the issue of an indictment.", "30. On 21 April 2006 the \u0130zmir public prosecutor issued an indictment against doctors T.K., H.V., S.A. and \u00d6.\u00d6., calling for their conviction for unintentional homicide (Article 455 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code).", "31. On 11 September 2006 the first applicant applied to intervene in the proceedings, a request which the \u0130zmir Criminal Court granted on the same date.", "2. The proceedings against the midwife G.E.", "32. By a decision of 1 March 2001, the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka District Governor authorised the opening of criminal proceedings against the midwife G.E. for breach of her professional duties.", "33. On 25 April 2001 the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka public prosecutor indicted the defendant for breach of her professional duties (Article 230 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code) and called for her conviction.", "34. On 23 October 2001 the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka Criminal Court acquitted the defendant on the ground that another midwife had also been on duty on the day of the events, and that it had not been established that it was the defendant who had examined the deceased and had sent her home without first calling for a specialist to examine her. The court added that, moreover, even supposing that the defendant was the midwife who had examined Mrs \u015eent\u00fcrk and sent her home, the breach in her duties had not been intentional, so that the constituent elements of the offence had not been made out.", "35. This judgment became final on 31 October 2001.", "36. On 14 June 2005, on the basis of the conclusions in the report by the General Medical Council finding that G.E. was two-eighths liable for his wife\u2019s death (see paragraph 45 below), the first applicant asked that the criminal proceedings against that midwife be reopened.", "37. On 12 October 2005 the first applicant applied to join the proceedings against G.E. as a civil party.", "38. On 9 March 2006 the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka Criminal Court granted the request for reopening of the proceedings and announced the joinder of this case and the proceedings pending before the \u0130zmir Criminal Court (see paragraphs 51 et seq. below). It also decided to submit to the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation the dispute as to jurisdiction between those two courts.", "39. On 12 June 2006 the Court of Cassation decided to join the criminal proceedings in question and named the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka Criminal Court as the court with jurisdiction for examining the remainder of the proceedings.", "3. The criminal proceedings against A.Y., F.B. and \u00d6.\u00c7.", "40. On 14 March 2001 the Governor of Konak authorised the opening of proceedings against the midwife A.Y. and the doctors F.B and \u00d6.\u00c7.", "41. On 12 October 2001 the \u0130zmir public prosecutor charged those individuals with breach of duty (Article 230 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code) and called for their conviction.", "42. On 12 April 2002 the first applicant asked to join the criminal proceedings before the \u0130zmir Criminal Court as a civil party.

On 1 February 2005 the court received the report by the General Medical Council and noted that the defendants\u2019 liability had been established, but not to the extent of eight-eighths.", "47.

On 4 July 2006 the first applicant asked the \u0130zmir Criminal Court to complete the proceedings as soon as possible. Relying on Article 6 of the Convention, he emphasised that the length of the proceedings breached his right to a fair hearing within a reasonable time. He also stressed that their continued duration raised the risk of statutory limitation and infringement of his right of property, given that he might find himself deprived of any possibility of obtaining compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage.", "51.

He further submitted a claim for compensation in respect of the damage caused to his client on account of his wife\u2019s death and claimed 60,000 Turkish lira (TRY) in respect of the non-pecuniary damage sustained by the first applicant and TRY 50,000 for the non-pecuniary damage sustained by the latter\u2019s son, together with a claim for TRY 30,000, jointly, in respect of pecuniary damage.", "53. At the close of the hearing of 8 May 2007 the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka Criminal Court noted that the indictment contained no mention of Dr S.\u00d6., although the latter\u2019s name had appeared alongside those of the defendants in the proceedings before the \u0130zmir Criminal Court. Consequently, it asked for clarification as to whether, after the decision terminating the proceedings (see paragraph 29 above), charges had been dropped against S.\u00d6. or whether there had been an error. It added that, in the latter case, the omission ought to be rectified.", "54.

In addition, all of the sentences were suspended. The court dismissed the request for conviction of defendant G.E., noting that, although the report by the General Medical Council had established that she was two-eighths liable, that circumstance did not amount to a ground for reopening the criminal proceedings against her under Article 314 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In consequence, it upheld her acquittal as pronounced at the close of the first criminal proceedings.", "The relevant part of the criminal court\u2019s reasoning reads as follows:", "\u201c...

In their pleadings they emphasised that the criminal court had not responded to the request, submitted on behalf of the applicant\u2019s son, to join the proceedings as a civil party, nor to the claim for compensation submitted by them. They also challenged G.E.\u2019s acquittal, given that her liability in the death had been established, and the fact that the prison terms imposed on the defendants had been suspended and commuted to fines. Furthermore, relying on Article 2 of the Convention, they alleged that there had been a breach of the right to life and that the State had failed in its positive obligations in this respect; they considered that the fact that the first applicant and his wife had been obliged to go from one hospital to another amounted to treatment contrary to Article 3. Relying on Articles 6 and 13, they complained about the length of the proceedings and the lack of any remedy to end the related damage. Finally, they submitted that the judgment had breached their right of property.", "59. On 21 January 2009 the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his observations and asked that court to uphold the first-instance judgment in so far as it concerned G.E., to set it aside in respect of the other defendants on the ground that the offence was time-barred, and to end the proceedings.", "60. On 7 October 2010 the Court of Cassation upheld the first-instance judgment in so far as it concerned G.E. It set aside the part of the judgment concerning the other defendants on the ground that the offence provided for in sections 102(4) and 104(2) of Law no. 765 had become time-barred.
