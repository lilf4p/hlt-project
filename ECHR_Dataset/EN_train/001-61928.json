{"ITEMID": "001-61928", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "RUS", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 2004, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF NIKITIN v. RUSSIA", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of P7-4;No violation of Art. 6-1", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["7. The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in St Petersburg.", "8. In February 1995 the applicant, a former naval officer, joined an environmental project conducted by Bellona, a Norwegian non-governmental organisation, to work on a report entitled \u201cThe Russian Northern Fleet \u2013 Sources of Radioactive Contamination\u201d (\u201cthe report\u201d).", "9. On 5 October 1995 Bellona\u2019s Murmansk office was searched by the Federal Security Service (\u0424\u0421\u0411 \u0420\u0424 \u2013 \u201cthe FSB\u201d). The FSB seized the draft report, interrogated the applicant and instituted criminal proceedings on suspicion of treason, since the draft report allegedly contained information, classified as officially secret, concerning accidents on Russian nuclear submarines.", "10. On 20 October 1998 the applicant\u2019s trial on a charge of treason through espionage and a charge of aggravated disclosure of an official secret began before St Petersburg City Court. After four days of hearings, the case was remitted for further investigation on 29 October 1998. The court considered that the indictment was vague, which impaired the applicant\u2019s defence and prevented the court from carrying out an examination on the merits. It also found that the investigation file left open the question whether the report contained any official secrets as such, and that it did not contain a \u201cproper and complete\u201d expert evaluation of possible public sources of the information in question or of the estimated damage. The court ordered the prosecution to conduct an additional expert examination into the possibility that the applicant had obtained the disputed information from public sources and to take other steps to complete the investigation.", "11. On 3 November 1998 the prosecution appealed against this decision, claiming that the case was clear enough for determination by a court and that there was no need for further investigation.", "12. On 4 February 1999 the order for further investigation was upheld by the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation (\u201cthe Supreme Court\u201d).", "13. On 23 November 1999 the St Petersburg City Court resumed the applicant\u2019s trial on the same charges.", "14. On 29 December 1999 the St Petersburg City Court acquitted the applicant on all the charges, having found that the applicant had been prosecuted on the basis of secret and retroactive decrees.", "15. The prosecution appealed.", "16. On 17 April 2000 the Supreme Court upheld the acquittal. The court found that the charges were based on secret and retroactive decrees which were incompatible with the Constitution. The acquittal thus became final.", "17. On 30 May 2000 the Procurator General filed a request with the Presidium of the Supreme Court to review the case in supervisory proceedings (\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0441\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440, \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0443). He challenged the judgment on the grounds of wrongful application of the law governing official secrets, the vagueness of the indictment \u2013 which had led to procedural prejudice against the applicant \u2013 and other defects in the criminal investigation, in particular the lack of an expert report as to whether the disputed information had originated from public sources. He called for a reassessment of the applicable law and of the facts and evidence in the case file, and for the case\u2019s remittal for fresh investigation.", "18. On 13 September 2000 the Presidium of the Supreme Court dismissed the Procurator General\u2019s request and upheld the acquittal. While it acknowledged that the investigation had been tainted with flaws and shortcomings, it found that the prosecution could not rely on them in calling for a remittal, as it had been entirely within the prosecution\u2019s control to redress them at an earlier stage in the proceedings. Moreover, the Presidium pointed out that the investigation authority had earlier been required to remedy exactly the same defects as those relied on in the request to quash the acquittal. It observed that on 29 October 1998 the court had expressly instructed the investigating authority, inter alia, to conduct a study of information in the public domain in order to ascertain whether the applicant could have obtained the disputed data from public sources.", "19. On 17 July 2002 the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation examined the applicant\u2019s challenge to the laws which allowed supervisory review of a final acquittal.", "20. In its ruling of the same date, the Constitutional Court declared incompatible with the Constitution the legislative provisions permitting the re-examination and quashing of an acquittal on the grounds of a prejudicial or incomplete investigation or court hearing or on the ground of inaccurate assessment of the facts of the case, save in cases where new evidence had emerged or there had been a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings.", "21. The Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment stated, inter alia:", "\u201c... Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention provides that the right not to be tried or punished twice does not prevent the reopening of the case in accordance with the law and criminal procedure of the State concerned, if there is evidence of new or newly discovered facts, or if there has been a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings, which could affect the outcome of the case.", "It follows ... that, subject to the above requirements, the national legislation may provide for a system by which a case may be reopened and a final judgment be quashed, and may specify where, depending on the case, a procedure for reopening on the grounds of new or newly discovered evidence or a supervisory review should apply.", "Any exemption from the general prohibition on resuming proceedings to the detriment of the acquitted or convicted person may be justified only in exceptional circumstances, where a failure to rectify a miscarriage of justice would undermine the very essence of justice and the purpose of a verdict as a judicial act and would upset the required balance between the constitutionally protected values involved, including the rights and legitimate interests of convicted persons and those of the victims of crime. In the absence of any possibility of reversing a final judgment resulting from proceedings tainted by a fundamental defect that was crucial for the outcome of the case, an erroneous judgment of this type would continue to have effect notwithstanding the principle of general fairness ... and the principle of judicial protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.", "3.2. Under the [Constitution and the Convention] any possibility provided for at national level of quashing a final judgment and reviewing a criminal case must be subject to strict conditions and criteria clearly defining the grounds for such review, given that the judgment concerned is already binding and determinative of the individual\u2019s guilt and sentence.", "However, the grounds for review of final judgments provided for in the Code of Criminal Procedure [of 1960] go beyond these limits. When establishing a procedure for the review of final convictions and, especially, acquittals ... definite grounds should have been formulated to ensure that such a procedure would be implemented with sufficient distinctness, precision and clarity to exclude its arbitrary application by the courts. In failing to do so, [the legislature] misapplied the criteria which derive from [the Constitution] and Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention for the quashing of final judgments in criminal cases ...", "Furthermore, [the power] of a supervisory instance to remit a case for fresh investigation where it concludes, through its own assessment of evidence, that the previous investigation has been prejudicial or incomplete, is incompatible with the constitutional principles of criminal procedure and with the Constitutional Court\u2019s jurisprudence, in that it gives the prosecution an unfair advantage by providing it with additional opportunities to establish guilt even after the relevant judgment has become operative. It follows that a court of supervisory instance cannot quash a final acquittal only on the ground of its being unfounded ... Accordingly, the prosecutor is not entitled to request the supervisory review of such a judgment on the ground that it is unfounded ...\u201d", "22. Section VI, Chapter 30, of the 1960 Code of Criminal Procedure (\u0423\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e-\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441 \u0420\u0421\u0424\u0421\u0420) in force at the material time allowed certain officials to challenge a judgment which had become effective and to have the case reviewed on points of law and procedure. The supervisory review procedure (Articles 371-83 of the Code) is distinct from proceedings in which a case is reviewed in the light of newly established facts (Articles 384-90). However, similar rules apply to both procedures (Article 388).", "23. Under the terms of Article 356 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a judgment takes effect and is enforceable from the date on which the appeal court renders its decision or, if no appeal has been lodged, once the time-limit for appeal has expired.", "\u201cThe grounds for quashing or varying a judgment [on supervisory review] are the same as [those for setting aside judgments (which have not taken effect) on appeal] ...\u201d", "\u201cThe grounds for quashing or varying a judgment on appeal are as follows:", "(i) prejudicial or incomplete investigation or pre-trial or court examination;", "(ii) inconsistency between the facts of the case and the conclusions reached by the court;", "(iii) a grave violation of procedural law;", "(iv) misapplication of [substantive] law;", "(v) discrepancy between the sentence and the seriousness of the offence or the convicted person\u2019s personality.\u201d", "\u201cJudgments, decisions and rulings which have become effective may be set aside on account of newly discovered circumstances.", "The grounds for reopening a criminal case are as follows:", "(i) with regard to a judgment which has become effective, the establishment of false witness testimony or false expert opinion; forgery of evidence, investigation records, court records or other documents; or an indisputably erroneous translation which has entailed the pronouncement of an unfounded or unlawful judgment;", "(ii) with regard to a judgment which has become effective, the establishment of criminal abuse of their powers by judges when examining the case;", "(iii) with regard to a judgment which has become effective, the establishment of criminal abuse of their powers by investigation officers dealing with the case, where this has entailed the pronouncement of an unfounded or unlawful judgment or a decision to terminate the prosecution;", "(iv) other circumstances, unknown to the court at the time when the case was examined, which, alone or combined with other previously established facts, prove a convicted person\u2019s innocence or the commission by him or her of an offence which is more or less serious than that of which he or she was convicted, or which prove the guilt of a person who was acquitted or whose prosecution was terminated.\u201d", "24. Article 371 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provided that the power to lodge a request for a supervisory review could be exercised by the Procurator General, the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation or their respective deputies in relation to any judgment other than those of the Presidium of the Supreme Court, and by the presidents of the regional courts in respect of any judgment of a regional or subordinate court. A party to criminal or civil proceedings could solicit the intervention of those officials for a review.", "25. Article 373 of the Code of Criminal Procedure set a limitation period of one year during which a request calling for the supervisory review of an acquittal could be brought by an authorised official. The period ran from the date on which the acquittal took effect.", "26. Under Articles 374, 378 and 380 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a request for supervisory review was to be considered by the judicial board (the Presidium) of the competent court. The court could examine the case on the merits and was not bound by the scope and grounds of the request for supervisory review.", "27. The Presidium could dismiss or grant the request. If it dismissed the request, the earlier judgment remained in force. If it granted the request, the Presidium could decide to quash the judgment and terminate the criminal proceedings, to remit the case for a new investigation, to order a fresh court examination at any instance, to uphold a first-instance judgment reversed on appeal, or to vary or uphold any of the earlier judgments.", "28. Article 380 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 provided that the Presidium could, in the same proceedings, reduce a sentence or amend the legal classification of a conviction or sentence to the defendant\u2019s advantage. If it found a sentence or legal classification to be too lenient, it was obliged to remit the case for a new examination.", "29. On 1 July 2002 a new Code of Criminal Procedure came into force. Under Article 405, the application of supervisory review is limited to those cases where it does not involve changes that would be detrimental to the convicted person. Acquittals and decisions to discontinue the proceedings may not be the subject of a supervisory review.", "30. On 19 January 2000, at the 694th meeting of the Ministers\u2019 Deputies, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted Recommendation No. R (2000) 2 on the re-examination or reopening of certain cases at domestic level following judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. The recommendation encouraged the Contracting Parties to examine their national legal systems with a view to ensuring that there existed adequate possibilities to re-examine the case, including the reopening of proceedings, in instances where the Court had found a violation of the Convention."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
