The applicant is a German national, born in 1938 and living in Mettmann.", "9. In a letter of 30 December 1985 addressed to the Rheinprovinz Pension Office (Landesversicherungsanstalt), the applicant and her husband, born in 1927, declared that for the purposes of entitlement to a widow\u2019s or a widower\u2019s pension the statutory rules still in force should continue to apply in future (see below, \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201d).", "10. On 4 March 1986, following her husband\u2019s death, the applicant applied with the Rheinprovinz Insurance Office for the payment of a survivor\u2019s pension.", "11. On 10 June 1986 the Insurance Office issued a decision granting the applicant a survivor\u2019s pension as from 1 March 1986. The Office, referring to the relevant provision of the Workers\u2019 Pension (Reform) Act, further stated that in case that the person concerned had other earned income or income in lieu of earned income, the payment of the survivor\u2019s pension was not suspended during the first year after the spouse\u2019s death. During the second year, the survivor\u2019s pension was reduced by a specific percentage in relation to a dynamic exonerated amount.", "12. On 20 June 1986 the applicant lodged an administrative complaint (Widerspruch) with the Pensions Office, which was dismissed on 24 March 1987.", "13. By submissions dated 27 April 1987, the applicant, represented by counsel, instituted proceedings with the D\u00fcsseldorf Social Court, challenging the above decisions issued by the Rheinprovinz Pension Office. She maintained in particular that the underlying legislation, especially the age-limit for opting out of the new system, was unconstitutional, i.e. in breach of the right to property. In this respect, the applicant noted that, according to information provided by the Federal Ministry for Labour and Social Matters, a constitutional complaint concerning the above issue was pending before the Federal Constitutional Court. She suggested that the proceedings before the Social Court be suspended to await the outcome of the said constitutional complaint proceedings. With her action, the applicant also objected to the calculation of the pension in question.", "14. On 24 June 1987 the D\u00fcsseldorf Social Court suspended the proceedings pursuant to Section 251 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung - see below, Relevant domestic law).", "15. On 14 August 1987 the Rheinprovinz Pensions Office reassessed the applicant\u2019s survivor\u2019s pension. Taking her other income into account, the Office suspended the monthly payment of DEM 967.10.", "16. By submissions of 10 September 1987, the applicant filed an action with the D\u00fcsseldorf Social Court against the decision of 14 August 1987. She again suggested that the proceedings be suspended pending constitutional complaint proceedings in a similar case. The second set of proceedings was, thereupon, also suspended.", "17. On 26 February 1993 the applicant requested the Social Court to resume the suspended proceedings. She noted that in the meantime the Federal Constitutional Court had not taken any decisions concerning the legal provision at issue in her case. On 17 March 1993 the Social Court informed the applicant that the proceedings had been resumed.", "18. On 22 July 1993 the Social Court inquired with the Federal Constitutional Court about the state of the constitutional complaint proceedings concerning certain aspects of the reform of the rules governing a survivor\u2019s pension. On 5 August 1993 the Federal Constitutional Court informed the Social Court that two proceedings had terminated in 1987 and that it envisaged rendering a decision in three further cases in 1994.", "19. On 17 September 1993 the Social Court held an oral hearing. Following discussion, the parties agreed to a further suspension of the proceedings.", "20. On 5 June 1996 the applicant requested the Social Court to resume the proceedings. She submitted that, having regard to the length of the proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court and considering her age, she could no longer be expected to wait. On 18 June 1996 the Social Court informed the applicant that the proceedings had been resumed. On 5 February 1998 the Social Court inquired again with the Federal Constitutional Court about the state of proceedings before it.", "21. On 18 February 1998 the Federal Constitutional Court dismissed two constitutional complaints. It found that the rules introduced by the Survivor\u2019s Pension and Educational Periods Act, in so far as they provided for a suspension of the payment of the survivor\u2019s pension in case of other earned income or income in lieu of earned income, were compatible with the Basic Law (Grundgesetz).", "22. On 7 May 1998 the Social Court forwarded the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s decision to the applicant\u2019s counsel and requested him for comments. After a reminder, the applicant\u2019s counsel asked for an extension of the time limit. After a further reminder, the applicant\u2019s counsel informed the Social Court on 13 October 1998 that he was no longer representing the applicant.", "23. On 17 March 1999 the Social Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 actions. It found in particular that in 1987 the Federal Constitutional Court had declared the age-limit of 50 years compatible with the Basic Law. It held that the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s decisions of 1998 had no impact on its decision, as they did not concern the issues raised in the applicant\u2019s action.", "24. Before 1 January 1986 men and women had to meet different conditions for entitlement to a widow\u2019s or a widower\u2019s pension, respectively. While a widow was generally entitled to a widow\u2019s pension, a widower could only obtain payment of a widower\u2019s pension if his late wife had mainly provided for the family\u2019s maintenance. In March 1975 the Federal Constitutional Court had held that, having regard to changes in the role of women in marriage and family and the labour market, the existing rules fixing different conditions for entitlement to a widow\u2019s or a widower\u2019s pension had to be replaced by legislation avoiding discrimination.", "25. On 1 January 1986 the Survivor\u2019s Pension and Educational Periods Act (Hinterbliebenenrenten- und Erziehungszeiten-Gesetz) of 11 July 1985, amending the relevant provisions of the Employees\u2019 Pension Act (Angestelltenversicherungsgesetz), the Reich Insurance Act (Reichsversicherungsordnung) and the Reich Miners\u2019 Act (Reichsknappschaftsgesetz), entered into force. The Reich Insurance Act, applying to workers, and the Employees\u2019 Pension Act, applying to employees, together with the reform legislation, namely the Workers\u2019 Pension (Reform) Act (Arbeiterrentenversicherungs-Neuregelungsgesetz) and the Employees\u2019 Pension (Reform) Act (Angestelltenversicherungs-Neuregelungsgesetz), formed the basis of the general old age insurance system (gesetzliche Rentenversicherung der Arbeiter und Angestellten). A widow is entitled to a survivor\u2019s pension after the death of her insured husband, and a widower is entitled to a survivor\u2019s pension after the death of his insured wife. Moreover, pursuant to the new legislation, a survivor\u2019s earned income or income in lieu of earned income is taken into account. According to the explanatory report, the latter rule was justified on account of the maintenance function of a survivor\u2019s pension (60% of the spouses\u2019 last income). The reform only concerned pension cases having occurred as from 1 January 1986. Furthermore, for a transitional period until 31 December 1988, spouses could opt for the old regime if they had been married before 1 January 1986 and if they were both older than 50 years at that time. Subsequent reform legislation, including a uniform pension regime for workers and employees, did not affect the substance of the above legislation concerning a survivor\u2019s pension.", "26. According to Section 251 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a court suspends proceedings upon the request of the parties if such a suspension appears reasonable on account of settlement negotiations or for other important reasons."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
