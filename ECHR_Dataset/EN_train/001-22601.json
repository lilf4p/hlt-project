In January 1997 he lodged with the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Regional Court an application contesting the Municipal Council\u2019s decision of 19 July 1994 concerning the levying of local taxes and duties and the decision of 17 October 1996 regarding the placement of outside advertisements in the Municipality of Chi\u015fin\u0103u, the presidential decree of 10 May 1995 appointing the mayor and certain provisions of i) the law of 27 December 1994 concerning the date of local elections and the extension of the mandate of the councillors of local councils, ii) the law of 7 December 1994 concerning the local elections, iii) the law of 7 December 1994 concerning the local public administration, iv) the law of 19 April 1995 concerning the status of the Municipality of Chi\u015fin\u0103u and v) the law of 19 April 1995 concerning the status of a councillor in a local council. He alleged that the contested legal provisions contravened the Constitution and ratified international instruments and that the unlawfully conducted municipal elections of 1995 precluded him from freely exercising his right to participate in the administration of local public affairs. On 23 January 1997 the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Regional Court dismissed as unfounded the application on the ground that his right to participate in the administration of local public affairs as a former councillor had not been interfered with as a result of the municipal elections and of the impugned acts. The applicant appealed against this decision, submitting that the Regional Court had erroneously applied the material law and incorrectly dismissed his application. On 14 October 1997 the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal as unfounded referring to the reasoning of the Regional Court. The applicant appealed against this decision, arguing that the inferior courts had disregarded the relevant provisions of the Constitution and ratified international instruments on human rights. On 17 December 1997 the Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision of 14 October 1997 and sent the case back for re-examination to the same court. On 8 April 1998 the Court of Appeal dismissed as unfounded the applicant\u2019s appeal against the decision of the Regional Court of 23 January 1997 and upheld the latter decision.", "The applicant lodged an appeal against this decision, arguing that the Court of Appeal had erroneously applied procedural law and disregarded the relevant provisions of the Constitution and ratified international instruments on human rights. On 15 July 1998 the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal after having found that the Court of Appeal had conducted the proceedings in accordance with applicable procedural rules having due regard to the relevant provisions of the Constitution and ratified international instruments on human rights. On 16 September 1998 the Supreme Court dismissed as unfounded the applicant\u2019s petition for annulment against of decision.", "In 1997 the applicant contested before the Court of Appeal an official letter signed and addressed to him by a judge of the Constitutional Court, explaining that the court lacked jurisdiction insofar as it concerned individual and collective petitions lodged by citizens directly with the Constitutional Court. He argued that the said letter and the refusal of a judge of the Constitutional Court to examine his application had infringed his constitutional right to have direct access to the Constitutional Court. On 19 August 1997 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint on the ground of its lack of jurisdiction, observing that jurisdiction in the matter lay with the competent district court. The applicant appealed against this decision, submitting that the Court of Appeal had erroneously applied procedural law and incorrectly dismissed the application. On 8 October 1997 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s initial application relying on the fact that the contested letter could not be classified as an administrative act and that therefore the courts lacked jurisdiction as regards the infringement of the applicant\u2019s rights he had complained of.", "In 1998 the applicant contested before the Court of Appeal the actions and omissions of judges of Constitutional Court who had rejected his numerous complaints and letters in which he had challenged the constitutionality of certain legislative provisions and administrative decisions. He complained that the contested acts and omissions contravened the Constitution and ratified international instruments on human rights. On 9 April 1998 the Court of Appeal dismissed the application on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction as regards the infringements of the applicant\u2019s rights he had complained of. The applicant lodged an appeal against this decision. On 22 July 1998 the Supreme Court, relying on the same grounds as those stated in the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision, dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal. On 3 September 1998 the Supreme Court dismissed as unfounded the applicant\u2019s petition for annulment of this decision.", "In 1997 the applicant contested before the Court of Appeal the presidential decree of 9 August 1994 appointing the mayor of Chi\u015fin\u0103u and the presidential decree of 10 May 1995 appointing the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Municipal Council, alleging that the contested decrees contravened the Constitution and ratified international instruments on human rights and precluded him from freely exercising his right to vote and to be elected to the Municipal Council and to participate in the administration of local public affairs. On 3 September 1997 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint on the ground of its lack of jurisdiction as regarded the alleged unconstitutionality of the above acts, observing that jurisdiction in the matter lay with the Constitutional Court. The applicant appealed against this decision, arguing that the Court of Appeal had failed to examine all the complaints contained in his application. On 22 October 1997 the Supreme Court, referring to the Court of Appeal\u2019s reasoning, dismissed the appeal as unfounded.", "Also in 1997 the applicant contested before the Court of Appeal the provisions of i) Article 140 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution, ii) the law of 13 December 1994 concerning the Constitutional Court, iii) the Code of constitutional jurisdiction of 28 September 1995 and iv) six administrative acts of the Parliament and its divisions. He alleged that the contested legal norms contravened the Constitution and ratified international instruments on human rights and precluded him from freely exercising his right to vote and to be elected to the Municipal Council and to participate in the administration of local public affairs. On 5 September 1997 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint on the ground of its lack of jurisdiction as regarded the alleged unconstitutionality of the above acts, observing that jurisdiction in the matter lay with the Constitutional Court. The applicant appealed against this decision, arguing that the Court of Appeal had failed to examine all the complaints contained in his application. On 22 October 1997 the Supreme Court quashed the decision of the Court of Appeal of 5 September 1997 and sent the case back for re-examination to the same court. On 6 January 1998 the Court of Appeal dismissed the initial application on the ground of its lack of jurisdiction, observing that the jurisdiction in the matter concerning the constitutionality of the challenged acts lay with the Constitutional Court, while the competence concerning the electoral disputes lay with competent district court. On 3 June 1998 the Supreme Court, relying on the same grounds as those stated in the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision of 6 January 1998, dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal against the above decision.", "In 1998 the applicant contested before the Supreme Court eleven decisions of the Central Electoral Commission concerning the preparation and carrying out of the electoral campaign for the parliamentary elections of 1998 and the manner in which the Central Electoral Commission had applied certain provisions of the Electoral Code. He argued that the contested acts and the manner in which they were applied contravened the relevant provisions of the Constitution and ratified international instruments on human rights and infringed his right to vote and to stand for the parliamentary elections. In particular, he complained that the threshold of 4% of the votes cast established for all candidates placed the independent candidates in a disadvantageous position as against other candidates (e.g. political parties, blocks etc.). On 19 March 1998 the Supreme Court dismissed the application on the ground that all the contested decisions had been adopted in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Constitution and Electoral Code. In the same decision, the court ruled that it had had due regard to the relevant provisions of the ratified international instruments on human rights and that the applicant had failed to adduce prima facie evidence to prove that the contested acts had interfered with his right to vote and to stand for the parliamentary elections of 1998 and dismissed as unfounded his complaint concerning the difference in treatment of the candidates. The applicant appealed against this decision, arguing that the Supreme Court had erroneously applied the Electoral Code and the rules of civil procedure, and had disregarded relevant provisions of the international instruments on human rights incorporated in the domestic legal order. On 21 March 1998 the enlarged panel of the Supreme Court, relying on the same grounds as those stated in its decision of 19 March 1998, dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal.", "In 1998 the applicant lodged with the Court of Appeal an application against the Government, Chancellery of State and eleven ministries requesting the annulment of a joint decision of 21 May 1998 of the Ministry of Economy and Ministry of Finance imposing the levying of compulsory fees as a condition for exercising certain entrepreneurial activities. In the same application, he argued that the decision contravened the Constitution and ratified international instruments on human rights and sought compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage caused to him as a result of the decision. On 7 April 1999 the Court of Appeal discontinued the proceedings on the ground of lack of jurisdiction in respect of the alleged unconstitutionality of the above decision, observing that jurisdiction lay with the Constitutional Court.", "The applicant appealed against this decision, submitting that the court had erroneously applied procedural law and incorrectly discontinued the proceedings. On 16 July 1999 the Supreme Court quashed the judgment and sent the case back for re-examination to the Court of Appeal on the ground that the applicant had failed to exhaust extra-judicial proceedings by contesting the decision before the administrative authority which had adopted the decision. On 26 October 1999 the Court of Appeal dismissed the initial application as inadmissible on the ground that, in the meantime, the above administrative decision had been declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court and had been subsequently repealed by another administrative decision. The applicant lodged an appeal against this decision, arguing that his appeal had been dismissed as a result of the erroneous interpretation and application of the applicable provisions of civil procedure. On 23 February 2000 the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, relying on the same grounds as those stated in the judgment of the Court of Appeal of 26 October 1999. On 5 April 2000 the Supreme Court dismissed as unfounded the applicant\u2019s petition for annulment of this decision.", "Article 1 provides that the Republic of Moldova is governed by the rule of law, where the dignity of people, their rights and freedoms, the open development of human personality, justice and political pluralism represent supreme values, which shall be guaranteed.", "Under Article 2, national sovereignty resides with the people of the Republic of Moldova, who shall exercise it directly and through its representative bodies in the ways provided for by the Constitution.", "With regard to the human rights and freedoms, Article 4 states that the constitutional provisions for human rights and freedoms shall be understood and implemented in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and with other conventions and treaties endorsed by the Republic of Moldova.
