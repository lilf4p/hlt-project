The Supreme Court considered that the lower courts had made errors in their judgments and had examined superficially the facts and evidence.", "12. The County Court held some thirty hearings in the case, at steady intervals of approximately one month. About six hearings were postponed because defence counsel was absent or asked for more time to prepare the defence. The other hearings were mainly postponed because of errors in the summonsing procedure or absence of the civil parties.", "On 20 April 2006 the applicant was again convicted by the County Court and sentenced to eight years, two months and thirteen days' imprisonment.

He hired counsel and on several occasions objected to the measures taken by the liquidators.", "18. On 8 December 2000 the Bucharest County Court allowed the creditor's request and started the insolvency proceedings. The company's representative was present at the hearing.
