At the same time he applied for the appointment of a lawyer to act on his behalf, for a waiver of court fees and for the exclusion of the District Court judges from the case due to their lack of impartiality.", "Due to the applicant\u2019s modifications of his initial action the case was referred to the \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem Regional Court, subsequently the applicant challenged the impartiality of the Regional Court\u2019s judges.", "On 11 September 2000 the \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem Regional Court refused the applicant\u2019s request for the waiver of court fees and for the appointment of the lawyer. On 27 February 2001 the Prague High Court upheld this decision.", "In July 2001 the applicant lodged further submissions and the Regional Court discontinued proceedings as he had not paid the court fees.", "On 5 February 2002 the Regional Court quashed this decision as the applicant had paid the court fees in the meantime.", "On 1 August 2002 the Regional Court appointed a lawyer on the applicant\u2019s behalf as his financial standing had deteriorated.", "On 21 July 2003 the High Court rejected the applicant\u2019s challenge of the impartiality of the Regional Court\u2019s judges for the most part and excluded one judge from the proceedings for different reasons than the ones raised by the applicant.", "On 15 July 2004 the High Court admitted the applicant\u2019s new objection as to the impartiality of the Regional Court judges and referred the case to the Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 Regional Court which in February 2005 granted the applicant\u2019s request to modify the action and to extend it to the Ministry of Justice.", "On 26 April 2005 the applicant requested the court to examine the case-files from other proceedings as supplementary evidence.", "The hearing was fixed for 30 January 2007, however, it was adjourned owing to the applicant\u2019s health problems.

The court found that in the absence of any judgment, it would be difficult to assess the complexity of the proceedings. Further, it considered that the applicant had contributed to the length of the proceedings by not having paid the court fees in due time, by unclear claims and by applying for extensions of the action to other parties. Besides, the proceedings were affected by the applicant\u2019s health and his procedural requests, which could however not be invoked to the applicant\u2019s detriment.", "The applicant appealed and challenged the impartiality of judges of the Prague Municipal Court and the Prague High Court; these objections were dismissed by the directly superior courts including the Supreme Court.", "On 10 March 2010 (served on 10 April 2010) the Prague Municipal Court upheld the judgment, finding that the proceedings were primarily affected by the applicant\u2019s failure to conform to the procedural rules and by his procedural requests.

In February and April 2003 the District Court invited him to provide the necessary information justifying the request.", "On 22 April 2003, 8 December 2003 and 2 February 2004 the applicant challenged the impartiality of different judges.", "On 15 March 2004 the District Court refused not to charge the applicant the court fees.

On 13 April 2006 the District Court rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal against this decision for the same reasons.", "On 14 July 2006 the High Court decided on the impartiality of the Regional Court judges.", "On 6 October 2006 the Regional Court upheld the District Court decision of 13 April 2006, which became final on 24 September 2008.", "On 27 November 2007 the applicant claimed compensation for non-pecuniary damage arising from the excessive length of the above proceedings.", "As the Ministry of Justice did not deal with the applicant\u2019s request within the six-month statutory time-limit, he brought a civil action for damages against the Ministry on 10 July 2008. He specified the non-pecuniary damage allegedly suffered at CZK 600,000 (EUR 25,570).", "On 15 September 2008 the Ministry of Justice acknowledged that the proceedings were unreasonably lengthy and awarded the applicant CZK 56,000 (EUR 2,337) for non-pecuniary damage.", "On 30 January 2009 the Prague 2 District Court, referring to the case-law of the Court, dismissed the action. It reiterated that out of thirteen and half years long proceedings, the delays in years 1996 \u2013 2002 were attributable to the first-instance court, otherwise the proceedings had been smooth. The court found that the complexity of the proceedings had been difficult to estimate as not a single hearing had been held. Further, it considered that the importance of the proceedings for the applicant had been low given that he had not attempted to accelerate them during the six years pause and that they had been discontinued eventually as he had not paid the court fees.", "On 21 January 2010 (served on 12 May 2010) the Prague Municipal Court upheld the judgment, considering that from the District Court\u2019s perspective the proceedings had been finished in 1996, the applicant having not duly notified his new address and having not been interested in the proceedings for six years. Under these circumstances and with regard to the low importance of the proceedings for him, the just satisfaction awarded had been appropriate.", "The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the allegedly excessive length of judicial proceedings are set out in the Court\u2019s decision in the case of Vokurka v. the Czech Republic (no. 40552/02 (dec.), \u00a7\u00a7 11-24, 16 October 2007)."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
