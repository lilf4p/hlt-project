Pietrzak, a lawyer practising in Warszawa.", "2.", "3. On 12 April 2006 a seventeenyearold Belgian teenager was murdered at the Brussels Central train station. Two individuals, who attempted to steal his MP3 player, stabbed him five times causing his death.", "4. The applicant, who had been identified by surveillance cameras as one of the attackers, at that time also seventeen years old, fled Belgium and was arrested in Poland on 27 April 2006. A European arrest warrant (the EAW) was issued against the applicant by the Belgian authorities.", "5. On 31 May 2006 the Warsaw Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) decided to agree to the applicant\u2019s surrender to Belgium on the basis of the EAW provided that after the trial he would be returned to Poland in order to serve his sentence. The decision was upheld on 25 July 2006 by the Warsaw Court of Appeal.", "6. The applicant was transferred to Belgium on 2 August 2006.", "7. On 5 June 2008 the applicant was convicted by the first-instance court in Brussels of armed robbery resulting in death and sentenced to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment.", "8. On 23 September 2008 the judgment was upheld by the Brussels Assize Court.", "9. The Belgian authorities informed the Polish authorities that the applicant\u2019s sentence would come to an end on 28 January 2027 and that he could apply for conditional release as of 2 October 2013.", "10. On 21 April 2010 the applicant was transferred to Poland for the purpose of continuing his imprisonment.", "11. On 6 May 2010 the Warsaw Regional Court gave a ruling on the legal qualification of the offence under Polish law and on the enforcement of the sentence. It considered that the offences of which the applicant had been convicted in Belgium fulfilled the description of offences prohibited by Articles 280 \u00a7 2 and 156 \u00a7 3 of the Polish Criminal Code. The court further considered that it was bound by the sentence imposed abroad, although twenty years\u2019 imprisonment did not appear in the range of penalties possible under Polish law. Finally, the court decided not to rule on the matter of conditional release as the Belgian judgment did not include a provision on the length of the sentence the applicant would have to serve before he was eligible to apply for conditional release. Therefore, Polish rules on enforcement of sentences would apply to the case.", "12. The applicant appealed against the judgment. He complained in particular about the decision not to apply regulations pertaining to conditional release that were binding in the sentencing country, Belgium.", "13. On 6 July 2010 the Warsaw Court of Appeal upheld the judgment. The court considered that matters of conditional release related to enforcement of the sentence and thus should not be dealt with at the instant stage. The Court of Appeal reiterated that the sentencing judgment did not contain a provision regulating the date on which the applicant was eligible to apply for conditional release. Moreover, according to both Belgian and Polish law, conditional release was facultative and depended on a positive criminological prognosis of the prisoner and his behaviour during the serving of the sentence. Conditional release should not be considered as a right automatically acquired if the conditions provided by law were fulfilled. The judgment is final.", "14.

If in the situation described above the person is sentenced to a penalty of deprivation of liberty ... the provisions of Article 607s \u00a73-5 shall apply.\u201d", "17.
