It found that her late father, who was the applicant's brother, with the knowledge of the previous owner of the house, had invested a considerable amount of money for its refurbishment and, thereby, he had acquired a title to part of the house in accordance with the relevant provision of the Law on Property. On 9 September 1992 the Skopje County Court upheld the above judgment.", "On 15 April 1993 the Supreme Court quashed the lower courts' judgments. It referred the case back for re-examination to the Skopje Municipal Court and instructed it to order an expert valuation whereby the value of Ms D.'s father's investment would be determined in a precise manner.", "On 11 April 1996 the experts submitted their report. They concluded that Ms D.'s late father's investment represented 71% of the value of the relevant part of the house after its refurbishment.", "At the hearing of 7 May 1997 several witnesses appeared before the Skopje Municipal Court.", "On 12 May 1997 the applicant made written submissions to the court.

He complained, inter alia, that the lower court assessed the evidence wrongly and refused to appoint new experts.", "On 29 June 2000 the Skopje Appellate Court rejected the applicant's appeal. It held, inter alia, that the expert report covered all the important issues, that on the applicant's request an additional expert report had been prepared and that the report was corroborated with other evidence.", "The applicant received the judgment on 15 August 2000."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
