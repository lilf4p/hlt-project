POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["7. On 15 April 1997 the applicant company filed a claim against the Best-Sat company in the Bielsko-Bia\u0142a District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy). The value of the claim was PLN 246,969.86. The claim resulted from Best-Sat\u2019s refusal to pay the applicant company\u2019s invoice issued on 8 October 1995 for the construction of a TV cable network, in accordance with the contract concluded between the parties. The applicant company requested that its claim be considered in a summary procedure (post\u0119powanie nakazowe).", "8. On 24 April 1997 the District Court decided that the case should be considered in the ordinary procedure as it did not fulfil the legal conditions for the summary procedure. On 14 May 1997 the applicant company filed with the Bielsko-Bia\u0142a District Court an interlocutory appeal (za\u017calenie) against the decision of 24 April 1997. Subsequently, the court ordered the applicant company to pay a court fee of PLN 2,789.60 for the consideration of its interlocutory appeal. On 10 June 1997 the applicant filed with the Bielsko-Bia\u0142a District Court an application for an exemption from that fee. However, on 21 July 1997 the District Court dismissed that application. The applicant filed another, apparently unsuccessful, interlocutory appeal against the decision of 21 July 1997, claiming that the company was on the brink of insolvency as a result of its enforceable claims not having been satisfied by the Best-Sat company.", "9. On an unspecified later date, the case was transmitted to the Bielsko-Bia\u0142a Regional Court (S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki) in order to be considered in the ordinary proceedings. On 3 February 1998 the Regional Court ordered the applicant company to pay a court fee of PLN 13,948.49 for lodging its claim.", "10. On 17 February 1998 the applicant company filed with the Bielsko-Bia\u0142a Regional Court an application for an exemption from the fee, pursuant to section 113 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It stated that the amount of the fee was considerably beyond its means. It also submitted that, for the first 10 months of 1997, it had made net profits of only PLN 7,695.37, while the company\u2019s assets amounted to PLN 31,366.98, but consisted mostly of claims to be satisfied.", "11. The applicant company stressed that it had no possibility to dispose of its assets promptly in order to secure funds to pay the court fee and, even if that were possible, it would lead to the winding up of the company. It further argued that the lack of funds to pay the court fee did not result from any fault in its activities or from a negligent failure to secure funds for the litigation. It also maintained that its claim resulted from work done over the past few years which had dominated the activities of the company. Consequently, it did not have other possibilities to secure sufficient funds from other contracts.", "12. On 2 March 1998 the Regional Court ordered the applicant company to produce a number of documents concerning its financial situation. The relevant documents were submitted to the court as enclosures to a letter of 16 March 1998. In the same letter the applicant supplemented its application for exemption from the court fees. It stated that it had three enforceable claims, including two against the Best-Sat Company which were the subject of the pending litigation. The third claim, although enforceable as of 25 November 1997, had not been satisfied. The applicant company stated that its fixed assets of PLN 11,670.90 were necessary to continue the running of its business and, if disposed of, the company would have to be wound up. The plaintiff also submitted that in 1997 it had made net profits of PLN 2,723.19, which were used to set off the losses made in 1995 and 1996.", "13. On 25 May 1998 the Bielsko-Bia\u0142a Regional Court rejected the application. The court gave the following reasons for its decision:", "\u201cAt the request of the court, the plaintiff has submitted its balance sheets as of 30 November 1997 and of 30 March 1998, as well as a bank statement regarding its accounts as of 17 March 1998. In the court\u2019s view the above documents prove unequivocally that the plaintiff makes profits from its business, as evidenced by the balance on its bank accounts for the period between December 1997 and March 1998. It should also be pointed out that the plaintiff has gross profits (przych\u00f3d) from its business activity estimated at PLN 26,322.95, including gross profits from the sale of goods and materials in the amount of PLN 2,365.81.", "Furthermore, according to the balance sheet of 3 March 1998, the plaintiff company has significant fixed assets (maj\u0105tek trwa\u0142y) in the amount of PLN 7,192.67, and current assets (maj\u0105tek obrotowy) in the amount of PLN 31,067.97.", "The examination of the above documents leads to the conclusion that the plaintiff can afford to pay the court fees because it has sufficient funds.", "It should also be pointed out that, in case of a lack of such funds, the plaintiff could obtain them by means of partners\u2019 surcharges (dop\u0142aty) since it is a limited liability company.", "All the other expenses of the plaintiff should be treated by it on equal terms with the expenses which are necessary to pursue its claims...\u201d", "14. On 4 June 1998 the applicant company filed an interlocutory appeal against the decision of 25 May 1998 with the Katowice Court of Appeal. It submitted that the District Court had made a mistake in calculating the amounts of fixed and current assets because the figures relied on were from 1 January 1997, but the value of the assets had decreased since then. As of 31 January 1998 the amount of fixed and current assets was estimated at PLN 5,019.27 and PLN 18,494.77 respectively. The applicant company argued that the combined value of all its assets only slightly exceeded the amount of the court fee, and that, if the latter had to be paid in that amount, the company would be forced to wind up.", "15. The applicant company further pointed out that the fixed assets consisted of office equipment which was necessary to run the business, whereas its current assets consisted mostly of reserves of materials necessary to provide services to clients and claims which were the subject of separate litigation. Thus, even assuming that the value of current assets exceeded the amount of the court fee, it could not be presumed that the former could be disposed of in order to provide the funds necessary to pay that fee.", "16. The applicant company also contested the Regional Court\u2019s view that all expenses should be treated equally, and pointed out that any surplus would be used to pay taxes since failure to do so could result in prosecution. Finally, the applicant observed that the unpaid invoice which gave rise to the present claim related to work done by the applicant company over a period of two years, which had dominated the applicant\u2019s business during that period. That was, to a large extent, the reason why the applicant company had been unable to secure funds for possible litigation expenses. Lastly, the applicant company, in principle, agreed with the Regional Court\u2019s view as to the possibility of obtaining additional funds by means of partners\u2019 surcharges. However, relying on section 113 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, it stressed that a legal person was entitled to exemption from court fees if it proved that it did not have sufficient funds.", "17. On 31 July 1998 the Katowice Court of Appeal rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal as follows:", "\u201cAccording to the plaintiff\u2019s documents, its financial situation deteriorated only in 1998. However, it emerges from the documents produced in support of the statement of claim that the plaintiff\u2019s claim results from work done between 1993 and 1995, since the notice to pay for that work is dated 16 January 1995. From that it unequivocally follows that the plaintiff could have secured the funds necessary for the pursuance of its claims prior to 1996 when its financial situation deteriorated, and when, as it transpires from its balance sheets, its assets and gross profits from the sale of goods and materials had been at the level which had been referred to in the contested decision.", "The Court of Appeal also does not subscribe to the plaintiff\u2019s view that, if at the current moment the plaintiff does not have sufficient funds to pay the court fee, then it can successfully request to be exempted ... under section 113 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure.", "As follows from the established case-law of the Supreme Court, and also the case-law of this Court of Appeal, the possibilities of paying the court fees by a legal person should be assessed in the larger context not only of the funds currently held but also those that could possibly have been secured. When the plaintiff holds a current bank account, where its turnover is recorded, and that turnover still in December 1997 was of significant volume, then there are no reasons to assume that the plaintiff could not take out the necessary loan in order to obtain the funds needed to pursue claims of the very significant value of PLN 246,969.86. Obviously, interest will be charged on such a loan, but there are no grounds to hold that the cost of such a loan should be borne by the taxpayers, which would happen if exemption from court fees was granted...", "The Court of Appeal also fully shares the Regional Court\u2019s argument that, since the plaintiff is a limited liability company, the obligation of the partners to make appropriate surcharges in order to secure funds to cover expenses related to the assertion of claims should be taken into consideration...\u201d", "18. The applicant company did not pay the required court fee. On an unspecified later date, the Bielsko-Bia\u0142a Regional Court ordered that the applicant company\u2019s statement of claim be returned to it, which meant that its claim was of no legal effect.", "19. According to the applicant company\u2019s tax return for 1997, in that year it made net profits of PLN 4,484.70.", "20. Under Polish law every plaintiff is obliged to pay a court fee at the time of lodging a statement of claim with a court. As the case proceeds, either party is obliged to pay further court fees at the time of lodging any appeal, unless granted exemption from such fees.", "Court fees are based on a percentage (if a fee is due for lodging a claim or an appeal) or a fraction (if a fee is due for lodging an interlocutory appeal) of the value of the claim in question. The court fees incurred by either party can, depending on the outcome of the litigation, be finally repaid by the losing party (who, in principle, is ordered to pay all the costs of litigation in a final judgment).", "21. There are, however, categories of litigants who are exempted from court fees by virtue of statutory provisions. Some of those categories are listed in Article 111 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure. That provision, in the version applicable at the relevant time, exempted from court fees a party lodging a paternity action, a party seeking maintenance, a prosecutor, a court-appointed guardian and \u201cany party exempted from court fees by the competent court\u201d (that is to say, a party who had been granted an exemption under Article 113 of the Code, cited below).", "22. The other categories of exempted litigants are listed in, inter alia, sections 8 and 9 of the Law of 13 June 1967 on Court Fees in Civil Cases (Ustawa o kosztach s\u0105dowych w sprawach cywilnych). Under section 8 of the Law, the State Treasury, municipalities and other public organs or institutions are not obliged to pay court fees, provided that the claim in question does not relate to their business activities.", "23. In the case of a successful outcome of litigation initiated by a person exempted from court fees, the fees which would normally have been collected from that person for lodging and proceeding with the claim are awarded to the State Treasury against the opponent.", "24. The Law of 13 June 1967 on Court Fees in Civil Cases (as amended) sets out general principles with respect to the collection of fees by courts. Section 5(1) of the Law, in the version applicable at the material time, stipulated:", "\u201cUnless otherwise provided by the law, a party who has submitted to a court a pleading which is subject to court fees, shall pay such fees.\u201d", "25. The relevant part of section 16 of the Law, in the version applicable at the material time, provided as follows:", "\u201c1. The court shall not take any action if the court fee due for lodging a given pleading is not paid. In such a case the president of the court shall order the party concerned to pay the fee due within a period not exceeding seven days, on pain of having the pleading returned. If the party does not comply with the time-limit, the pleading shall be returned to this party.", "...", "3. Any appeal, cassation appeal, interlocutory appeal or objection to a judgment by default ... shall be rejected if the court fee due is not paid within the [above] time-limit.\u201d", "26. Section 18 provided:", "\u201cA pleading which has been returned to a party as a result of the fact that the court fee had not been paid, shall be of no legal effect.\u201d", "27. Exemption from the payment of court fees was (and still is) a matter for the discretion of the court competent to deal with the case. According to Section 112 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the competent court may grant partial exemption from the fees.", "Article 113 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in the version applicable at the material time, stipulated:", "\u201cAn individual may ask the competent court dealing with the case to grant him an exemption from court fees provided that he submits a declaration to the effect that the fees required would entail a substantial reduction in his and his family\u2019s standard of living. Such a declaration shall contain details concerning his family, assets and income. It falls within the court\u2019s discretion to assess whether or not the declaration satisfies the requirements for granting the exemption requested.\u201d", "28. The grounds for exempting legal persons, companies and business enterprises from court fees were, however, formulated in a different way from the grounds applying to natural persons. Paragraph 2 of Article 113 of the Code of Civil Procedure in the version applicable at the relevant time read:", "\u201cA legal person, or an entity not possessing legal personality, which has demonstrated that it does not have sufficient financial means for court fees, may be granted an exemption from those fees.\u201d", "29. Article 116 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides:", "\u201cIn case of doubt ... as to the real financial situation of the party requesting exemption from court fees, the court may order a verification of [his/her] declaration.\u201d", "30. Article 116 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads:", "\u201cThe court shall refuse to grant a party [to the proceedings] exemption from court fees if [his/her]claim or defence are of a manifestly ill-founded character.\u201d", "31. The relevant part of Article 120 \u00a7 1 of the Code, in the version applicable at the material time, stated:", "\u201cThe court shall revoke an exemption from court fees or legal assistance granted if the basis therefor did not exist or has ceased to exist. In either instance, the party concerned shall pay all court and/or legal fees due in the case...\u201d", "32. Fees collected by courts do not constitute, nor are they equivalent to, security for costs. The court fees are transferred by financial departments of the courts to the State Treasury and are deemed to be part of its income.", "33. On 11 January 1995 the Supreme Court (S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy) gave a decision in which it referred for the first time to the \u201cright to a court\u201d guaranteed under Article 6 \u00a7 1 in the context of the requirement to pay court fees for lodging a claim or appeal (decision no. III ARN 75/95, published in OSN Zb. U. 1995, no. 9).", "That ruling concerned an extraordinary appeal lodged by the First President of the Supreme Court with the Supreme Court. The appeal was directed against a decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, refusing to exempt a claimant in administrative proceedings from payment of court fees. The Supreme Court held as follows:", "\u201c1. From the date on which Poland became a member of the Council of Europe, the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg may and should be taken into account in interpreting Polish law.", "2. If the subject matter of a case is the party\u2019s application for substantial financial assistance from the public authorities, particular diligence should be displayed in considering [that party\u2019s] parallel application for an exemption from court fees. [Any decision] rejecting such an application should give relevant and particularly cogent reasons so as not to amount to an actual denial of the right to a court (as secured by Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights) ...\u201d", "Although the relevant decision related to court fees for lodging an appeal with the Supreme Administrative Court by a person who had requested financial assistance from the public authorities, it has been applied mutatis mutandis to civil cases."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
