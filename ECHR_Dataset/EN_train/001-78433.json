The applicant was born in 1947 and lives in Ko\u0161ice. He is a selfemployed entrepreneur. In that capacity he had dealings with a private company S. which included arranging insurance for its vehicles.", "5. On 6 August 1993 S. brought a civil action against the applicant in the Ko\u0161ice II District Court (then Obvodn\u00fd s\u00fad, at present Okresn\u00fd s\u00fad) claiming a sum of money in connection with their previous business.", "6. On 11 August 1993 the Ko\u0161ice II District Court found that the action fell within the jurisdiction of the Ko\u0161ice I District Court and decided to transmit the case to the latter.", "7. On 10 December 1993 the Ko\u0161ice II District Court quashed its above decision of 11 August 1993 on the ground that, according to up-to-date information, the defendant\u2019s business was within its judicial district. The case thus remained with the Ko\u0161ice II District Court.", "8. On 19 August and 24 October 1994 the District Court requested the defendant to pay court fees and to specify its claim for legal costs. The defendant replied on 30 September and 19 December 1994, respectively.", "9. On 28 December 1994, in summary proceedings, the District Court issued a payment order (platobn\u00fd rozkaz) against the applicant for the amount claimed.", "10. On 19 January 1995 the applicant successfully appealed (protest). The order was ex lege vacated and the matter fell to be determined in ordinary proceedings.", "11. On 16 June and 25 October 1995 the District Court requested the applicant to pay court fees for his appeal. The applicant replied that he could not pay as he had no money, but he eventually paid on 9 February 1996.", "12. The District Court held hearings on 24 January and 30 May 1997. Both hearings were adjourned, the former due to the absence of the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer, the latter at the plaintiff\u2019s request since he wished to explore the possibility of settling the case out-of-court.", "13. On 26 February 1998 the applicant counterclaimed that the defendant owed him money and sought an order for repayment.", "14. Another hearing was scheduled for 17 March 1998 but did not take place because the judge was absent for health reasons.", "15. On 9 June 1999 the Ko\u0161ice Regional Court (Krajsk\u00fd s\u00fad) declared the plaintiff company insolvent and appointed a receiver. As a result, by operation of Article 14 \u00a7 1 (d) of the Bankruptcy Code (Law no. 328/1991 Coll., as amended), all actions by and against the plaintiff were automatically stayed. However, under that provision, actions by the insolvent entity could resume if their defendants so required.", "16. In a letter of 16 June 1999 the District Court informed the applicant that the proceedings had been stayed.", "17. The proceedings are still stayed.", "18.

At the meeting the creditors approved a summary of the insolvency estate and the proposal for its sale. The Regional Court subsequently held a hearing (prieskumn\u00e9 pojedn\u00e1vanie) with a view to establishing the claims of the different creditors in the insolvency proceedings. At the hearing, which the applicant did not attend, the receiver rejected his claim. It was decided that the applicant and other creditors whose claims had been rejected and who had been absent would be informed in writing that they could seek judicial recognition of their claims by way of a separate action (inciden\u010dn\u00e1 \u017ealoba) under Article 23 \u00a7 2 of the Bankruptcy Code.", "22. In a letter of 27 February 2002 the Regional Court informed the applicant of the above possibility. The applicant then brought proceedings for recognition of his claim. They are described in detail below.", "23. The receiver subsequently held 21 rounds of sales of items belonging to the estate. The sales were supervised by the Regional Court.", "24. On 9 March 2005 the receiver filed a report with the Regional Court on the progress of the proceedings. He stated inter alia that it had not been possible to conclude the proceedings thus far because the estate was involved in 9 other court proceedings which were all still pending.", "25. The insolvency proceedings are still pending.", "26. On 12 March 2002 the applicant responded to the Regional Court\u2019s above letter of 27 February 2002.

On 19 February 2003 the Constitutional Court declared the complaint inadmissible. In line with its established practice it held that, as the proceedings had been lawfully stayed for a legitimate reason (the insolvency), no unjustified delays could be imputed to the Ko\u0161ice II District Court at that time. The part of the proceedings before the District Court before they had been stayed could not be reviewed because they had been stayed outside the statutory two-month time-limit for lodging a constitutional complaint. It was noted that the applicant had not complained of delays in the insolvency proceedings which were pending before the Regional Court.", "As regards any delays in the proceedings which might have occurred prior to the decision of 16 June 1999 to stay the proceedings in the Ko\u0161ice II District Court, the applicant had filed his constitutional complaint after the expiry of the statutory two-month time-limit."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
