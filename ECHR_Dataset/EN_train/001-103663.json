On 22 February 2002 the Cherkassy Court granted the request of the applicant\u2019s defence counsel to cross-examine the witnesses in the criminal proceedings who lived in the Russian Federation. The court noted that some witnesses had confirmed their statements by cable and stated that they could not travel to Cherkassy for financial reasons. The court ruled that it was necessary to examine the witnesses either in Ukraine or at their place of residence by a local judicial authority with jurisdiction under the Minsk Convention. Taking into account lack of sufficient funds for travel and accommodation for the witnesses from the city of Yakutsk in the city of Cherkassy, the court opted for the international legal assistance mechanism and ordered that the appropriate Russian authorities be requested to conduct a judicial examination of the witnesses in the Russian Federation. The records of that examination would be used by the Cherkassy Court as evidence in the criminal case against the applicant.

The court also made a separate ruling noting the unlawfulness and irregularities of certain periods of the applicant\u2019s detention and lack of cooperation of the Ukrainian authorities responsible for international legal assistance.", "24.

On 18 November 2003 the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Cherkassy Court. In its decision, it stated that the applicant and his representatives had been aware of the difficulty of obtaining the attendance of witnesses from Russia and had agreed to and supported the proposal to send a request to a Russian court to have the witnesses questioned in that country, but that they had not showed any interest in attending the questioning, which they had had the right to do.
