The applicant was born in 1951 and, at the time of lodging her application, lived in Nizip, Gaziantep, Turkey. She now lives in Paris, having apparently been granted asylum in France. The applicant stated that she made the application not only on her own behalf but also on behalf of her daughter and deceased husband. The case concerns the applicant\u2019s allegations that her husband, Mehmet \u015een, was abducted, tortured and killed by members of the security forces.", "9. The facts surrounding the death of Mehmet \u015een, are in dispute between the parties.", "10. The facts as presented by the applicant are set out in Part A below. The facts presented by the Government are contained in Part B. The witness evidence taken by Delegates of the Commission at a hearing in Ankara is summarised in Part C. The summary of the other evidence submitted by the parties, in documentary form, which the Court considers relevant is to be found in Part D.", "11. The applicant\u2019s husband, Mehmet \u015een, was a Turkish national of Kurdish origin. He was an active member of the Democracy Party (the \u201cDEP\u201d Party) in Turkey until it withdrew from local elections. He had been the Party\u2019s candidate for the post of the Mayor of Ayran (Birecik, \u015eanl\u0131 Urfa) in the 1994 local elections.", "12. Throughout his involvement with the DEP, Mehmet \u015een was followed and threatened by plain-clothed police and this continued after the withdrawal of his candidacy. On 25 March 1994 Mehmet \u015een informed the applicant that he was not being followed by the usual plain-clothed policemen but by other people whom he said might be \u201chit-men\u201d.", "13. On 26 March 1994 at approximately 5 p.m., two plain-clothed policemen had a drink at the \u00c7a\u011fda\u015f caf\u00e9 in Birecik, which was owned by Mehmet \u015een and Rasim A\u011fpak. At approximately 7 p.m., a Do\u011fan SLX car (registration number 34 PLT 30) blocked the door of the caf\u00e9. Three plain-clothed persons entered, leaving the car engine running with a fourth person remaining in the vehicle. One of the three persons asked Rasim A\u011fpak whether he was Mehmet \u015een. When he answered negatively, the person approached Mehmet \u015een, who confirmed his identity and showed his identity card. Before the nine people in the caf\u00e9, the abductors stated that they were plain-clothed police who were there to take Mehmet \u015een to the Security Directorate. Mehmet \u015een was grabbed by the arms and taken away in the waiting car. It was later ascertained that a second car with four persons inside had left with the Do\u011fan SLX vehicle.", "14. Upon hearing the news of the abduction, the applicant contacted, inter alia:", "(a) the Nizip Anti-Terrorism Department, who denied holding Mehmet \u015een or any knowledge of the abduction;", "(b) the Gaziantep Security Directorate who also denied all knowledge; and", "(c) the Gaziantep Branch of the Human Rights Association, with a request that they look into the matter.", "15. Other persons also contacted the Gaziantep Security Directorate on the applicant\u2019s behalf, but were told that Mehmet \u015een was not in custody.", "16. On 28 March 1994 the applicant applied to the Nizip Prosecution by way of petition, reporting that Mehmet \u015een had been abducted.", "17. On 30 March 1994 an unknown person telephoned the \u201c\u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem\u201d newspaper and the Gaziantep Branch of the DEP, saying that Mehmet \u015een\u2019s body was at the Gaziantep State Hospital. The applicant went to the hospital and, on examining the corpse, concluded that her husband had been killed under torture. She saw the body with the right eye gouged out, the right side of the head crushed to pieces, a broken right arm, broken fingers, marks of blows to the body, and a bullet wound to the head and one to the neck, with no traces of blood, implying that the shots had been fired after death.", "18. An autopsy report concluded that there was a bullet wound to the left side of the chest, a bullet wound above the right eyebrow, fired at almost point blank range, exiting the body from the back of the head, a bullet wound to the left cheek, fired at a distance of 95 cm, which had travelled through the body and lodged in the rib cage, that there were no other wounds, blows to the body or head, and that death had been caused by the bullet to the head.", "19. On 31 March 1994 the applicant and the DEP Member of Parliament for Siirt, Naif G\u00fcne\u015f, met the representative of the Governor of Gaziantep. The Gaziantep Security Director and the Provincial Gendarmes Commander were also present. The Gendarmes Commander said that the body of Mehmet \u015een had been found by a shepherd near the village of Karpuzkaya in the \u015eehit Kamil District of Gaziantep, and that the gendarmes had collected the body. The State Prosecutor, Naci Ayaz, gave the applicant the same information. He also stated that the body had had no identity card on it, and therefore the autopsy report was headed \u201cunidentified body\u201d.", "20. However, the applicant was informed that a person at the hospital had witnessed four plain-clothed policemen take Mehmet \u015een\u2019s body to the hospital morgue on the night of 29 March 1994.", "21. On 13 April 1994 the Gaziantep Branch of the Human Rights Association, on behalf of the applicant, made an application to the Governor of Gaziantep and the State Prosecution. On 22 April 1994, the Governor replied that it had not been possible to determine any suspect or suspects but that the inquiries were continuing. The State Prosecution also indicated that the inquiry into the death was continuing.", "22. The applicant was not satisfied with the inquiries and the answers she had been given. The official information she had received was allegedly inconsistent with her own. She therefore continued contacting the State for answers. She was informed on 26 May 1994 by the State Prosecutor that there had been no developments.", "23. According to the statements of Osman \u00d6zer, Durmu\u015f Kaplan, Maksut Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, Rasim A\u011fpak and Abit \u015eahin, who had been present when Mr \u015een was abducted on 26 March 1994, three people entered the caf\u00e9 where Mehmet \u015een was playing cards. One of them asked where he could find Mr \u015een. When Mehmet \u015een presented himself, he was asked to show his identity card. Then the person in question came closer to Mr \u015een and showed him a card, the details of which the witnesses could not see. Osman \u00d6zer and Maksut Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m also stated that the persons who came into the caf\u00e9 had not openly presented themselves as plain-clothed policemen, so they could not say for certain that they were. Rasim A\u011fpak stated that Mehmet \u015een had not asked any questions or resisted the abductors. It was as if he had known them.", "24. On 29 March 1994 Mehmet \u015een\u2019s body was found near the quarry of Karpuzkaya on the Kahramanmara\u015f-Gaziantep highway construction site. On the same day an autopsy was carried out. The autopsy report concluded that death had resulted from a fractured skull, the destruction of the cellular tissues of the brain and an internal haemorrhage due to a bullet wound. There were no signs of assault or torture.", "25. The Nizip Public Prosecutor started an investigation into the killing of Mehmet \u015een. On 18 May 1994 a decision of non-jurisdiction was issued and the file was sent to the Gaziantep Public Prosecutor. According to the preliminary findings, Mehmet \u015een had not been taken into custody by the security forces. The car in which he was driven away carried a false registration number. The investigation was still pending in June 1996.", "26. The facts of the case being in dispute between the parties, three Delegates of the Commission took evidence in Ankara between 16 and 18 June 1998. The applicant appeared before the Delegates, as did ten other witnesses for one or other party. Certain other witnesses had been summoned but failed to appear. The evidence of those who attended the hearing may be summarised as follows:", "27. Mrs \u015een was born in 1951 and had been married to Mehmet \u015een since 1971. She had been a teacher and he ran the \u00c7a\u011fda\u015f coffee house in Nizip, owned by his brother. He had had no personal enemies or debts. Nor had he been involved in any vendetta.", "28. Mr \u015een became politically active around 1991, helping to create the HEP Party and the DEP Party in 1992. The DEP withdrew from the 1994 local elections due to the intimidation of its members (threats, detention and murders).", "29. Her husband had been a leading member of DEP and, when he stood as a candidate for the post of the Mayor of Ayran in early 1994, he was threatened by the Gendarmes Station Commander of that constituency (who may have been called Sergeant-Major Orhan), and regularly picked up by the police for questioning. He was so intimidated that he resorted to carrying a licensed gun and rarely went out alone. He was taken to the police station many times and harassed. He sold the gun eventually as he was detained several times at night with a view to ascertaining whether the gun had been involved in incidents. However, this was just part of the harassment to which he was subjected.", "30. Two days before he was abducted, Mr \u015een told his wife that he was being followed by hit-men, men who were not his previous surveillance officers. He had been alerted to this possibility by an acquaintance who had been detained and interrogated about Mr \u015een, and about whom the interrogators had said that Mr \u015een would be \u201cdone away with\u201d. Some seven people had been killed in the recent past by unknown perpetrators because of their DEP affiliation and/or membership of the Kurdistan National Assembly. These hit men were not recognised by Mr \u015een, who had known most of the local policemen. They were of medium height and able-bodied, carrying radios and guns. Mrs \u015een had understood her husband to mean that they were contra-guerrillas operating under State authority, as confirmed in the later Susurluk report.", "31. On 16 March 1994 Mrs \u015een was informed of her husband\u2019s abduction 5 minutes after its occurrence by Osman \u00d6zer, one of the caf\u00e9\u2019s employees. Mr \u00d6zer told her that two strangers had been in the caf\u00e9 for tea. They seemed tense, made a telephone call and left. Then a Do\u011fan SLX car (registration number 34 PLT 30) stopped in front of the caf\u00e9, blocking the door. Of the four unknown people in the vehicle, one stayed in the driver\u2019s seat with the engine running, another, carrying a gun and a radio, waited at the door. That man was well dressed and middle-aged. Two others, casually dressed, strong looking and with apparent special training, walked towards Rasim A\u011fpak, who looked rather like Mr \u015een, and then moved on to Mr \u015een, who identified himself. The two flashed identity cards at the people in the caf\u00e9. The armed man at the door spoke into his radio, \u201cOK, Sir, we\u2019ve got him\u201d, and then said to Mr \u015een, \u201cYou\u2019re coming with us to police headquarters. We have business with you.\u201d Mr \u015een tried to ask questions but was dragged towards the door by the two men, holding him under his armpits. He was put in the back of the car, which drove off immediately. Despite the shock and panic of the people in the caf\u00e9, they managed to note down the registration number of the car.", "32. These matters were discussed over and over again in the following days with Osman \u00d6zer, Rasim A\u011fpak, Maksut Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m and Durmu\u015f Kaplan because Mrs \u015een wanted to learn as much as possible about the details of the incident. It was during such discussions with others that she learnt that another car, with four other plain-clothed people in it, drove off behind the first. She had not talked to Abit \u015eahin, who had also witnessed the events, as she did not know him.", "33. The people in the caf\u00e9 had said that the abductors had been policemen because of the gun, the radio, the identity cards they had shown everyone and what they had said. However, the caf\u00e9 witnesses were taken from their homes in the ensuing days, at 2 o\u2019clock in the morning, for interrogation, and statements were demanded of them. This had intimidated them.", "34. Immediately after Mr \u00d6zer\u2019s call, Mrs \u015een called the Nizip Police Headquarters and the Anti-Terrorism Department. They said that they had not taken him into custody and had no information about him. They confirmed that they would investigate. She tried contacting the Mayor, a Member of Parliament, a delegation from Switzerland and DEP members, for them to make inquiries about her husband\u2019s fate.", "35. Mrs \u015een\u2019s inquiries with the Urfa, Gaziantep and Birecik Police proved fruitless. Travelling had been difficult at the time because of roadblocks and identity checks, through which only the security forces could pass easily. She nevertheless went to Adana after she had been told by a lawyer called \u00c7a\u011fatay \u00d6zaslan that the car number plate was a forged one used by the Adana Police. The Public Prosecutor there was not helpful. He referred to a DEP Member of Parliament who had been killed and added, \u201cWhat can I tell you? What can I do?\u201d She was advised to go home and wait.", "36. She then met a DEP member called M\u00fcsk\u00fcn Kurucu who told her that the Gaziantep branch of the DEP had telephoned to say that she should return home immediately. On her arrival, she was told that the body of her husband was in the morgue at the State hospital. The Gaziantep DEP and the newspaper \u201c\u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem\u201d had been telephoned by a well-spoken Turkish lady who had provided this information. Mr \u015een\u2019s relatives were called and Mrs \u015een met her sister-in-law and father-in-law at the hospital, where a crowd had gathered, cordoned off by the police.", "37. Mrs \u015een was not informed of the circumstances surrounding the recovery of the body. Subsequently, the Public Prosecutor of Gaziantep, Mr Naci Ayaz, informed her that the body had been found by the gendarmerie in the rural area of Karpuzkaya, in the \u015eehit Kamil District of Gaziantep. The body was unidentifiable, as it had no personal belongings or identity card on it, until the inner pocket of the suit, which the corpse was wearing, was ripped open to disclose Mr \u015een\u2019s name, written by his tailor on the lining. However, Mrs \u015een said that the suit had not been tailor-made, but had been a ready-to-wear purchase from a shop. She did not recall the gendarmes mentioning this matter to her. She therefore insisted on further information as to how her husband\u2019s body had been identified. She was told that her husband\u2019s belongings were to be kept for the investigation. A ring and watch were returned to her father-in-law in the autumn of that year.", "38. The sight of her husband\u2019s body was horrible: the right side of his head had been smashed; his right eye was not in place; his right hand fingers and arm appeared broken, and there was a hole through his throat with no blood around it. She saw only one bullet wound. She insisted on having a copy of the autopsy report, which she was not given until long after the burial, and which did not correspond to her observations (such as its description of two other bullet wounds to the face).", "39. Mrs \u015een told the Public Prosecutor that her husband had been tortured, and insisted that a murder investigation be conducted. However, the Public Prosecutor would not listen to her and no statement or information was sought from her. As she persisted in visiting the Prosecutor regularly, a statement was taken from her a month later on 26 April 1994. However, no progress whatsoever was made in the investigation, even years later.", "40. After her husband had been killed, her house was put under constant surveillance, all visitors being recorded, and many asked by the policemen on duty why they were visiting such terrorists. Her 12-year-old daughter had been stopped as she was leaving school and asked by plain-clothed policemen whether her mother used her as a courier and what kind of papers she was carrying. She was so scared by this and the idea that she might be killed like her father, that she stopped attending school.", "41. Mrs \u015een received threatening telephone calls at that time. The caller said that he was a contra-guerrilla and that she would be killed too. She changed the locks on the doors to her home as her husband had had his house keys on him when he had been abducted. She and her daughter were away on 28 May 1994 when special policemen unsuccessfully tried to enter the house, according to the employees of the bakery situated on the ground floor of her building. The police then went to the house of Mrs \u015een\u2019s friends where her daughter was staying and asked why they had taken in a terrorist\u2019s daughter. The father of that family was placed in custody for four or five days and interrogated about his relationship with the \u015een family.", "42. Mrs \u015een was warned not to go home as there was a purple civilian car waiting at the corner of the street and that she would be taken away. Since then she has not returned home even to recuperate her belongings or souvenirs of her husband. Out of the same concerns, she was living separately from her daughter.", "43. She was taken into custody on 10 November 1995 in Diyarbak\u0131r and interrogated for 11 days about her alleged membership of the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party) (see her other application to the Convention organs \u2013 Nuray \u015een v. Turkey, no. 41478/98, judgment of 17 June 2003).", "44. Mr \u015een was an elderly gentleman, born in 1916. He was the father of the deceased Mehmet \u015een. His son had not told him of his fears for his life prior to his abduction, nor of the difficulties he had faced as a politician. He had had no enemies whatsoever. Everyone liked him.", "45. Mr \u015een was informed the morning after the event that his son had been seized by policemen the evening before. He intuitively knew that he was dead. He went to Nizip. His daughter-in-law had gone to Adana in search of her husband. In Nizip he heard from Gaziantep that his son had been killed.", "46. Mr \u015een went to the Gaziantep Hospital to identify the body. He did not meet Nuray \u015een there. He could not bear to look at his son\u2019s tortured corpse, but noticed that an eye was missing, apparently caused by a bullet wound, and that he had a fractured finger. His son\u2019s clothing was bloodstained. Apparently he had been killed by the police, perhaps because of his candidacy for Mayor.", "47. The police ordered him to remove the body, but he did not do so until the following day. A great crowd gathered. They took the body back to the village and buried it. There were police and gendarmes everywhere on alert, who behaved disrespectfully. Nuray \u015een was at the funeral.", "48. One or two months later he was called to appear before the Prosecutor and Judge to receive his son\u2019s personal possessions. He took the watch and ring but not the clothes which were soaked in blood. The only inquiry made later was by the Gendarmes Station Commander, Sergeant-Major Orhan, about Nuray \u015een\u2019s stay with him for 9 or 10 days, which dates the gendarmes deliberately recorded wrongly.", "49. Mr \u015een was born in 1970. He was no relation to the deceased Mehmet \u015een and did not know him.", "50. In May 1994 the witness was stopped at a police roadblock at the exit from Nizip, where everyone\u2019s identity was checked. One could not leave Nizip without going through this checkpoint. He was also given a body search and asked why he was carrying a copy of the newspaper \u201c\u00d6zg\u00fcr \u00dclke\u201d. He alleged that, because of his surname and the possession of the newspaper, he was taken into a field by three officers and tortured with beatings for two or three hours. In view of this experience, he could understand how Mehmet \u015een had died.", "51. Mr Aktaran was born in 1958 and was a Public Prosecutor at Gaziantep a year after the events, from February to August 1995.", "52. The investigation into the death of Mehmet \u015een was opened by the Gaziantep Chief Prosecutor, Naci Ayaz. The file was subsequently transferred to him. It contained witness statements taken by the police, Mrs \u015een\u2019s statement to the Prosecutor and the autopsy report, but provided no serious leads as to the perpetrator of the crime. There was no ballistic expertise of the bullet found in Mr \u015een\u2019s body or of the empty cartridge found near his corpse. No evidence had been taken from police witnesses because none had been identified as being implicated in the death. The suggestion that Mr \u015een had been involved in vendettas was not taken up as it had no serious basis.", "53. On receiving the file, the witness found lacking an inquiry into the registration number of the car in which Mr \u015een had been abducted \u2013 a honey-coloured vehicle with a registration containing the letters PLT, PUC or PUD. This inquiry revealed that either the car had had false number plates or that the witnesses had been mistaken about the registration number. He did not seek other information following the evidence of the eyewitness Osman \u00d6zer as to a green car with the number 34 PVC 30 or 34 PVD 30. He was unaware of any significant discrepancies in the overall evidence on this or other points.", "54. Mr Aktaran considered that he and his colleague had conducted a satisfactory investigation in the circumstances. Prosecutors do not need to take further evidence from people whose statements have already been taken by the police. At the outset he had been open-minded about the applicant\u2019s allegation that the security forces might have been involved in the incident. However, there had been nothing in the various statements taken to suggest that an inquiry into any particular officers was required. He placed a permanent search warrant on the file, so that the investigation would remain open for another 20-25 years should new evidence appear.", "55. Mr Kelleci was born in 1973 and at the material time was working as a reporter for the Gaziantep office of the \u201c\u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem\u201d newspaper. He had been acquainted with Mr \u015een.", "56. In a general operation against the \u201c\u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem\u201d newspaper on 11 December 1993, the witness was taken into custody and held for some six days. On the fourth day of his interrogation, the name of Mehmet \u015een was mentioned with a threat \u201cto finish him off\u201d or \u201cdo him in\u201d along with two other named persons. Mr \u015een\u2019s name was cursed. The witness thought that the remarks were intended to be passed on to Mr \u015een. He later informed Mr \u015een of this threat and advised him to take care.", "57. The next time he saw Mr \u015een was at the morgue. His newspaper had been telephoned with the news by a well-spoken Turkish lady. He had taken the call himself. When he saw the corpse, of which he took photographs, he remarked the strange position of the wrists, which looked fractured. He did not see the injured side of the face which was turned parallel to the table. No autopsy had been performed on the body at that stage.", "58. On returning home from the morgue, he received an anonymous telephone call also threatening him with death.", "59. Mr Kelleci accompanied Mrs \u015een and a delegation to the Governor\u2019s office on 31 March 1994. Afterwards, the witness saw the Gaziantep Gendarmes Commander, Chief of Police H\u00fcseyin \u00c7apk\u0131n and the Deputy Governor. They stated that Mr \u015een\u2019s death was possibly linked to gambling debts and had not been perpetrated by the State. He told them of the death threat he had personally received but it was not taken seriously. They persisted with the gambling debt theory and assured him that Mr \u015een\u2019s murderer would be found.", "60. Mr Alan was born in 1958 and was a tailor by profession in Gaziantep, as well as the Chairman and District Leader of the DEP Party at the material time. He knew Mehmet \u015een from their common political activities. In those days there had been many killings by unknown perpetrators which, together with the bombing of the Party\u2019s headquarters in Ankara, led to their withdrawal from the imminent elections.", "61. Mr \u015een came to his shop four days before his abduction and offered to repair his car. When driving it away, the witness noticed that Mr \u015een was being followed by a white police car, a Renault Toros. This had happened to him too. The occupants were obviously plain-clothed policemen, whom he could identify if he saw them again. All Party members were under great pressure at that time. Even after the Party\u2019s withdrawal from the elections, it continued: he was taken into custody at midnight on 29 March 1994, four days after Mr \u015een\u2019s abduction, and challenged about disseminating propaganda for the Welfare Party instead.", "62. On the drive into custody, he was told that Mr \u015een had \u201cchanged worlds\u201d, and that he would be \u201csent to the place where he is\u201d. He had understood the remarks to mean that Mr \u015een was dead and that he would be killed too. (He had not heard of the recovery of Mr \u015een\u2019s corpse at that stage, so he was not too sure.) Panicking, the witness claimed to have made certain telephone calls before he had been taken from his house, including a call to the normal police. He was then punched and, before the car left town, it turned round and deposited him at the police anti-terrorism department, some 220 meters from his house.", "63. Mr Alan was held in police custody for 16 days. The custody records indicating a shorter period were incorrect. He was interrogated under torture. Mr \u015een was not mentioned but Mr Alan was told that his Party was \u201cfinished in Nizip\u201d. He was subsequently remanded in custody for three months, accused of being, inter alia, a member of, and aiding and abetting, the PKK. On release, these charges were dropped and a remaining charge of possessing a gun without a licence was still pending.", "64. Dr Erkol was born in 1962. She had worked as an expert in forensic medicine and as a lecturer at the Medical Faculty of Gaziantep University since 1990.", "65. Dr Erkol performed the autopsy on Mehmet \u015een, whose identity was unknown at that time, as was that of his killer. Given the frequent blood feuds in the area, she suspected that the murder was another of that kind. She was struck by the fact that the victim had been blindfolded. Dr Ahmet Aslan, an unspecialised physician, assisted her at the autopsy. The Public Prosecutor, Naci Ayaz, whom the witness described as a meticulous and responsible professional, attended the procedure.", "66. The body, fully clothed, was inspected on site and photographed by Dr Aslan and the Prosecutor. It was then taken to the hospital for examination. The bloodstains on the victim\u2019s jacket indicated that he had been shot whilst clothed and still alive. The clothes were removed at the morgue. Dr Erkol had been told prior to the autopsy, and then saw herself, that the name of Mehmet \u015een had been written in biro on the inside pocket of the jacket, but that was insufficient evidence of identity. She did not follow the local news, so had not heard about Mr \u015een\u2019s abduction. It was not her responsibility to identify the corpse.", "67. The body was X-rayed to verify the placement of any bullets still lodged in it. The X-rays were not kept. There were two bullet wounds to the head, one bullet having remained lodged in the chest. They had caused extensive fracturing, brain damage and haemorrhaging, resulting in death, some 36 hours to four days before the autopsy. It would appear that Mr \u015een had been killed two or three hours after his last meal. It was not possible to be more precise about the time of death given the limited facilities available in Gaziantep. The bullet which had entered and exited the skull had torn the victim\u2019s eye out. Neither the arms nor fingers had been fractured, but their distorted position would have been due to the onset of rigor mortis.", "68. The remaining bullet would have been kept. It was probably of a wide calibre \u2013 9 mm \u2013 fired from a short-barrelled gun, within a 95 cm range of the body. A ballistic analysis could prove valuable only if linked to a suspect weapon and a comparative study.", "69. The body showed no trace of ill-treatment. In the absence of any obvious external signs or allegations of torture, no examination of the internal organs was conducted. However, the body had begun to decompose, presenting signs of post-mortem discolouring, distortion through rigor mortis, and, with the bullet injuries and autopsy incisions, was a very ugly sight. An untrained person might understandably misconstrue these elements as evidence of ill-treatment. Moreover, the body was not washed down after the autopsy, so it may have looked even bloodier. Washing was for the hoca, a religious leader on duty at the morgue, or the family to perform. The hole in the throat seen by Mrs \u015een would have been an autopsy incision.", "70. People cannot enter the morgue without the Prosecutor\u2019s authorisation, other than perhaps a very close relative who might be allowed to view the body by the hoca. She could not tell from the poor photocopy of the photograph taken by the journalist, Mr Kelleci, purportedly of Mr \u015een\u2019s corpse in the morgue, whether that photograph had been taken before or after the autopsy. However, judging by the position of one of the hands in the photograph, it was probable it had been taken before the autopsy had been conducted.", "71. It transpired that the photographs provided by the Government at this point in the hearing, and in respect of which the witness noted several contradictions with the autopsy findings, were not of Mr \u015een\u2019s corpse.", "72. Mr G\u00fcd\u00fcl was born in 1947 and was the official chauffeur for the law courts. He also accompanied the Prosecutor at autopsies.", "73. In the present case he had driven the Prosecutor to where the body had been found. It was on the road construction site but accessible by car, albeit very dusty because of the nearby sand quarries and frequent heavy lorry traffic. There were gendarmes at the scene, as well as a finger print expert, a clerk and a doctor. The Prosecutor made a record which included the position of the body. This procedure took about an hour. The body was lying on its back, clothed. There was a yellow, car-polishing cloth over its eyes. There was blood on the ground which had come from the back of the head. The body was transported by ambulance to the Gaziantep State Hospital morgue as an on-site autopsy was not possible. There had been no discussion as to its identity.", "74. He was sure that no one saw the corpse at the morgue other than the officials concerned. He described the same X-ray, medical procedures and findings as Dr Erkol, having been present throughout. He did not recall the name of Mr \u015een being inscribed inside his jacket. He had had no idea who the individual was. That was a police matter. For him it was just an ordinary incident. He did not recall being present when Mr \u015een\u2019s father arrived at the morgue to identify the corpse, although his signature had been on the relevant document. The circumstances had been very distressing at the time.", "75. Mr Pekbalc\u0131 was born in 1956 and was a farmer by profession. He had been working on the road construction site, obtaining materials from the quarry using explosives. He had had a fright after one particular detonation when he spotted a corpse about 10 m away from him, which, without approaching it, he reported to the Gendarmes Station of Aktoprak. He signed a statement to that effect at the station. The place where the body was found was accessible by car but was frequented mostly by lorries. He had been working with \u0130brahim Kilit at the time.", "76. Mr S\u00fcnb\u00fcl was born in 1970 and was a Gendarmes Non-commissioned Officer. At the material time he was Station Commander at the \u015eehitarif Sub-station which was attached to the Central District Station in Gaziantep. His superior was H\u00fcseyin Kanat, the District Gendarmes Commander.", "77. Mr S\u00fcnb\u00fcl had been at his station when MM Pekbalc\u0131 and Kilit reported the presence of a corpse on the Tekfen highway construction site. He took statements from them and then went with a unit of his men to the location. There they found the clothed body of a man, some 45-50 years old, lying on his back, with firearm wounds to his head and face. He checked the throat artery, confirming death, cordoned off the area and notified his superiors. Although there appeared to be two bullet wounds, only one cartridge was found, despite a thorough search of the immediate vicinity. He had no idea of the time of death or how long the body had been there. The person in charge of the criminal laboratory at the Provincial Gendarmes Headquarters took photographs. These would still be in the gendarmes\u2019 files if they had not been sent to the Public Prosecutor.", "78. The next day he typed up a report from his notes about the corpse, which had not been identified as no identity papers had been found, although Mr \u015een\u2019s name had been written on the jacket. The Prosecutor must have been shown that. He had not been aware of Mrs \u015een\u2019s missing person report the day before. His station had not been informed of that. The abduction had taken place in Nizip and his station would not have been informed unless directly asked to make inquiries. He presumed that his superiors had conducted the necessary inquiries after he had told them about the name in the jacket.", "79. Mr S\u00fcnb\u00fcl sent the empty cartridge case, together with the person\u2019s ring and watch and the documents he had prepared, to the Public Prosecutor that day. The blindfold was also transmitted. It had the name and number of a petrol station on it, about which inquiries were made by his superior officer. No analysis was carried out of the soil near the corpse for the fibres of other clothes or the like. He could not recall whether casts were made of the footprints near the body.", "80. The body\u2019s location had been accessible by car. The area consisted of compacted earth on which there were footprints. Only the site workers frequented the area and the body had been well hidden from view. There were no vehicle tracks within an 8 to 10 m perimeter of the corpse.", "81. He did not recall whether there had been checkpoints in place on the day the body was found. Subsequently, he interviewed local villagers and site workers in an unsuccessful effort to gather information about the incident. It would have been possible to have transported Mr \u015een to the site using secondary roads and thus avoiding the road-blocks on the main route. If he had been informed of Mr \u015een\u2019s abduction, he would have instructed the checkpoints under his control to look out for him. At the checkpoint, people\u2019s identity cards would be checked manually against a list of wanted persons. The officers could also search vehicles and persons who were suspect.", "82. Mr Kanat was born in 1969 and he was the \u015eehit Kamil District Gendarmes Commander at the material time, with six stations under his command, including a large central station. The workload was very heavy.", "83. After being notified of the incident by the Station Commander, he in turn notified the Provincial Gendarmes Commander and the regiment\u2019s operations centre. He accompanied the Public Prosecutor to the scene, which had already been secured on his instructions by the Station Commander. The regiment\u2019s team of crime specialists arrived in separate vehicles and carried out a systematic and detailed investigation. The photographs which they had taken should have been retained at the Gaziantep Central Gendarmerie. They would have been sent to the Public Prosecutor if requested. They were kept principally to assist in identifying the body and showing them to people assisting with the inquiries.", "84. Mr Kanat confirmed Mr S\u00fcnb\u00fcl\u2019s description of the corpse, the bullet wounds, the empty cartridge and the name written inside the jacket. The body seemed to have been in place for some time \u2013 perhaps 15 or 16 hours. He thought that a ballistic test had been made at a later date. The results would be in the Prosecutor\u2019s file. The blindfold was marked with the name of a service station called Petrol Ofisi, from which it was thought that the victim could have been from Nizip. However, he had not heard of the abduction of Mr \u015een beforehand. The area was searched for footprints or other leads. Footprints were found near the body which could have been those of the people who had discovered it. However, they were not recent enough for casts to be made.", "85. On the instructions of the Prosecutor, they searched the body and found a small piece of paper in the inner pocket of the jacket with the name Mehmet \u015een written on it. It could also have been the case that the name had been written in very small letters on the pocket lining. Perhaps a dry cleaner had done this. They took the blindfold and notified the regiment\u2019s operations\u2019 centre to confirm the person\u2019s identity. This was not confirmed until the witness returned to the main station in Gaziantep. He was not present at the autopsy but did attend the funeral.", "86. After establishing that the deceased person was Mehmet \u015een, Mr Kanat went to Nizip where he started his inquiries. According to the statements of witnesses, the victim was last seen playing cards at the coffee shop. Three people entered the caf\u00e9 and then left with him by car. The vehicle bore the registration number 35 PLT (or PLV) 30 which, following inquiries by the provincial police headquarters, proved to be false. Other similar numbers were searched unsuccessfully. He rejected any suggestion that the security forces in the area had been operating in vehicles with false number plates. All their vehicles had official plates. Inquiries were also made as to the identity of a woman who worked in a nightclub, and who was mentioned in the statements taken, but a check on all the nightclubs proved fruitless. Nothing suspicious was reported by the local stations or the check-points on the main road. In any event, it would not have been possible for them to check every passing vehicle as traffic was heavy. Besides, the killer could have taken the secondary roads with no roadblocks.", "87. At first he did not consider the possibility that the death had been perpetrated by officials. He thought that this was a settling of scores within the \u201corganisation\u201d, particularly as the victim had been a candidate in local elections, and such unpleasant incidents frequently occurred at the time. Later however he did make unofficial background inquiries into Mrs \u015een\u2019s allegation of official involvement, particularly concerning police employees, but he found no evidence to support her claims. He thus rejected this theory. He made no contact himself with Mrs \u015een, the caf\u00e9 employees or any DEP Party members. Statements were taken by his subordinates about the murder. The police also took statements, possibly because of the abduction offence which had occurred within their jurisdiction. No records were drawn up of inquiries which proved fruitless. So, for example, if someone had gone to the aforementioned petrol station but inquiries there had revealed nothing pertinent, no record of that visit would have been made.", "88. More than ten people had been murdered by firearms during the three years he was stationed in the area. Most of the perpetrators of those crimes had been found. The killer of an unknown person, whose head had been crushed beyond recognition, was not found, like the murderer of Mr \u015een. These two incidents were unusual. He had heard that seven members of the DEP Party had been murdered, but did not know if it had occurred at the material time. He had not heard of groups of contra-guerrillas employed unofficially to eliminate political opponents or activists, other than what he had read in newspapers.", "89. Certain key witnesses failed to appear before the Delegates of the Commission: the eyewitnesses to the abduction of Mr \u015een from the coffee shop, namely Osman \u00d6zer, Rasim A\u011fpak, Maksut Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, Durmu\u015f Kaplan and Abit \u015eahin, who were to have been summonsed through the applicant\u2019s representatives, and the principal Public Prosecutor in the case, Naci Ayaz, summonsed through the Government Agent. Mr Ayaz refused to attend the hearing because of a heavy workload.", "90. The applicant declared that her husband had been abducted from his place of work by plain-clothed policemen on 26 March 1993 around 7 p.m. and that she had had no news of him since. There had been seven eyewitnesses to the event. The applicant also lodged a formal criminal complaint. The Prosecutor immediately ordered the Nizip Security Directorate, urgently, to make the necessary inquiries and take the pertinent statements. On 30 March 1994 the Prosecutor issued a similar instruction to the Gaziantep Population Service. That day, he also issued the burial certificate and authorisation. On 18 April 1994, the Prosecutor requested an urgent reply to his instructions from the Nizip Security Directorate.", "91. The Prosecutor, Naci Ayaz, instructed the Gaziantep Gendarmerie to make an in-depth, discreet investigation into the murder, to identify the assassins, and to respect their defence rights on arrest, to take the evidence of eyewitnesses and to transmit the results to him.", "92. Mr Kilit described how his colleague, Selahattin Pekbalc\u0131, had found the corpse of Mehmet \u015een while working nearby on 29 March 1994, and he had driven over with his lorry to see it and immediately notified the gendarmes. He did not get out of the lorry to examine the corpse more closely. Mr Pekbalc\u0131 stated that he had been recuperating cables for explosives work and, while walking down the highway, he had spotted the corpse. He then informed Mr Kilit and accompanied him to the gendarmerie.", "93. Mr Mehmet S\u00fcnb\u00fcl, a Gendarmes Sergeant, recorded that Mr Pekbalc\u0131 had said to him that he had spotted the corpse on the highway construction site but had been too scared to go over to it. Mr S\u00fcnb\u00fcl had made a sketch of the site and the placement of the corpse. That record also contained details of the few personal effects found on the deceased, which effects included a ring and watch.", "94. Mr S\u00fcnb\u00fcl had made a sketch of the site and the placement of the corpse. He recorded that the body of an unidentified person had been found. The deceased was Mehmet \u015een, killed by a bullet to the head. The crime had probably been committed some 24 to 36 hours before the body was discovered. The identity and number of the assassins were unknown. The minutes described, inter alia, how the gendarmes had been informed of the incident and the state of the corpse (see also paragraph 95 below).", "95. The Gendarmes Command had informed the Prosecutor\u2019s Office by telephone that the body of an unidentified man had been found, shot, 2 km from the village of Karpuzkaya. Prosecutor Naci Ayaz and other officials went to the scene of the incident at the highway construction site. The area had been cordoned off. The state of the body was described and the evidence of Mehmet S\u00fcnb\u00fcl was taken. He said that around 2 p.m. that day two construction workers had come to the Gendarmes Station and reported the body. He went with his team and the two workers to the scene. He found the body of a man of around 40 years of age, and gave other details about the corpse. An empty cartridge had been found a metre away. He noted that the name Mehmet \u015een had been written in biro on the lining of the inside pocket of the deceased\u2019s jacket. Photographs were taken of the body and the scene. The doctor present said that an autopsy could not be conducted there and then as night was falling, so the body was taken to the State Hospital.", "96. The state of the corpse and its clothing were described. The cause of death was found to have been a bullet wound to the skull, causing major brain damage and haemorrhaging, some 36 hours to 4 days before the examination.", "97. The report, written by Mr H\u00fcseyin Kanat, described the finding of the body of an unknown person who had been murdered with a 9 mm calibre pistol. The deceased\u2019s clothes and personal effects were depicted. On 29 March 1994 around 2 p.m. a telephone call was received at the gendarmerie from someone calling himself Mehmet \u015een (sic), reporting the finding of a male corpse. The Chief Prosecutor was immediately informed. After an investigation, it was established that the person had been killed on 28 March 1994.", "98. The report, also written by Mr H\u00fcseyin Kanat, gave the identity of the victim, his wife and their address. It mentioned the abduction on 26 March 1994 and that inquiries were continuing.", "99. The Prosecutor, Naci Ayaz, described the finding of an unidentified corpse near the Karpuzkaya village on 29 March 1994 and the subsequent identification of the body by Necip \u015een, the father of the victim, the next day.", "100. The property found on or near the deceased was listed. It included a 9 mm empty cartridge, cigarettes and a lighter, and a windscreen cloth from the Bucak petrol station.", "101. Mr Kaplan stated that he had known Mehmet \u015een for some 5 to 10 years. Mr \u015een had been his associate in running the \u00c7a\u011fda\u015f Caf\u00e9. On 26 March 1994 around 4 or 5 p.m., Mr \u015een had been playing cards in the caf\u00e9 with others. Mr Kaplan had been at another table. Three unknown men came into the caf\u00e9. Two stayed at the door and the third approached Mr \u015een. While asking to see his identity, the man showed him his. The latter had had his back to Mr Kaplan and was carrying a walkie-talkie. One of the men at the door told him to hurry up, whereupon Mr Kaplan looked at him. He described that individual. Mr \u015een left the caf\u00e9 with them, quite normally, in a car with a registration number beginning with the numbers \u201c34\u201d. Before meeting Mr \u015een, Mr Kaplan had known that he had been a heavily indebted gambler. Mr \u015een\u2019s brother in Germany paid his debts. Mr \u015een knew a certain \u0130nci Do\u011fan, a hostess at the night club in Gaziantep. Mr Kaplan had previously discussed with Mr \u015een the latter\u2019s DEP Party candidature for the post of the Mayor of Ayran.", "102. Mr Kaplan confirmed his statement above (paragraph 101) and added that he had not seen whether an actual identity card had been shown to Mr \u015een by the stranger who had approached him; nor did he hear the reason why Mr \u015een was being taken away. Mr \u015een had not seemed perturbed, however. Because of gambling debts amounting to 50-100 million Turkish lira, Mr \u015een had sold two bakeries which he had owned, and his home and caf\u00e9 were mortgaged.", "103. Mr \u00d6zer declared that he had known Mehmet \u015een for 2 or 3 years. He was one of his associates in the running of the \u00c7a\u011fda\u015f Caf\u00e9. On 26 March 1994 around 4 or 5 p.m., they had been playing cards with two others when three unknown men came into the caf\u00e9. Mr \u00d6zer described two of them. One man came over to the card table and asked for Mehmet \u015een, who identified himself. On request, Mr \u015een showed his identity card, which the man kept, and then showed his, asking Mr \u015een to follow him, which he did without protest. The man said to them, \u201cIt\u2019s not serious.\u201d The four left in a metal green coloured Do\u011fan SLX, registration number 34 PVC (or PVD) 30. He immediately notified Mrs \u015een, but was unable to tell her who the men were. He added that he had read in the newspapers that Mr \u015een had been a DEP Party candidate for the post of the Mayor of Ayran.", "104. Mr \u00d6zer essentially confirmed his statement of 1 April 1994 (paragraph 103 above), whilst amending the car registration number to 34 PLT (or PVT) 30, and adding that Mr \u015een had had gambling debts and had been involved in a long-standing vendetta.", "105. Mr \u015eahin said that he had been a waiter at the \u00c7a\u011fda\u015f Caf\u00e9. On 26 March 1994 Mehmet \u015een had been playing cards with others there. All Mr \u015eahin had seen, around 7 p.m., was Mr \u015een leaving with two other people, whose backs were turned to him and whom he was incapable of recognising or identifying. He had heard it said that these people had presented themselves as policemen.", "106. Mr Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m had been playing cards with Mehmet \u015een at the \u00c7a\u011fda\u015f Caf\u00e9 on 26 March 1994 when, around 5.15 p.m., a man had entered the caf\u00e9 and asked Rasim A\u011fpak if he were Mr \u015een, whereupon the latter identified himself. The individual showed Mr \u015een a document enclosed in an identity wallet, and told him that he had to accompany him, which he did. Mr Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m had not taken note of the individual or his appearance as he had had his back half-turned away from the man. Before leaving, Mr \u015een asked Mr \u00d6zer for some money, but Mr Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m had not looked at him at that point in order to avoid any embarassment. He had not been worried by any of this as he had been absorbed by the excitement of the card game. After drinking some tea, Mr Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m went home. He knew that Mr \u015een had been involved in a vendetta for years and that he liked going to nightclubs and gambling, thereby spending the money he made from the bakery which his brother had given him.", "107. Mr A\u011fpak said that on 26 March 1994, around 5.15 p.m., someone came up behind him while he was playing cards at the \u00c7a\u011fda\u015f Caf\u00e9, asking whether he was Mehmet \u015een. Before Mr A\u011fpak could turn round to see who was speaking to him, Mr \u015een identified himself. Within a few seconds, Mr \u015een had left the caf\u00e9. Mr A\u011fpak could not remember what the stranger had looked like or whether he had shown an identity card. He had continued playing cards as the matter did not concern him.", "108. On the basis of the statements made by the eyewitnesses, MM Kaplan, \u00d6zer, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m and A\u011fpak, a sketch was made of the inside of the \u00c7a\u011fda\u015f Caf\u00e9 where they had all been sitting when Mr \u015een was taken away, the streets outside and the placement of the abduction vehicle, registration number 34 PLT 320 or 34 PVT 30.", "109. It was recorded that the investigations, including a car registration check, had so far not disclosed the identity of the killers of Mehmet \u015een, but that inquiries were continuing.", "110. The report recounted that on 29 March 1994 the body of an unknown man was found 2 km from the village of Karpuzkaya. The autopsy revealed that he had been killed on 28 March 1994 by a gunshot wound to the head. Investigations discovered that the victim had been Mehmet \u015een who, on 26 March 1994, had been abducted from a night club by three people in a car bearing the false registation number 34 PLT 30. Since then there had been no news of him.", "111. It was noted that the gold wedding ring and wristwatch belonging to Mehmet \u015een were to be handed to his heirs.", "a) on 4 April 1994 to the Gaziantep Human Rights Association", "112. The applicant stated that her husband had been abducted from his caf\u00e9 on 26 March 1994 around 7 p.m. by three people claiming to be plain- clothed policemen, in a honey-coloured Do\u011fan SL car, registration number 34 PTL 30. Her enquiries of the local authorities revealed nothing. She later learnt of and saw his tortured body at the morgue of the Gaziantep State Hospital. The applicant recounted her husband\u2019s fears on 25 March 1994 about two men who had been following him, and the eyewitness accounts of two strangers being in the caf\u00e9 drinking coffee on the afternoon of the abduction. She suspected that her husband had been abducted, tortured and killed by contra-guerillas.", "113. This statement essentially contained the applicant\u2019s original allegations described above (see paragraphs 11-22 and 27-39). She added that she was now convinced that her husband had been abducted, tortured and killed by contra-guerillas because of his political beliefs and activities for the DEP Party.", "114. This statement essentially contained the applicant\u2019s original allegations described above (see paragraphs 11-22 and 27-39). She claimed that four people had abducted her husband (rather than the three previously mentioned, paragraph 112 above). She could conceive that her husband had been murdered because of his political affiliations and ambitions, but was now of the view that it had been the work of contra-guerrillas. Seven DEP Party members had been abducted and murdered to date. She confirmed her criminal complaint and asked that her husband\u2019s killers be brought to justice.", "115. The applicant recounted how her father-in-law, Necip \u015een, had been called to the office of the Birecik State Prosecutor and handed his son\u2019s ring and watch. He was informed that no progress had been made in the identification of his son\u2019s murderers. However, on the many occasions on which the applicant had gone to the Gaziantep Prosecutor\u2019s Office for a progress report, she had been told that no personal possessions had been found on her husband\u2019s corpse. She therefore deduced that the Turkish State knew of her husband\u2019s murder / murderers, and demanded to be told, inter alia, how the State had obtained the ring and watch, from whom, and for how long they had kept them, as well as the identity of the murderers and her husband\u2019s last words.", "116. Mrs \u015een alleged that her father-in-law had been mentally tortured by the Urfa Anti-terrorist Department in January 1995 to give information about her current whereabouts and activities. Her relatives in Nizip and Gaziantep were being put under similar pressure. So she could no longer go home or work. Since giving an interview to Amnesty International, she had been denounced as a PKK member at a press conference given by a Turkish Government spokesman, relayed in the press and on television. Her death warrant had thereby been signed by the State and she requested international support. (The applicant later made other statements to the Convention organs, alleging her ill-treatment, which statements were dealt with separately in application no. 41478/98, decision of 30 April 2002.)", "117. Mr Dirik was recorded as saying that people had knocked on his door at 3.30 a.m. on the same day as Mehmet \u015een\u2019s abduction, 26 March 1994. \u0130smail Kelleci, a journalist at the \u201c\u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem\u201d newspaper, had been told by the Gaziantep Security Directorate in December 1993 that they knew what Arif Dirik and Mr \u015een had been doing, that their patience had run out and that they were going to kill the two of them. Mr Dirik declared that he could no longer go home and that, if any action was taken against him, it would be the responsibilty of H\u00fcseyin \u00c7apk\u0131n and the Gaziantep Security Directorate.", "118. In response to their inquiries, the Association was informed that it had not been possible to determine the identity of the offenders, but that the investigation was being pursued in many directions in order to cast light on the incident.", "119. The letter enclosed the latest statements (three), records (four) and a rough sketch that had been drawn up for the investigation file.", "120. The Nizip Prosecutor stated that he had no geographical jurisdiction in the matter of the murder of Mehmet \u015een. Accordingly, he referred the file to the Gaziantep Prosecution.", "121. In response to a request for information, the Governor explained that Mrs \u015een had filed a petition with the Nizip Prosecutor on 28 March 1994 concerning the abduction of her husband. A body was found on 29 March 1994. The autopsy established that the victim had been shot, and inquiries revealed that the deceased was Mehmet \u015een. The security forces denied any involvement in the matter. Any allegation to the contrary was an absolute, slanderous lie. Allegations by Mrs \u015een that she had been ill-treated were also untrue. An investigation into the registration number, 34 PLT 30, of the car in which Mr \u015een had been taken away, revealed false plates.", "122. The Prosecutor, Zek\u00e2i Aktaran, instructed the gendarmerie to make an in-depth, discreet investigation into the murder, to identify the assassins, and to respect their defence rights on arrest, to take the evidence of eyewitnesses and to transmit the results to him.", "123. The gendarmes recorded that little progress had been made in the investigation concerning the murder of Mehmet \u015een. No new clues had been revealed by their inquiries, which were continuing.", "124. Lieutenant H\u00fcseyin Kanat reported to the Gaziantep Prosecutor that no progress had been made in the identification of the corpse found shot on 29 March 1994. Moreover, no information had been gleaned concerning the murderer(s). The gendarmes had no clues or evidence which could throw any light on the case. The investigation would continue.", "125. Prosecutor Zek\u00e2i Aktaran requested the directorate to run a search on a metallic green Do\u011fan SLX car, registration number 34 PUC (PUD) 30, or a honey-coloured Do\u011fan SLX car, registration number 34 PTL 30. The directorate replied on 18 April 1995 that these registration numbers belonged to other vehicles of different makes and colours.", "126. The warrant stated that the search for the guilty person(s) had continued but their identity had not been established. The search would be kept open until time-barred on 30 March 2014, in accordance with Article 102 (1) of the Criminal Code. A letter of inquiry would be addressed to the gendarmerie every three months in the meantime.", "127.

Some of these reports mentioned the patrol visits to the village of Karpuzkaya, 2.5 km from where the body of Mr \u015een had been found.

(He had not appeared before the Delegates to testify to this, as had been proposed at one stage by the applicant\u2019s representatives.)", "132. Mrs Dirik said that Mehmet \u015een had been a family friend. He had telephoned her one or two days before his kidnapping in an anxious state. He had wished to speak to her husband who was not in. After his abduction, her husband went with Nuray \u015een to Adana to inquire whether Mehmet \u015een was in police custody there. While he was away, around 2 to 3 a.m. at night, her doorbell rang and there was a loud banging on her door. Peering through the curtains, she saw two men and a taxi. She made a couple of telephone calls and was advised not to open the door. She thought it could have been the police, as her husband would have used his key and he had previously been threatened and taken into custody because of his political and trade union activities. Eventually the strangers left. The next morning she saw that the doorbell had been broken. At the Human Rights Association the following day, she heard that the tortured corpse of Mehmet \u015een had been found. On being informed of this, her husband never returned to Gaziantep.", "133. Mr Dirik confirmed his wife\u2019s statement above (paragraph 132 above).

Mr Kelleci had told Mr Dirik that the police had asked whether he knew him and Mehmet \u015een, to which Mr Kelleci replied that he knew the latter.
