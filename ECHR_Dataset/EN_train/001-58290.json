On the same day, in a different set of proceedings concerning unrelated facts, the Regional Court of Amsterdam convicted him of unlawful possession of a firearm and sentenced him to six weeks\u2019 imprisonment.", "22. On 14 November 1996, the applicant filed a request under Article 89 CCP for compensation in respect of damage sustained on account of the time spent in pre-trial detention on suspicion of committing the offences of which he had been acquitted. Instead of seeking pecuniary compensation, the applicant requested the Regional Court to order the deduction of the time he had spent in pre-trial detention from the six weeks\u2019 imprisonment to which he had been sentenced in the other set of criminal proceedings.", "23. In its decision of 25 April 1997, the Regional Court noted that the applicant had been taken into police custody on 26 February 1996 on suspicion of committing an offence under Article 250 ter CC, that on 27 February 1996 the investigating judge had ordered the applicant\u2019s detention on remand and that he had been released for lack of space on 6 March 1996. Pursuant to Article 27 \u00a7 2 CC and Article 90 \u00a7 4 CCP, the Regional Court ordered that ten days be deducted from the six weeks\u2019 imprisonment imposed for the other offence (see paragraph 21 above). As to the remaining 32 days, the applicant has successfully sought a royal pardon, these 32 days having been commuted to 69 hours\u2019 community work.", "24.

A custody order is only valid for a maximum of three days and may be prolonged once for a maximum period of three days. No appeal lies against a custody order.", "27. Article 59a CCP requires that no later than three days and fifteen hours after being arrested, a suspect must be brought before an investigating judge in order to be heard. On that occasion the suspect may request the investigating judge, in accordance with Article 59a \u00a7 4 CCP, to order his or her release. Where the investigating judge finds the order for detention in police custody (inverzekeringstelling) unlawful, the suspect\u2019s immediate release must be ordered (Article 59a \u00a7 5 CCP).", "28. In order to prolong the detention of a suspect, the public prosecutor can request the investigation judge for a remand order (inbewaringstelling) under Article 63 CCP. Pursuant to Article 64 \u00a7 1 CCP this remand order is valid for a period of maximum ten days.", "29. Although no direct appeal lies against a remand order, a person whose detention on remand has been ordered can, in accordance with Article 69 \u00a7 1 CCP, apply to the Regional Court for an order lifting the pre-trial detention (opheffing voorlopige hechtenis). Under Article 87 \u00a7 2 CCP, an appeal against a rejection by the Regional Court of a first request to lift pre-trial detention may be lodged with the Court of Appeal (Gerechtshof).", "30. In order to prolong the detention of a suspect whose remand has been ordered by the investigation judge, the public prosecutor can request the Regional Court for an order for further detention on remand (gevangenhouding). Pursuant to Article 66 CCP this order is valid for a period of maximum thirty days. Under Article 71 CCP, an appeal against an order for further detention on remand lies with the Court of Appeal.", "31. According to the established case-law of the Supreme Court (Hoge Raad), procedural defects occurring in respect of previous orders for pre-trial detention do not constitute independent grounds for dismissing an application for a subsequent category of pre-trial detention. A judge must examine for each category separately whether all conditions are fulfilled (see HR (Hoge Raad), 4 March 1975, NJ (Nederlandse Jurisprudentie), 1975, no. 241; HR, 10 November 1981, NJ 1982, no. 45; and HR, 7 October 1988, NJ 1989, no. 510). However, in deciding requests under Article 69 CCP, a judge may take procedural defects into consideration as a relevant factor (see HR, 16 March 1990, NJ 1990, no. 500).", "32.
