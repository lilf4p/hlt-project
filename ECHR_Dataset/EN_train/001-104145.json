The closure was to be carried out on the basis of the 1959 Cemeteries Act.", "7.

The applicants intended to build a house and a workshop on it.", "10. On 4 May 1987 the Koszalin Regional Inspector of Historic Monuments (Wojew\u00f3dzki Konserwator Zabytk\u00f3w) issued a decision adding the applicants\u2019 property to the register of historic monuments (rejestr zabytk\u00f3w) on the grounds that a Jewish cemetery had been established on it at the beginning of the nineteenth century. It was one of the few remnants of the former Jewish culture in the region. The Inspector found that the layout of the cemetery was discernible and that certain parts of the cemetery were intact (the foundations of a house of prayer, a stone wall and some gravestones). The applicants were advised as to the scope of their obligations deriving from the 1962 Protection of the Cultural Heritage and Museums Act (ustawa o ochronie d\u00f3br kultury i o muzeach).

On 30 May 1988 the applicants requested the Governor of Koszalin to offer them an alternative plot of land on which they could construct a house. On 15 June 1988 the Koszalin Regional Inspector of Historic Monuments requested the Mayor of Dar\u0142owo to grant the applicants\u2019 request. On 5 July 1988 the Mayor of Dar\u0142owo informed the applicants that the exchange of plots requested by them would be possible only in the event of the Mayor receiving a subsidy from the Governor of Koszalin.", "12.

On 14 May 1992 the Regional Inspector requested the Head of the Koszalin District Office to institute expropriation proceedings in respect of the applicants\u2019 property. On 14 August 1992 the Head of the District Office decided to discontinue the proceedings, finding that no entity was interested in purchasing the cemetery. The Head of the District Office further found that the applicants, who had been aware in 1974 that they were purchasing a Jewish cemetery, were obliged to protect the site until they could find an entity interested in its purchase. The applicants appealed and requested that the issue be resolved. They stated that they were not interested in the maintenance and protection of the site.", "16. On 2 October 1992 the Governor of Koszalin quashed the decision and remitted the case.

On 1 August 2000 the National Inspector informed the applicants that the S\u0142awno District Office (starostwo powiatowe) was the competent authority to deal with the matter. Furthermore, the Regional Inspector of Historic Monuments could request the S\u0142awno District Office to commence expropriation proceedings under sections 33 and 34(1) of the Protection of the Cultural Heritage Act. They were informed that section 33 of that Act provided that a monument of particular historic, scientific or artistic value could be acquired by the State if the public interest so required. The National Inspector informed the applicants that the former Jewish cemetery in Rusko belonged to that category of monuments, being one of the few remnants of Jewish culture in the Middle Pomerania Region. The applicants were advised to contact the S\u0142awno District Office as the representative of the State Treasury, whose duty it was to resolve their problem.", "20.

A request could also have been submitted by the Regional Inspector.", "21. On 26 January 2001 the Koszalin Regional Inspector of Historic Monuments requested the Mayor of S\u0142awno District to initiate expropriation proceedings. The Regional Inspector stated that in 1974 the applicants had bought the property as a construction plot. Subsequently, following the 1987 listing decision, the applicants had been prevented from developing their land in any manner. The Regional Inspector expressed the opinion that the expropriation of the plot and its ensuing transfer to the Jewish community would be consistent with the provisions of the 1997 Act on Relations between the State and the Jewish Community (ustawa o stosunku Pa\u0144stwa do gmin wyznaniowych \u017cydowskich) and the policy concerning the Jewish monuments agreed between Poland and Israel.", "22.

However, there was one plot in D\u0105bki that could be exchanged. By a letter of 14 July 2003 the Mayor of Dar\u0142owo informed the S\u0142awno District Office that Mr Potomski had refused to exchange his plot for the plot situated in D\u0105bki.

On 7 August 2003 the Mayor of Dar\u0142owo again requested the S\u0142awno District Office to commence expropriation proceedings with a view to resolving the applicants\u2019 case. It reminded the District Office that in accordance with section 6 of the 1997 Land Administration Act the protection of properties classified as part of the cultural heritage was in the public interest. The Mayor also noted that the 1987 decision unambiguously excluded any development of the applicants\u2019 plot.", "26. On 14 August 2003 the S\u0142awno District Office informed the applicants of the possibility of exchanging their plot of land for a plot situated in Rusko, the village where they lived. The proposed plot was designated in the local development plan for housing and services. They were further informed that in the event of a refusal on their part the only solution would be the institution of expropriation proceedings at the request of the Regional Inspector of Historic Monuments. However, that procedure could be set in motion only if the Inspector had secured a subsidy from the Governor for the purpose. Accordingly, the applicants were informed that it was not possible to specify when their case might be finally resolved.", "27. By a letter of 22 August 2003 the applicants refused the exchange, stating that the proposed plot did not satisfy their expectations. They expressed their preference for expropriation.", "28. On 30 September 2003 the Mayor of S\u0142awno District informed the Regional Inspector that the negotiations concerning the exchange of plots had failed. In his view, the only solution to the problem consisted in expropriation of the applicants\u2019 property in accordance with the Land Administration Act 1997, and having regard to its section 6(5). Under the 1962 Protection of the Cultural Heritage Act the expropriation could be requested by the regional inspector or the district Mayor. However, the district Mayor did not have the necessary funds to pay compensation in the event of expropriation. Consequently, he informed the Regional Inspector that he could institute the expropriation proceedings only once the Inspector had secured an amount corresponding to the appropriate level of compensation.", "29.

Gmin wyznaniowych \u017cydowskich) to transfer ownership of the property owned by the applicants to it on the grounds that the land had formerly been used as a Jewish cemetery.

From 29 April 1985 to 1 January 1998 the rules governing the administration of land held by the State Treasury and the municipalities were laid down in the Land Administration and Expropriation Act of 29 April 1985 (\u201cthe Land Administration Act 1985\u201d).", "On 1 January 1998 the Land Administration Act 1985 was repealed and the Land Administration Act of 21 August 1997 (Ustawa o gospodarce nieruchomo\u015bciami \u2013 \u201cthe Land Administration Act 1997\u201d) came into force.", "Section 6(5) of the Act, which was introduced by the Protection and Conservation of Monuments Act, stipulates that the protection of real properties classified as monuments within the meaning of the Protection of the Cultural Heritage Act is a public-interest aim.", "Under section 112 of that Act, expropriation consists in taking away, by virtue of an administrative decision, ownership or other rights in rem.
