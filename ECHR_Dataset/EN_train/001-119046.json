The applicant was born in 1937 and lives in Moscow.", "6. On 13 December 2005 she complained to the police about her neighbours. She stated that a \u201cgang\u201d of neighbours had damaged her property and had used \u201cpsychotronic generators\u201d in their apartments and cars to cause damage to her health and mind. The applicant also mentioned in the complaint that she had in the past made submissions to the Federal Security Service, the President of the Russian Federation and the State Duma, which had been unsuccessful.", "7. On 20 January 2006 a police officer took statements from the applicant\u2019s neighbours, who stated that she had behaved unreasonably, walked naked on the streets, shouted at people and accused them of various illegal activities.", "8. The Psychoneurological Outpatient Clinic no. 20 of Moscow (\u201cthe POC\u201d) was requested by the police on 20 January 2006 to carry out a psychiatric examination of the applicant.", "9. On 14 July 2006 a resident psychiatrist at the POC (Ms K.) issued a report confirming the need for a psychiatric examination of the applicant relying on the evidence obtained seven months before. The report stated that the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaints to various authorities gave reason to believe that they were brought about by a pathology associated with a psychiatric disorder. The psychiatrist concluded that an examination of the applicant was necessary, because progressive development of the disorder might cause a deterioration in her health and aggressive behaviour towards others. The report was certified by the head physician of the POC. It is not clear whether the psychiatrist examined the applicant in person before issuing the report.", "10. On the same day Ms K. filed an application with the Kuzminskiy District Court of Moscow (\u201cthe District Court\u201d) seeking authorisation for an involuntary psychiatric examination under section 23, subsection 4 (c) of the Law of the Russian Federation on Psychiatric Assistance and Guarantees of the Citizens\u2019 Rights Related to Its Administration 1992 (\u201cthe Psychiatric Assistance Act\u201d). The application stated that there was evidence of \u201ca psychiatric disorder resulting in significant damage to health due to the deterioration of a psychiatric condition in the absence of psychiatric assistance\u201d. It also indicated that on 20 January 2006, during a police interview, the applicant had refused to consent to undergo a voluntary psychiatric examination. The application was also certified by the head physician of the POC.", "11. Evidence attached to the application included the above-mentioned psychiatrist\u2019s report of 14 July 2006, the applicant\u2019s complaint to the police of 13 December 2005, the police officer\u2019s request of 20 January 2006, and the applicant\u2019s neighbours\u2019 statements of 20 January 2006.", "12. The application was received by the District Court on 27 July 2006 and a hearing was scheduled for 18 August 2006. On 14 August 2006 the court sent a summons to the applicant by registered letter, but that was later returned to the sender after several unsuccessful delivery attempts.", "13. On 18 August 2006 the District Court considered the psychiatrist\u2019s application for involuntary psychiatric examination of the applicant. Neither the applicant nor the representative of the POC were present at the hearing. It was noted in the court transcript and decision that both parties had been duly notified of the hearing but that neither had chosen to appear in court. The District Court authorised a psychiatric examination of the applicant without her consent and ordered it to be carried out either at her home or at the POC. It reasoned as follows:", "\u201cThe court, having examined the evidence, namely the report of the POC on the need for a psychiatric examination, considers the application well-founded ... for the following reasons.", "In accordance with Section 23, subsection 4 of the Psychiatric Assistance Act 1992 ... a psychiatric examination of a person may be carried out without his or his legal representative\u2019s consent when the evidence available suggests that the examinee performs acts giving reason to presume the existence of a severe psychiatric disorder which causes feebleness, i.e. the inability to autonomously satisfy one\u2019s basic needs, or significant damage to health due to the deterioration of a psychiatric condition in the absence of psychiatric assistance.", "The said condition ... has been proven by the POC\u2019s medical report, a copy of the applicant\u2019s complaint to [the police] concerning the use of various types of secret weapons, a copy of a statement by Ms Sh. (Ms Petukhova\u2019s neighbour), who stated that Ms Petukhova behaved unreasonably, walked naked on the streets and shouted at people, as well as by other evidence confirming the need for a psychiatric examination of Ms Petukhova.\u201d", "14. The Court has received no evidence to suggest that the applicant was either notified of the decision or provided with a copy.", "15. More than three months later, on 1 December 2006, the POC sent a request to the police seeking their assistance in the applicant\u2019s apprehension in order to prevent her from potentially behaving aggressively towards others. The request stated that the clinic was unable to ensure that the applicant would attend an examination.", "16. On the same day at around 10 a.m. three policemen visited the applicant\u2019s flat and took her by force to a police station. Having spent four hours there she was transferred by ambulance to Psychiatric Hospital no. 13 (\u201cthe PH-13\u201d). At 2.30 p.m. on arrival at the hospital, the applicant was informed that she had been brought there under the authorisation of the District Court. It is not clear whether she was allowed to read the court order.", "17. Later that day at 4.30 p.m. the applicant was examined by a medical counselling panel and diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia aggravated by paranoid syndrome.", "18. After her release from the hospital on 4 December 2006 the applicant requested the District Court to provide her with a copy of its decision of 18 August 2006 authorising her involuntary psychiatric examination.", "19. On 18 December 2006 the applicant appealed against that decision. She argued, inter alia, that the District Court had examined the case in her absence and that she had not been duly notified of the hearing; that the decision did not contain reasons and that it was based on a single psychiatric report which was accepted by the court without scrutiny.", "20. On 15 February 2007 the Moscow City Court after hearing the applicant and her representative dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal and upheld the authorisation for an involuntary psychiatric examination. The court reasoned that the applicant\u2019s presence at the District Court hearing was not required under Article 306 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Furthermore, it stated that the psychiatric report was well-founded because it contained details of the applicant\u2019s actions giving grounds to presume the existence of a psychiatric disorder.", "21. The applicant applied for supervisory review, but to no avail.", "22. The applicant lodged a constitutional complaint about Article 306 of the Code of Civil Procedure. She alleged that this legal provision did not guarantee her a right to be present during the hearing of an application for involuntary psychiatric examination, since it specified that such applications shall be considered by \u201ca single judge\u201d.", "23. On 18 December 2007 the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint. It argued that the term \u201csingle judge\u201d for the purposes of Article 306 of the Code of Civil Procedure referred only to the composition of a court and did not preclude the parties\u2019 participation in a hearing.", "24. On 1 December 2006 after the applicant was brought to the hospital and diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia aggravated by paranoid syndrome (see paragraphs 16-17 above), the medical panel of the PH-13 concluded that involuntary hospitalisation of the applicant was required under section 29 of the Psychiatric Assistance Act 1992 in order to prevent potentially significant damage to her health due to the deterioration of a psychiatric condition in the absence of psychiatric assistance. The application for involuntary hospitalisation was filed with the Lyubinskiy District Court of Moscow on the same day.", "25. On 4 December 2006 the applicant was discharged from PH-13 and advised to follow an outpatient treatment programme. Later that day the deputy head physician of PH-13 requested the Lyubinskiy District Court of Moscow to discontinue the proceedings concerning the applicant\u2019s involuntary hospitalisation in the light of her discharge from the facility. The request was granted and the proceedings discontinued on 6 December 2006.", "26. The applicant did not initiate any proceedings for review of her hospitalisation.", "27. Article 306 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the Russian Federation of 2002, which entered into force on 1 February 2003, regulates the procedure for the judicial authorisation of involuntary psychiatric examinations. It reads as follows:", "\u201cAn application for involuntary psychiatric examination of a citizen shall be lodged by a psychiatrist with the court at the place of the citizen\u2019s place of residence. A reasoned report by a psychiatrist on the need to conduct such an examination and other evidence shall be attached to the application. Within three days of the application being filed, a single judge shall consider the application for involuntary psychiatric examination and shall decide to either authorise the involuntary psychiatric examination of a citizen or refuse [it].\u201d", "28. The Psychiatric Assistance Act 1992 in section 5 subsection 2 provides a list of the rights of persons suffering from a psychiatric disorder, including the right to be informed of their rights, the nature of their disorder and available treatment, the right to the least restrictive methods of treatment, and the right to the assistance of a lawyer, legal representative or other person. Section 5 subsection 3 prohibits restrictions on the rights of persons suffering from a psychiatric disorder solely on the basis of their diagnosis or their admission to a specialised facility.", "29. Sections 23 and 25 of the Act regulate the procedure for conducting involuntary psychiatric examinations. The relevant parts read as follows:", "\u201c(1) A psychiatric examination shall be conducted in order to determine whether the examinee suffers from a psychiatric disorder and needs psychiatric assistance, and to determine the type of such assistance.", "(2) A psychiatric examination, as well as a prophylactic examination, shall be conducted at the examinee\u2019s request and with his consent ...", "...", "(4) A psychiatric examination of a person may be carried out without his or his legal representative\u2019s consent in cases when the available evidence suggests that the examinee performs acts giving reason to presume the existence of a severe psychiatric disorder which causes:", "...", "c) significant damage to health due to the deterioration of a psychiatric condition in the absence of psychiatric assistance ...\u201d", "\u201c...", "(4) In cases when a person does not present an immediate danger to himself or others, the application for a psychiatric examination shall be submitted in writing and shall contain detailed information giving reasons for the need for examination and an indication of the refusal by the person or his or her legal representative to consult a psychiatrist.

The judge gives sanction within three days from receiving all of the materials ...\u201d", "30. The Police Act 1991 in section 10 establishes the duties of police in law enforcement. In the relevant part it reads as follows:", "\u201cThe police in line with assigned tasks shall:", "...", "(22) deliver to healthcare institutions ... for medical treatment persons refusing to appear, suffering from diseases and presenting danger to themselves and others, and also ... to ensure together with healthcare institutions in cases and under a procedure prescribed by law supervision over persons suffering from mental disorders ... and presenting danger to others ...\u201d", "31. In its decision of 10 March 2005 (no. 62-O) interpreting the Psychiatric Assistance Act 1992, the Constitutional Court stated that judicial proceedings in cases concerning psychiatric assistance must be adversarial and respect the principle of equality of parties. Consequently, a psychiatric facility lodging an application with a court was under an obligation to provide evidence confirming the information stated in such an application.", "32. In the decision of 21 April 2011 (no. 592-O-O) concerning procedural guarantees afforded to individuals subjected to involuntary psychiatric examination, the Constitutional Court concluded that such guarantees were essentially the same as those afforded in the course of involuntary hospitalisation and that they included the duty of the courts to verify all the evidence presented to them.", "33. Article 304 of the Code of Civil Procedure of 2002 establishes the procedural guarantees afforded to a person placed in a psychiatric facility. In the relevant part it reads as follows:", "\u201c1. An application for involuntary placement to a psychiatric facility, or extension of a period of involuntary placement, of a citizen who is suffering from a psychiatric disorder shall be considered by a judge within five days from the date on which the proceedings were initiated.
