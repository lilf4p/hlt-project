On 2 July 2001 the federal armed forces carried out a large-scale \u201csweeping\u201d operation (\u201czachistka\u201d) in the village of Sernovodsk in Chechnya. According to the Government, interior troops of the Ministry of the Interior participated in the operation.", "8. The applicants submitted numerous NGO and press reports on these events as well as statements by other villagers about the general circumstances of the sweeping operation and the detention of their relatives.", "9. According to the applicants, a similar operation took place in the nearby village of Assinovskaya on 3 July 2001, where about 300 persons were detained.", "10. The first applicant is the mother of Apti Isigov, who was born in 1978. The second applicant is the first applicant's daughter and Apti Isigov's sister. They live at 34 Pervomayskaya Street in Sernovodsk. According to the applicants, at the material time Apti Isigov was planning to enrol in a law faculty in Moscow.", "11. According to the first applicant, at about 12 noon on 2 July 2001 an armoured personnel carrier (\u201cAPC\u201d) pulled up in front of their house. The first applicant noted that the APC identification number was Ch025. Several armed men in camouflage uniforms rushed into the courtyard, where the applicant's son Apti Isigov and his cousin Rustam Isigov, who lived in the same house, had been waiting for them with their passports in hand. The first applicant submitted that the documents were in order. Nevertheless, the soldiers had collected the passports without looking at them, pulled the Isigov cousins' shirts over their heads and forced them into the APC. In reply to the first applicant's question about the reasons for their arrest, the servicemen stated that they had orders to detain every man aged between 15 and 50.", "12. The soldiers then searched the house and, according to the first applicant, took some money and household items.", "13. Rustam Isigov later recalled that the APC into which they were put had stopped in a neighbouring street and they had been ordered to get out and to climb into a military truck. He had noticed a serviceman with five or six passports in his hand nearby. There were several people inside the truck, both detainees and servicemen. One of the servicemen had ordered Apti Isigov to climb into the far corner of the truck and to cover himself with a piece of canvas attached to the side. Apti had obeyed.", "14. The detainees had then been taken to a passport checkpoint situated in a field near the village, where the basement of an unfinished building stood. Rustam Isigov and other detainees had been ordered out of the truck. Apti was ordered to stay in the vehicle but got out and sat on the ground with the rest of them. He was frightened and Rustam Isigov had tried to calm him down, even though the detainees were not allowed to talk. About 15 minutes later a man in camouflage uniform had arrived, had looked through a passport he had been holding and had ordered Apti Isigov to climb back into the truck.", "15. The first applicant referred to the statements of other witnesses she had managed to collect which stated that Apti Isigov had then been brought to the APC no. Ch025 and had spent some time inside. Several witnesses among those detained that day stated that they had seen Apti in the APC in the afternoon of 2 July 2001, several hours after his apprehension. One of those witnesses was K. Ch. who had been taken to the passport checkpoint at about 7.40 p.m. and had seen Apti Isigov inside the APC.", "16. The third applicant is the mother of Zelimkhan Umkhanov, who was born in 1972. The fourth applicant is Zelimkhan Umkhanov's wife and the fifth applicant their son. Zelimkhan Umkhanov and his family used to live in Grozny, but after the resumption of hostilities moved to Sernovodsk to his mother's home because he thought they would be safer there.", "17. The third and fourth applicants did not witness Zelimkhan Umkhanov's detention but referred to eye-witness statements submitted by them to the Court. According to those statements, at about 4 p.m. on 2 July 2001 Zelimkhan Umkhanov was detained in Groznensky Lane in Sernovodosk. The applicants submitted several statements of villagers who had witnessed Zelimkhan's detention in the street. Several witnesses, including K. Ch. (see above), stated that they had seen Zelimkhan Umkhanov in APC no. Ch025 in the afternoon of 2 July 2001.", "18. The first, third and fourth applicants, along with other relatives of those detained during the \u201csweeping\u201d operation, walked to the edge of the field where the men had been detained and remained there until about midnight. The guards did not allow them to approach any nearer.", "19. According to the applicants, at about 6 p.m. an officer with the rank of major came out and reassured them that all the detainees would be released 30 minutes later. He also told them that he shared their indignation and that he had already talked to his superiors about the events. Later that evening he came out once again and repeated his comments.", "20. At about 8 p.m. the women saw some of the detainees being put into two buses. When the buses drove off, the women tried to block them, but the soldiers started to shoot at the ground in front of the crowd and dispersed them.", "21. The men from Sernovodsk remained detained at the passport checkpoint in the field until the early hours of 3 July 2001. At about 11 p.m. the military started to release them in small groups, and by 2 a.m. there was no one left in the field. About forty men were not released, however, and their relatives were eventually told that they had been taken to the Temporary Office of the Interior of Achkhoy-Martan District (\u201cthe Achkhoy-Martan VOVD\u201d). Apti Isigov and Zelimkhan Umkhanov were not released that night, and the applicants have had no news of them since.", "22. Early in the morning on 3 July 2001 the fourth applicant went to the military camp in an attempt to obtain information about her husband from the major who had talked to them the night before, but the military were already leaving and she was unable to speak to anyone.", "23. Later in the morning on 3 July 2001 the first, third and fourth applicants, along with other relatives who had not seen their detained family members since the previous day, went to the Achkhoy-Martan VOVD. There they were shown a list of about forty names of persons from Sernovodsk, including Apti Isigov and Zelimkhan Umkhanov, who had been brought to the Achkhoy-Martan VOVD. According to the applicants, during the day detainees were gradually released from the Achkhoy-Martan VOVD, but they told the applicants that they had not seen their relatives inside. In the evening of 3 July 2001 the head of the Sernovodsk village administration joined the applicants at the Achkhoy-Martan VOVD. In reply to their enquiries the officials there denied that the two men had ever been brought there, contrary to what they had said in the morning.", "24. On 4 July 2001 the applicants went to the village of Assinovskaya, in which a similar \u201csweeping\u201d operation was being carried out. They saw the APC with the identification number Ch025 there and the same truck in which their two relatives had been taken away from Sernovodsk two days earlier, a Ural with identification no. O 10 03 KSh.", "25. On the same date the applicants also talked to R. Kh., who had attended the same school as Apti Isigov and knew him quite well. He stated that on 3 July 2001 he had seen Apti Isigov and Zelimkhan Umkhanov in a military Ural truck in Assinovskaya. R. Kh. said that he had heard someone asking for water from inside the truck saying that \u201cwe have not had any water since yesterday\u201d and when one of the military lifted the canvas to give him some water, the witness had seen two men, one of whom he had immediately recognised as Apti Isigov. Both men had traces of beatings on their faces, and Zelimkhan's hand was hurt, probably broken. R. Kh.'s written statement was submitted to the Court.", "26. That day the applicants waited near the passport checkpoint in the field near Assinovskaya until 3 a.m. hoping that their relatives would be released together with the detainees from that village, but in vain.", "27. They and their other relatives continued to search for the two missing men. On numerous occasions, both in person and in writing, they applied to prosecutors at various levels, to the Ministry of the Interior, to the administrative authorities in Chechnya, to the Special Envoy of the Russian President for Rights and Freedoms in the Chechen Republic, to the media and to public figures. In their letters to the authorities the applicants gave details of the detention of Apti Isigov and Zelimkhan Umkhanov and asked for assistance and information about the investigation, but were given hardly anything of substance. On several occasions they and other relatives received copies of letters forwarding their requests to various prosecution services.", "28. On 4 and 5 July 2001 the applicants and their relatives applied in person to the Prosecutor's Office of the Achkhoy-Martan District and submitted a written complaint.

On 5 July 2001 the Prosecutor's Office of the Achkhoy-Martan District forwarded the applicants' complaints to the Achkhoy-Martan VOVD. The latter replied to the first applicant in a letter of 10 July 2001 that Apti Isigov had not been detained by the VOVD and that the local office of the Interior had no information about his whereabouts.", "30. On 12 July 2001 the third applicant wrote to the head of the administration of the Sunzhenskiy District and asked for assistance in finding Zelimkhan Umkhanov and Apti Isigov.

He described in detail the events of 2 July 2001 and requested that his cousin be found.", "32. On 17 July 2001 the Prosecutor's Office of the Achkhoy-Martan District informed the third applicant that her son had not been detained by personnel of the district department of the Interior and had not been brought to the Achkhoy-Martan VOVD.", "33. On 13 August 2001 the second and fourth applicants wrote to the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic to complain that they had not been granted victim status in the criminal proceedings concerning the disappearance of their brother and husband respectively. On the same date the fourth applicant requested the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic to institute criminal proceedings in respect of her husband's abduction.", "34. The applicants reiterated their requests for assistance in searching for their relatives and information on the progress of the investigation to the Prosecutor General's Office on 16 August 2001 and 2 October 2001, the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic on 16 August 2001, 12 and 23 September 2001 and the Minister of Defence on 1 October 2001.", "35. On 8 July 2001 the Prosecutor's Office of the Achkhoy-Martan District instituted criminal proceedings in connection with numerous complaints of the residents of Sernovodsk of abuse of authority by federal servicemen during a special operation of 2 July 2001. The case file was assigned number 27031.", "36. On 10 September 2001 the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic informed the third applicant of the decision of 8 July 2001, stating that the disappearance of Apti Isigov and Zelimkhan Umkhanov was being investigated in the context of those proceedings. On 3 October 2001 the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic informed the applicants that the proceedings in criminal case no. 27031 were pending and that they would be informed of the outcome.", "37. On 19 October 2001 the Ministry of the Interior replied to the applicants that their complaint had been forwarded to the Chechen Department of the Interior and that the search for their relatives would remain under the control of the Ministry.", "38. On 22 November 2001 the Ministry of the Interior informed the applicants that a number of steps aiming at locating their relatives' whereabouts had been taken. In particular, the Achkhoy-Martan VOVD had opened \u201csearch files\u201d (\u0440\u043e\u0437\u044b\u0441\u043a\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430) and the two men had been included in the federal search database as well as in the system of identification of unidentified bodies. However, those efforts had not brought any results thus far. The letter assured the applicants that they would be informed of any results of the search.", "39. On 10 September 2002 the third applicant requested the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic to update her on the results of the investigation.", "40. In similar letters dated 3 October 2002 the latter replied to each of the applicants that on 8 July 2001 the Prosecutor's Office of the Achkhoy-Martan District had opened criminal investigation no. 27031 in connection with the allegations of abuse of authority, unlawful use of violence and detention, theft and destruction of property during the special operation in Sernovodsk on 2-4 July 2001 and that the investigation was being conducted by the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic. It had established that at about 11.20 a.m. and 4 p.m. respectively on 2 July 2001, Apti Isigov and Zelimkhan Umkhanov had been detained and that their whereabouts had remained unknown since. APC no. Ch025 belonged to military unit no. 6783, which had participated in the operation. During questioning, the APC crew had stated that they had taken a number of people to the location of Ministry of Justice detachments which had been carrying out identity checks on the detainees. The investigating authorities had also questioned a number of servicemen from the Ministry of Justice who had stated that pursuant to an order of Lieutenant-Colonel G., the deputy commander of the operation, they had put two \u201cChechens\u201d into a separate vehicle. On 5 July 2001, also upon the deputy commander's orders, the two men had been taken to the military base in Khankala (the main Russian military base in Chechnya) where they had been handed over to servicemen from the Ministry of the Interior. However, given that no record concerning their apprehension or detention had been drawn up, it had been impossible to establish their identities. The letters did not specify whether Lieutenant-Colonel G. had been questioned as a witness. It was further stated that the investigating authorities had been unable either to identify those responsible or to establish the whereabouts of Apti Isigov and Zelimkhan Umkhanov. The search had also involved verification of unidentified bodies in Chechnya and the neighbouring regions. The relatives of those missing had been granted victim status in the criminal proceedings. The letters concluded that on 12 June 2002 the investigation had been suspended owing to the failure to identify the alleged perpetrators.", "41. According to the applicants, between July 2001 and May 2002 at least five investigators of the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic had been appointed in turn to deal with the case. The missing men's personal details, such as their height, shoe size and photographs, had only been collected from the applicants in the spring of 2002. The applicants also submitted that the investigators had complained to them that they had had no answers or assistance from the military authorities of the Khankala base in establishing the whereabouts of Apti Isigov and Zelimkhan Umkhanov.", "42. On 26 October 2002 the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic, in reply to a query from the first applicant, confirmed that her son was being searched for by the law-enforcement bodies and that the investigation in criminal case no. 27031 had been suspended on 12 June 2002, as it had been impossible to identify those responsible.", "43. On 12 November 2002 similar information was sent to Zelimkhan Umkhanov's father.", "44. In a letter of 20 March 2003 the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic informed the fourth applicant that the criminal proceedings in case no. 27031 had been resumed on 19 March 2003.", "45. In a letter of 18 April 2003 the SRJI, on behalf of the first and third applicants, requested the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic to inform them of the developments in the investigation and to grant them victim status in the proceedings. On 24 July 2003 the SRJI sent a copy of its previous letter to the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic, as it had not received any reply. On the same date the applicants forwarded a similar letter to the Prosecutor General's Office.", "46. On 19 April 2003 the investigation was suspended on account of the failure to identify the culprits.", "47.

According to the Government, \u201chaving obtained reliable information that Apti Isigov and Zelimkhan Umkhanov had disappeared during the special operation\u201d, on 14 April 2003 the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic decided that a case in respect of the disappearance of the applicants' two relatives under Article 126 (2) of the Russian Criminal Code (aggravated kidnapping) should be opened and severed from criminal case no. 27031. It appears that the new case was first assigned number 59114 which was then changed to number 34/33/0506-03. It was sent for investigation to the military prosecutor's office of military unit no. 20102 in Khankala in order to check the possible involvement of military personnel in the alleged offence.", "49. In his decision of 14 April 2003 to open criminal case no. 59114, the deputy prosecutor of the Chechen Republic, \u201chaving examined the information on a criminal offence committed on 2 July 2001 during the special operation of the federal forces in Sernovodsk, which had been submitted by an investigator of the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic on 14 April 2003\u201d, established that:", "\u201cOn 2 July 2001, during a special operation in the village of Sernovodsk of the Sunzhenskiy District of the Chechen Republic, A.A.
