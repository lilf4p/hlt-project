They were represented before the Court by Mr D. Rotar, an advocate practising in Zagreb. The Croatian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mrs \u0160. Sta\u017enik.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "On 1 January 1997 the Act on Compensation for, and Restitution of, Property Taken under the Yugoslav communist regime (Zakon o naknadi za imovinu oduzetu za vrijeme jugoslavenske komunisti\u010dke vladavine \u2013 \u201cthe Denationalisation Act\u201d) entered into force. It enabled the former owners of confiscated or nationalised property, or their heirs in the first line of succession (direct descendants or a spouse), to obtain under certain conditions either restitution of or compensation for property appropriated during the communist regime. They were required to submit their requests within six months from the Act\u2019s entry into force. Requests submitted after that date were to be declared inadmissible.", "Pursuant to section 22 of the Denationalisation Act, nationalised flats in respect of which third persons had acquired specially protected tenancies (stanarsko pravo) were not to be restored to their former owners. The tenants had a right to purchase such flats from the provider of the flat under favourable conditions set out in the Specially Protected Tenancies (Sale to Occupier) Act (Zakon o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo). At the same time, the former owners were entitled to financial compensation in respect of the flats.", "On the other hand, pursuant to section 32 of the Denationalisation Act, confiscated flats were to be awarded to their former owners. Under section 13 of the Appropriated Property Compensation Fund Act (Zakon o Fondu za naknadu oduzete imovine), the tenant had the right to purchase a confiscated flat only if no request for its restitution had been submitted or if such request had been dismissed in a final decision.", "The applicants were holders of the specially protected tenancy of a flat in Zagreb, measuring 125 square metres. The flat is located in the same building, which on 28 November 1945 was confiscated from its owner T.G. by the communist authorities.", "On 25 March 1997 the applicants made a request to the City of Zagreb to purchase their flat, under the Specially Protected Tenancies (Sale to Occupier) Act.", "On 9 March 1998 the applicants asked the Office for Property Affairs of the City of Zagreb (Grad Zagreb, Gradski ured za imovinskopravne poslove) whether a request for restitution of the building in which their flat was located had been submitted. In their letter of 28 May 1998 the Office replied that no such request had been submitted.", "On 10 September 1998 the City of Zagreb, as the provider of the flat, concluded a contract of sale with the applicants whereby it sold them the flat in respect of which they had a specially protected tenancy for 87,255 Croatian kunas (HRK). Shortly afterwards the applicants were recorded as the owners of the flat in the land register.", "Meanwhile, on 13 June 1997 K. and F.G. and M.D., the heirs of the former owner T.G., (\u201cthe heirs of T.G.\u201d or \u201cT.G.\u2019s heirs\u201d) instituted administrative proceedings before the Office for Property Affairs of the City of Zagreb by submitting a request for restitution of T.G.\u2019s confiscated property, including the above-mentioned building.", "On 11 June 1999 the Office delivered a partial decision awarding ownership of all business premises in the building at issue to the heirs of T.G.", "On 19 January 2001 the Office delivered another partial decision awarding ownership of all flats in the building, except the applicants\u2019 flat and one other, to T.G.\u2019s heirs.", "On 3 January 2007 the Office delivered the last partial decision whereby it awarded ownership of the two remaining flats, including the applicants\u2019 flat, to the heirs of T.G. and declared that the applicants had acquired the status of protected lessees (za\u0161ti\u0107eni najmoprimci) under section 33 of the Denationalisation Act. The applicants appealed.", "It appears that the proceedings are currently pending before the Ministry of Justice (Ministarstvo pravosu\u0111a), as the second-instance administrative authority.", "On 20 July 2001 the heirs of T.G. brought a civil action against the applicants and the City of Zagreb in the Zagreb Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Zagrebu). They asked the court to declare the above contract of sale null and void as being contrary to peremptory rules. They argued that under the Denationalisation Act, confiscated flats were not to be sold to their tenants but awarded to their former owners. Only if the former owner\u2019s request for restitution had been dismissed or declared inadmissible were the tenants allowed to purchase such flats. They plaintiffs explained that on 13 June 1997 they had submitted a request for restitution of the entire building in which the flat in question was located with the Office for Property Affairs of the City of Zagreb, and that this request had not been dismissed or declared inadmissible by the time the impugned contract of sale had been concluded. On the contrary, on 11 June 1999 and 19 January 2001 that Office had adopted decisions awarding them ownership of the building with all the flats and business premises in it. Therefore, the City of Zagreb had not been allowed to sell the flat while the request for its restitution was pending. The applicants replied that it was the same Office for Property Affairs which in its letter of 28 May 1998 had informed them that no request for restitution had been lodged in respect of their flat. They had therefore acted in good faith when they had concluded the contract of sale and should not suffer the consequences of the mistake made by the authorities.", "On 4 February 2004 the court declared the impugned contract of sale null and void ab initio, endorsing the arguments adduced by the plaintiffs. In doing so it noted the applicants\u2019 main argument that they had been misinformed by the authorities, but did not expressly address that argument. It confined itself to stating that the contract was in breach of peremptory rules and therefore null and void from its inception. The applicants appealed.", "On 18 October 2005 the Zagreb County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Zagrebu) dismissed an appeal by the applicants and upheld the first-instance judgment endorsing the reasons given therein. It added that the Office for Property Affairs had obviously made a clerical error when on 28 May 1998 it had informed the applicants that no request for restitution had been submitted as regards the building in which their flat was located. However, since it had been established beyond doubt that the plaintiffs had indeed submitted such a request, the City of Zagreb had breached peremptory rules when later on it sold the flat to the applicants.", "The applicants then lodged a constitutional complaint, alleging violations of their constitutional rights to property and equality before the law.", "On 24 January 2007 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 constitutional complaint and served its decision on their representative on 13 February 2007. It agreed with the findings of the lower courts and added that the letter of the Office for Property Affairs of 28 May 1998 could not be considered a certificate or an extract from the official records, that is, a public document in respect of which it could have been presumed that the information it contained was correct. It explained that this was so because the offices for property affairs had not been keeping records on requests submitted under the Denationalisation Act.", "The Act on Compensation for, and Restitution of, Property Taken During the Yugoslav Communist Regime (Zakon o naknadi za imovinu oduzetu za vrijeme jugoslavenske komunisti\u010dke vladavine, Official Gazette nos. 92/1996, 92/1999 (corrigendum), 80/2002 (amendments) and 81/2002 (corrigendum) \u2013 \u201cthe 1996 Denationalisation Act\u201d), which entered into force on 1 January 1997, enables the former owners of confiscated or nationalised property, or their heirs in the first line of succession (direct descendants and a spouse), to seek under certain conditions either restitution of or compensation for appropriated property.
