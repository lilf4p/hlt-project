They are close relatives of Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz, respectively the President and Secretary of the Silopi branch of the People's Democracy Party (Halk\u0131n Demokrasi Partisi (HADEP)).", "13. The applicants alleged that Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz received death threats from the Silopi gendarmerie command and the \u015e\u0131rnak gendarmerie regimental headquarters on account of their political activities.", "14. At about 1.30 p.m. on 25 January 2001, three people in a blue Fiat purporting to be police officers attempted to force Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f to get into the car. Having informed them that he would go to the central gendarmerie station only if he received an official summons, he made his way to HADEP's offices. On receiving a call on his mobile phone from the gendarmerie commanding officer, he went to the station accompanied by Ebubekir Deniz. Three witnesses, \u00d6mer Sansur, \u0130sa Kanat and Hamit Belge, saw them enter the station.", "15. An hour later, unable to reach the men on their mobile phones, their families and lawyers asked the Silopi public prosecutor and the Silopi gendarmerie command for information. The commanding officer, S\u00fcleyman Can, told them on the telephone that neither man had attended the station or been taken into custody.", "16. On 1 February 2001, after the incident was reported in the press, the \u015e\u0131rnak provincial governor issued a written statement indicating that the two men had gone to the Silopi gendarmerie station on 25 January 2001, stayed for half an hour, and then left the premises.", "17.

After criminal complaints were lodged by the two men's families, the Silopi public prosecutor launched an investigation and took statements from the applicants. The relevant authorities were notified that they were missing and their photographs and descriptions were circulated to the public prosecutor's offices and police headquarters in the province.", "21. On 26 February 2001, at the request of the prosecutor leading the investigation, the district court made an order under Article 143 of the Code of Criminal Procedure restricting access to the preliminary investigation file.", "22.

He was living in Cizre at the material time, and ran a petrol station in Ba\u015fveren (Silopi). He last saw his son, who lived in Silopi, on 24 January 2001.", "25. Before commencing his military service, that is to say prior to November 2000, his son had worked as a driver transporting fuel from Iraq. Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f was the only child providing for the family, as the other children had not completed their studies. The witness said that he had heard that after returning from military service Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and a group of friends had taken steps to open a local branch of HADEP in Silopi.", "26. In October 2000 the witness and his brother were arrested by gendarmes on their way to work. His brother was released, but the witness was taken to Cizre district gendarmerie station. On the same day the gendarmes searched his home in his presence and made him sign a record. He was then taken to \u015e\u0131rnak gendarmerie headquarters, where he was held for seven days. He was made to wear a blindfold during questioning, so could not identify his interrogator. His interrogator told him: \u201cGive up your HADEP activities. If you don't, it will cost you your life.\u201d The witness was tried with four co-defendants and spent approximately fifty-seven days in prison. The person who made the accusations against them subsequently sent a letter to the authorities informing them that he had been acting under duress and did not even know the defendants.", "27. The witness then gave details of a meeting he had had with the commanding officer, Levent Ers\u00f6z, at the \u015e\u0131rnak regimental headquarters. The commanding officer had threatened him, saying: \u201cGive up the idea of opening a local branch of HADEP in Silopi. I don't want to hear what you have to say, this is my area. If you don't give it up, I will not let you live.\u201d", "28. The witness said that he had also been summoned by S\u00fcleyman Can, the commanding officer of the Silopi district gendarmerie, in January 2001, approximately two weeks before his son went missing. S\u00fcleyman Can had said to him \u201cTell Serdar to give up this business\u201d and had telephoned Levent Ers\u00f6z, who asked to speak to the witness and said: \u201cWhy didn't Serdar come and see me? You tell him that if he doesn't come today, I'll kill him if he ever sets foot in the \u015e\u0131rnak area again. Tell him that. He knows my position and rank.\u201d", "29. The witness and his son M\u00fcd\u00fcr went back to see S\u00fcleyman Can, who repeated his earlier warning: \u201cTell him to give up that business. All his colleagues have resigned. He's the only one who's stayed on. If he doesn't resign, he'll come to grief.\u201d Before leaving the premises, they asked S\u00fcleyman Can to convince Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f himself or to put pressure on him.", "30. On being asked by the witness why he had not gone to see the \u015e\u0131rnak commanding officer, Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f replied that he had spoken to him on the telephone and added that after the party's inauguration he had received a call from S\u00fcleyman Can and had told him: \u201cCommanding Officer, if I give it up, someone else will replace me. I was born in the area and know the situation better and am not carrying out any illegal activity; I will not leave the party.\u201d", "31. The witness's nephew Ey\u00fcp Tan\u0131\u015f told him that on 25 January 2001 an attempt had been made to force Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f into a vehicle outside the post office. He had told the occupants that he would only do as they said if he received a call from the \u201cofficial\u201d authorities.", "32. The witness said that his son and Ebubekir Deniz went to the gendarmerie station after receiving a telephone call from that source. The two men got on well and worked together for HADEP. Ebubekir Deniz had also received threats because of his political activities and, like Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f, had been forced into hiding before the branch opened. Owing to the intimidation, he had been unable to continue working. The witness added that the entire family had suffered as a result of Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f's political activities.", "33. He said that on the night of 25 January he was informed by his nephew \u0130dris Tan\u0131\u015f that Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz had not returned from the station. For four or five days the authorities denied that they had been there. On the sixth day the commanding officer said that, as he had been out on a tour of inspection, the two men had been seen by a non-commissioned officer, Selim G\u00fcl, and had left the premises half an hour later. The witness lodged a complaint with the public prosecutor on 28 or 29 January. Subsequently he and Mehmet Ata Deniz went to see the commanding officer S\u00fcleyman Can, who repeated that they had been on the premises for half an hour, but had then left. He told them: \u201cWe handed them over to the J\u0130TEM [Jandarma \u0130stihbarat Ter\u00f6rle M\u00fccadele \u2013 Gendarmerie Anti-Terrorist Intelligence Branch] ... the J\u0130TEM does not take orders from the regimental commanding officer.\u201d", "34. The witness affirmed that he had been held in custody at the \u015e\u0131rnak Security Directorate because of a letter addressed to him that had allegedly been seized in a vehicle that had entered Turkey from Iraq. The police told him that the letter said that his son was in the PKK camps. The witness considered that incident to be part of a \u201cplot\u201d against them.", "35. Ey\u00fcp Tan\u0131\u015f said that he was born in 1976 and was living in Silopi at the material time. He was a cousin of Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and a former administrator of the local branch of HADEP.", "36. He too stated that threats had been made against Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f by the regimental commanding officer of the gendarmerie because of his attempts to open a local branch of HADEP in Silopi. Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f had been subjected to intimidation and followed by plain-clothes police officers. He had been forced to leave Silopi and had spent approximately one month in Diyarbak\u0131r. The witness said that he too had been followed on a number of occasions. All seven of the HADEP party administrators had received threats and three had resigned as a result.", "37. On the morning of 25 January 2001, the witness and Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f went to the HADEP offices, where the other party members were also present. Towards noon he went with Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f to the post office. A car with three people inside pulled up in front of them. The driver and one of the passengers opened a rear door and asked them to get in. Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f refused, saying: \u201cWe don't know you and if there's anything to be discussed, then we'll talk in an official institution, at the Silopi gendarmerie station or Security Directorate if you like \u2013 in an official place like that.\u201d Unable to persuade the witness and Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f to accompany them, the three people, who said they were police officers, left the scene. The witness and Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f then returned to HADEP's offices. The witness left for a short period during which it appears that Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f received a telephone call from the commanding officer of the gendarmerie and went to the station with Ebubekir Deniz. After waiting for approximately twenty minutes, the witness made several unsuccessful attempts to reach Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f on his mobile phone. According to the witness, the driver of the minibus who took them to the station saw them enter the building.", "38. The witness said that he made a statement before the Silopi public prosecutor. He also answered questions by an investigating officer and provided a description enabling an identikit picture to be prepared of the two people who attempted to force Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz into the car. He subsequently attended the public prosecutor's office three times to examine photographs. At one of the sessions he indicated that he recognised the driver of the car in one of the photographs and found a strong likeness in another. In that connection, the witness confirmed the content of the identification record that was drawn up on 26 February 2001.", "39. The threats prompted by their political activities in HADEP continued after January 2001 and on one occasion the police searched the party's offices.", "40. The witness added that before starting his military service Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f was in the business of transporting fuel from Iraq and did not engage in any political activity. He repeated that on 25 January Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f went to the Silopi gendarmerie station with Ebubekir Deniz after receiving a telephone call from the commanding officer. The two men had been subjected to intimidation by the authorities when transporting fuel in their vehicles. They had threatened to withdraw Ebubekir Deniz's operator's licence and certificate. All the intimidation was linked to their political activities.", "41. The witness said that following Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f's disappearance he became the acting President pending the next HADEP congress. In 2002 he was taken into custody at Silopi gendarmerie station. Around 7 a.m. one morning a military vehicle drew up outside his house. He was taken to the Silopi gendarmerie station. He was blindfolded and told: \u201cYou must resign from HADEP!\u201d He refused and was tortured and threats were made to kill him like Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz. He was brought before a judge and accused of having PKK documents at his home. He lodged a criminal complaint against the officers who were on duty when he was in custody.", "42. Yakup Tan\u0131\u015f said he was an applicant and one of Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f's brothers. He was born in 1978 and was studying in Isparta at the material time. He returned to Silopi on 27 January 2001 following his brother's disappearance.", "43. He saw his brother when their father was taken into custody by the gendarmerie. His father telephoned him to say that he was with an officer and asked him to contact Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f to persuade him to resign from HADEP.", "44. Yakup Tan\u0131\u015f also confirmed that the family had been subjected to intimidation by the authorities on account of his brother's political activities. Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f could not remain in Silopi. He feared that he would be arrested and had been threatened by Levent Ers\u00f6z and S\u00fcleyman Can, the commanding officers of the gendarmeries of \u015e\u0131rnak and Silopi respectively. Ebubekir Deniz was in the same position. Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f had sent a complaint to the authorities about the threats that had been made against him and had asked for protection. The witness said that he had seen the complaint in question.", "45. The witness said that despite various attempts he was unable to gain any information from the authorities about his brother. He had even been taken to the police station twice, where he was instructed not to write any further letters to the authorities. A person called Mahmut had threatened to kill him like his brother.", "46. Mehmet Ata Deniz said that he was an applicant and Ebubekir Deniz's brother. He was assisted by an interpreter when giving evidence. He was born in 1963 and lived in Silopi.", "47. He confirmed that before they went missing his brother and Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f had been forced to go to Diyarbak\u0131r by the threats and intimidation to which they had been subjected on account of their activities as members of HADEP. Their wives, who lived in Silopi, feared reprisals by the authorities and moved frequently.", "48. The witness said that approximately twenty days before his disappearance his brother had been arrested at the Habur checkpoint at the border with northern Iraq, and his operator's licence had been seized. The intimidation against his brother had begun when he joined HADEP.", "49. The witness described a meeting he had had with Captain S\u00fcleyman Can. He and \u015euayip Tan\u0131\u015f had gone to the gendarmerie station to make enquiries about Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz. He had said to the captain: \u201cYou have handed them over to the J\u0130TEM\u201d, to which the captain had replied that the J\u0130TEM was not under his orders or the orders of the \u015e\u0131rnak regimental commanding officer.", "50. The witness said that he had made two statements to the Silopi public prosecutor without the assistance of an interpreter. His statements had been recorded by the public prosecutor, who had noted that he was illiterate and did not understand Turkish.", "51. The three witnesses were born in 1981, 1978 and 1975. Zehra Deniz is the wife and Divan Arsu the partner of Ebubekir Deniz. Selma G\u00fcngen is Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f's wife.", "52. They confirmed that the authorities had threatened and intimidated both men on account of their activities as members of HADEP. They said that they had been afraid to remain in Silopi and had been forced to leave their home for a time.", "53. \u00d6mer Sansur was born in 1981 and was living in Silopi at the material time.", "54. He said that he was present at HADEP's offices when Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f received a telephone call from the gendarmerie station. Although it was Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f who received the summons to go to the station, Ebubekir Deniz insisted on accompanying him.", "55.

Ebcet Sunmez was born in 1978 and was living in Cizre at the material time. He was a lorry driver and travelled from time to time to Iraq with Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz.

He said that Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f had told him in telephone conversations that he had been subjected to intimidation and threats because of his political activities, and that he had had to leave Silopi for approximately one month and had attended to the administrative formalities required to open a branch of HADEP in Silopi in Diyarbak\u0131r.", "60. The witness gave this account of a visit he and \u015euayip Tan\u0131\u015f had made to the commanding officer of the Silopi gendarmerie S\u00fcleyman Can:", "\u201cApproximately twenty days before Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f's disappearance, I drove \u015euayip Tan\u0131\u015f to the Silopi district command. He had been summoned by S\u00fcleyman Can, who met us and told \u015euayip Tan\u0131\u015f that he wanted to speak to Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f to get him to give up his activities as a member of HADEP. S\u00fcleyman Can said that Levent Ers\u00f6z, the commanding officer of the \u015e\u0131rnak regiment, had asked to speak to \u015euayip Tan\u0131\u015f. He reached Levent Ers\u00f6z on the telephone in \u0130dil where he was on a tour of inspection. After speaking for approximately three minutes outside his office, S\u00fcleyman Can passed the telephone to \u015euayip Tan\u0131\u015f. As it was a cordless phone, I was able to hear the conversation. The commanding officer said to him: 'Tell Serdar to come and see me tomorrow, otherwise he had better not ever set foot in \u015e\u0131rnak again, or I'll kill him.' \u201d", "The witness added that after leaving the station \u015euayip Tan\u0131\u015f telephoned Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f to ask him to go and see the commanding officer.

The delegation from the Human Rights Association asked the public prosecutor why he had not gone to the station himself. The public prosecutor replied that he considered the answer he had received from the commanding officer on the telephone sufficient and urged them to pursue their enquiries in \u015e\u0131rnak.", "65. The witness said that he and Osman Baydemir had failed to get an audience with either the commanding officer of the Silopi gendarmerie or the district governor. The delegation went the same day to see the \u015e\u0131rnak public prosecutor. He had been informed of the incident and was waiting for written information from the Silopi public prosecutor's office.

Resul Sadak was born in 1959 and was living in \u015e\u0131rnak at the material time. In January 2001 he was the President of the local branch of HADEP in \u015e\u0131rnak.

In 1999, when he and others were in the process of trying to open a local branch of HADEP in \u015e\u0131rnak, they too had been subjected to intimidation and threats by the authorities. Three members of the party in Silopi had been forced to resign as a result of the intimidation. The party had only been able to assemble five members instead of seven. Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f had informed him of the pressure being exerted on him and in January 2001 had handed over a letter in his presence to the President of the Diyarbak\u0131r office of HADEP giving details of the threats and intimidation to which he and members of the party in Silopi had been subjected by the commanding officer of the \u015e\u0131rnak regiment.", "74. The witness asserted that at the beginning of January 2001 he was arrested by gendarmes on the road from \u015e\u0131rnak to Diyarbak\u0131r and summoned to the \u015e\u0131rnak regimental headquarters. The commanding officer threatened him and expressed his displeasure at the opening of local party branches in Silopi and Cizre.

Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f informed him of all the threats and intimidation to which he and his entourage had been subjected.

The witness said that Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f had been anxious and concerned about the threats and arranged for his lawyer to draft five or six copies of a petition to the public prosecutor and other authorities, informing them of the intimidation and pressure to which he and his entourage were being subjected by the commanding officer of the \u015e\u0131rnak gendarmerie regiment. On 8 January 2001 Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f gave him the petitions. However, fearing reprisals, he kept them until 25 January 2001, when he handed them over to the lawyers dealing with the case.", "81. Mahmut Damar was born in 1971. He was a sergeant at Silopi gendarmerie district command and a traffic team commander at the material time.", "82. He said that approximately eighty people worked at the station. He described the premises and said that in addition to the main entrance there was a separate entrance for officers on the left-hand side of the building.", "83. From 25 January until 9 a.m. on 26 January 2001 he was the duty officer and assisted non-commissioned officer Faruk Atalay. His duties were to monitor and record incidents and to supervise the activities of the soldiers. Sergeant Veysel Ate\u015f was responsible for recording the names of visitors at the main entrance.", "84. Mr Damar said that visitors were required to leave proof of identity and to sign the register. They were given a badge to enter the building.", "85. He said that no incidents had been recorded on 25 January 2001. He did not know Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f or Ebubekir Deniz and learnt of their disappearance from the press and from discussions within the gendarmerie.", "86. Cemal G\u00fcld\u00fcler was born in 1968 and was a non-commissioned officer at Silopi district gendarmerie command at the material time. He had administrative duties relating to personnel.", "87.

The witness said that in January they carried out a tour of inspection. He could not remember whether the commanding officer of the \u015e\u0131rnak regiment had taken part. He confirmed that people entering or leaving the station were required to sign a register.", "89. Arif Aydo\u011fan was born in 1979. He was performing his military service at Silopi district gendarmerie command at the material time. He was on guard duty inside the building.", "90. He did not know Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f or Ebubekir Deniz. He had heard of them through the public prosecutor.", "91. The witness said that he could not recall the following statement he made on 29 January 2001:", "\u201cThe witness was shown photographs of Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz. He said, 'The persons you have shown me did not enter the station while I was on duty ... on 25 January 2001. As a great many civilians enter or leave the station, it is not easy to keep track of them'.\u201d", "92. Mehmet Ta\u015fdan was born in 1979. He was performing his military service at Silopi district gendarmerie command at the material time. He was on guard duty at the main entrance to the station.", "93.

He had made a statement to the public prosecutor, who showed him photographs of the men and asked him if he knew them and whether he had seen them previously at the station. That is how he learnt that they were missing.", "95. Selim G\u00fcl was born in 1968. He was a non-commissioned officer engaged in operations intelligence at Silopi district gendarmerie command at the material time.", "96. He said that his job was to gather intelligence for use in maintaining public order and preventing crime. He was the leader of a two-man team. He and his colleague reported to the commanding officer, S\u00fcleyman Can. The usual source of their information was individuals.", "97. The witness knew Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz. Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f contacted him by telephone at the end of 2000 to ask him for help as his father had been taken into custody for providing assistance and support to a terrorist organisation. Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f offered to provide information in exchange. The witness first met Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f in January 2001 in the commanding officer's office. Their discussion lasted several minutes, but the witness could not remember what it was about. They did not speak about Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f's HADEP activities and he was not subjected to pressure or intimidation.", "98. The witness said that Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f provided him with information. He got in touch when he had information to pass on and in some ways acted as an agent for the witness and Captain S\u00fcleyman Can. The witness said that the first time he saw Ebubekir Deniz was on 25 January 2001.", "99. On that date he saw both Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz in the waiting-room on the second floor of the gendarmerie station. They had come to see S\u00fcleyman Can about Ebubekir Deniz being disqualified from driving. The witness did not summon them to the building. As the commanding officer was not there, they left the waiting-room, Ebubekir Deniz first. The witness spoke with Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f for approximately thirty seconds and he handed him documents wrapped in a newspaper he had taken out of the inside pocket of his jacket. One of the documents concerned HADEP, the other, contraband. The witness parted company with the two men in the building and saw them leave by the main entrance. However, he lost sight of them once they were in the street.", "100. The witness did not recall when or how he was informed of their disappearance. He was questioned by the public prosecutor about it. He could not really remember whether he had handed the documents over to the public prosecutor.", "101. He said that he gathered information about HADEP and other political parties as part of his job and that gendarmerie officers working in intelligence used unmarked vehicles when necessary. Ta\u015fk\u0131n Akg\u00fcn worked for the intelligence service at the regimental headquarters of the \u015e\u0131rnak gendarmerie. The witness did not know whether Ta\u015fk\u0131n Akg\u00fcn and other gendarmes came to Silopi in civilian dress on 25 January 2001. He contacted him after the men's disappearance in order to work with him on the investigation.", "102. Veysel Ate\u015f was born in 1975. He was performing his military service and had the rank of sergeant at Silopi district gendarmerie command at the material time. He was responsible for keeping the visitors' registers and carrying out the checks necessary for that purpose.", "103. He said that once the checks had been carried out visitors were allowed to go to the relevant office unaccompanied.", "104. He knew Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f, who had already been to the gendarmerie station in the past. The witness was on duty on 25 January 2001. Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f arrived with Ebubekir Deniz. They appeared relatively calm and he spoke with them briefly. They told him that they had come to see the commanding officer S\u00fcleyman Can. He informed them that he had gone out. Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f asked when he would be back. The witness replied that the commanding officer did not give them any information about his schedule. Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f decided to wait for him in the waiting-room. He entered their names in the register and the two men signed the book using his pen. The witness gave the following account of what ensued: \u201cAfter a few minutes Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz returned to reception. I gave Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f his mobile phone, they signed the register and left the premises. They did not say whether they had seen anyone else and did not ask to see Selim G\u00fcl.\u201d", "105. As regards the visitors' register, the witness explained that when his turn of duty came to an end he would show the register to the officer relieving him, who would check it and sign at the foot of the last page. The witness was unable to explain why there was no signature in the register for 25 January 2001, whereas the corresponding page for 5 January 2001 did have one.", "The visitors' register showed that Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f had been to the station on 18 January 2001.", "106.

He was a non-commissioned officer serving in the operations unit of the \u015e\u0131rnak gendarmerie at the material time.", "110. He said that he had heard of Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz following anonymous information received at the gendarmerie station in March. While he could not remember the precise content of the information, the gist was that two people, who may have been Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz, had been taken by lorry to PKK camps in northern Iraq. The gendarmerie passed the information on to the anti-terrorist branch of the Security Directorate and drew up a report. He played no further part in the case.", "111. The witnesses were born in 1972, 1970, 1949, 1970 and 1972 respectively. They were police officers at the Habur Security Directorate and responsible for immigration control at the border with northern Iraq.", "112. They were informed that Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz were missing and were asked whether the two men had left or entered Turkey through the Habur checkpoint.", "113. Acting on information from an anonymous informant, the witnesses stopped a lorry that had entered Turkey from Iraq and, during a search that took approximately five hours, seized a letter and a small bottle filled with green powder. They were somewhat surprised as the information related to a possible haul of leaflets issued by an illegal organisation. The driver was present during the search and denied any implication in the incident. They informed the Silopi public prosecutor, who came out to the checkpoint. The letter was intended for \u015euayip Tan\u0131\u015f and said that Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz were in PKK camps in northern Iraq.", "114. S\u00fcleyman Can was born in 1968 and was the commanding officer of the Silopi district gendarmerie at the material time.", "115. He said that his superior was Colonel Levent Ers\u00f6z, the commanding officer of the \u015e\u0131rnak gendarmerie regiment. He would converse with him several times a day.", "116. He described the location of his office. Visitors waited in the waiting-room opposite his office and he saw them when he had time.", "117. He had not known Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz before November 2000. He knew the former through his political activities as a member of HADEP. Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f was in contact with non-commissioned officer Selim G\u00fcl and provided important information on the trafficking of arms, fuel, drugs and illegal products.", "The witness met \u015euayip Tan\u0131\u015f for the first time in January. As the witness had only just been appointed to the post, \u015euayip Tan\u0131\u015f paid him a courtesy visit. He was accompanied by another person. \u015euayip Tan\u0131\u015f mentioned that his son, Serdar, had just become President of the local branch of HADEP in Silopi and would shortly be paying him a visit. The witness asked \u015euayip Tan\u0131\u015f to congratulate his son on his behalf.", "118. The witness said that in principle the establishment of a local party office or a change in its membership would be of no interest to him. However, certain information and material in his possession had raised concerns about possible links between HADEP and the terrorist organisation KADEK (Kurdistan Freedom and Democracy Congress). He did not at any stage ask Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz to give up their activities as members of HADEP.", "119. He met \u015euayip Tan\u0131\u015f again on 17 January 2000. He came to pay him a visit with his brother Mustafa Tan\u0131\u015f and two other people. This too was a courtesy visit. On 18 January Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f himself came to visit him. The witness had already spoken with him on the telephone but this was the first time he had seen him. Serdar informed him of his new position at the local branch of HADEP and confirmed that he continued to see non-commissioned officer Selim G\u00fcl. Serdar told the witness: \u201cDo not have any suspicions about me, I wish to collaborate closely with the State, with all the agents of the State, the gendarmerie, the police and the district governor.\u201d He added that party leaders and other people had been putting pressure on him. He had left Silopi for a time and had travelled to Van, Cizre and Diyarbak\u0131r to attend to personal matters and HADEP's affairs. The witness said that their meeting took place in a very friendly atmosphere and he even called in Selim G\u00fcl. This was the first time Selim G\u00fcl had met Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f, as they had previously only spoken on the telephone. Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f had contacted Selim G\u00fcl for help when his father was in custody and offered to provide information in exchange. The witness said that he had never met Ebubekir Deniz; however, he had seen his name mentioned in an official document as someone engaged in the transport of fuel from northern Iraq.", "120. On the morning of 25 January 2001, the witness played host to a team of eight or nine inspectors whom he accompanied on a tour of inspection of the Ortak\u00f6y and Bota\u015f gendarmerie posts (having left the station at approximately 1.30 p.m.). He did not return to the station until 5.30 p.m. or 6 p.m. and did not speak to Selim G\u00fcl that day. He saw him at about 5 p.m. the following day. The witness said that he was replaced by the duty officer during his absence. None of his superiors or other officers from the \u015e\u0131rnak regimental headquarters visited the Silopi district command on 25 January.", "121. The witness said that on his return to the station in Silopi he received a telephone call from the Silopi public prosecutor, Kubilay Ta\u015ftan, enquiring whether two people, who were members of HADEP, had been taken into custody at Silopi district gendarmerie command. He said that they had not, but that he would make enquiries at other gendarmerie posts. The public prosecutor rang back at about 9 p.m. and the witness informed him that his enquiries indicated that neither Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f nor Ebubekir Deniz had been taken into custody at any stage.", "It was not until the following day that S\u00fcleyman Can learnt that Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz had come to see him. Selim G\u00fcl told him that he had spoken with the two men, who said that Ebubekir Deniz was having problems with his fuel transport business and needed his help. Before leaving the building Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f handed some documents on HADEP to Selim G\u00fcl. The witness refused to divulge the content of those documents.", "122. It was the witness's understanding that the public prosecutor was fully empowered to inspect the gendarmerie station (or to carry out an investigation). When visiting the station, the public prosecutor would inspect the registers and cells and thus perform routine checks.", "123. With regard to HADEP's activities, the witness said that they were relatively concerned about the party's links with KADEK. He added:", "\u201cKADEK is a terrorist organisation and has a great deal of influence over HADEP. I informed Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f about this and asked him to keep me informed of any developments. He assured me that Selim G\u00fcl and I would be informed without delay and that he would not be doing anything illegal. Prior to 26 January 2001 I had not spoken about Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz to my superior, Levent Ers\u00f6z. He had not asked me any questions about them. Following their disappearance, the public prosecutor and the Ministry of the Interior investigators made enquiries. All the enquiries focused on the Silopi district gendarmerie command. We also made enquiries: we questioned a number of people, some 400 soldiers, worked in close cooperation with the police and circulated posters bearing their photographs. However, when the letter was seized by police at the Habur border control, we directed our investigations to northern Iraq.", "I repeat that no pressure was exerted by command as a result of HADEP's activities. The resignations of some of HADEP's members was an internal party affair. The allegations of threats and intimidation made by \u015euayip Tan\u0131\u015f are without foundation. He came to pay me a courtesy visit and brought me a gift, which I declined. No one ordered Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz to come to the station. I did not witness a call by Levent Ers\u00f6z to \u015euayip Tan\u0131\u015f on 5 January 2001; he did not say that unless Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f came to see him he would never be able to set foot in \u015e\u0131rnak again and he would kill him. I repeat that neither Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f nor Ebubekir Deniz were at any stage taken into custody. On 25 January they came to the station and then left.\u201d", "124. The witness said that after returning from his tour of inspection at about 5.30 p.m. on 25 January 2001 he was contacted by Mr \u0130dris Tan\u0131\u015f and the public prosecutor Kubilay Ta\u015ftan. He told them that neither of the missing men was in custody and gave the same reply to the district governor the following day. In response to the district governor's comments, he checked the register of visitors' arrivals and was informed of Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz's visit. On 28 or 29 January 2001 the public prosecutor summoned the gendarmes and requested the registers.", "125. As to the allegation that the visitors' register was not signed by the duty officer on 25 January 2001, the witness explained that there was no rule on the subject and that it was left to the duty officer's discretion. The important point was to note comings and goings.", "126. The witness did not know the officers on the interrogation and intelligence team at the \u015e\u0131rnak regimental headquarters. He was unable to comment on the document the Silopi public prosecutor had sent to the \u015e\u0131rnak public prosecutor asking to be allowed to interview the officer who had telephoned Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f (on his mobile phone) at 1.44 p.m. on 25 January 2001 and indicating that the persons who had attempted to force him into their car at around 1.30 p.m. had been identified.", "127. The witness said that he was questioned by the public prosecutor in February 2002, by which time he had been transferred to the Baykan district. The public prosecutor had not summoned him earlier. He said that certain teams from the \u015e\u0131rnak regimental headquarters (dealing with intelligence) wore plain clothes and used unmarked cars.", "128. The witness denied telling Mehmet Ata Deniz that the J\u0130TEM was not under his orders or the orders of the commanding officer of the \u015e\u0131rnak gendarmerie regiment. He said that he knew nothing about the J\u0130TEM and had never heard of the existence of such a unit within the gendarmerie.", "129. Kubilay Ta\u015ftan was born in 1969 and was one of the Silopi public prosecutors at the material time. There were three public prosecutors in Silopi at the time, Hakan Ba\u015fverdi, G\u00fcndo\u011fan \u00d6zt\u00fcrk and the witness.", "130. He did not know Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz and had never met them. He was informed of the incident at about 5 p.m. on 25 January 2001 by Mr \u0130dris Tan\u0131\u015f. He contacted the commanding officer of the Silopi gendarmerie on the telephone and asked his replacement to make enquiries of all the gendarmerie posts. S\u00fcleyman Can called him back to say that neither of the missing men had been to the gendarmerie station or taken into custody.", "After receiving that information he did not consider an on-site inspection necessary. The procedure was that the commanding officer of the gendarmerie had a duty to inform him whenever anyone was taken into custody and of the reasons for the arrest. He regarded everything he was told by the gendarmes as true. He gave the following account of the events:", "\u201cWe considered that Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz had not been taken into custody. The investigation proceeded orally. I found the information provided by the commanding officer to be satisfactory. On 26 January 2001 I contacted the \u015e\u0131rnak, Cizre and \u0130dil public prosecutors' offices by telephone and asked whether the missing men had been detained within their sectors. They said they had not. Later that day Mr Tan\u0131\u015f arrived with the father of one of the missing men. We took a statement from him, they lodged their complaint and the investigation began that day. On 27 and 28 January I took a statement from someone who said that he saw Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz enter the district gendarmerie command and gave instructions to the commanding officer to send full lists of the names of the soldiers and officers who were on the premises on 25 January 2001. I also questioned five or six soldiers who were on duty that day. I repeat that it would not have been possible to conceal any detention from me and that there would have been no point in my going to the station. On 29 January 2001, in accordance with our internal organisation procedure, I handed the investigation file over to my colleague G\u00fcndo\u011fan \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, who took evidence from various gendarmes and members of the armed forces. On the same day a delegation from the Human Rights Association came to see me and asked me questions about the investigation. I did not say that they should look for Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz in \u015e\u0131rnak. I always spoke to S\u00fcleyman Can on the telephone and did not meet him in person. We did not receive any information about what had happened to the missing men. I saw the visitors' register and the custody record on 29 January 2001 and checked the signatures.\u201d", "131. With regard to the investigation procedure, the witness said that, when investigating a case, the public prosecutor was in all cases entitled to enter the gendarmerie station, make enquiries on the premises and carry out judicial checks, such as inspecting the cells or checking the lawfulness and conditions of detention.", "132. He expressed no view on the allegation that a gendarme had called Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f to ask him to come to the station. He said that he could not divulge the name of that person as the investigation was confidential.", "133. G\u00fcndo\u011fan \u00d6zt\u00fcrk was born in 1971 and was a public prosecutor in Silopi at the material time.", "134. He did not know Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f or Ebubekir Deniz. He was in charge of the investigation into the disappearance of the two men for a period of five months before being transferred on 12 July 2001.", "He gave the following account:", "\u201cThere were three public prosecutors in Silopi. One of us was on duty each week. I was given the file on the case by Kubilay Ta\u015ftan. He had taken some statements and requested the registers from the station. I questioned the gendarmes who were present at Silopi district gendarmerie command on 25 January 2001 and carried out a proper investigation taking all possibilities into account. On a number of occasions I used Ey\u00fcp Tan\u0131\u015f, who was a key witness in this case. I sent him to Diyarbak\u0131r so that an identikit picture could be made of the people who had attempted to force Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f into a car. I asked for the people who had telephoned him to be identified and photographs of all personnel at Silopi district gendarmerie command were shown to Ey\u00fcp Tan\u0131\u015f. The public prosecutors' offices in the region were informed that the two men were missing. Copies of the visitors' registers to the station were sent to the Institute of Forensic Medicine. I did not take a statement from S\u00fcleyman Can as I was not given the authority to do so, as when a commanding officer was accused of an offence authorisation was needed from the Ministry of Justice. I questioned the other gendarmes as suspects.", "Until 26 February 2001 those concerned had access to the documents in the investigation file and a copy of the material in the file was given to \u0130dris Tan\u0131\u015f. However, the information had been disseminated by the media, including the media controlled by the illegal organisation. Therefore, further to an application by me with a view to bringing the investigation to a successful conclusion, the judge made an order on 26 February 2001 imposing restrictions on access to the file. It is true that the commanding officer of the Silopi gendarmerie had earlier sought an order making all the statements from the gendarmerie personnel confidential.\u201d", "135. In response to a question regarding the identity of the person who had telephoned Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f on 25 January 2001, the witness replied:", "\u201cNo call was made by the commanding officer of the Silopi gendarmerie. The list compiled by the telephone operators indicates the name of the person who rang Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f. That name appears in the file. When we sent a copy of the investigation file to the Ministry of Justice, the names had not been deleted. Since the person concerned was not in Silopi, I had no jurisdiction to question him or her or to organise an identification procedure. I informed the competent public prosecutor's office and it was its responsibility to take the necessary action.\u201d", "136. Hakan Ba\u015fverdi was born in 1968 and was a public prosecutor in Silopi at the material time.", "137. He did not know Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f or Ebubekir Deniz and was not personally responsible for the investigation. However, the other two public prosecutors worked with him.", "138. The applicants alleged that Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz had been threatened and intimidated by the commanding officer of the \u015e\u0131rnak gendarmerie regiment on account of their activities as members of HADEP. They stated that after being summoned by the commanding officer of the Silopi gendarmerie the missing men had gone to the station on 25 January 2001. There had been no news of them since.", "139. On 26 January 2001 the public prosecutor Kubilay Ta\u015ftan took evidence from Ey\u00fcp Tan\u0131\u015f and \u00d6mer Sansur. The latter said that, following a telephone call from the commanding officer, he had taken Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz by car to the Silopi gendarmerie.", "The telephone records showed that Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f had received a call on his mobile phone at 1.44 p.m. on 25 January 2001.", "140.
