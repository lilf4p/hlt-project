UKRAINE", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of P1-3;Not necessary to examine Art. 14;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award", "JUDGES": "Jean-Paul Costa", "TEXT": ["7. The applicant was born on 18 October 1966 in the village of Zapadynka, district of Vasylkiv, in the Kyiv region. He currently resides in the United States of America, where he has refugee status.", "8. The applicant served in the Department of Security of the President of Ukraine. He was responsible for guarding the office of the President. In the course of his work, he allegedly made tape recordings of the President\u2019s personal conversations with third persons relating to the President\u2019s possible involvement in the disappearance of the journalist Georgiy Gongadze.", "9. Mr Gongadze was a political journalist and editor-in-chief of the internet journal Ukrayinska Pravda. He was known for his criticism of those in power and for his active involvement in awareness-raising in Ukraine and abroad concerning issues of freedom of speech. He disappeared on 16 September 2000 after complaining for months of being subjected to threats and surveillance. On 2 November 2000 the decapitated body of an unknown person, later identified by forensic medical tests as Mr Gongadze, was discovered in the vicinity of the town of Tarashcha, in the Kyiv region. His widow has lodged an application with the Court (application no. 34056/02).", "10. On 26 November 2000 the applicant left Ukraine, as he was afraid of political persecution following the public disclosure of the aforementioned tapes.", "11. On 28 November 2000 the Chairman of the Socialist Party of Ukraine, Mr O. Moroz, publicly announced during a session of the Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada (\u0412\u0435\u0440\u0445\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438), the existence of audio recordings secretly made in the office of the President and implicating the President and other high-level State officials in the disappearance of Georgiy Gongadze. According to a report by \u201cReporters sans fronti\u00e8res\u201d published on 22 January 2001, the recorded conversations mentioned different ways of getting rid of Mr Gongadze. In one of those conversations, allegedly between the President and the Minister of the Interior, the Minister said that he knew people capable of performing this task, people whom he called \u201creal eagles\u201d, ready to do whatever was required. (The \u201creal eagles\u201d were purportedly an illegal squad of former or current members of the security forces.) This disclosure led to a major political scandal.", "12. Two days later, on 30 November 2000, the Pechersky District Court of Kyiv instituted criminal proceedings against Mr O. Moroz for defamation with regard to the tapes.", "13. The applicant fled Ukraine. However, he still held an internal passport indicating his registered Kyiv address for administrative purposes (the \u201cpropiska\u201d, as it was called at the time \u2013 see paragraphs 40-42 below).", "14. The applicant applied for political asylum in the United States. On 27 April 2001 the Immigration and Naturalisation Service of the United States Department of Justice recognised the applicant as a refugee under the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees of 1951 (\u201cthe Geneva Convention\u201d). The Department of Justice issued him with a travel document and granted him the right to stay in the United States indefinitely.", "15. On 4 January 2001 the investigator at the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office (\u201cthe GPO\u201d) decided to initiate criminal proceedings against the applicant concerning allegations of defamation of the President of Ukraine, Mr L. Kuchma, as well as Mr V. Lytvyn and Mr Y. Kravchenko, who were at the material time Head of the Administration of the President of Ukraine and Minister of the Interior respectively. Proceedings were also initiated for forgery in respect of the official application the applicant had made for his passport, as he had failed to disclose the fact that he knew certain State secrets by virtue of his employment (see paragraph 34 below). On the same date the GPO investigator ordered a search for the applicant.", "16. On 14 February 2001 the GPO investigator initiated further criminal proceedings against the applicant for his alleged involvement in disclosing State secrets and an abuse of power. On 15 February 2001 the applicant was to be formally charged with all four offences, jointly. On 19 October 2001 the indictment was reissued by the GPO in accordance with the new Criminal Code. The defamation charge was dropped, as the new Code had decriminalised libel. On 24 January 2002 the Pechersky District Court of Kyiv, in the applicant\u2019s absence, issued a warrant for his arrest and detention pending trial.", "17. On 12 January 2002 the 9th Congress of the Socialist Party of Ukraine nominated the applicant as candidate no. 15 on the Socialist Party list for election to the Verkhovna Rada.", "18. On 22 January 2002 the Socialist Party submitted his application to the Central Electoral Commission (\u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0438\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0456\u0441\u0456\u044f) for his formal registration as a candidate. In the registration request the applicant gave his propiska address as his place of residence in Ukraine for the previous five years.", "19. On 26 January 2002 the Central Electoral Commission adopted Resolution no. 94 on the refusal to register candidates for the election on 31 March 2002 of the people\u2019s members of the Verkhovna Rada.", "20. This resolution was based on the verbatim record of a discussion on the applicant\u2019s request for registration and was adopted following a proposal by Ms I. Stavniychuk, a member of the Central Electoral Commission, who claimed that registration should be refused for the following reasons:", "\u201c... It ensues from what has been specified above that the provision of subsection (2) of section 8 of the Law on the election of the people\u2019s members of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, which concerns residence in accordance with the international treaties in force in Ukraine, does not extend to M.I. Melnychenko.", "From a legal point of view, M.I. Melnychenko\u2019s stay in the United States prevents him being recognised as permanently resident in Ukraine, as prescribed by section 8 of the Law ...", "... M.I. Melnychenko remains abroad on other grounds; those grounds are not covered by subsection (2) of section 8 of the Law ...", "... any break in residence in Ukraine on grounds other than those for residence or stay listed in subsection (2) of section 8 of the Law ... rules out the possibility for that person to exercise his right to be elected as a people\u2019s member of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, since [a break in residence] cannot constitute residence in Ukraine ...", "... On this account and due to the fact that M.I. Melnychenko has submitted inaccurate information about his habitual place of residence or stay for the past five years, as established by the Central Electoral Commission, we propose that the Commission refuse M.I. Melnychenko\u2019s registration as a candidate for the election of the people\u2019s members of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine ...\u201d", "21. The Central Electoral Commission therefore adopted Ms I. Stavniychuk\u2019s proposal and refused the registration of thirteen potential candidates, including the applicant. In particular, it decided:", "\u201c...", "2. To refuse to register, as a candidate for election to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine in the multi-mandate all-State electoral constituency, Mykola Ivanovych Melnychenko, enrolled under number 15 on the list of candidates for the election of the people\u2019s members of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on 31 March 2002, whose documents, as submitted to the Central Electoral Commission, contain substantially inaccurate data about his place and period of residence for the past five years.\u201d", "22. During its meeting, the Commission had distinguished the applicant\u2019s situation from that of a certain Mr Y.M. Zviahilsky, who had been allowed to stand as a parliamentary candidate in a previous election under different regulations despite having spent more than two years abroad for medical treatment in Israel on a temporary basis. The applicant contended that Mr Zviahilsky, who was prosecuted for abuse of power during his office as Acting Prime Minister of Ukraine, had fled to Israel during the suspension of his parliamentary immunity.", "23. The other twelve candidates were refused registration because they had not filled in the necessary registration documents properly.", "24. On 30 January 2002 the Socialist Party lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court of Ukraine against the Central Electoral Commission\u2019s Resolution no. 94 of 26 January 2002. It sought to have the resolution declared unlawful and annulled.", "25. On 8 February 2002 the Supreme Court of Ukraine dismissed the appeal for the following reasons:", "\u201c... the information about M.I. Melnychenko\u2019s habitual place of residence for the past five years in Ukraine, referred to in the said documents, is contested by the Central Electoral Commission and the Court. This information is substantially lacking in truth in respect of a candidate for election as a member of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, and therefore paragraph 2 of the Central Electoral Commission\u2019s Resolution no. 94 of 26 January 2002 complies with the requirements of subsection (2) of section 8 and sections 41 and 47 of the Law on the election of the people\u2019s members of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.", "On the basis of the foregoing, ... the Court", "Holds:", "that the complaint of the Socialist Party of Ukraine concerning paragraph 2 of the Central Electoral Commission\u2019s Resolution no. 94 of 26 January 2002 on the refusal to register M.I. Melnychenko as a candidate for election to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine in the multi-mandate all-State electoral constituency should be dismissed.\u201d", "26. On 21 November 2002 the applicant informed the Court that he resided in the United States, where he had refugee status. As his case had received much media attention, this was common knowledge in Ukraine.", "27. Article 25 of the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Ukraine is a party, guarantees the right to vote and to stand for public office for citizens of a country.", "28. As regards the participation of refugees in elections in their country of origin, the Human Rights Committee in its General Comment 25 (1996) on Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, while noting that Article 25 prohibited arbitrary discrimination between citizens, considered that a registration requirement, itself dependent on residence, would be justifiable. Thus, States do have a right to limit voting in general to those citizens habitually resident in their territory. This Comment also stated that:", "\u201c15. The effective implementation of the right and the opportunity to stand for elective office ensures that persons entitled to vote have a free choice of candidates. Any restrictions on the right to stand for election, such as minimum age, must be justifiable on objective and reasonable criteria. Persons who are otherwise eligible to stand for election should not be excluded by unreasonable or discriminatory requirements such as education, residence or descent, or by reason of political affiliation. No person should suffer discrimination or disadvantage of any kind because of that person\u2019s candidacy. States Parties should indicate and explain the legislative provisions which exclude any group or category of persons from elective office.\u201d", "29. Relevant extracts from the Guidelines on Elections of 5-6 July 2002 read as follows (footnotes omitted):", "\u201c... Thirdly, the right to vote and/or the right to stand for election may be subject to residence requirements, residence in this case meaning habitual residence. ... Conversely, quite a few States grant their nationals living abroad the right to vote, and even to be elected. ... Registration could take place where a voter has his or her secondary residence, if he or she resides there regularly and it appears, for example, on local tax payments; the voter must not then of course be registered where he or she has his or her principal residence.", "The free movement of citizens within the country is one of the fundamental rights necessary for truly democratic elections. However, if persons have been displaced against their will, they should, for a certain time, have the possibility of being considered as resident at their former place of residence. This possibility ought to be open for a minimum of five years but for no more than fifteen years to persons displaced within the national territory.", "Lastly, provision may be made for clauses suspending political rights. Such clauses must, however, comply with the usual conditions under which fundamental rights may be restricted; in other words, they must:", "\u2013 be provided for by law;", "\u2013 observe the principle of proportionality;", "\u2013 be based on mental incapacity or a criminal conviction for a serious offence.", "Furthermore, the withdrawal of political rights may only be imposed by express decision of a court of law. However, in the event of withdrawal on grounds of mental incapacity, such express decision may concern the incapacity and entail ipso jure deprivation of civic rights.", "The conditions for depriving individuals of the right to stand for election may be less strict than for disenfranchising them, as the holding of a public office is in issue and it may be legitimate to debar persons whose activities in such an office violate a greater public interest.\u201d", "30. There is no uniform State practice with regard to participation in elections by expatriate citizens. Although many States do not impose any residence requirement (for example, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Cyprus, Finland, Italy, France, Greece, Poland, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Spain, Portugal, Estonia, Latvia, Croatia, Moldova, Switzerland, Austria and Turkey), other States continue to impose such a requirement for presidential elections (for example, Germany, Bulgaria, \u201cthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d, Azerbaijan, Albania and Russia) or parliamentary elections (Malta and Iceland \u2013 presidential systems; Liechtenstein, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway and Sweden \u2013 non-presidential systems) or for both types of election (for example, Hungary, Slovakia, Armenia, Romania, Georgia, Lithuania and Ukraine).", "31.
