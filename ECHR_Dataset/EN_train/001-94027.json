They were represented before the Court by Mrs Lj. Nogolica, an advocate practising in Zagreb. The Croatian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mrs \u0160. Sta\u017enik.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "On 1 January 1997 the Act on Compensation for, and Restitution of, Property Taken under the Yugoslav communist regime (Zakon o naknadi za imovinu oduzetu za vrijeme jugoslavenske komunisti\u010dke vladavine \u2013 \u201cthe Denationalisation Act\u201d) entered into force. It enabled the former owners of confiscated or nationalised property, or their heirs in the first line of succession (direct descendants or a spouse), to obtain under certain conditions either restitution of or compensation for property appropriated during the communist regime. They were required to submit their requests within six months from the Act\u2019s entry into force. Requests submitted after that date were to be declared inadmissible.", "Pursuant to section 22 of the Denationalisation Act, nationalised flats in respect of which third persons had acquired specially protected tenancies (stanarsko pravo) were not to be restored to their former owners. The tenants had a right to purchase such flats from the provider of the flat under favourable conditions set out in the Specially Protected Tenancies (Sale to Occupier) Act (Zakon o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo). At the same time, the former owners were entitled to financial compensation in respect of the flats.", "On the other hand, pursuant to section 32 of the Denationalisation Act, confiscated flats were to be awarded to their former owners. Under section 13 of the Appropriated Property Compensation Fund Act (Zakon o Fondu za naknadu oduzete imovine), the tenant had the right to purchase a confiscated flat only if no request for its restitution had been submitted or if such request had been dismissed in a final decision.", "The applicants were holders of specially protected tenancies of flats in Zagreb, measuring 92.92 square metres (the first applicant\u2019s flat) and 87.70 square metres (the second applicant\u2019s flat). Both flats are located in the same building, which in 1946 was confiscated from its owner M.V. by the communist authorities.", "On 13 February 1997 M.V.\u2019s daughter M.B. instituted administrative proceedings before the Office for Property Affairs of the City of Zagreb (Grad Zagreb, Gradski ured za imovinskopravne poslove) by submitting a request for restitution of M.V.\u2019s confiscated property, including the above-mentioned building.", "On 17 July 1997 M.V. died and her testamentary heirs V.A.-V. and T.A. took over the proceedings.", "On 11 May 2001 the Office delivered a decision awarding ownership of the plot of land on which the building at issue was built to V.A.-V. and T.A. It stated, however, that it would decide on the restitution of the building itself at a later date.", "On 26 May 2004 the Office issued a decision awarding ownership of the entire building to V.A.-V. and T.A. and declaring that the applicants had acquired the status of protected lessees (za\u0161ti\u0107eni najmoprimci) under section 33 of the Denationalisation Act.", "On 7 December 2005 the Ministry of Justice (Ministarstvo pravosu\u0111a), as the second-instance administrative authority, dismissed an appeal by the applicants and upheld the first-instance decision of 26 May 2004.", "The applicants then brought an action in the Administrative Court (Upravni sud Republike Hrvatske) challenging the Ministry\u2019s decision. On 8 January 2009 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 action. The first-instance decision of 26 May 2004 thereby became final.", "The applicants then lodged a constitutional complaint against the judgment of the Administrative Court. It would appear that the proceedings are currently pending before the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske).", "Meanwhile, in March 1997 the applicants made requests to the City of Zagreb to purchase their respective flats, under the Specially Protected Tenancies (Sale to Occupier) Act.", "On 16 June 1998 the second applicant asked the Office for Property Affairs of the City of Zagreb whether a request for restitution of the building in which her (and the first applicant\u2019s) flat was located had been submitted. In the letter of 21 July 1998 the Office replied that no such request had been submitted.", "On 14 September 1998 the City of Zagreb, as the provider of the flat, concluded a contract of sale with the first applicant whereby it sold him the flat in respect of which he had a specially protected tenancy for 70,145 Croatian kunas (HRK). On 14 December 1998 the City of Zagreb concluded a similar contract with the second applicant, selling her the flat in respect of which she had a specially protected tenancy for HRK 60,696. Shortly afterwards the applicants were recorded as the owners of their respective flats in the land register.", "On 20 April 2000 V.A-V. and T.A. brought a civil action in the Zagreb Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Zagrebu) against the applicants, several other individuals who had purchased flats located in the same building and the City of Zagreb. They asked the court to declare the contracts of sale null and void as being contrary to peremptory rules. They argued that under the Denationalisation Act, confiscated flats were not to be sold to their tenants but awarded to their former owners. Only if the former owner\u2019s request for restitution had been dismissed or declared inadmissible were the tenants allowed to purchase such flats. The plaintiffs explained that they had taken over the administrative proceedings instituted on 13 February 1997 before the Office for Property Affairs of the City of Zagreb by M.B., who had submitted a request for restitution of the entire building in which the flats in question were located, and that this request had not been dismissed or declared inadmissible by the time the impugned contracts of sale had been concluded. Therefore, the City of Zagreb had not been allowed to sell those flats as long as the request for their restitution had been pending.", "On 17 October 2002 the court declared the impugned contracts of sale null and void ab initio, endorsing the arguments adduced by the plaintiffs. It found that the contracts were in breach of peremptory rules and therefore null and void from their inception. The respondents appealed.", "On 13 January 2004 the Zagreb County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Zagrebu) dismissed an appeal by the respondents and upheld the first-instance judgment.", "The applicants then lodged constitutional complaints, alleging a violation of their constitutional right to equality before the law.", "On 29 September 2004 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 constitutional complaints.", "The Act on the Prohibition of the Transfer of Rights to Dispose of and Use Certain Items of Immovable Property in Social Ownership to other Users or into the Ownership of other Natural or Legal Persons (Zakon o zabrani prijenosa prava raspolaganja i kori\u0161tenja odre\u0111enih nekretnina u dru\u0161tvenom vlasni\u0161tvu na druge korisnike odnosno u vlasni\u0161tvo drugih fizi\u010dkih i pravnih osoba, Official Gazette nos. 53/1990, 61/1991, 25/1993 and 70/1993 \u2013 \u201cthe Transfer Prohibition Act\u201d), which entered into force on 14 December 1990, banned any transfer of property that had been acquired by means of nationalisation or confiscation.", "Paragraph 1 of section 1 provided that the prohibition applied to any property appropriated on the basis of legislation listed in that paragraph.", "Paragraph 2 of section 1 provided that the prohibition applied to any property appropriated by means of confiscation irrespective of the legislation on which the confiscation measure had been based.", "Section 4(1) provided that any contract concluded in contravention of the provisions of the Transfer Prohibition Act was null and void.", "Section 6 provided that the prohibition was to apply until the introduction of denationalisation legislation.", "The Act on Compensation for, and Restitution of, Property Taken During the Yugoslav Communist Regime (Zakon o naknadi za imovinu oduzetu za vrijeme jugoslavenske komunisti\u010dke vladavine, Official Gazette nos. 92/1996, 92/1999 (corrigendum), 80/2002 (amendments) and 81/2002 (corrigendum) \u2013 \u201cthe 1996 Denationalisation Act\u201d), which entered into force on 1 January 1997, enables the former owners of confiscated or nationalised property, or their heirs in the first line of succession (direct descendants and a spouse), to seek under certain conditions either restitution of or compensation for appropriated property.
