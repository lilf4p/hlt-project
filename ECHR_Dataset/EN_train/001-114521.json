De Gaetano;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["7. The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Pi\u0142a.", "8. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "9. On 5 May 2004 the applicant\u2019s daughter, Y, was informed that she was between four and five weeks pregnant. Prior to or early in her pregnancy she developed ulcerative colitis (\u201cUC\u201d). The applicant\u2019s daughter began experiencing the symptoms of UC, such as nausea, abdominal pains, vomiting and diarrhoea. Those symptoms were recurrent and caused pain and discomfort.", "10. Y was repeatedly admitted to a number of hospitals. Y, accompanied by the applicant, attended the following hospitals in Poland: 18 to 19 May 2004, Specialist Hospital in Pi\u0142a, Gynaecology and Obstetrics Department (Szpital Specjalistyczny w Pile, Oddzia\u0142 GinekologicznoPo\u0142o\u017cniczy); 19 May to1 June 2004 and 4 to 8 June 2004, Specialist Hospital in Pi\u0142a Internal Medicine Department (Szpital specjalistyczny w Pile, Oddzia\u0142 Chor\u00f3b Wewnetrznych) (\u201cPi\u0142a Hospital\u201d); 8 June to 1 July 2004 and 19 to 28 July 2004, Clinic of Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Independent Public Teaching Hospital No. 2, H. \u015awi\u0119cicki Medical Academy in Pozna\u0144 (Samodzielny Publiczny Szpital Kliniczny Nr 2 im. H. \u015awi\u0119cickiego Akademii Medycznej w Poznaniu, Oddzia\u0142 Kliniczny Gastroenterologii, \u017bywienia Cz\u0142owieka i Chor\u00f3b Wewn\u0119trznych) (\u201c\u015awi\u0119cicki Hospital\u201d); 13 to 15 July 2004 Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department III, Gynaecology and Obstetrics Teaching Hospital, Independent Public Medical Facility in Pozna\u0144 (Oddzia\u0142 Po\u0142o\u017cniczo-Ginekologiczny III, Ginekologiczno-Po\u0142o\u017cniczy Szpital Kliniczny Akademii Medycznej w Poznaniu); 28 July to August 2004, Surgery Department of the Specialist Hospital in Pi\u0142a (Szpital Specjalistyczny w Pile, Oddzia\u0142 Chirurgiczny); 17 August to 4 September 2004, Pirogow Regional Specialist Hospital in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, General and Vascular Surgery Department (Wojew\u00f3dzki Szpital Specjalistyczny im. Pirogowa w \u0141odzi, Oddzia\u0142 Chirurgii Og\u00f3lnej i Naczyniowej) (\u201cPirogow Hospital\u201d); 4 September 2004, M. Madurowicz Regional Specialist Hospital in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (Wojew\u00f3dzki Szpital Specjalistyczny im. M. Madurowicza w \u0141odzi); 4 to 29 September 2004, Intensive Care Department, Norbert Barlicki University Teaching Hospital No. 1 in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (Uniwersytecki Szpital Kliniczny Nr 1 im. N. Barlickiego Uniwersytetu Medycznego w \u0141odzi, Oddzia\u0142 Kliniczny Anestezjologii i Intensywnej Terapiii) (\u201cBarlicki Hospital\u201d).", "11. The applicant\u2019s daughter was formally diagnosed with UC during her stay in Pi\u0142a Hospital between 19 May and 1 June 2004. She underwent a number of tests, including an endoscopy and a fibro-sigmoidoscopic examination of the anus.", "12. During the visits in the hospitals listed above, the applicant\u2019s daughter received some diagnostic tests and basic treatment. She was given pharmacological treatment (for example, intravenous and oral administration of steroids and antibiotics).", "13. On 8 June 2004 Y was admitted to Swiecicki Hospital. Between 8 June and 1 July and 19 and 28 July 2004 she was an inpatient in that hospital. On 19 July 2004 she was diagnosed with an abscess.", "14. On 28 July 2004 Y left the clinic.", "15. The next day, 29 July 2004, she was admitted to Pi\u0142a Hospital, where she underwent an operation to remove the abscess.", "16. On 17 August 2004 Y was admitted to Pirogow Hospital due to a new abscess and rectovaginal fistula. On the same date she was operated on to remove the abscess. Medical files confirm that at the time Y was admitted to hospital the doctors were aware of Y\u2019s ulcerative colitis .", "17. During the applicant\u2019s daughter\u2019s stay in Pirogow Hospital in August 2004 the doctor refused to perform a full endoscopy. In addition, no diagnostic imaging of the abdomen (diagnostyka obrazowa jamy brzusznej) was performed.", "18. On 4 September 2004 Y\u2019s condition deteriorated. She was transferred to Madurowicz Hospital. Immediately following her admission she was sent for a surgical operation to establish the cause of the apparent sepsis. During the operation the doctors removed her appendix. Y\u2019s condition deteriorated, consequently immediately after the operation she was transferred to the intensive care unit of Barlicki Hospital.", "19. On 5 September 2004 the doctors removed the foetus, which was dead. On 15 September 2004 the doctors removed Y\u2019s uterus. Altogether the applicant\u2019s daughter was operated on six times in Barlicki Hospital. On 29 September 2004 she died of septic shock caused by sepsis.", "20. By letter, dated 30 September 2004, Y\u2019s brother asked the hospital not to perform an autopsy. He submitted that the cause of Y\u2019s death was known to him.", "21. The Government maintained that on 28 July 2004 Y left the hospital at her own request due to a planned wedding ceremony. In this respect they submitted a copy of Y\u2019s medical file, which in its relevant part reads as follows:", "\u201c27 July 2004 ...Due to a planned wedding ceremony, the patient is to be released tomorrow at her own request.\u201d", "22. The applicant disagreed. She maintained that Y had not requested to leave the hospital, but had been sent home.", "23. The applicant further submitted that during her daughter\u2019s stay in the surgical department of Pi\u0142a Hospital the head of that department commented that \u201cit is absurd to spend a whole week treating an abscess. [Y] is too busy with her bottom, instead of taking care of something else\u201d, referring to the pregnancy. The applicant stated that this comment and its context had humiliated and angered her and her daughter.", "24. The Government argued that Pi\u0142a Hospital maintained that no such comment had been made, either by the head of the department or by any other doctor of that hospital. Also, the Regional Agent for Disciplinary Matters in Pozna\u0144, in the course of disciplinary proceedings instituted against doctors who had treated Y, did not confirm the applicant\u2019s allegations.", "25. The applicant also submitted that the doctor at Pirogow Hospital had justified not performing a full endoscopy (in August 2004) by referring to his fear of endangering the life of the foetus. The applicant submitted that the doctor had stated that \u201cmy conscience does not allow me\u201d, but had not formalised his objection or directed Y to another doctor.", "26. The Government argued that during the investigation instituted by the Regional Agent for Disciplinary Matters in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a it had been established that none of the doctors at Pirogow Hospital had based their refusal to perform a full endoscopy on a \u201cconscience clause\u201d (klauzula sumienia). The decision not to perform a full endoscopy was taken because there were no medical grounds for such an examination, and not because of Y\u2019s pregnancy.", "27. On 6 December 2004 the applicant\u2019s lawyer asked the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a District Prosecutor to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s daughter\u2019s death. The lawyer submitted medical charts from three hospitals and asked the prosecutor to obtain full medical documentation. The applicant was questioned by the prosecutor on 6 January 2005.", "28. On 10 February 2005 the prosecution requested the Collegium Medicum in Krak\u00f3w and the Medical University in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a to issue an opinion as to whether an exhumation would be possible in Y\u2019s case. Both universities replied that an exhumation of Y\u2019s body would not have enabled an opinion to be given on the cause of her death.", "29. On 1 March 2005 the prosecutor opened an investigation of possible unintentional homicide of the applicant\u2019s daughter (Article 155 of the Criminal Code).", "30. On 24 June 2005 the prosecutor decided to appoint an expert from the Forensic Medicine Department of the Collegium Medicum in Krak\u00f3w, to evaluate the treatment provided to the patient, and to establish whether there was a direct causal link between any irregularities in Y\u2019s treatment and her death. However, Collegium Medicum informed the prosecutor that no autopsy was carried out following the applicant\u2019s daughter\u2019s death, and that exhumation of her body at a later stage would not have enabled an opinion to be given on the cause of death. A similar opinion was issued by the Medical University in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a.", "31. On 20 July 2005 the Medical Academy in Gda\u0144sk, on 22 July 2005 the Forensic Medicine Department in Szczecin, and on 19 July 2005 the Medical Academy in Warsaw refused to provide an opinion in Y\u2019s case due to their workload in other cases and lack of staff.", "32. Meanwhile, on 14 June 2005 the Minister of Health convened a special expert committee to investigate Y\u2019s treatment and the circumstances of her death. The aim of the committee was to inquire in respect of all the hospitals involved in Y\u2019s treatment as regards their organisation and methods of treatment and the availability of those methods. On 15 November 2005 the committee concluded that the death had been directly caused by sepsis. The committee noted however, that during Y\u2019s stay in Pirogow Hospital, despite her history of inflammatory bowel disease the doctors failed to perform a diagnostic imaging test on her abdomen. In addition, an earlier diagnosis of sepsis and the establishment of its original cause in Pirogow Hospital (most probably Lesniewski-Crohn disease) and a possible decision about surgical treatment would have had an impact on Y\u2019s situation. The committee\u2019s report was signed by several national consultants in various fields of health care. Two members of the committee, who were not medical experts, did not sign the report: professor of criminal law E.Z., and W.N., the head of an NGO working in the field of reproductive rights.", "33. On 8 August 2005 the prosecutor\u2019s office asked national consultants in gastroenterology, gynaecology and vascular surgery to submit opinions on Y\u2019s treatment.", "34. On 12 December 2005 an expert gastroenterologist stated in her opinion that the original cause of sepsis could not be determined due to the fact that an autopsy had not been performed on Y\u2019s body.", "35. The investigation of the death of the applicant\u2019s daughter was extended several times. It was then suspended, on 26 May 2006. The prosecutor referred to the need to obtain expert opinions and the fact that the waiting time for such opinions was at least twelve months.", "36. Subsequently six medical opinions were submitted to the prosecutor\u2019s office on 12 March, 10 April, 10 May, 4 June, and 27 September 2007, and 25 April 2008. Altogether the prosecution obtained opinions from eight medical experts. The experts were subsequently heard by the prosecutor.", "37. During the investigation, there were several changes of prosecutor: at least six prosecutors handled the investigation at different stages.", "38. On 10 May 2007 M.K, an expert gastroenterologist, considered it surprising that Y had not undergone an ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen. He further stressed that she could have had an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) to determine the cause of the abscess. Lastly, an autopsy would have allowed the original cause of the sepsis to be determined. In an additional opinion of 25 April 2008 M.K. considered that in both hospitals, Pi\u0142a and Pirogow, the doctors failed to do an MRI. However, he stressed that the lack of adequate examination in Y\u2019s case should be treated not as medical malpractice but as lack of due diligence.", "39. On 11 June 2008 the District Prosecutor resumed and discontinued the investigation. The prosecutor concluded that on the basis of the experts\u2019 opinions there was no ground for any doubts or objections as to the treatment received by the applicant\u2019s daughter. Failure to conduct an MRI should be considered a lack of due diligence and not medical malpractice. It could no longer be said that an earlier operation would have saved Y\u2019s life. Consequently, no direct link had been established between the treatment and the death of the applicant\u2019s daughter.", "40. The applicant appealed.", "41. On 5 September 2008 the L\u00f3dz District Court upheld the prosecutor\u2019s decision. The court referred to the complicated nature of the case and the fact that no autopsy was performed, and therefore it was impossible to establish whether Y suffered from Lesniewski-Crohn\u2019s disease. The court considered that there were no grounds for continuation of the investigation of Y\u2019s death.", "42. The applicant stated that the prosecutor had not obtained the necessary information, such as full medical records, to assist experts in forming their opinions. The Government maintained that the prosecutor had obtained full medical records from all the hospitals attended by the applicant\u2019s daughter in Pi\u0142a, Pozna\u0144 and \u0141\u00f3d\u017a.", "43. The applicant also stated that the prosecutor had the applicant\u2019s daughter. The Government argued that the prosecutor had examined the issue of colonoscopy and the investigation had been focused on Y\u2019s cause of death: in particular, on the question whether her treatment had been adequate to the diagnosis and whether further tests, such as a full endoscopy and a diagnostic imaging test, could have prevented Y\u2019s death.", "44. The applicant claimed that the two members of the special expert committee (see paragraph 32 above) who had not signed the report of 15 November 2005 had not been allowed to participate in the committee\u2019s discussions and therefore did not have access to the medical files. The Government disagreed. They drew the Court\u2019s attention to the fact that all the medical specialists had signed the report.", "45. On 20 June 2005 the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Agent for Disciplinary Matters (Okregowy Rzecznik Odpowiedzialnosci Zawodowej) (\u201cDisciplinary Agent\u201d) instituted disciplinary proceedings against the doctors who had treated Y. After consulting several experts and hearing witnesses, he concluded that there was no evidence of medical malpractice. During the proceedings the applicant and Y\u2019s fianc\u00e9 refused to testify before the Disciplinary Agent. The proceedings were discontinued by a decision of 25 October 2006.", "46. In late May 2005 the Pozna\u0144 Disciplinary Agent instituted disciplinary proceedings against the doctors who had treated Y. On 6 December 2006 three specialists from the Wroc\u0142aw Medical Academy issued a medical opinion, that there was no evidence of medical malpractice. The proceedings were discontinued by a decision of 8 January 2007.", "47. The applicant did not appeal against the Poznan and Lodz Disciplinary Agents\u2019 decisions to the Chief Agent for Disciplinary Matters in Warsaw (Naczelny Recznik Odpowiedzialnosci Zawodowej).", "48. In September 2007 the applicant had brought a compensation claim in the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a District Court against Pirogow Hospital.", "49. On 7 April 2009 the applicant modified her claim and asked for 300,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) in compensation. Consequently, the case was transferred to the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Court.", "50. On 17 March 2011 the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim for compensation. The applicant did not appeal against this judgment. In addition, none of the parties asked to be served with the written reasoning of the judgment.", "51. There is no indication in the medical files of Y\u2019s stay in Pi\u0142a Hospital (19 May-1 June 2004) that she had given permission for third parties to have access to these files. For these reasons, in 2004 the hospital refused the applicant access to the medical files", "52. Medical files of Y\u2019s stay in Swiecicki Hospital (8 June to 1 July 2004 and 19-28 July) indicate that Y specified that the applicant was entitled to obtain documentation on her stay in the hospital. The hospital granted access to these files to the Lodz District Prosecutor (on 14 March and 9 May 2005 and 27 February 2006) and to the Ministry of Health on 27 June 2005.", "53. Medical files in Pierogow Hospital do not indicate that Y allowed third-party access to her medical files. For this reason the hospital refused the applicant access to these files.", "54. The Government maintained that the applicant had not requested the Swiecicki hospital to give her access to Y\u2019s files. The applicant disagreed. She submitted, without specifying any details, that she had twice asked the hospital for these files but had not been granted access.", "55. The Government submitted that on 1 March 2005 the prosecutor\u2019s office requested the relevant hospitals to provide files on Y\u2019s treatment. In this connection they submitted copies of the prosecutor\u2019s decisions.", "56. The applicant disagreed: she claimed that the relevant files were requested only in February and April 2006.", "57. Under section 39 of the Medical Profession Act of 1996 (ustawa o zawodzie lekarza i lekarza dentysty) (\u201cthe 1996 Act\u201d), as applicable at the material time, a doctor may refuse to carry out a medical procedure, citing her or his objections on the ground of conscience. He or she is obliged to inform the patient where the medical procedure concerned can be obtained and to register the refusal in the patient\u2019s medical records. Doctors employed in health-care institutions are also obliged to inform their supervisors of their refusal in writing.", "58. Sections 24-26 of the Health-Care Institutions Act of 1991 (ustawa o zak\u0142adach opieki zdrowotnej), as applicable at the material time, specified situations in which an autopsy is to be performed. In general, when a person died in a hospital, the authorities might carry out an autopsy unless that person\u2019s statutory representative objected or the patient expressed such a wish whilst alive. However, an autopsy was obligatory if the cause of the patient\u2019s death could not be unequivocally established or in situations specified in the code of criminal procedure.", "59. Under section 41 of the 1996 Act and the ordinance of 2001 on types of individual medical documentation, keeping them and detailed conditions of granting access to them (Rozporzadzenie Ministra Zdrowia w sprawie rodzaj\u00f3w indywidualnej dokumentacji medycznej, sposobu jej prowadzenia oraz szczeg\u00f3\u0142owych warunk\u00f3w jej udostepniania) as applicable at the material time, a doctor was obliged to grant access to individual medical files to a patient, his statutory representative or a person authorised by the patient; to another doctor or person authorised to conduct the patient\u2019s treatment; other organs under separate legislation (such as courts or a prosecutor\u2019s office).", "60. Under Article 417 of the Polish Civil Code, the State is liable for damage caused by its agents in the exercise of their functions. There is established case-law of the Polish courts to the effect that this liability of the State also includes liability for damage caused by medical treatment in a public system of medical care, run either by the State or by the municipalities.", "61. Article 155 of the Criminal Code of 1997 provides that a person who unintentionally causes the death of another human being shall be liable to a sentence of imprisonment between three months and five years", "62. The Chambers of Physicians Act of 1989 (ustawa o izbach lekarskich) (\u201cThe 1989 Act\u201d) no longer in force, established Chambers of Physicians. The disciplinary responsibility of physicians for professional misconduct may be determined in proceedings before organs of the Chambers, agents for disciplinary matters and disciplinary courts. Agents and members of the courts for each region are elected by members of a local chamber. The Chief Agent for Disciplinary Matters and the Principal Court are elected by the National Congress of Physicians, composed of delegates of local chambers.", "63. Pursuant to Article 42 of the Act, the following penalties may be imposed in disciplinary proceedings: a warning, a reprimand, suspension of the right to practise medicine for a period from six months to three years, and being struck off the register of physicians.", "64. The agent for disciplinary matters must investigate the matter if he obtains credible information that the rules of professional conduct have been infringed. When investigating such a complaint, the agent may question a physician charged with professional misconduct, may appoint experts and question witnesses and take such other evidence as he or she sees fit. A physician charged with professional misconduct is entitled to make any submissions which in his or her opinion are relevant.", "65. The agent shall discontinue proceedings if he concludes that the material gathered in the case does not suffice for drawing up a motion for a penalty to be imposed."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
