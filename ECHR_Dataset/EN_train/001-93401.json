The applicant, Mr Vidoje Blagojevi\u0107, is a Serbian national who was born in 1950. He is currently detained in a prison in Norway, serving a fifteen-year prison sentence imposed by the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 (also known as the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, hereafter the ICTY). He was represented before the Court by Mr V. Domazet, a lawyer practising in Ni\u0161 (Serbia).", "2", "3. On 30 October 1998 the ICTY\u2019s Prosecutor issued an indictment against the applicant. This indictment charged the applicant, who had commanded a brigade of the Bosnian Serb Army (Vojska Republike Srpske, \u201cVRS\u201d) in Eastern Bosnia, with genocide and in the alternative complicity in genocide, extermination as a crime against humanity, murder as a crime against humanity and a violation of the laws and customs of war, and persecutions on political, racial and religious grounds as a crime against humanity. This indictment was amended on 27 October 1999 to include two further charges, namely deportation as a crime against humanity and inhumane acts based on forcible transfer as a crime against humanity. The indictment was kept sealed until the applicant\u2019s arrest.", "4. The applicant was arrested by the Stabilisation Force (SFOR) on 10 August 2001 and transferred to the custody of the ICTY the same day.", "5. On 16 August 2001 the applicant made his initial appearance in open court, assisted by duty counsel, Mr Van der S. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. On the same day the applicant was ordered placed in detention on remand until further order.", "6. The applicant claimed to lack the means to retain counsel and subsequently qualified to have counsel assigned. The ICTY\u2019s Registrar assigned Mr K., pursuant to the applicant\u2019s request, on 5 September 2001. On 25 September 2002 Ms T. was assigned as co-counsel, based on the request of Mr K.", "7. On 27 November 2002 the applicant lodged a motion for the replacement of Ms T. By a decision dated 9 December 2002 the Trial Chamber refused to do so, finding that leading counsel Mr K. had expressed confidence in Ms T. and that Ms T. was not incompetent or acting in any way contrary to the applicant\u2019s interests.", "8. On 27 March 2003 the applicant again sought the replacement of Ms T. In addition, stating that he had lost confidence in Mr K. who had failed to consult him when choosing Ms T. as co-counsel, he requested the replacement of his entire legal team. On 8 April 2003 the ICTY\u2019s Registrar issued a decision refusing both requests, citing a lack of substantive grounds relating to Ms T.\u2019s peformance or professional ethics and pointing out that a replacement of counsel could cause delays in the proceedings which would affect the applicant\u2019s right to an expeditious trial.", "9. Following a statement made by the applicant on 5 May 2003 to the effect that he considered his entire defence team fired, the Trial Chamber on 9 May 2003 instructed the Registrar to appoint independent counsel for the purpose of assisting the applicant in his dispute with his assigned defenders.", "10. In the meantime the applicant\u2019s case had been joined with that of another accused, Major J. The trial opened on 14 May 2003.", "11. The Registrar appointed the lawyer Mr Sj. in the role of independent counsel on 23 May 2003. On 5 June 2003 Mr Sj. filed a motion seeking that the Trial Chamber instruct the Registrar to appoint a new defence team for the applicant due to an absence of trust and communication with the current team. This was denied by the Trial Chamber on 3 July 2003; however, the Trial Chamber requested that the Registrar appoint a legal representative to assist the applicant and his defence team during the trial process in order to re-establish a relationship of trust.", "12. Mr Sj. lodged an appeal against the Trial Chamber\u2019s decision. On 15 September 2003 the Appeals Chamber dismissed the appeal. In so doing it considered that the applicant had failed to demonstrate any error of the Trial Chamber in its impugned decision that would warrant the interference of the Appeals Chamber and that it was in the interests of justice that the applicant retain his assigned counsel, and that the applicant\u2019s trial had been adjourned pending the outcome of his appeal.", "13. On 5 April 2004 the Trial Chamber gave a judgment on motions for acquittal lodged by both accused. It acquitted the applicant of planning, instigating and ordering the crimes with which he was charged, with the exception of genocide. This document names Mr K. and Ms T. as the applicant\u2019s counsel.", "14. The Trial Chamber rendered a single judgment against both the applicant and Major J. on 17 January 2005. This judgment too names Mr K. and Ms T. as the applicant\u2019s counsel. It found the applicant guilty of complicity to commit genocide, aiding and abetting murder as a crime against humanity and as a violation of the laws or customs of war and of aiding and abetting deportation as a crime against humanity and inhumane acts based on forcible transfer as a crime against humanity. The Trial Chamber then sentenced him to eighteen years\u2019 imprisonment, putting the time which he had spent in ICTY\u2019s custody to his credit towards the sentence.", "15. Both the applicant and the prosecution appealed.", "16. The Appeals Chamber gave judgment on 9 May 2007. The judgment names the applicant\u2019s counsel as Mr Vladimir Domazet, who is also his representative in the proceedings before the Court.", "The judgment contains the following passages (footnote references omitted):", "\u201c17. Blagojevi\u0107 submits that the Trial Chamber violated his right to counsel of his choice when it refused to replace his entire defence team after the breakdown in trust and communication between him and his assigned counsel. This submission consists of two principal arguments. First, Blagojevi\u0107 maintains that, even as a participant in the International Tribunal\u2019s legal aid system, he has a right to counsel of his choice. This argument has no merit. An accused who lacks the means to remunerate counsel shall have the right to have counsel assigned to him by the Registrar from the list drawn up in accordance with Rule 45(B), provided that there is no impediment to the assignment of that counsel. While there is the additional limitation placed on the right of an indigent accused to choose counsel in so far as the choice is limited to the list of counsel maintained in accordance with Rule 45, as previously explained in this case, the Registrar normally takes account of an accused\u2019s preferences in assigning counsel, as was done in the present case, but it is also within the Registrar\u2019s discretion to override that preference in the interests of justice. Once counsel has been properly assigned, as was the case here, counsel has a professional obligation to continue representing the accused and may only be withdrawn or replaced, if sufficient cause exists.", "18. Second, Blagojevi\u0107 disputes the conclusion of the Appeals Chamber and Trial Chamber that he was not justified in resisting his assigned legal representation and that he did not show good cause for removing his assigned counsel. Blagojevi\u0107 contends that the breakdown was not, in fact, unilateral because his counsel falsely accused him of trying to engage in fee-splitting. Blagojevi\u0107 argues that this \u2018false and tendentious accusation\u2019 destroyed all possibility of re-establishing any form of cooperation between them because in his view his counsel had accused him of being a \u2018common criminal\u2019. Though the Appeals Chamber found this argument to be without merit at the pre-trial stage, Blagojevi\u0107 points to an exchange at a status conference during the trial where Mr. [K.], in his view, acknowledged and apologized for making false accusations against him, thereby vindicating his refusal to deal with his counsel.", "19. The Appeals Chamber previously explained that the matter of alleged fee-splitting had no bearing on the Trial Chamber\u2019s decision to maintain Blagojevi\u0107\u2019s assigned counsel. The Appeals Chamber nonetheless considered the nature and possible impact of such an allegation on the lawyer-client relationship \u2018for completeness and to ensure finality\u2019. The Appeals Chamber noted that the assigned counsel did not breach any client confidence by raising the issue of fee-splitting, as he was ethically bound to bring such issues to the attention of the Registrar. The Appeals Chamber also determined that this issue should not unduly impact the relationship, in particular, noting that Mr. [K.] did not place blame on Blagojevi\u0107 for attempting to enter into a feesplitting arrangement and instead explained that it resulted from \u2018family pressures\u2019. The Appeals Chamber observed that this was consistent with Blagojevi\u0107\u2019s own explanation. A review of the transcripts of the status conference pointed to by Blagojevi\u0107 does not, contrary to his submissions, indicate that Mr. [K.] admitted to falsely accusing him of trying to engage in fee-splitting. Rather, Mr. [K.] simply made clear, consistent with the submissions previously considered by the Appeals Chamber, that he never accused Blagojevi\u0107 himself of trying to engage in feesplitting.", "20. In addition, Blagojevi\u0107 seeks to reopen the issues considered and decided in the interlocutory appeal by arguing that the Appeals Chamber and Trial Chamber failed to appreciate that the breakdown of his relationship with his counsel would last throughout the trial and prevent him from playing any meaningful role in his defence. However, Blagojevi\u0107\u2019s submissions before trial clearly indicated that he considered the breakdown irreparable. Nonetheless, Blagojevi\u0107 correctly notes that both the Appeals Chamber and Trial Chamber expressed measured optimism that the situation between him and his counsel would improve. This view resulted from the determination that there was no objective basis for Blagojevi\u0107 to be dissatisfied with his counsel\u2019s performance. Blagojevi\u0107 has not called this conclusion into question. More importantly, however, Blagojevi\u0107\u2019s argument on this point fails to address the key aspect of the Appeals Chamber\u2019s earlier holding. In dismissing Blagojevi\u0107\u2019s interlocutory appeal, the Appeals Chamber stated:", "[sub-quotation]", "In circumstances such as this, where an Appellant unjustifiably resists legal representation from assigned Counsel, Counsel\u2019s professional obligations to continue to represent the accused remain. The Appeals Chamber is satisfied that Counsel in this case is committed to representing the Appellant, and that the Appellant will receive a fair trial with the assistance of his assigned Counsel. In dismissing the Appellant\u2019s appeal, the Appeals Chamber wishes to make it clear to the Appellant that he has now exhausted all avenues available to him to voice his objections that he has not been accorded that to which he has no justifiable reason to demand. The Tribunal will not entertain a demand by an Appellant for that to be granted to him to which he has established no legal entitlement.", "[end of sub-quotation]", "21. Blagojevi\u0107\u2019s own submissions under the present ground of appeal reflect that the continued breakdown during the trial and the resulting complaints about the conduct of his defence also resulted from his unilateral refusal to communicate with his counsel, rather than from any action on the part of his counsel and Defence team. The Trial Chamber\u2019s decision on Blagojevi\u0107\u2019s request to testify is exemplary of Mr. [K.]\u2019s continued willingness to meet with and assist him and of Blagojevi\u0107\u2019s unilateral resistance to any cooperation. The Appeals Chamber considers that an appellant cannot premise a request for a new trial on a claim of a total breakdown in communication in circumstances where the appellant unjustifiably refused to cooperate with his or her assigned counsel throughout the trial proceedings.\u201d", "17. The Court understands fee-splitting to be an arrangement under which an accused who has been granted legal aid makes his consent to be represented by assigned counsel conditional on payment to him or her of a portion of the legal aid fees paid to counsel. The judgment includes the following quotation of Mr K. from the transcript of a status conference during the trial (footnote 65 on page 9):", "\u201cI just want to reiterate, one, I have done nothing for which I need to explain or apologise. I have never divulged any attorney/client privileges, nor have I ever accused Mr. Blagojevi\u0107 of making any attempts to fee split as he seems to indicate. I\u2019ve never accused him of that, nor has he ever made any efforts himself. So I want to make sure that\u2019s very clear on the record. I have nothing more, Your Honour. \u201d", "18. The Appeals Chamber went on to dismiss the prosecution\u2019s appeal in its entirety and to allow the applicant\u2019s appeal in part. It reversed the Trial Chamber\u2019s conviction of complicity in genocide and reduced the sentence to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment, subject to credit being given for the period which the applicant had already spent in detention.", "19. One judge, Judge S., appended a partly dissenting opinion in which he expressed the view that the applicant\u2019s steadfast refusal to recognise Mr K. as his counsel ought to have been respected and that the applicant ought to have been granted a retrial.", "20.
