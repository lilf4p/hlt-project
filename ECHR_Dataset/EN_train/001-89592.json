At 3.10 p.m. an MI-8 and two MI-24 helicopters without clear hull numbers appeared in the sky over the field. One of the helicopters had the letters VVS RF (\u201cthe Air Forces of the Russian Federation\u201d) on its side.", "13. The MI-24 helicopters headed towards the field and started shooting over the heads of the people who remained there. Women and children were among their number.", "14. The MI-8 helicopter attacked the \u201cNiva\u201d vehicle. After several warning shots the car stopped. The helicopter then landed nearby and several armed men in uniform approached the \u201cNiva\u201d, strafing it with machine guns.

According to the Government, since the beginning of the counter-terrorist operation in the Chechen Republic, the civil and military authorities had taken all necessary steps to secure the safety of civilians residing in the North Caucasus. The residents of the Chechen Republic had been notified of the actions they should perform when in the area of any special counter-terrorist operation so as to indicate that they did not belong to illegal armed formations. In particular, once they had established \u201cvisual contact\u201d with representatives of the federal forces, residents were to stop moving, exit from their means of transport, show that they had no firearms or other weapons in their hands and wait for the arrival of a group of servicemen for an identity check.", "18.

At about 3.30 p.m., while patrolling over the area in the vicinity of the village of Komsomolskoye, the pilots of the helicopters saw an off-road VAZ-2121 \u201cNiva\u201d vehicle moving at high speed. The pilots fired warning shots using a light machine-gun at a spot situated 20-30 metres away from the car in order to make it stop. In the Government\u2019s submission, the \u201cNiva\u201d accelerated. The pilots again fired warning shots using the same weapons and aiming the same distance from the car. The \u201cNiva\u201d then stopped and the helicopters landed. Servicemen from the helicopters saw a man rush out of the car and hide in thick bushes along the road. According to the Government, the people who remained in the car did not get out and show that they were unarmed. The servicemen started approaching the \u201cNiva\u201d but when they arrived within 10 metres of the car, it suddenly drove off. The officer in command of the servicemen assessed the situation as life-threatening and ordered that lethal fire be opened on the car, with the result that Amkhad Gekhayev and Zalina Mezhidova were shot dead.", "20.

It does not appear that they received any replies to their letters.", "60. Referring to the information provided by the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, the Government submitted that the investigation into the abduction of the applicants\u2019 relatives had been commenced on 27 October 2001, and had then been discontinued on several occasions as there had been no constituent elements of a crime in the servicemen\u2019s actions, and subsequently resumed by higher-ranking prosecutors in view of the incomplete nature of the investigation. According to them, the applicants were duly informed of all the decisions taken during the investigation. The Government adduced a report on the investigative measures taken in case no. 34/33/0741-01. The undated report signed by an acting head of one of the departments of the Main Military Prosecutor\u2019s Office lists investigative measures taken during the investigation, without providing any details concerning those actions.", "61. It can be ascertained from this document that the criminal proceedings in criminal case no. 34/33/0741-01 were instituted under Article 126 (kidnapping) of the Russian Criminal Code on 27 October 2001. They were then discontinued on 30 November 2001 owing to the absence of the constituent elements of a crime in the incident of 27 October 2001. That decision was quashed on 21 June 2002 and the case file was forwarded to the military prosecutor\u2019s office of military unit no. 20102 for further investigation. The report further states that the investigator in charge of the military prosecutor\u2019s office of military unit no. 20102 took up the case on 8 December 2003. It is unclear from the report whether any action was taken in the period between 21 June 2002 and 8 December 2003. The investigation was then discontinued on 8 January 2004 in the absence of the constituent elements of a crime in the incident of 27 October 2001. On 21 May 2004 that decision was set aside and the case was sent for additional investigation. On 10 July 2004 the proceedings were again discontinued, as it was impossible to establish the whereabouts of Captain S., the officer in command of the servicemen involved in the incident of 27 October 2001. Thereafter the investigation was reopened on 23 October 2004 and 7 May 2005 and discontinued in application of an amnesty act on 7 April and 21 July 2005 respectively.", "62. The report also states that the scene of the incident was inspected on 27 October and 29 October 2001, and that the \u201cNiva\u201d vehicle was inspected on 9 November 2001. It can also be ascertained from the report that in the first few days following the incident of 27 October 2001 fragments of bullets and cases were collected at the scene of the incident and in the \u201cNiva\u201d and examined by experts. Also during the first days following the incident investigators seized and examined documents relating to the combat mission of 27 October 2001, as well as firearms and ammunition used by the servicemen involved in the events in question. Over the same few days a number of expert studies were ordered and carried out and a number of witnesses were questioned. The report reveals the names of some of those witnesses, whilst the other witnesses, apparently the servicemen involved in the events of 27 October 2001, are identified only by the first letter of their surnames. According to the report, one A. A. Mezhidov \u2013 apparently the third applicant \u2013 was questioned and granted the status of victim of a crime on 3 November 2001.", "63.

The report further states that the results of the forensic examination of the bodies of the deceased \u201cwere received on 29 June 2004\u201d. It can also be ascertained from the report that at some point criminal proceedings were brought against Captain S., the officer in command of the servicemen who strafed the \u201dNiva\u201d vehicle on 27 October 2001, but were discontinued on 21 July 2005, under an amnesty act.", "64. In their memorial of 6 August 2007, submitted after the decision on admissibility, the Government did not provide any updated information regarding developments in the investigation after 21 July 2005 despite the Court\u2019s specific request for such information. In reply to another question of the Court they indicated that on 29 October 2001 investigators had examined the dead bodies of Amkhad Gekhayev and Zalina Mezhidova in the presence of forensic medical experts. They further submitted that a forensic medical examination of the remains had been ordered and commenced on 30 October 2001 and terminated on 19 February 2002. According to the Government, expert report no. 221 of 19 February 2002 reflecting the results of the examination of Amkhad Gekhayev\u2019s remains had stated that six gunshot and shrapnel wounds had been found on his chest and that those wounds had been caused by bullets and iron fragments of a car body. The report had further attested a traumatic amputation of Amkhad Gekhayev\u2019s lower limbs as a result of the explosion of some explosive device. It had stated that Amkhad Gekhayev\u2019s death had been caused by abundant blood loss as a result of a bullet wound to his chest inflicting injuries of the heart and left lung. In the Government\u2019s submission, expert report no. 222 of 19 February 2002 showing the results of the examination of Zalina Mezhidova\u2019s remains had stated that three bullet wounds had been found on the right buttock, thigh and pubic region. The Government did not provide any further details regarding the results of the examination of Zalina Mezhidova\u2019s body and, in particular, did not indicate the cause of her death. They also remained silent as regards the applicants\u2019 assertion that the upper half of Zalina Mezhidova\u2019s body had been missing. According to them, both reports stated that the gunshot wounds had been inflicted while the victims were alive. The Government did not submit a copy of any of the reports to which they referred.", "65.

He described in detail the events of 27 October 2001, the circumstances of the discovery of the bodies of Amkhad Gekhayev and Zalina Mezhidova and the applicants\u2019 fruitless efforts to have their relatives\u2019 killings investigated. He further complained that the investigation had been plagued with serious defects which rendered it ineffective. The first applicant complained, in particular, that the investigation had been pending for almost a year and a half without any progress, that none of the numerous eye-witnesses to the events of 27 October 2001 had ever been questioned by the investigators, that the reports on the forensic examination of the remains of Amkhad Gekhayev and Zalina Mezhidova had not been included in the case file and that none of the relatives of the deceased could gain access to those reports, that none of the relatives of the deceased had been declared victims, that none of them had received copies of the decisions to open the criminal proceedings or to discontinue the investigation, or been informed what measures were being taken to investigate the events of 27 October 2001, and that their numerous requests and applications had remained unanswered or only formal replies had been given. The first applicant requested the court to order the competent authorities to carry out a full and objective investigation capable of leading to the identification of those responsible for his relatives\u2019 deaths.", "66. The Military Court of the North Caucasus Military Circuit forwarded this complaint to the Grozny Garrison Military Court (\u0413\u0440\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0437\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0434) on 13 November 2003.", "67. In a letter of 1 December 2003 the Grozny Garrison Military Court notified the first applicant that a court hearing in connection with his complaint had been scheduled for 9 December 2003. The letter was sent to the SRJI\u2019s address in Moscow rather than to the first applicant\u2019s address in the Gudermes District of Chechnya. According to the SRJI, they received the above letter on 8 January 2004, and therefore neither the first applicant nor his representatives from the SRJI were able to attend the hearing.", "68. On 9 December 2003, in the absence of the first applicant or his representatives and in the presence of the defendants\u2019 representatives, the Grozny Garrison Military Court examined the first applicant\u2019s complaint of 13 October 2003 and dismissed it as unfounded. The court held, in particular:", "\u201cIt has been established that the objective reason for the prolonged processing of the case was that the case file had been transmitted to various levels of the competent authorities by confidential mail.", "The question of the necessity of questioning any witnesses falls within the competence of the investigator in charge or the supervising prosecutor.", "The case material also reveals that the report on the forensic examination of the bodies of Z. Mezhidova and A. Gekhayeva was not included in the case file, with the result that it was impossible for the [applicants] to gain access to it.", "...", "...On 22 July 2002 the decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings in connection with the abduction of Z.

Gekhayev by [the] servicemen was quashed and it was not until 8 December [2003] that the senior investigator of the military prosecutor\u2019s office of military unit no. 20102 took up the case. As a result, the [applicants] have not been informed of the course of the investigation and so far [they] have not been granted the status of victims of a crime.", "Accordingly, it has been established that there is no evidence of any breach of the law in the [defendants\u2019] actions.\u201d", "69. On 20 January 2004 the SRJI wrote to the Grozny Garrison Military Court stating that they had not received the court\u2019s letter of 1 December 2003 until 8 January 2004. They requested the court to send them a copy of its decision of 9 December 2003, if a decision had been taken on that date, and henceforth to inform them of court hearings in advance. They also pointed out that the first applicant\u2019s address in Chechnya had been indicated on the front page of his complaint.", "70. By two letters of 17 June 2004 the Grozny Garrison Military Court forwarded a copy of its decision of 9 December 2003, without further explanations, to the first applicant and the SRJI. According to the applicants, this letter never reached the first applicant, whilst the SRJI received it on 4 September 2004.", "71. On 13 September 2004 the SRJI dispatched an application to have the time-limit for appealing against the decision of 9 December 2003 restored. The application was sent by registered mail and received by the Grozny Garrison Military Court on 21 October 2004. No reply followed.", "72. On 11 February 2005 the SRJI forwarded a copy of their application of 13 September 2005 to the Grozny Garrison Military Court and asked the latter to provide them with reasons for its failure to reply to the motion received by the court on 21 October 2004. According to the applicants, they were informed in reply that the court had not received their letter of 13 September 2004. The outcome of these proceedings is unclear.", "73. In April 2005, when the application was communicated to them, the Government were invited to produce a copy of the investigation file in the criminal case opened in connection with the incident of 27 October 2001. Relying on information obtained from the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, the Government replied that the investigation was in progress and that the disclosure of the documents would be in violation of Article 161 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure since the file contained information of a military nature and personal data concerning the witnesses. At the same time, the Government suggested that a Court delegation could have access to the file at the place where the preliminary investigation was being conducted, with the exception of \u201cthe documents [disclosing military information and personal data concerning the witnesses], and without the right to make copies of the case file and to transmit it to others\u201d.", "74. In August 2005 the Court reiterated its request and suggested that Rule 33 \u00a7 3 of the Rules of Court be applied. In reply, the Government again refused to produce the investigation file for the aforementioned reasons. The Government did, however, submit a report containing a list of investigative measures taken in the context of the investigation in case no. 34/33/0741-01 (see paragraphs 60-63 above).", "75. On 3 May 2007 the application was declared partly admissible. At that stage the Court once again invited the Government to submit the investigation file and to provide information concerning the progress in the investigation after 21 July 2005, the latest date on which it had been stayed. Having regard to the Government\u2019s statement to the effect that on 27 October 2001 the federal servicemen had been pursuing a combat mission in order to suppress the criminal activity of members of illegal armed formations in Chechnya, and to their argument that the use of force by the federal servicemen was no more than absolutely necessary during the incident on 27 October 2001, the Court also put a number of factual questions to the Government. It enquired, in particular, how and by whom the mission had been planned and commanded, whether, and, if so, in what manner, the military personnel involved had been instructed to avoid civilian casualties, and whether any firearms or unlawful violence had been used by the applicants\u2019 relatives before the federal servicemen fired lethal shots.", "76. In reply, the Government once again refused to furnish the Court with the investigation file, referring to Article 161 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure and the lack of assurances from the Court that, once in receipt of the investigation file, the applicants or their representatives would not disclose the material contained in it to the public. The Government remained silent as regards the Court\u2019s question concerning progress in the investigation after 21 July 2005, and the question whether firearms or any unlawful violence had been used by the applicants\u2019 relatives against the federal servicemen on 27 October 2001. As regards the Court\u2019s question on the planning and commanding of the combat mission of 27 October 2001 and whether any instructions had been given to the military personnel to avoid civilian casualties during that mission, the Government replied that during the combat mission the federal servicemen, both commanding officers and their subordinates, had acted in compliance with national legislation and regulations for securing the safety of the civilian population and those relating to the use of lethal force, and that \u201cevery serviceman ... knows and must strictly comply with the rules governing contacts with the civilian population in areas of military action\u201d. They refused to provide any further details or any relevant documents, stating that such information constituted a military secret.", "77. The Government adduced copies of domestic court decisions reached in unrelated sets of civil and criminal proceedings. These included four first-instance judgments by which federal servicemen, privates or non-commissioned officers, had been convicted of criminal offences committed in the Republic of Ingushetia or the Chechen Republic, as well as a first-instance judgment and appeal decision awarding compensation for omissions on the part of the investigating authorities during the investigation into an individual\u2019s abduction in the Republic of Karachayevo-Cherkessia, the person in question having subsequently been released.", "78.
