The applicant refused to do so until he was given an explanation for the reason for his transfer.", "7. On 3 May 2006 three officers approached him and requested him to follow them. As they reached cell 121 he was ordered to go into that cell, which was empty. He refused, asking for an explanation from the prison administration, but was then allegedly assaulted by the officers, helped by two other staff members, who punched and kicked him and hit him with rubber truncheons, then banged his head against the wall, causing him severe pain. They swore at him and told him that they were fed up with his complaints about various alleged violations of his rights. When he could no longer resist, he was pushed into cell 121, where he ran to the window and broke it, took a piece of glass and slit his wrist in the hope that that would stop the ill-treatment and would ensure a visit from a doctor. However, the assailants continued to beat him up in the cell, and then took him to a psychiatrist.", "8. According to the Government, the applicant refused all medical assistance on 3 May 2006.

He noted that the applicant\u2019s complaint had been received on 28 July 2006. He relied on the medical documents produced in Prison no. 13, which did not confirm the applicant\u2019s allegation of ill-treatment on 3 May 2006.

He was also convicted of threatening with violence five officers of Prison no. 13 who had been escorting him to another cell. In this latter respect, the court summarised the witness statements made by various prison officers and detainees (see paragraphs 28-33 above). The court considered that the detainees who had confirmed the applicant\u2019s statements concerning his ill-treatment by the prison officers who accused him of threatening them, had made the statements to protect the applicant from criminal liability.", "35. On 6 December 2007 the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Court of Appeal upheld the lower court\u2019s judgment. In respect of the events of 3 May 2006 the court referred to the applicant\u2019s punishment for breaching prison regulations on 3 May 2006 and the results of the medical examination of some of the staff attacked by the applicant on that day.

On 22 May 2008 Botanica District Court rejected the applicant\u2019s action as unfounded, finding that he could not claim any compensation without a criminal conviction of the prison officers he had accused of ill-treatment. During the hearing on that day the applicant noted that the prosecutor had been well aware of the existence of video materials, as well as that they had been destroyed very soon afterwards, but had done nothing to obtain the materials in order to substantiate his complaint of ill-treatment. In reply, a prosecutor representing the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office informed the court that the prosecution had been aware of the fact that Prison no. 13 was under video surveillance, but had decided at that time that video recording was not necessary in view of the other materials in the file, which were sufficient to adopt a lawful decision. Moreover, the materials had been destroyed by the time the verification had taken place.", "39. On 15 December 2008 the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Court of Appeal upheld the first-instance court judgment."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
