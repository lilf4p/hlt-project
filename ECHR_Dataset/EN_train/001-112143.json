The applicants are of Serbian origin. They had a specially protected tenancy on a flat in Zagreb in which the first applicant lived until 1991 and the second applicant until 1992, when they left Croatia and went to live in Serbia.", "4. On 10 April 1995 the Zagreb Municipal State Attorney\u2019s Office (Op\u0107insko dr\u017eavno odvjetni\u0161tvo u Zagrebu), on behalf of the Republic of Croatia, brought a civil action against the applicants in the Zagreb Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Zagrebu), seeking termination of their tenancy on the grounds that the applicants had been absent from the flat for a period exceeding six months without any justified reason, and that their address was unknown.", "5.

On 12 April 2002 that court again terminated the applicants\u2019 specially protected tenancy, finding that the applicants had failed to provide a convincing explanation for leaving the flat at issue and for remaining passive for three years before trying to seek information about the status of their tenancy. The applicants lodged an appeal with the Zagreb County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Zagrebu), which upheld the first-instance judgment on 25 November 2003.", "9.

On 19 March 2010 the applicants complained to the Zagreb County Court about the length of the proceedings before the Zagreb Municipal Court.

The civil proceedings before the Zagreb Municipal Court are still pending.", "16. On 19 January 2004 the applicants lodged an application with the Court complaining about the termination of their specially protected tenancy and the fairness of the proceedings before the Zagreb Municipal Court.

The applicants further complained under Article 14 of the Convention, taken in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, that their tenancy had been terminated because of their Serbian origin. Lastly, the applicants complained under Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention about the outcome of the civil proceedings in respect of the termination of their specially protected tenancy before the Zagreb Municipal Court.", "19.

He also invoked Article 2 of the Covenant (respect for human rights and effective domestic remedy).", "21. On 30 March 2009 the Human Rights Committee in Geneva set out its views in communication no. 1510/2006. It found that the termination of the applicants\u2019 specially protected tenancy amounted to a violation of Article 14 \u00a7 1 taken in conjunction with Article 2 \u00a7 1, and Article 17 taken in conjunction with Article 2 \u00a7 1 of the Covenant, and that there was no need to consider the question of a separate violation of Article 26 of the Covenant."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
