The Russian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by Mr P. Laptev, the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "In 2002 Mr N. lodged an action against the applicant seeking repayment of a loan. The Myasnikovskiy District Court of the Rostov Region listed the first hearing for 11 March 2002. The applicant informed the District Court that he was unable to attend because he was in hospital. He asked for a stay of the proceedings.", "The hearing of 11 March 2002 was adjourned and rescheduled for 19 March 2002. According to the Government, the District Court sent a summons to the applicant notifying him of the hearing. According to the applicant, he was not summonsed to that hearing.", "On 19 March 2002 the Myasnikovskiy District Court upheld Mr N.\u2019s action in the applicant\u2019s absence and ordered that the applicant should repay him the loan and interest thereon. Mr N.\u2019s representative attended the hearing and made oral submissions.", "On 15 May 2002 the Rostov Regional Court quashed the judgment and remitted the case for fresh examination.", "The President of the Rostov Regional Court lodged an application for supervisory review of the judgment of 15 May 2002. On 4 July 2002 the Presidium of the Rostov Regional Court, by way of supervisory-review proceedings, quashed the judgment of 15 May 2002 and upheld the judgment of 19 March 2002.", "On 14 October 2003 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, on a petition by the applicant for supervisory review, quashed the judgment of 4 July 2002 and upheld the judgment of 15 May 2002. The Supreme Court, in so far as relevant, held as follows:", "\u201c...it appears from the case materials [that] the first-instance court examined the case in the absence of the defendant.", "The judgment of the Myasnikovskiy District Court of the Rostov Region was quashed on appeal, and the case was sent for re-examination. The judgment of the appellate court stated that the judgment of the [District] court was to be quashed because it had been made in violation of the requirements of Article 157 of the RSFSR Code of Civil Procedure. In particular, there was no evidence in the case file that Mr Babunidze had received a telegram containing information on the date of the hearing, which is a ground for quashing a judgment according to paragraph 2 of Article 306 of the RSFSR Code of Civil Procedure.", "...", "The judgment of 4 July 2002 of the Presidium of the Rostov Regional Court should be quashed because it was issued in violation of the procedural legal norms.", "Pursuant to Article 106 of the RSFSR Code of Civil Procedure, in force at the material time, parties to the proceedings and their representatives should be informed by a court summons about the time and place of a court hearing or about other procedural actions...", "A summons should be served on the parties and their representatives in such a way [as to ensure] that they have enough time to prepare their case and arrive at the court.", "Pursuant to Article 157 of the RSFSR Code of Civil Procedure, where a party fails to appear and there is no evidence that he/she was properly summonsed, the court hearing is to be adjourned.", "Pursuant to Article 308 \u00a7 2 of the RSFSR Code of Civil Procedure, examination of a case in the absence of a party which was not properly notified of the date and place of the court hearing is an unconditional ground for the quashing of a judgment.", "There is no evidence in the file that Mr Babunidze was notified of the time and place of the court hearing, [and] thus the appeal judgment by which the District Court\u2019s judgment, made in violation of Article 157 of the RSFSR Code of Civil Procedure, was quashed, is lawful and substantiated. The Presidium of the Rostov Regional Court had no grounds for quashing it. \u201d", "The case file was returned to the Myasnikovskiy District Court. After receiving the case file, the court fixed several hearings. According to the Government, the applicant was summonsed to the hearings but failed to appear on every occasion. In particular, the District Court fixed five hearings in June 2005, five in July 2005, three in August and four in September 2005. The applicant did not attend, motioning the District Court to stay the proceedings because he was undergoing outpatient treatment for hypertension.", "The District Court listed a hearing for 3 October 2005. The applicant again asked the District Court to adjourn the hearing, alleging that he had sustained an injury and could not attend.", "The District Court asked the hospital for information on the applicant\u2019s state of health. On 6 October 2005 the hospital replied that the applicant had complained to a doctor about pain in a knee-joint and that that injury was not serious enough to have prevented him from participating in the hearing of 3 October 2005.", "The following hearing was fixed for 10 October 2005. The District Court sent a telegram to the applicant\u2019s home address, notifying him of the hearing. The telegram could not be delivered because the applicant was not at home. A postman left a notice in the applicant\u2019s mail box, informing him about the telegram and noting that it had been sent by the District Court. The applicant failed to retrieve the telegram.", "On 10 October 2005 the Myasnikovskiy District Court held a hearing. The applicant did not attend. The District Court considered that he had been properly summonsed and delivered judgment in Mr N.\u2019s favour. The District Court held, in particular:", "\u201cBy virtue of Article 113 of the RF Code of Civil Procedure, parties to the proceedings are to be summonsed to a hearing by a letter sent by registered mail with an acknowledgment of receipt, by a court summons with an acknowledgment of receipt, by a telegram, by phone or fax or by any other means which can guarantee the recording of the fact that the summons was sent and was received by the party. Parties must inform the court of changes to their address during the proceedings. If a party fails to notify the court of such a change, a court summons is to be sent to the addressee\u2019s last known address and is considered to be delivered even if the addressee no longer lives or resides there (Article 118 of the Code of Civil Procedure).", "At the last court hearing in which the defendant participated on 23 May 2005, he indicated the following address as his residence... This circumstance is also confirmed by the address certificate of 12 September 2005, enclosed in the case file. Under Article 118 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the applicant was under an obligation to inform the court of any change in his address during the proceedings, but did not do this.", "Having regard to the above considerations, the court finds that under Article 118 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the summons in the form of the telegram which was sent to the defendant\u2019s last known address, was delivered to him and considers it possible to examine the case in Mr Babunidze\u2019s absence, in accordance with Article 167 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d", "The applicant appealed against the judgment, alleging defective notification of the hearing of 10 October 2005. The Rostov Regional Court accepted the statement of appeal and fixed a hearing for 30 November 2005. The applicant was summonsed. However, he asked the Regional Court to adjourn the appeal hearing on account of his ill-health.", "On 30 November 2005 the Rostov Regional Court upheld the judgment of 10 October 2005 in the applicant\u2019s absence. It addressed in detail the applicant\u2019s complaint about the defective notifications to the hearings before the District Court. The Regional Court again confirmed that the telegram had been sent to the applicant, notifying him of the hearing on 10 October 2005. It had not been delivered because the applicant had not been at home. He had not responded to the note about the telegram. Furthermore, the applicant had been aware that the hearing of 3 October 2005 had been adjourned at his request, submitted on the same day. He had had an opportunity to ask the District Court about the date of the following hearing but had failed to do so.", "Furthermore, the Regional Court pointed out that, during the re-examination of the case following the quashing of the judgment of 4 July 2002, the applicant had failed to attend more than fifteen hearings over the previous five months. He had been properly summonsed to every one of them and had had an opportunity to appoint a representative. However, he had persistently lodged motions for adjournment on the ground that he had been undergoing outpatient treatment. At the same time, he had not submitted any evidence showing that he had been unable to take part in the hearings due to his state of health. Furthermore, the applicant had not attended the hearing on 3 October 2005, complaining about an injury, although it subsequently became clear that he had been fit to take part. The Regional Court concluded that the applicant had abused his procedural rights and had procrastinated in the proceedings. The District Court had had no choice but to issue the judgment in his absence.", "The Regional Court dismissed the request for an adjournment of the appeal hearing, holding as follows:", "\u201cOn 30 November 2005 Mr Babunidze did not attend the appeal hearing before the Rostov Regional Court. He filed a written petition for an adjournment of the appeal proceedings on the ground that he was ill. He submitted a certificate issued on 29 November 2005 by Rostov town hospital no. 9, confirming that Mr Babunidze had several illnesses, including hypertension, stenocardia, etc., on the basis of which he was recommended for outpatient treatment.", "The representative [of the plaintiff] objects to the adjournment, insisting that the defendant systematically defaults, referring to various illnesses from which he suffers, and that he intentionally procrastinates in the examination of the present case.", "In accordance with Article 354 of the Code of Civil Procedure, by virtue of which the absence of a party properly notified of the date and place of a court hearing does not prevent an appellate court from examining the case, and having regard to the fact that there is no evidence that [Mr Babunidze\u2019s] illnesses and the state of his health on 30 November 2005 prevented him or his representative from participating in the hearing (under Article 48 of the Code of Civil Procedure the defendant has a right to participate in the appeal proceedings himself or through some form of representation, including an advocate, but [the applicant] did not consider it necessary to make use of such a right), the [Regional] court decides to reject the request [for an adjournment].\u201d", "1.
