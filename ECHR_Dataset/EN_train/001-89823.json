The applicant\u2019s family lived in the village of \u0104\u017euolpamu\u0161io, Pasvalys district. Her husband died on 15 April 2002.", "6. Prior to his death, on 31 January 2001 the biggest Lithuanian daily newspaper, Lietuvos Rytas, published a front page article entitled \u201cPasvalys villages paralysed by the fear of death: residents of the remote Lithuanian area shackled by the AIDS threat\u201d (Pasvalio kaimus paraly\u017eavo mirties baim\u0117: nuo\u0161alios Lietuvos vietov\u0117s gyventojai atsid\u016br\u0117 AIDS gr\u0117sm\u0117s gniau\u017etuose). The following statements of particular concern to the applicant\u2019s family were made in the article:", "\u201cNotoriously promiscuous, thirty-year old Gitana Biriuk is already sick with this fatal disease ...", "An HIV-positive person lives in a village in the Pajie\u0161menys area. This [is] G. Biriuk, an unmarried mother of two children ...", "The father of G. Biriuk\u2019s two children is an inhabitant of Paie\u0161meni\u0173 [village] - L. Armonas...", "Medics at the Pasvalys hospital confirmed that G. Biriuk is HIV-positive. The woman was taken to hospital with tuberculosis. Blood tests revealed that she was HIV-positive ...", "The woman [G. Biriuk] has already been diagnosed with AIDS - this is the last stage of the infection. The disease can last from a year up to ten years but finally ends with death...", "Laimis Armonas is HIV-positive...", "Last week ... the father of G. Biriuk\u2019s two children, living in Pajie\u0161meni\u0173 village, was taken to Pasvalys hospital with a high fever...", "L. Armonas is another victim of AIDS...", "From the appearance of the patient [reference to L. Armonas] and the symptoms of the disease, the doctors suspected that he might be HIV-positive. The reply recently received from the AIDS centre confirmed the suspicions.\u201d", "7. The husband instituted proceedings in the Vilnius City Third District Court, suing the newspaper for non-pecuniary damages in the amount of 50,000 Lithuanian litai (LTL, or about 14,460 euro (EUR)) for a breach of his right to privacy.", "8. On 19 July 2001 the court ruled in his favour. The court found that the defendant had not proved the truthfulness of the published allegations as to the husband\u2019s relationship with G. Biriuk, or that the information about the husband\u2019s state of health, indicating his full name and residence, had been made public with his consent, or met a legitimate public interest in drawing society\u2019s attention to the rising number of HIV cases in Lithuania. Having assessed all the relevant evidence, the court decided that there was no proof that the husband was the father of G. Biriuk\u2019s children. The article humiliated the husband and the publication of information about his private life caused him non-pecuniary damage, had an impact on his health, and a negative influence on his family life and his reputation. It also restricted his family\u2019s opportunities to communicate with others. The court noted that in 2001 the statutory capital of the newspaper company - JSC Lietuvos Rytas - was LTL 33,754,700 (approximately EUR 9,776,037). However, the court concluded that the information had not been made public deliberately, and applied Article 54 \u00a7 1 of the Law on the Provision of Information to the Public. Accordingly, it awarded the husband the maximum sum set by this Law in such circumstances, i.e. LTL 10,000 (about EUR 2,896), in compensation for non-pecuniary damage.", "9. The husband appealed to the Vilnius Regional Court. On 8 October 2001 the court dismissed the appeal, agreeing with the lower court\u2019s reasoning.", "10. As mentioned above, the husband died on 15 April 2002.", "11. On 24 April 2002 the Supreme Court upheld the appellate court\u2019s decision. It stated that an award exceeding the amount of LTL 10,000 set by the aforementioned legislation could be granted if it were established that information had been published intentionally. The court observed that by printing the article the newspaper had committed two violations: first, it had published information which was not true and which debased the husband\u2019s honour and reputation, and, secondly, it had published data about his private life without his consent. However the Supreme Court ruled that the lower courts had come to the well-founded conclusion that the husband had not proved that the defendant had published information about him deliberately and, therefore, there was no ground to increase the amount of compensation for non-pecuniary damage fivefold, as envisaged by Article 54 \u00a7 1 of the Law on the Provision of Information to the Public.", "12. Article 22 of the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania provides as relevant:", "\u201cThe private life of a human being shall be inviolable...

Non-pecuniary damage shall be compensated only in cases provided for by laws. Non-pecuniary damage shall be compensated in all cases where it has been incurred due to crime, health impairment or deprivation of life, as well as in other cases provided for by laws. The courts, in assessing the amount of non-pecuniary damage, shall take into consideration the consequences of the damage sustained, the gravity of the fault of the person by whom the damage is caused, his financial status, the amount of pecuniary damage sustained by the aggrieved person, and any other circumstances of importance for the case, as well as the criteria of good faith, justice and reasonableness.\u201d", "16.

The amount of the compensation for non-pecuniary damage may not be in excess of LTL 10,000, except for cases when the court establishes that false information degrading the honour and dignity of a person has been published intentionally. In such cases the amount may, by a decision of a court, be increased, but not more than fivefold. In each case the amount awarded to the plaintiff may not be in excess of five percent of the annual income of the publisher and (or) disseminator of public information. ...", "4.

The rights of the person are protected irrespective of whether the disseminated information degrades his or her honour and dignity.\u201d", "19. The Ruling further stipulated that the producer or disseminator of public information who publishes information about an individual\u2019s private life without his or her consent must compensate for the non-pecuniary damage caused. When assessing the monetary compensation for such damage, the courts should take into consideration the guilt of the defendant, his or her behaviour after the dissemination of the information, the negative impact on the plaintiff\u2019s professional or social life and the form and manner in which the information was disseminated, as well as its content and other relevant circumstances.
