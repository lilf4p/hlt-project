CROATIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6;Violation of P1-1", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["4. The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Jastrebarsko.", "5. On 3 February 1994 the police authorities impounded the applicant's vehicle suspecting that it had been stolen.", "6. On 25 November 1994 the Osijek Municipal State Attorney's Office gave a decision by which it refused to institute criminal proceedings against a certain M.S. \u2013 a person from whom in 1992 the applicant had bought the car \u2013 and dismissed the criminal complaint relating thereto. It however failed to decide on returning the vehicle to the applicant.", "7. Meanwhile, on 23 June 1994 the applicant brought a civil action against the State in the Zagreb Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Zagrebu) seeking recovery of the impounded vehicle or, alternatively, pecuniary damages. Subsequently, on 9 November 1999, the applicant withdrew the first claim maintaining the one for damages.", "8. On 10 October 1997 the Municipal Court gave judgment dismissing the applicant's claim. The applicant appealed.", "9. On 11 May 1999 the Zagreb County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Zagrebu) quashed the first-instance judgment for misapplication of substantive law and remitted the case.", "10. In the resumed proceedings, the Municipal Court held hearings on 5 November 1999, 5 September 2001, 7 March 2003 and 11 March 2004. The hearings scheduled for 16 March 2001 and 2 July 2002 were adjourned owing to the illness of the judge assigned to hear the case, and to the applicant's absence, respectively.", "11. On 11 March 2004 the parties reached an in-court settlement (sudska nagodba) whereby the State was to return the vehicle to the applicant, pay her 30,000 Croatian kunas (HRK) in respect of pecuniary damages, cover the costs of the proceedings in the amount of HRK 13,664 and pay the statutory default interest on these amounts accruable from the date of settlement, all within eight days. Under Croatian law an in-court settlement is equal, in terms of its effects, to a res judicata judgment and constitutes an enforcement title.", "12. Since the State failed to perform the assumed obligations, on 15 September 2004 the applicant applied to the Zagreb Municipal Court for enforcement of the part of the above settlement concerning payment of damages and costs of proceedings. The case was later on transferred to the Jastrebarsko Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Jastrebarskom).", "13. On 15 February 2005 the Jastrebarsko Municipal Court issued a writ of execution (rje\u0161enje o ovrsi), which was carried out on 5 April 2005.", "14. The applicant's vehicle has not been returned to her. The Government submitted that she had never attempted to enforce that part of the in-court settlement. The applicant, however, submitted that, relying on the settlement, she had attempted to retrieve her vehicle from the police authorities but had been sent from one location to another, at none of which her car could be found.", "15. Meanwhile, on 16 July 2002 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint under section 63 of the Constitutional Court Act complaining about the length of the above proceedings. On 29 September 2004 the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) dismissed her complaint finding that the delay was attributable to the complexity of the case and the applicant's conduct. In particular, it found that the applicant had contributed to the length of the proceedings in that she had failed to attend the hearing of 2 July 2002. As to the conduct of the Municipal Court, the Constitutional Court observed that there had existed two substantial periods during which no hearings had been held. However, even though they altogether amounted to more than two years, they had been justified because in that period the Municipal Court had been taking evidence by corresponding with the competent administrative authorities.", "16.
