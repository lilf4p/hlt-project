The court further based itself on another report prepared by the General Directorate of Security, dated 24 October 1996. In this report, it was stated that Hezbollah had been involved in many terrorist attacks throughout Turkey. Finally, the court examined a report from a book called \u201cthe Eurasia File\u201d (Avrasya Dosyas\u0131), which was published by the International Relations and Strategic Studies Centre.
