The applicant, Mr Beniamin Nersesyan, is a Canadian national who was born in 1954 and lives in Misissauga, Canada. He was represented before the Court by Ms A. Atoyan, a lawyer practising in Yerevan. The respondent Government were represented by their Agent, Mr G. Kostanyan, Representative of the Republic of Armenia at the European Court of Human Rights.", "2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "3. Since 1993 the applicant has been living in Canada.", "4. On 2 August 2006 he instituted civil proceedings against his brother, seeking to have annulled a number of documents relating to his brother\u2019s acquisition of their deceased father\u2019s estate and to be recognised as one of the heirs. He alleged that his father, prior to his death in September 1998, had made a will which named him and his brother as heirs. The notary, when formalising the inheritance in March 1999 pursuant to the law, had failed to verify this circumstance before issuing his brother and mother with an inheritance certificate.", "5. On 18 October 2006 the Kentron and Nork-Marash District Court of Yerevan (\u0535\u0580\u0587\u0561\u0576\u056b \u053f\u0565\u0576\u057f\u0580\u0578\u0576 \u0587 \u0546\u0578\u0580\u0584-\u0544\u0561\u0580\u0561\u0577 \u0570\u0561\u0574\u0561\u0575\u0576\u0584\u0576\u0565\u0580\u056b \u0561\u057c\u0561\u057b\u056b\u0576 \u0561\u057f\u0575\u0561\u0576\u056b \u0564\u0561\u057f\u0561\u0580\u0561\u0576) examined and dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim as unsubstantiated. The District Court found that the applicant had been aware of his father\u2019s death and was therefore aware that an inheritance procedure had been opened. In spite of this, he had missed the six month time-limit prescribed by law to claim the inheritance.", "6. On an unspecified date the applicant lodged an appeal.", "7. On 13 December 2006 the Civil Court of Appeal (\u0540\u0540 \u0584\u0561\u0572\u0561\u0584\u0561\u0581\u056b\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576 \u0563\u0578\u0580\u056e\u0565\u0580\u0578\u057e \u057e\u0565\u0580\u0561\u0584\u0576\u0576\u056b\u0579 \u0564\u0561\u057f\u0561\u0580\u0561\u0576) upheld the judgment of the District Court, reaching similar conclusions.", "8.

Pursuant to Article 231.2 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (\u201cthe CCP\u201d), he argued that these violations would have grave consequences, namely the loss of his property. He further argued that the decision to be adopted by the Court of Cassation would have a significant impact on the uniform application of the law, claiming that a person was not obliged to know about the existence of a will on the day of the testator\u2019s death. He finally argued that the judgment of the Court of Appeal contradicted a decision of the Court of Cassation adopted on 3 March 2005 in connection with another dispute. A copy of that decision was attached to the applicant\u2019s appeal.", "9. On 15 January 2007 the Court of Cassation, sitting in camera as a panel of seven judges, decided to return the appeal, that is, to declare it inadmissible. The reasons provided were as follows:", "\u201cThe Civil Chamber of the Court of Cassation ... having examined the question of admitting [the applicant\u2019s appeal lodged against the judgment of the Civil Court of Appeal of 13 December 2006], found that it must be returned with the following reasoning:", "Pursuant to Article 230 \u00a7 1 (4.1) of [the CCP] an appeal on points of law must contain any of the grounds [required by] Article 231.2 \u00a7 1 of [the CCP].", "10.
