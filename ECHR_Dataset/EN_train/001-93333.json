The courts relied mainly on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question and on he might obstruct the proceedings.

Between 2005 and 2007 the Gda\u0144sk Regional Court held fourteen hearings in the case.", "14. The applicant was released on 14 May 2007. The Gda\u0144sk Regional Court found that the necessary pieces of evidence had been obtained and the case was at its final stage, so there was no need to prolong the applicant\u2019s detention.", "15. The proceedings are pending.", "16. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of detention on remand (aresztowanie tymczasowe), the grounds for its prolongation, release from detention and rules governing other, so-called \u201cpreventive measures\u201d (\u015brodki zapobiegawcze) are stated in the Court\u2019s judgments in the cases of Go\u0142ek v.
