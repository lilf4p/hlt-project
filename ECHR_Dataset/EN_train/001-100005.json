He had stated before the national authorities that he had left Egypt for economic reasons and had paid money to human smugglers to be brought to Istanbul where he aimed to find work. In support of their observations the Government submitted the applicant's statement taken on the day he was arrested. The document is signed, inter alia, by the applicant as well as a translator.", "On 18 February 2008 the applicant contacted a lawyer who works with the UNHCR in Turkey and stated that he was denied access to the asylum procedure.

In this connection the applicant invoked Articles 2, 3, 5 and 6 of the Convention. On the same day the Court decided to indicate the interim measure until further notice. The Government were asked a number of questions and both parties were requested to submit relevant documents.", "On 25 March 2009 the UNHCR interviewed the applicant.
