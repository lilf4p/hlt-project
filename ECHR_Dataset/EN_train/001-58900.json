When the applicant realised that she was going to be sent to Iran she told the Aliens Department that she was an Iranian national.

An Iranian woman, the co-accused of a foreign businessman, was reportedly sentenced to 100 lashes in October 1999 after she was convicted of illicit sexual relations. It was unknown whether the sentence was carried out.

He had been sentenced to death for adultery.", "32. The 1999 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, released on 25 February 2000 by the US Department of State, mention, with reference to Iran, that harsh punishments are carried out, including stoning and flogging.
