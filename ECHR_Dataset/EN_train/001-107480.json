The fourth applicant is the second applicant\u2019s son. He is a student and lives in Chi\u015fin\u0103u.", "5. The facts concerning the background of application no. 48787/99, including the Transdniestrian armed conflict of 1991-1992 and the period up to late 2003, are set out in Ila\u015fcu, Ivan\u0163oc, Le\u015fco and Petrov-Popa v. Moldova and Russia [GC], no. 48787/99, \u00a7\u00a7 28-183, ECHR 2004VII.", "6. The first and second applicants were detained until their release, respectively on 2 and 4 June 2007, in the \u201cMoldovian Republic of Transdniestria\u201d (MRT).", "7. On 9 December 1993 the first and second applicants were tried and convicted by the \u201cSupreme Court of the Moldavian Republic of Transdniestria\u201d for various crimes and offences such as murder, deliberate destruction of another\u2019s property and the unauthorised use and theft of ammunition or explosive substances. They were sentenced to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment and confiscation of their property.", "8. In 1999 the first and second applicants, as well as two other individuals who had been tried and convicted with them in 1993, namely Mr Ilie Ila\u015fcu and Mr Alexandru Le\u015fco, filed an application with the Court concerning, inter alia, the alleged unlawfulness of their detention and their conditions of detention.", "9. In a judgment of 8 July 2004 in application no. 48787/99 the Grand Chamber of the Court found that both Moldova and the Russian Federation\u2019s responsibility was engaged with regard to the acts complained of and held that there had been violations of various Articles of the Convention (see below, paragraph 12).", "10. In the first place, the Court found that the Moldovan Government was the only legitimate government of the Republic of Moldova under international law, but that it did not exercise authority over that part of its territory that was under the effective control of the \u201cMoldavian Republic of Transdniestria\u201d (MRT). Nevertheless, in the Court\u2019s opinion, the Moldovan Government were under a positive obligation under Article 1 of the Convention to take the diplomatic, economic, judicial or other measures that were in their power to take and that were in accordance with international law to secure to the applicants the rights guaranteed by the Convention (Ila\u015fcu, Ivan\u0163oc, Le\u015fco and Petrov-Popa v. Moldova and Russia ([GC], no. 48787/99, ECHR 2004-VII, \u00a7\u00a7 330-331).", "It further stated that it was not its task to indicate which measures the authorities had to take in order to comply with their obligations most effectively, but that it had to verify that the measures actually taken were appropriate and sufficient in the present case. When faced with a partial or total failure to act, the Court\u2019s task was to determine to what extent a minimum effort was nevertheless possible and whether it should have been made. Determining that question was especially necessary in cases concerning an alleged infringement of absolute rights such as those guaranteed by Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention (ibid. \u00a7 334).", "The Court noted that until 2001, the Moldovan authorities had taken various measures aimed at obtaining the applicants\u2019 release and that as a result, Mr Ila\u015fcu was released in May 2001. It considered that even after Mr Ila\u015fcu\u2019s release in May 2001, it was within the power of the Moldovan Government to take measures to secure to the applicants their rights under the Convention. It further noted that the negotiations for a settlement of the situation in Transdniestria, in which the Russian Federation was acting as a guarantor State, had been on-going since 2001 without any mention of the applicants or without any measure being taken or considered by the Moldovan authorities to secure the applicants their Convention rights, although it was within the power of the Moldovan Government to take such measures (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 350 and 351).", "The Court therefore held that Moldova\u2019s responsibility was capable of being engaged under the Convention on account of its failure to discharge its positive obligations with regard to the acts complained of which occurred after May 2001 (ibid., \u00a7 352).", "11. As to the Russian Federation, the Court found that all of the acts committed by the Russian soldiers with regard to the applicants before the ratification of the Convention by the Russian Federation, including their transfer into the charge of the Transdniestrian separatist regime, in the context of the Russian authorities\u2019 collaboration with that illegal regime, were capable of engaging responsibility for the acts of that regime (ibid., \u00a7 385).", "Turning to the question whether that responsibility was still engaged at the time of the ratification of the Convention by the Russian Federation, the Court found that the \u201cMRT\u201d, which had been set up in 1991-1992 with the support of the Russian Federation and was vested with organs of power and its own administration, remained \u201cunder the effective authority, or at the very least under the decisive influence of the Russian Federation, and in any event, it survives by virtue of the military, economic, financial and political support given to it by the Russian Federation\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 392).", "It therefore held that there was a continuous and uninterrupted link of responsibility on the part of the Russian Federation for the applicants\u2019 fate, as the Russian Federation\u2019s policy of support for the regime and collaboration with it continued beyond 5 May 1998, the date of entry into force of the Convention in respect of the Russian Federation, and after that date the Russian Federation had made no attempt to put an end to the applicants\u2019 situation brought about by its agents, and did not act to prevent the violations allegedly committed after 5 May 1998. In the light of these findings, it considered it to be of little consequence that since 5 May 1998 the agents of the Russian Federation have not participated directly in the events complained of in that application (ibid., \u00a7 393).", "The Court held that the applicants came within the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d of the Russian Federation for the purposes of Article 1 of the Convention and its responsibility was engaged with regard to the acts complained of (ibid., \u00a7 394).", "12. Applying these findings (paragraphs 10 and 11 above) to the alleged substantive violations of the Convention, the Court further found, in respect of the applicants Andrei Ivan\u0163oc and Tudor Popa:", "i) that their detention was contrary to Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention, that, since the applicants were still detained, this violation was of a continuous nature (\u00a7 463), and that the conduct constituting a violation of this provision was imputable both to the Russian Federation as from 5 May 1998, and to Moldova as from May 2001 (\u00a7 464);", "ii) that any continuation of the unlawful and arbitrary detention of the applicants would necessarily entail a serious prolongation of the violation of Article 5 and a breach of the respondent States\u2019 obligation under Article 46 \u00a7 1 of the Convention to abide by the Court\u2019s judgment, and indicated that \u201cthe respondent States must take every measure to put an end to the arbitrary detention of the applicants still detained and to secure their immediate release\u201d (\u00a7 490);", "iii) that the persecution, ill-treatment and restrictions to which Mr Ivan\u0163oc was subjected while in detention constituted \u201ctorture\u201d within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention (\u00a7\u00a7 444-447), that the Russian Federation was responsible for the treatment inflicted on Mr Ivan\u0163oc as from 5 May 1998, and that Moldova was responsible for that treatment from May 2001 onwards (\u00a7 449).", "iv) that the harsh conditions of detention experienced by Mr Popa could be qualified as inhuman and degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention (\u00a7 452), that the Russian Federation was responsible for that violation as from 5 May 1998, and that Moldova was responsible for that violation as from May 2001 onwards (\u00a7 454).", "13. As to the application of Article 41, the Court ordered the Russian Federation and Moldova to pay to each applicant the sum of 190,000 euros (EUR) for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages, and awarded the overall sum of EUR 17,036 for costs and expenses.", "14. The applicants refer to a number of facts concerning the respondent States\u2019 responsibility under Article 1 of the Convention after 8 July 2004, the date of the Ila\u015fcu, Ivan\u0163oc, Le\u015fco and Petrov-Popa judgment.", "15. The applicants submitted the following information concerning, on the one hand, the relations between Moldova, the \u201cMRT\u201d and the Russian Federation with regard to the applicants and, on the other hand, the alleged support provided to the \u201cMRT\u201d by the Russian Federation.", "16. On 8 July 2004 the Moldovan Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement in which it expressed its regret that the Russian Federation was delaying the withdrawal of its troops from Moldova, in violation of the decisions taken at the OSCE Summit in Istanbul in November 1999.", "17. On 9 July 2004 the \u201cMinistry of Foreign Affairs of the MRT\u201d issued a statement accusing the European Court of Human Rights of having decided the Ilascu, Ivan\u0163oc, Le\u015fco and Petrov-Popa v. Moldova and Russia case in a superficial and biased manner and confirming that the release of the applicants prior to completion of their term was impossible.", "18. The applicants\u2019 situation was not discussed during the visit to Russia of the Moldovan Minister of Foreign Affairs on 13 and 14 July 2004, although the Moldovan Minister met Mr Lavrov, the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Mr Kozak, Head of the Government administration.", "19. On 1 August 2004 Moldova prohibited the import and export of merchandise to and from the \u201cMRT\u201d.", "20.

The Moldovan Government considered that the Convention responsibility of the Russian Federation continued to be engaged having regard to the latter\u2019s support for the Transdniestrian regime and to the fact that they maintained their troops on the territory of Moldova, in breach of international law, of the OSCE Summit Statements in Istanbul (1999) and in Porto (2002) (see also Ila\u015fcu, Ivan\u0163oc, Le\u015fco and Petrov-Popa cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 124, 354 and 387), and of Law no. 173-VI of 22 July 2005 on essential provisions on the particular legal status of the towns on the left bank of Dniestr, which provided for a complete, urgent and transparent withdrawal by the Russian Federation of its weaponry and military personnel in Transdniestria.", "23.

For instance, in a judgment delivered on 21 October 2004, upheld by the Moldovan Supreme Court, Orhei County Court awarded an individual non-pecuniary damages on account of his unlawful detention in the Transdniestrian region. The damages were paid by the Moldovan Ministry of Finance.", "25. Furthermore, the Moldovan Government referred to developments in the relations between Moldova and the Russian Federation following the Ila\u015fcu, Ivan\u0163oc, Le\u015fco and Petrov-Popa judgment.", "26.

In addition, after 2004 relations between Russia and Transdniestria became even closer at the political, military and economic levels.", "28. The Government also referred in this respect to a study in 2006 by the New York City Bar Association, \u201cThawing a Frozen Conflict: Legal Aspects of the Separatist Crisis in Moldova\u201d which pointed to Russia\u2019s activities in Transdniestria, \u201cincluding the intervention of its 14th Army on behalf of the separatists, the ongoing military assistance to the Moldovan Republic of Transdniestria (\u201cMRT\u201d), the economic support for the MRT, and effectively bargaining on behalf of the MRT using energy and other levers of power against Moldova\u201d, and which concludes that \u201cRussia has illegally propped up the viability of the MRT and made reintegration virtually impossible\u201d.", "29. The presence of Russian troops on the territory of Moldova, in the Transdniestrian part, amounted to a form of political and military support for the Transdniestrian regime.", "Moldovan authorities regularly raised with the Russian Federation the issue of the illegal stationing of Russian military forces on the territory of Moldova. However, the Russian Federation did not make the necessary efforts to ensure a complete withdrawal of their troops. Moreover, Russia refused to sign a statement on stability proposed by Moldova during the OSCE Summit in Sofia in December 2004.", "30. In 2005 the Moldovan Parliament made a public statement calling on the Russian Federation to withdraw its troops and material from Moldovan territory, since the purpose of the cease-fire agreement concluded between Moldova and the Russian Federation had been achieved.", "31. According to the Moldovan Government, the Russian Federation undertook once more within the framework of the OSCE to withdraw its troops from the Transdniestrian part of Moldova by 31 December 2006, but again failed to fulfil its obligations.", "32. The Moldovan Government submitted that the Russian Federation continued to exert economic pressure on Moldova, while reserving preferential treatment for the Transdniestrian region.", "For instance, the Russian authorities increased the price of natural gas exported to Moldova, while fixing a low price for the Transdniestrian part. Starting in 2005 the Russian Federation stopped, under false pretences, the importation of meat, wine, fruit and vegetables from Moldova, in breach of WTO regulations and the free-trade agreement between Moldova and the Russian Federation.", "Likewise, the Russian Federation provided technical and financial assistance to various projects initiated by the Transdniestrian administration, for instance a project on railroads in June 2005.", "33. The Moldovan Government further submitted that the Russian Federation was behind the decision of the Transdniestrian administration to forbid the use of the Latin script in schools in Transdniestria and to prevent farmers from obtaining access to the land they owned situated in the villages behind the cease-fire line.", "34. Insofar as Russian political support for Transdniestria was concerned, the Moldovan Government pointed to, inter alia, the statement by the Russian Duma that the Transdniestrian electoral code was in accordance with Russian legislation and European requirements in that field, the statement made in October 2005 by the Russian Ambassador in Moldova during the celebration of the anniversary of the city of Tiraspol proclaiming that \u201cTiraspol was and continues to be an integral part of Southern Russia and of Russian history\u201d, and the statement on 2 June 2006 by the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs about the right to self-determination of the former Soviet republics.", "35. The Russian Government did not make any comments on the facts.", "36. The applicants refer to a number of facts concerning the conditions in which Mr Ivan\u0163oc and Mr Popa were detained since 8 July 2004, the date of the Ila\u015fcu, Ivan\u0163oc, Le\u015fco and Petrov-Popa judgment, until their release on the expiry of their term of imprisonment in June 2007, and their effects on all applicants\u2019 family life:", "37.

Under point 10 letter (\u0432) of this decree, the term of imprisonment of persons convicted of intentional crimes for a period of more than 6 years was reduced by one third. On 10 October 2005 Mr Gribincea sent a letter to the \u201cMinistry of Justice of MRT\u201d requesting it to explain whether the amnesty decree of 21 July 2005 was applicable to the applicants, and if so, when and in what circumstances the applicants would be released.", "On 10 April 2006 the \u201cMinister of Justice of MRT\u201d informed Mr Gribincea that he could neither answer Mr Gribincea\u2019s questions nor maintain correspondence with him, as Mr Gribincea had no right to represent persons on the territory of the \u201cMRT\u201d.", "38. The applicants\u2019 conditions of detention did not change following the Court\u2019s judgment of 8 July 2004.", "39. Both Andrei Ivan\u0163oc and Tudor Popa were detained in solitary confinement. No explanation was ever provided for their detention regime and conditions.", "40. Mr Popa was detained until his release to Hlinaia Prison and placed in the wing for prisoners sentenced to death.

Inside the cell there was a metal bed and a table.", "Mr Ivan\u0163oc was detained in Tiraspol Prison no. 2, in a cell of some 16 sq. m.", "41. The applicants spent 23 hours a day in their cells, which had no natural light. Access of sunlight was blocked by special blinds, which also prevented them from looking outside.", "42. Both applicants were entitled to a daily one-hour walk in a closed courtyard; no other prisoner could be present at the same time. From the courtyard the applicants could only see the sky and four very high walls. The applicants had no access to the gym or other such facilities.", "They were allowed to have a shower once a week. In summertime there was no warm water. During the winter of 2004-2005 there was no cold water at all in Tiraspol Prison no. 2, so that Andrei Ivan\u0163oc had only hot water for all his needs.", "43. The cells were never heated. Unlike Mr Popa, Mr Ivan\u0163oc was allowed to receive an electric heater from his family. He was also allowed to build a small wall in order to separate the toilet from the rest of his cell.", "44. Mr Ivan\u0163oc has liver problems and Mr Popa suffers from tuberculosis. They received neither appropriate treatment for their illnesses nor appropriate meals as prescribed by doctors. They were also prohibited from receiving medicines from their relatives.", "The applicants were not permitted to receive visits from the prison doctors.

No explanation was provided for this refusal.", "48. Short-term visits were generally granted on the same day the request was made. They took place in a special room. The applicants were separated from visitors by a window and discussion took place over the telephone. Applications for long-term visits had to be filed with the prison administration at least one month before the date requested.", "49. Mr Ivan\u0163oc was authorised to receive parcels every month.

Three members of the Ila\u015fcu group had been held for more than 8 years under conditions of solitary confinement (though one of them - Tudor Petrov-Popa - had recently been offered, but had refused, the presence of other prisoners in his cell). As regards at least one of the prisoners, there were clear indications that the regime to which he was subject was having harmful psychological consequences. Certain other prisoners interviewed by the delegation had also been held under conditions of solitary confinement for prolonged periods.", "The CPT pays particular attention to prisoners held, for whatever reasons, under conditions akin to solitary confinement. The principle of proportionality requires that a balance be struck between the requirements of the case and the application of a solitary-confinement type regime, which is a measure that can have very harmful consequences for the person concerned. Solitary confinement can, in certain circumstances, amount to inhuman and degrading treatment; in any event, all forms of solitary confinement should be as short as possible. To hold persons under conditions of solitary confinement for years on end is scarcely justifiable under any circumstances.", "56. At the end of the visit, the delegation requested that two measures be taken to attenuate the severity of the regime applied to the three members of the Ila\u015fcu group referred to above: i) allow them access to newspapers of their own choice; ii) ensure that their rights to visits from family members and lawyers are fully respected in practice. The CPT wishes to be informed of the action taken upon the delegation\u2019s request.", "Beyond this, the CPT calls upon the authorities to end the solitary confinement regime applied to Ilie Ila\u015fcu, Andrei Ivan\u0163oc and Tudor Petrov-Popa. Whatever justification there might have been in the past for the application of that regime to these prisoners, to persist with such a regime for close to a decade is indefensible.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3", "5", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3", "5", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
