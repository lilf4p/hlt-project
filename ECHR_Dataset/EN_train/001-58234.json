In June 1992 he requested, pursuant to newly adopted legislation, that a flat in which he lived and which was located in a block of flats in Dubnica nad V\u00e1hom, Slovakia should be sold to him.", "10. The applicant alleged that his neighbours and other individuals subsequently disturbed him by their noisy behaviour, mockery and threats. On several occasions the door and windows of his flat and his letter box were damaged. The applicant considers that the purpose of those interferences was to dissuade him from buying the flat.", "11. On several occasions the applicant asked the police department in Dubnica nad V\u00e1hom to investigate the disturbances and to prosecute the persons responsible. He cited, inter alia, family B. The police informed him that the facts he had complained of could not be established and that accordingly the investigation of his complaints had been closed. On 15 April 1994 the police department, acting pursuant to section 63 of the 1990 Minor Offences Act, notified the Dubnica nad V\u00e1hom local office (Obvodn\u00fd \u00farad) about the complaints brought by the applicant (see paragraph 31 below).", "12. On 11 May 1994 the local office found that the applicant had committed a minor offence (priestupok) under section 49(1)(d) of the Minor Offences Act in that without justification he had accused family B. of causing a nuisance. The decision was based on the evidence submitted by the police department in Dubnica nad V\u00e1hom and on the facts which were established in the course of the proceedings before the local office.", "13. The applicant was fined 300 Slovakian korunas (SKK) and ordered to pay SKK 150 in respect of the costs of the proceedings.

On 16 August 1994 the applicant brought a complaint before the Constitutional Court (\u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad). In his submissions to that court he alleged, inter alia, a violation of Article 6 of the Convention in that there had been no fair and public hearing in his case and that the administrative authorities dealing with it had not been impartial.", "16. On 24 November 1994 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint as being manifestly ill-founded. It held, inter alia:", "\u201cA minor offence is characterised, in general, by a wrongful breach of law or legal obligations in different spheres of public administration which represents a minor danger to the society. Because of its character, a minor offence is not subject to examination by a court...

Pursuant to section 83 of the Minor Offences Act, in conjunction with Articles 244 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure, the lawfulness of administrative organs' decisions on minor offences can be reviewed by courts only in cases where a fine exceeding SKK 2,000 has been imposed, the exercise of a certain activity has been prohibited for a period exceeding six months or an object of a value exceeding SKK 2,000 has been confiscated.
