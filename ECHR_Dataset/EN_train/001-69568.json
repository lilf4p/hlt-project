It considered it to be \u201cimpossible that the criminal court later could merely assume a grossly negligent tax evasion (...), as the manipulations of her receipts and expenditure by the applicant, by their very nature, could only have been carried out intentionally.\u201d Consequently, the tax authorities were entitled to estimate her income in the relevant years.", "On 12 February 2000 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court.
