The applicant attended all the hearings as listed.", "14. On 5 October 1998 the Skopje Court of First Instance dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim as the dismissal decision had been adopted by a competent body and the applicant had infringed working discipline.

On 19 April 2000 the applicant instituted separate enforcement proceedings concerning the reinstatement order and the trial costs. On 27 April 2000 the court granted the applicant\u2019s request (\u201cthe enforcement order\u201d). On 22 June 2000 the applicant withdrew his request concerning the reinstatement, as he had meanwhile been reinstated. On 30 June 2000 the court stayed the enforcement proceedings concerning the applicant\u2019s reinstatement and dismissed the employer\u2019s objection concerning the reimbursement of the trial costs. On 12 October 2000 the Court of Appeal upheld the lower court\u2019s decision. On 20 November 2000 the employer requested postponement of the enforcement.

On 27 March 2003 the Supreme Court upheld the employer\u2019s appeal on points of law, overturned the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision and upheld the trial court\u2019s decision of 5 October 1998.
