The third applicant could not read the man's family name on the certificate because it was dark and the latter was covering it with his fingers. Having showed the certificate the man told the third applicant that he was not going to identify himself because \u201cif (the third applicant) fell into the hands of the FSB he would tell them everything\u201d.

During an additional interview as a witness Ch. confirmed his earlier statement in full but submitted that, owing to the time which had elapsed since the abduction of Bashir Mutsolgov, he would not be able to identify the FSB officer who had shown him the special permit.", "60. According to the Government, officers L., B., Ki., T., O. and Ka. of the GAI station, interviewed as witnesses, made statements similar to those given by officer Ch.", "61. According to the Government, L.T., interviewed as a witness on an unspecified date, stated that, as a senior officer of the Kostroma regional department of the FSB, he had been stationed in Ingushetiya from 15 July to 1 November 2003. On 18 December 2003 he had been at his permanent post in the Kostroma Region.", "62. The Government further submitted that unspecified authorities had requested that the Ingushetiya department of the FSB provide information in connection with officer Ch.'s statements. From their reply it followed that officers of that authority had not been at the crime scene at 6 Chkalova Street, Karabulak.", "63. With a view to establishing Bashir Mutsolgov's whereabouts and obtaining information on whether he had been arrested or prosecuted, the investigation sent out requests [\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435] to numerous authorities, including unspecified prosecutors of the Ingushetiya Republic, heads of the FSB departments in the North Caucasus and the UGA military prosecutor's office. According to the replies of those State bodies, he was not under arrest or criminal prosecution and his whereabouts were unknown.", "64. From the replies of the GOVD, and the remand centres in the Argunskiy, Nozhay-Yurtovskiy, Urus-Martanovskiy, Kurchaloyskiy, Itum-Kalinskiy, Sharoyskiy, Leninskiy, Shatoyskiy, Oktyabrskiy, Gudermesskiy and Groznenskiy districts, as well as several remand centres in the North Ossetia-Alania Republic, it followed that Bashir Mutsolgov was not detained in those detention facilities.", "65. The investigation in the case concerning Bashir Mutsolgov's abduction had been repeatedly suspended for failure to identify those responsible and subsequently resumed with a view to verifying new information. It found no evidence that Bashir Mutsolgov had been abducted by State officials or that he was not alive. The investigation in case no. 23520016 was pending.", "66. Despite specific requests by the Court, the Government refused to furnish any copies from the investigation file in case no. 23520016. They claimed that the investigation was in progress and that disclosure of the documents would be in violation of Article 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and would \u201cbreach the rights of the parties to the criminal proceedings\u201d. Neither did the Government indicate the exact dates or provide any further details of the witness' interviews and other investigative measures referred to in their submissions to the Court.", "67. On 14 March 2005 the third applicant complained to the Karabulak Town Court (\u201cthe Town Court\u201d) that the investigation in criminal case no. 23520016 was ineffective. He submitted, among other things, that it had taken the district prosecutor's office an unjustifiably long time to launch the investigation; that the main witness, officer Ch., had only been questioned a month after the opening of the investigation and that the district prosecutor's office had failed to take the most basic investigative steps in due time. In particular, they had failed to interview some witnesses and to compile a photofit image of the abductor who had shown the special passage permit at the GAI station. Despite the information concerning L.T., the investigation had failed to check it with the relevant FSB departments. On a more general level, the third applicant complained that he had had to beg for each and every investigative measure and that the investigating authorities had carried them out only after numerous requests from him, which was demonstrated by his voluminous correspondence with the town prosecutor's office. Lastly, the third applicant stressed that the numerous omissions in the investigation had made it impossible to solve his brother's abduction and to identify and punish the persons responsible for it, and that the culprits had been able to conceal the traces of their crime forever. He also averred that those omissions had been in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.", "68. By a decision of 26 May 2005 the Town Court dismissed the third applicant's complaint as unfounded. The court found that, having received the third applicant's complaint about the abduction of Bashir Mutsolgov on 19 December 2003, the town prosecutor's office, had sent a query to the Ingushetiya department of the FSB on the same day to find out whether they had arrested the applicant's brother. The reply to that query had been received only on 26 December 2003 and on the same day the town prosecutor's office had instituted criminal proceedings into the abduction. The town prosecutor's office could not have instituted the proceedings earlier; it had had first to satisfy itself that Bashir Mutsolgov had not been lawfully arrested.", "69. In respect of the remainder of the third applicant's complaints, the Town Court held as follows:", "\u201c...As to the submission about the belated interviewing of officer Ch., who had seen one of the abductors, the following should be noted.", "It follows from the materials available to the court that ... [on 26 December 2003] the head of the GOVD had been requested to carry out operational and search measures aimed at liberating Bashir Mutsolgov and identifying his abductors. Analogous requests had been sent to [various departments of the Ministry of the Interior] of the Ingushetiya Republic. On the same day the UGA prosecutor and the prosecutors of the NOAR and the Chechen Republic had been requested to verify whether any law-enforcement authorities responsible to them had arrested Bashir Mutsolgov. Those requests had been repeatedly sent to those authorities in January 2004.... Those requests could not have given an immediate result. Before interviewing witnesses it is necessary to identify them. As early as January 2004 the deputy prosecutor of the Ingushetiya Republic had issued a written direction to for witness Ch. to be interviewed. Those directions have been complied with in full and within the time-limits set...", "...", "The complainant also submits that, despite the information implicating L.T. in the crime, the investigation had failed to verify it. However, from the prosecutor's submissions it transpires that the check conducted by the prosecutor's office had established that L.T. had not been involved in the abduction of Bashir Mutsolgov.", "The suspension of the investigation in view of the failure to identify the persons having committed the abduction of Bashir Mutsolgov is in accordance with the requirements of Article 208 of the CCP.\u201d", "70. The third applicant appealed against the decision, submitting that the Town Court's reasoning concerning the promptness of the institution of the investigation was absurd. In particular, applying that reasoning, the investigating authorities would be free not to institute a criminal investigation for months if the authority which they had requested to provide the information failed to reply in due time. He further challenged the court's finding that the investigation had carried out all necessary steps and had taken them in due time. In particular, he stressed that the investigation had not confronted officer Ch. and officer L.T., although the former expressly stated that he had seen L.T. at the scene of an explosion where L.T. was working in a group of FSB officers and had identified himself as an FSB officer. Lastly, the third applicant pointed out that the photofit image of the abductor seen by officer Ch. had been compiled only a year after the opening of the investigation and after the applicant's repeated requests.", "71. On 5 July 2005 the Supreme Court of the Ingushetiya Republic dismissed the third applicant's appeal, having found that the investigating authorities had taken all necessary measures to find the missing man and those involved in the abduction.", "72.
