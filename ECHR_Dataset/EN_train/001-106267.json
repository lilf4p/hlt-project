He was represented before the Court by Dr J. Herrera, a lawyer practising in Valletta.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.", "Following a car accident on 22 October 2007, the applicant was sued by third parties for damages.", "According to section 15 (11) of the Arbitration Act (AA) the action was filed with the Arbitration Centre (AC). As the parties did not agree on the choice of arbitrator, an arbitrator was appointed by the AC\u2019s Chairman according to section 20 (2) of the AA (see relevant domestic law). The applicant acknowledged that the two insurance policies covering the traffic accident had not been issued by an insurance company for which the arbitrator nominated acted as a legal adviser when working in private practice. Thus, there was no direct conflict of interest.", "At the first sitting the applicant submitted that the law making this type of action subject to arbitration, as opposed to the ordinary courts, breached his Convention rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1. At the request of the applicant the proceedings were suspended pending the outcome of constitutional proceedings (see below). After they were resumed in December 2010 the proceedings were again suspended pending the outcome of proceedings before this Court. According to the applicant, had he not requested these suspensions, the State would have argued that he had accepted the jurisdiction of the arbitrator.", "On 25 July 2008 the applicant instituted constitutional redress proceedings alleging a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 on account of the fact that he was forced to submit his case to an arbitrator who did not offer sufficient guarantees of independence and impartiality. He requested the court to stay the proceedings.", "By a judgment of 29 May 2009 the Civil Court (First Hall) in its constitutional jurisdiction upheld the applicant\u2019s claim. It considered that the applicant had a legal interest in filing the claim as it was the law itself and not its application in the applicant\u2019s case that infringed his rights. It held that since arbitration was mandatory in certain cases, the tribunal had to be independent and impartial. Having analysed the AA provisions (see relevant domestic law), it considered that an arbitrator was subject to the AC\u2019s decision. The AC\u2019s Chairman had a discretion to decide whether to appoint a person as arbitrator and whether to appoint that person again in a subsequent case. It followed that the appointment of an arbitrator to one or more cases depended on the subjective appreciation of the AC, who was to an extent subject to the control of the Minister. Thus, the arbitrator did not enjoy security of tenure. He or she would be chosen for specific cases and might never be chosen again if disliked. The court further considered that an appeal on points of law could not remedy this defect, since such right of appeal was limited in scope. In consequence, the Arbitration Tribunal did not fulfil the requirement of independence under Article 6 \u00a7 1, particularly where, as in the instant case, the parties had not agreed on the choice of arbitrator. The court further held that the system also created justified doubts as to the objective impartiality of the Arbitration Tribunal, having regard to its composition, organisation and the appointment and removal of arbitrators.", "On 15 June 2009 the defendants appealed.", "By a judgment of 6 September 2010 the Constitutional Court upheld the appeal and reversed the first-instance judgment. Reiterating that the AC must comply with the requirements of impartiality and independence, it held that the criteria for choosing an arbitrator according to section 10 (3) of the AA (see relevant domestic law) were intended to ensure that persons appointed as arbitrators were competent and displayed integrity. In the absence of agreement between the parties, the selection of an independent arbitrator was left to the chairman. While it was true that the chairman was appointed by the Minister and was therefore to a certain extent subject to the Minister\u2019s control, this could not be relevant since in most cases the Government were not a party to the arbitration proceedings. It followed that section 4 (4) of the AA (see relevant domestic law) offered sufficient guarantees. Moreover, the removal of an arbitrator was, like any other decision of the AC, an administrative decision subject to judicial review. However, the removal of an arbitrator from a particular case was usually intended to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the procedure and could not raise issues as to security of tenure. Lastly, in the applicant\u2019s case there was no actual or realistic threat to the independence of the tribunal. For the reasons stated above, the court also considered that there was no issue of partiality, particularly because the arbitrator was independent of the parties in a case and the law offered sufficient guarantees in this respect. A chairman making an appointment would have to take account of all the relevant considerations beforehand. Indeed, in the present case, it did not appear that the applicant was complaining about the specific choice of arbitrator in his case. Since such proceedings were Article 6 compliant it was not necessary to consider whether an appeal could have remedied the defect alleged.", "In so far as relevant, the pertinent provisions of the Arbitration Act, Chapter 387 of the Laws of Malta, read as follows:", "Section 4", "\u201c(1) There shall be a Board which shall be responsible for the policy and general administration of the affairs and business of the Centre.", "(2) The Board shall consist of not less than three and not more than five members, appointed by the President of Malta acting on the advice of the Minister, one of whom shall be designated by the Minister as chairman.

The notification shall be in writing and shall state the reasons for the challenge.", "(3) When an arbitrator has been challenged by one party the other party may agree to the challenge. The arbitrator may also, after the challenge, withdraw from his office. In neither case does this imply acceptance of the validity of the grounds for the challenge. In both cases the procedure provided in articles 20 and 21 shall be used in full for the appointment of the substitute arbitrator even if during the process of appointing the challenged arbitrator a party had failed to exercise his right to appoint or to participate in the appointment.\u201d", "Section 26", "\u201c(1) If the other party does not agree to the challenge and the challenged arbitrator does not withdraw, the decision on the challenge will be made by the chairman, and his decision shall be final and binding.", "(2) When the chairman sustains the challenge, he shall appoint a substitute arbitrator.\u201d", "By virtue of section 15 (11) of the Act disputes arising from collisions between vehicles are subject to mandatory arbitration and in such cases the parties shall be deemed to be bound by an arbitration agreement in relation to such disputes.", "In so far as relevant the Arbitration Rules, Subsidiary Legislation 387.01, Legal Notice 421 of 2004 as amended in 2005 and 2007, read as follows:", "Section 6", "\u201cThe appointment of an arbitrator shall be accompanied by a confirmation by such arbitrator accepting his appointment together with a declaration by him confirming his independence and impartiality in terms of section 23 of the Act.\u201d", "Section 72", "\u201c(1) In case of breach of duty by an arbitrator in relation to the management of the arbitration proceedings, the Registrar [of the Centre] may issue orders in writing to the arbitrator who shall be bound to comply as soon as possible with such order.", "(2) The Board may request the Registrar to issue any such orders to any arbitrator if, when reviewing progress in any arbitration, the Board notes that any provisions of the Act, these rules or any guidelines are not being observed or that the arbitrator is failing to manage the arbitration process efficiently.", "(3) When an arbitrator fails to observe the orders of the Registrar issued in terms of this rule, the Registrar shall report on such circumstances to the Board and the Board shall determine what disciplinary action to take against the arbitrator.", "(4) In case of breach of the duty of independence by the arbitrator because of an undisclosed conflict of interest or because of irregular communication or otherwise, with one of the parties or any person on behalf of a party, the Registrar shall make a written report to the Board copied to the arbitrator and to the parties and the Board shall decide what actions are to be taken.", "(5) In cases referred to above, the Board shall determine the issue after giving the arbitrator the opportunity of being heard and after considering such other evidence as may be appropriate.", "(6) In such cases the Board has the power to take such disciplinary action as it considers appropriate in view of the circumstances.
