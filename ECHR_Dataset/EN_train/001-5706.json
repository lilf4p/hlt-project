Vr\u0161ansk\u00fd, their Agent.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "On 14 September 1993, while he was serving a prison term in the Ko\u0161ice-\u0160aca prison, the applicant sent an envelope by registered mail. The address on the envelope read as follows:", "", "\u201cHead of the Post Office", "POST OFFICE", "Ko\u0161ice", "040 20\u201c.", "The envelope had registration number R 925. It contained another envelope. The latter was addressed to the applicant\u2019s parents and contained a letter which the applicant wanted to be sent to Amnesty International.", "The main envelope also contained an accompanying letter for the head of the Ko\u0161ice 20 post office.

An employee in charge of correspondence addressed to the Slovak Post opened the main envelope. After having read the applicant\u2019s request addressed to the head of the Ko\u0161ice 20 post office, she re-directed the applicant\u2019s mail, in the original envelope, to the head of the Ko\u0161ice 12 post office which is in charge of delivering mail in the quarter where the applicant\u2019s parents live. The Ko\u0161ice 20 post office is situated in the same quarter, but it is not charged with delivering mail to addressees.", "The applicant\u2019s registered letter R 925 arrived at the Ko\u0161ice 12 post office on 16 September 1993. Its head could not comply with the applicant\u2019s request that the enclosed envelope be delivered to his parents at their expenses as postal regulations require that the postage be paid in advance.", "On 27 January 1994 the applicant was released from prison. He complained to the post that his registered mail had not been delivered.", "Following the applicant\u2019s complaint the head of the Ko\u0161ice 12 post office sent the envelope addressed to the applicant\u2019s parents back at the applicant\u2019s address in the Ko\u0161ice-\u0160aca prison by ordinary mail in accordance with the relevant regulation.

The applicant was further informed that the head of the post office had not been entitled to deliver the enclosed envelope to the applicant\u2019s parents at their expenses as requested by the applicant since Slovak Post did not provide such a service.", "The letter by the head of the Supervision Department also stated that the head of the Ko\u0161ice 12 post office had sent the envelope in question back at the applicant\u2019s address in the Ko\u0161ice-\u0160aca prison by non-registered mail. Since Slovak Post kept no records of the distribution of such mail, it was impossible to establish where the letter had been lost.", "On 11 April 1995 the applicant complained about the interference with his correspondence to the Constitutional Court (\u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad).

The letter further stated that the Constitutional Court lacked jurisdiction to appoint a lawyer ex officio.", "On 19 September 1995 the applicant requested the Slovak Bar Association that a lawyer be appointed to represent him before the Constituional Court. He explained that several lawyers had refused to represent him and that he was indigent.", "On 29 November 1995 the applicant informed the Constitutional Court that he was detained and that the Slovak Bar Association had not yet appointed a lawyer to him.", "On 16 January 1996 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicant\u2019s petition. It held that the applicant\u2019s submissions were not sufficient for proceedings before the Constitutional Court to be started. The decision stated that the applicant had not been deprived of his liberty throughout the time during which his petition had been prepared for a preliminary examination. In the Constitutional Court\u2019s view, the applicant had had enough time to specify, possibly with the assistance of a lawyer, the evidence which he proposed to take and the decision which he sought to obtain.", "At the relevant time the indication of addresses on mail was governed by Section 11 of the Postal Regulation of 1989 (Vyhl\u00e1\u0161ka o pr\u00e1vach a povinnostiach po\u0161ty a jej pou\u017e\u00edvate\u013eov).
