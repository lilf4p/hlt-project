On 24 April 2000, the deputy prosecutor of the Kyiv District of Kharkiv issued a decree refusing to institute criminal proceedings on the ground that there was no evidence that an offence had been committed. In his decree, the deputy prosecutor stated that criminal proceedings had been initiated against the applicant on 10 February 2000. The applicant confessed voluntarily to having committed the crimes of which he was charged when he learned that his accomplices had also confessed. Furthermore, police officers had been questioned about the applicant\u2019s allegations and had refuted the accusations against them. The deputy prosecutor concluded:", "\u201c(...) despite the fact that the forensic medical expert opinion No. 747/c of 5 April 2000 [established that the applicant suffered] minor bodily injuries giving rise to a short-term disability, no evidence has been obtained that those injuries were inflicted by officers of the Kyivsky District Police Station of Kharkiv. The [applicant\u2019s] arguments set out in his request must be considered to have been invented by him. He was fully aware that the investigation gave rise to sufficient proof that he had committed the crimes of which he was accused. He is now trying to avoid the punishment he deserves\u201d.", "19. On 3 June 2000 the applicant appealed against this decision to the Kyivsky District Court and to the City Prosecutor\u2019s Office.

The court stated that the prosecutor had failed to investigate the cause of the applicant\u2019s injuries and that the prosecutor\u2019s refusal to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers in question had been unreasonable.", "23. The criminal case was sent to the Kyivsky District Prosecutor\u2019s Office. On 10 November 2000 this Office requested the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office to lodge a supervisory review appeal with the Presidium of the Kharkiv Regional Court against the Kyivsky District Court\u2019s decision of 19 October 2000. The applicant was informed of this on 26 January 2001.", "24.

The prosecutor stated, inter alia, that the police officers who had been questioned had denied the accusations against them and had explained the applicant\u2019s allegations with reference to the criminal proceedings brought against him. The prosecutor further stated that the testimonies of T. and O., confirming the applicant\u2019s allegations, had to be disregarded since they were the applicant\u2019s co-accused. The prosecutor also maintained that the medical examination had concluded that the applicant\u2019s injuries could have been caused before he was detained at the police station.", "35. On 16 April and 31 May 2002 the applicant and his lawyer requested the district prosecutor to provide them with the case file. By letter of 10 June 2002, the prosecutor replied that the materials in the case file had been sent to the Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office for examination.", "36.
