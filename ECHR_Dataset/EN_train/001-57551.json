{"ITEMID": "001-57551", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 1987, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF O. v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;No violation of Art. 8;Not necessary to examine Art. 13;Just satisfaction reserved", "JUDGES": "C. Russo;N. Valticos", "TEXT": ["8. At the time of his application to the Commission, the applicant, an Irish national born in 1943, lived in England. He was married in 1967 but was divorced from his wife on 20 October 1981. During their marriage they had seven children, A, B, C, D, E, F and G, born in 1968, 1970, 1971, 1973, 1975, 1977 and 1978 respectively.", "9. In 1973, because of accommodation problems, the couple on three occasions put their then children into the voluntary care (see paragraphs 29-31 below) of the local authority (\"the Authority\"). On 11 January 1974, the local juvenile court made care orders (see paragraphs 21-23 and 25 below) in respect of A, B, C and D. As the applicant had obtained more satisfactory accommodation, these orders were discharged at his request by the juvenile court in June 1975 and replaced by supervision orders (see paragraphs 24 and 27 below).", "10. Following concern as to the children\u2019s welfare, brought to a head when the applicant assaulted A, the Authority obtained from the juvenile court on 2 July 1976 care orders in respect of A, B, C, D and E; the latter are hereinafter referred to as \"the children\", F and G not being the subject of the present proceedings. On 9 September 1976, the Crown Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal against this decision; he did not lodge a further appeal (see paragraph 28 below).", "11. The children lived at first in a children\u2019s home. In December 1976, A and B were placed with foster parents near the town where the applicant lived, and C with other foster parents in the same town. In February 1978, D and E, who had remained in the meantime at the children\u2019s home, were placed with foster parents at an address which was not given to the applicant by the Authority. It so decided following a case review held on 17 October 1977 and attended by social workers responsible for the children; the applicant was not informed of the review and was not invited to attend it.", "12. Until June or July 1978, the applicant and his wife continued to visit the children - or those whose whereabouts they knew - at least once a week, although the foster parents complained that the visits upset the children. The social worker responsible then proposed that future visits take place at the social services building in the town where the applicant lived. The parents saw there all five children, for about an hour, on 4 July 1978 and A, B and C, for about 45 minutes, on 24 April 1979.", "13. An application by the parents, who had taken legal advice with a view to establishing their right to access to the children, to revoke the care orders was rejected on 13 June 1979 by the juvenile court; the proceedings could not lead to a review of the isolated question of access, since the juvenile court, pursuant to the statutory provisions, had to determine whether or not it was appropriate to discharge the care orders as a whole (see paragraphs 27 and 42 below). No appeal was lodged against this decision (see paragraph 28 below).", "14. On 14 June 1979, the applicant\u2019s solicitors wrote to the Authority\u2019s Social Services Department seeking regular access for the parents to the children. In an interim reply of 20 June, the Department indicated that it would be holding a case conference in the near future, but that its policy concerning the children was unlikely to change significantly. A fuller reply, dated 10 July, was in the following terms:", "\"Further to my letter of the 20th June, a case conference has now been held to determine our future policy in respect of the five ... children in the care of this Authority.", "As you will no doubt appreciate, our paramount consideration must be the best interests of the children. In coming to a decision the case conference was very aware of Section 59 of the Children Act 1975 which [provides]: \u2018In reaching any decision relating to a child in their care, a Local Authority should give first consideration to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of the child throughout his childhood, and shall so far as practicable ascertain the wishes and feelings of the child regarding the decision and give due consideration to them, having regard to his age and understanding.\u2019 As a result of the unsuccessful application by the [applicant and his wife] to have the Care Orders on their children in the care of the [Authority] discharged, the real desire of all these children to remain with their foster parents was emphasised. The case conference therefore decided that the best interests of the children would be served by them remaining on a long term basis with their present foster parents.", "The visits which the [applicant and his wife] have made to their children in the past have proved quite unsettling for the children and their foster parents. In view of the fact that we see these children remaining in long term care emphasis should be placed on helping the children feel secure and happy in their foster homes. I therefore have to inform you that in the interests of the children there should be no contact with their natural parents.", "I do appreciate that this decision will be a matter of deep disappointment to the [applicant and his wife]. My social worker ... will be in touch with them in the near future and will be pleased to discuss with [them] in more detail the reasons behind this decision.\"", "The applicant asserts that he was not invited to attend the case conference referred to in this letter or consulted beforehand about the decision to terminate access.", "15. On 25 February 1980, the parents, in an attempt to raise the question of their access to the children, issued an originating summons as a result of which the latter became wards of court (see paragraphs 36-38 and 43 below). On 2 April, the Authority applied to the High Court for the wardship to be lifted (see paragraph 38 below); the parents contended in reply that while the Authority should continue to have care of the children, they should have access to them.", "16. At a hearing held on 6 October 1980, the High Court examined the questions whether it had jurisdiction to consider the parents\u2019 application for access in the context of wardship proceedings and whether the wardship should continue. The judge stated:", "\"... this Court does not sit as a Court of Appeal in relation to decisions of the Local Authority, and can only interfere with a decision of the Local Authority on the basis of the principles governing the interference with statutory discretions given to statutory bodies; that is, this Court can only interfere if it is satisfied that the Local Authority has taken into account matters which it should not have taken into account, or has not taken into account matters which it should have taken into account, or it can interfere if it comes to the conclusion that the Local Authority has come to a decision which no reasonable Local Authority could have come to. It can also interfere, of course, if it were satisfied that the Local Authority had been acting in bad faith.\"", "Given this limited jurisdiction, he held that the Authority\u2019s decision to refuse further access was not impeachable on any of the above grounds and therefore must stand. He accordingly terminated the wardship order.", "The applicant was advised that although an appeal from this decision would have been possible, it would have had no prospects of success in the light of the relevant case-law (see paragraphs 42-43 below).", "17. On 25 August 1981, an adoption order was made in respect of D and E, the judge having dispensed with the consent of the applicant and his wife (see paragraph 46 below). The 1976 care orders in respect of these two children thereupon terminated.", "The applicant left the United Kingdom in late 1984. It appears that he was not then regularly visiting A and C (the Authority\u2019s embargo on access never having been lifted) and that they did not wish him to do so. It also appears that he was not then regularly visiting B, although he had re-established contact with him at the latter\u2019s request. B and C are still subject to the 1976 care orders; that in respect of A terminated in 1986, on her attaining the age of 18.", "18. In the law of England and Wales, there are a number of different and partially co-ordinated procedures for dealing with the welfare of children. Whilst the oldest of these is the wardship jurisdiction of the High Court, it has for many years co-existed with, but not been ousted by, various statutory provisions whereby a child who is at risk may be put into the care of a local authority.", "Although the terms are not wholly accurate, the legislation is commonly divided into two categories: the first provides for \"compulsory care\", by establishing machinery whereby a local authority can obtain a court order committing a child to its care; the second concerns \"voluntary care\", the machinery here being originally designed to meet an emergency situation without the need of recourse to the courts. At any given time, there are approximately 86,000 children in public care in England and Wales, of whom 70,000 are not living with their parents or a relative.", "The statutory provisions have been amended on several occasions and many of them were repealed and replaced by the Child Care Act 1980 (\"the 1980 Act\"), a consolidating measure the greater part of which came into force on 1 April 1981. In the following summary of the law in force at the time of the present case, the original enactments are cited first and any corresponding provision of the 1980 Act in force at the relevant time is indicated in square brackets.", "By way of general background information, the summary covers all three of the procedures referred to above (namely those relating to compulsory care, voluntary care and wardship), but in the present case it was the machinery for compulsory care and the wardship jurisdiction of the High Court which were directly relevant.", "19. The principal statute concerning compulsory care is the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 (\"the 1969 Act\"), as amended by the Children Act 1975 and then partly replaced by the 1980 Act; it enables a local authority to obtain, as a temporary measure, a \"place of safety order\" and, as longer-term measures, a variety of other orders.", "20. Under section 28(1) of the 1969 Act, any person, including a local authority, may apply to a justice of the peace for authority to detain a child and take him to a place of safety; the justice may grant the application if he is satisfied that the applicant has reasonable cause to believe, inter alia, that the child\u2019s proper development is being avoidably prevented or neglected or his health is being avoidably impaired or neglected or he is being ill-treated, or that he is exposed to moral danger.", "A \"place of safety order\" so granted lasts for a maximum of 28 days and cannot be extended. The person detaining the child must as soon as possible take such steps as are practicable for informing his parent of the detention and the reason for it.", "If the local authority wishes to retain the child in protective surroundings after the 28-day period, it has either to make the child a ward of court (see paragraphs 36-38 below), or to institute care proceedings under section 1 of the 1969 Act (see paragraphs 21-23 below), or to apply to a justice or a magistrates\u2019 court for an interim order under section 28(6) (see paragraph 26 below); if an application of the last kind is refused, the child\u2019s immediate release \"may be ordered\".", "21. Under sections 1 and 2(2) of the 1969 Act, a local authority which reasonably believes that there are grounds for making an order as to the care and control or supervision of a child is, subject to certain exceptions, under a duty to institute care proceedings by bringing the child before a juvenile court.", "22. In care proceedings instituted by a local authority, the parties are the local authority and the child, but not the latter\u2019s parents. The child is entitled, subject to his means, to legal aid and it is open to him to have his parents conduct the case on his behalf either directly or through a lawyer. If the child is of sufficient competence, he may decide that he wishes to be separately represented.", "A natural parent who is not acting on behalf of the child is entitled to be notified of and to attend the hearing and to give and call evidence challenging the allegations made by the local authority. As a matter of practice, the court will also allow such parent to cross-examine witnesses on behalf of the local authority and to have separate legal representation.", "23. If the court before which the child is brought is satisfied that one of the grounds specified in section 1 of the 1969 Act exists and that the child is in need of care or control which he is unlikely to receive unless an order is made, it may make, inter alia, a supervision order, a care order or an interim order. The specified grounds include those on which a place of safety order may be made (see paragraph 20 above).", "24. A supervision order is an order placing the child under the structured supervision of the local authority; subject thereto, he may continue to live with his parents.", "25. A care order is an order committing the child to the care of the local authority. The latter will have the same powers and duties with respect to the child as his parent or guardian would have apart from the care order (section 24 of the 1969 Act [10(2) of the 1980 Act]), except that it cannot cause the child to be brought up in any religious creed other than that in which he would otherwise have been brought up and it cannot agree to the child\u2019s adoption.", "26. An interim order is a care order limited to a specified period not exceeding 28 days; it may be renewed on application (section 22 of the 1969 Act). It may be made if the juvenile court hearing the care proceedings is not in a position to decide which of the other specified orders ought to be made (section 2(10)) or, alternatively, during the currency of a place of safety order (see paragraph 20 above). The powers and duties of the local authority under an interim order are the same as under a full care order (see paragraph 25 above).", "27. A full care order normally terminates when the child in question attains the age of 18 (section 20(3)(b) of the 1969 Act).", "In addition, under sections 21(2) and 70(2), the juvenile court may, on application by the child or his parent on the child\u2019s (but not his own) behalf and if it considers it appropriate, discharge the care order and may, on discharging it, make a supervision order in respect of the child. Such applications may be made every three months or, with the juvenile court\u2019s permission, more frequently (section 21(3)). The paramount consideration in deciding whether to discharge the order is the interests of the child.", "28. Under sections 2(12) and 21(4) of the 1969 Act, the child in respect of whom the care order was made, or his parent on the child\u2019s (but not his own) behalf, may appeal to the Crown Court against the making of a care order, against the refusal of an application to discharge a care order or against the making of a supervision order on its discharge. The Crown Court will review the decision by way of re-hearing the case. From the Crown Court a further appeal may, with leave, be made to the High Court by way of case stated; thereafter an appeal lies to the Court of Appeal and, in rare cases, to the House of Lords.", "The local authority has no general right to appeal against a juvenile court\u2019s refusal to make a care order, except on a point of law to the High Court.", "29. The principal statute concerning voluntary care is the Children Act 1948 (\"the 1948 Act\"), as amended by the Children Act 1975 and then replaced by the 1980 Act. This legislation in effect enables a parent to place his child into the care of a local authority; at the initial stage the authority acquires no special status in relation to the child but a different situation may arise subsequently.", "30. Section 1 of the 1948 Act [2 of the 1980 Act] imposes on the local authority a duty to receive into its care a child under 17 where it appears, inter alia, that his parents or guardian are for the time being or permanently prevented by illness, incapacity or other circumstances from providing for his proper accommodation, maintenance and upbringing and that the intervention of the authority is necessary in the interests of the child\u2019s welfare. Whilst the authority must, save as otherwise provided in the Act, keep the child in its care so long as his welfare requires it and he has not attained the age of 18, it is also under a duty to endeavour to secure the resumption of parental care where this appears consistent with the child\u2019s welfare.", "31. Section 1 of the 1948 Act [2 of the 1980 Act] specifies that it does not entitle the local authority to keep the child in care if any parent or guardian desires to take over that care. However, if the child has been in care throughout the preceding six months, no person may take him away unless he has given at least 28 days\u2019 notice of his intention to do so or has the authority\u2019s consent (section 1(3A) [13(2)]).", "Moreover, if a parent requests the return of the child, the authority is not compelled to comply regardless of his welfare (Lewisham London Borough Council v. Lewisham Juvenile Court Justices [1979] 2 All England Law Reports 297). If it then considers the transfer of care to the parent to be inconsistent with that welfare, it may either pass a parental rights resolution (see paragraph 32 below) or apply to make the child a ward of court (see paragraphs 36-38 below).", "32. If it appears to a local authority in relation to any child who is in its care under section 1 of the 1948 Act [2 of the 1980 Act] that, inter alia, a parent of his is unfit to have the care of the child on account, notably, of his habits or mode of life or of having consistently failed without reasonable cause to discharge the obligations of a parent, the local authority may resolve that there vest in it the parental rights and duties with respect to that child (section 2(1) [3(1)]). The rights and duties which so vest are all rights and duties which by law the mother and father have in relation to a legitimate child and his property, including \"a right of access\" but excluding the right to agree or refuse to agree to the making of an adoption or certain related orders (section 2(11) of the 1948 Act [3(10) of the 1980 Act] and section 85(1) of the Children Act 1975).", "Before passing a parental rights resolution, the local authority must consider a report from its Social Services Department on the desirability of assuming parental rights, which report should contain all the material necessary for the proper exercise of the authority\u2019s discretion. In deciding the matter, the authority is to regard the interests of the child as of paramount importance and the views of the parents on the proposal are to be taken into account.", "33. If the parent has not already consented in writing to the parental rights resolution and his whereabouts are known, he must be served with notice of it, indicating his right to object by counter-notice within one month (section 2(2) and (3) of the 1948 Act) [3(2) and (3) of the 1980 Act]). If such objection is made, the resolution lapses on the expiry of 14 days from service of the counter-notice (section 2(4) [3(4)]). However, within that period, the local authority may \"complain\" to a juvenile court, in which event the resolution will not lapse until the complaint is determined; on hearing the complaint, the court may order that the resolution is not to lapse, provided that it is satisfied that the grounds for the resolution were made out when it was passed and subsist at the time of the hearing and that the continuation of the resolution is in the child\u2019s interest (section 2(5) [3(5) and (6)]).", "34. A parental rights resolution continues in force until the child attains the age of 18, unless it is previously rescinded by the local authority or terminated by a juvenile court (section 4 of the 1948 Act [5 of the 1980 Act]).", "The parent concerned, even if he did not originally object to the parental rights resolution, may apply to a juvenile court for its discharge. The court may grant the application if it is satisfied that there were no grounds for the making of the resolution or that it should be terminated in the child\u2019s interests (section 4(3)(b) [5(4)(b)]). An application based on the original foundation for the resolution can, however, be entertained only if lodged within six months of its adoption (section 127 of the Magistrates\u2019 Court Act 1980).", "35. Under section 4A of the 1948 Act [6 of the 1980 Act], an appeal (by the parent or the local authority) lies to the Family Division of the High Court from the making by a juvenile court of an order confirming (under section 2(5) [3(6)]) or discharging (under section 4(3)(b) [5(4)(b)]) a parental rights resolution, or from a juvenile court\u2019s refusal to make such an order. A further appeal lies to the Court of Appeal and, with leave, to the House of Lords.", "36. The Family Division of the High Court has an inherent jurisdiction, independent of statutory provisions and deriving from the prerogative power of the Crown acting in its capacity as parens patriae, to make a child a ward of court.", "37. The effect of wardship is that custody, in a broad sense, of the child is vested in the court itself; it assumes responsibility for all aspects of his welfare and may make orders on any relevant matter whatsoever, notably as regards the care and control of and access to the child and his education, religion or property. In making such orders, the court is required to treat the child\u2019s welfare as the \"first and paramount consideration\" (Guardianship of Minors Act 1971, section 1). Unless terminated earlier by order of the court, the wardship continues until the child attains his majority.", "Where there are exceptional circumstances making it impracticable or undesirable for the ward to be, or continue to be, under the care of his parents, the court may make an order committing him to the care of the local authority (Family Law Reform Act 1969, section 7(2)), subject to the power of the court to give directions (Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, section 43(5)(a)). In such circumstances, custody of the child remains with the court and it is for the court, and not the local authority, to take major decisions regarding the ward\u2019s future; it retains, inter alia, jurisdiction to make orders for access to the child.", "38. Wardship proceedings may be instituted by anyone who can show an appropriate interest in the child\u2019s welfare. An application for a wardship order has to be made by originating summons. The child becomes a ward immediately the summons is issued but the wardship automatically lapses after 21 days unless within that time an appointment is made for the hearing of the summons. This appointment is normally held before a registrar who, subject to an appeal to a judge, may give interim directions on such matters as access to the child and may decide that other interested parties be joined in the proceedings.", "A judge will hear contested wardship proceedings and also applications - which can be made at any time by any party - for the variation or discharge of an existing wardship order or for directions on such matters as access to or the education of the child. From the judge\u2019s order, an appeal lies to the Court of Appeal and thence, with leave, to the House of Lords.", "The child may be represented in wardship proceedings by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court; this is usually the Official Solicitor, who is a full-time public employee entirely independent of the executive.", "Under the Rules of the Supreme Court, it is possible to seek an order expediting the proceedings, notably if a party thereto is dilatory.", "39. The functions of a local authority in child-care matters are exercised and decisions are taken either by its Social Services Committee or by a sub-committee or an officer to whom powers have been delegated. At the time relevant to the present case, the practice varied from authority to authority, there being no precise requirements or guidance even of a non-statutory kind, and much depended on the nature or gravity of the decision to be taken. Whether the child is in its care by virtue of the 1948 [1980] or the 1969 Act, the local authority must give first consideration to the need to safeguard and promote the child\u2019s welfare throughout his childhood, and must so far as practicable ascertain his wishes and feelings regarding the decision and give due consideration to them, having regard to his age and understanding (section 59 of the Children Act 1975 [18(1) of the 1980 Act]).", "Authorities\u2019 decisions in this area are, in fact, often based on the outcome of case reviews or case conferences. The authority is under a statutory duty to review the case of each child in its care at six-monthly intervals (section 27(4) of the 1969 Act) and, as a matter of practice, the child\u2019s position will in addition be regularly examined at case conferences. Reviews and conferences will be attended notably by the social workers responsible and senior officials of the authority\u2019s Social Services Department, as well as by such other persons as health visitors, doctors and police officers.", "40. A parent may on occasion be allowed or invited to attend a case review or case conference or part thereof, although he has no legal right to do so. His contacts with the social workers constitute the most usual channel for the communication of his views on matters to be decided by the authority.", "In the absence of legal proceedings, the parent cannot compel the local authority to produce or permit inspection of the minutes of its relevant meetings or reports produced thereat, although the authority has a discretion to allow such inspection. In proceedings for judicial review (but not in juvenile court proceedings), the court may order the pre-trial disclosure of such documents, but only after leave to institute the proceedings has been obtained (see paragraph 42 below); however, this would be a rare occurrence, the general rule being that the documents are privileged and not open to inspection.", "41. A parent whose child is in the care of a local authority is not automatically deprived of access to him. The continuation of access is, however, a matter within the discretionary power of the authority (per Lord Wilberforce in A v. Liverpool City Council [1981] 2 All England Law Reports 385). Thus, under English law, the question whether and to what extent a parent is to have access to his child who is in public care was, at the relevant time, within the competence of the local authority to decide, without any application to a court.", "Both the 1948 [1980] Act and the 1969 Act reflect the general idea that continuation of parental access to children in public care is in many cases normal and desirable: the former allows the local authority to contribute to the costs of parental visits and the latter makes special provision for certain cases where the parents have not visited the child during a certain period of time.", "42. The statutory remedies described in paragraphs 27-28 and 33-35 above, whereby a parent may challenge or seek the discharge of a care order or a parental rights resolution, are directed to the order or resolution as such, there being, at the relevant time, no specific statutory remedy whereby he could contest the isolated issue of a decision to restrict or terminate his access to his child.", "A decision of a local authority concerning access can, however, be challenged by way of an application for judicial review. Anyone who wishes to make such an application must first seek, normally within three months of the decision, the leave of the court. The circumstances where judicial review will lie may be briefly summarised as follows:", "(a) the authority acted illegally, ultra vires or in bad faith;", "(b) the authority failed to take into account relevant considerations, took account of irrelevant considerations or came to a decision to which no reasonable authority could have come (Associated Provincial Picture Houses, Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 King\u2019s Bench Reports 223);", "(c) the authority failed to observe statutory procedural rules or to act fairly (see notably R v. The Bedfordshire County Council, ex parte C and R v. The Hertfordshire County Council, ex parte B, Times Law Reports, 19 August 1986).", "The remedy of judicial review is concerned with reviewing not the merits of the decision in question but rather the decision-making process itself, and the court will not act as a \"court of appeal\" from the body involved. Thus, where on a successful application for judicial review the court quashes an authority\u2019s decision, it will normally remit the matter to the authority for reconsideration; it may, however, also direct the authority to reach a conclusion in accordance with the court\u2019s findings (Rules of the Supreme Court, Order 53, rule 9(4)).", "43. In certain circumstances, the wardship jurisdiction may also be invoked to question the decisions of a local authority or a juvenile court relating to a child in the former\u2019s care. The general rule is that the prerogative power of the Crown is not for all purposes ousted or abrogated by the exercise of the duties and powers conferred on local authorities by legislation. In the leading case of A v. Liverpool City Council, the House of Lords examined the relationship between the wardship jurisdiction and the authorities\u2019 statutory powers. Their Lordships were unanimously of the view that the courts had no reviewing powers as to the merits of local authority decisions, notably on such matters as access to the child: the general inherent power of the court in its wardship jurisdiction was available to fill gaps or supplement the powers of local authorities but not to supervise (except on judicial review principles; see paragraph 42 above) the exercise of discretion within the field committed to them by statute. Sometimes, however, the local authority itself may invite the supplementary assistance of the court and the wardship may then be continued with a view to action by the court.", "The foregoing limits on the High Court\u2019s powers apply only where the wardship proceedings concern a child who is already in public care. If he is not, the High Court can examine fully such questions as access and make such order as it considers to be in his best interests.", "44. The inability of parents to approach the courts, save as explained above, where decisions are made by a local authority affecting access to their children led Parliament, in the Health and Social Services and Social Security Adjudications Act 1983, to modify the law on this point.", "Under the new provisions - which came into force on 30 January 1984, that is after the events giving rise to the present case -, a local authority may not refuse to make arrangements for access to a child in care and may not terminate such arrangements unless it has first given notice to the parent. The latter then has a right to apply to a juvenile court for an access order, requiring the local authority to allow access subject to such conditions as the court may specify. Where an access order has been made, there is a right to apply for variation. An appeal against the juvenile court\u2019s decision lies to the High Court. Any court dealing with the matter must regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.", "This new remedy applies only to decisions refusing or terminating access; in all other cases, the nature and extent of access remain within the local authority\u2019s discretion.", "45. In December 1983, the Government published a Code of Practice on Access to Children in Care. This document stresses the importance of involving the child\u2019s natural parents in the local authority\u2019s decision-making process in this area and of informing them fully and promptly as to the substance of decisions concerning access.", "46. A court cannot make an adoption order in respect of a child unless, inter alia, it is satisfied that each parent freely and unconditionally agrees (Children Act 1975, section 12). However, such agreement may be dispensed with upon a number of grounds specified in that section, notably that the parent is withholding consent unreasonably or has persistently failed without reasonable cause to discharge his parental duties. In reaching any decision relating to the adoption of a child, a court must have regard to all the circumstances, first consideration being given to the need to safeguard and promote his welfare throughout his childhood (Children Act 1975, section 3).", "47. Adoption proceedings in respect of a child who is a ward of court may not be instituted without the leave of the High Court. On an application for leave, the court\u2019s function is to consider whether the proposed adoption application is one that might reasonably succeed, the merits of the matter being examined subsequently, once leave has been granted and after compliance with the requirements concerning notices and reports."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
