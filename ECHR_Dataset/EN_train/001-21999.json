FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a Finnish national, born in 1950 and living in Helsinki. He is a maritime broker.", "He is represented before the Court by Mr Matti Wuori, a lawyer practising in Helsinki.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "A.", "In October 1987, the applicant started a relationship with T. They began living together in mid-November and became engaged to be married on 1 January 1988. In May 1988 it was confirmed that T was pregnant. According to the applicant, he and T had deliberately decided to found a family. In mid-June their engagement and cohabitation ended.", "On 21 July 1988, T married a person called R. In January 1989, T gave birth to a daughter called J.", "The applicant claims to be the biological father of J. On 7 September 1989, on his own initiative, he recognised J as his child before the Child Welfare Supervisor (lastenvalvoja, barnatillsyningsman) of Espoo.", "By virtue of section 20 of the Paternity Act (isyyslaki, lagen om faderskap), the matter of the approval of his recognition came before the District Court Judge (kihlakunnantuomari, h\u00e4radsh\u00f6vding) of Espoo. In his decision of 28 September 1989, the Judge noted that J was born in wedlock whereby followed a legal presumption of the husband\u2019s paternity. In the written proceedings T denied the applicant\u2019s paternity and maintained that she had already had a relationship with her husband around the time of J\u2019s conception. On the basis of these circumstances, the Judge found that the applicant was not J\u2019s father. According to section 45 of the Paternity Act, no appeal lay from the Judge\u2019s decision.", "The Judge\u2019s decision was written on a form designed for decisions concerning the recognition of paternity. On the back of the form was attached information for the man about, inter alia, the legal consequences of the recognition.", "T refused the applicant\u2019s offer to pay for a voluntary DNA test. The applicant\u2019s attempts to see J have been fruitless, apparently due to T\u2019s opposition thereto.", "On 14 June 1991, the applicant took legal action seeking a determination of whether he was the biological father of J or not. In doing so, he referred to Article 8 of the Convention.", "The mother T and the child J were summoned to the District Court (kihlakunnanoikeus, h\u00e4radsr\u00e4tten) of Espoo. During the first hearing on 22 October 1991, they objected to the trial, stating that the applicant had no right of action. Furthermore, they based their objection on the failure to summon J\u2019s other guardian R to the court. Subsequently, R was also summoned.", "On 10 March 1992, the District Court held a second hearing in which it considered the matter of the applicant\u2019s right of action. Both parties submitted to the District Court an expert opinion, respectively, concerning the issue of the applicant\u2019s legal standing. The parties disagreed over whether it was at all possible to start legal proceedings concerning only the determination of whether a person was a natural father or not, or whether the action should include a request for the establishment or annulment of paternity.", "On 10 March 1992, the District Court decided that the claim was not, as such, formulated in a manner that would be contrary to the Paternity Act. It found that the Paternity Act gave the courts an opportunity merely to declare whether a man and a child were, in reality, close relatives without, at the same time, establishing a legal father-child relation between them. However, the District Court also found that, according to the Paternity Act, a man claiming to be a father did not have the right of action as regards paternity proceedings relating to a child born in wedlock. The District Court considered Articles 8 and 12 of the Convention and Article 5 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention as well as Article 7 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989. It concluded that the applicant had no right of action regarding the determination of whether he was J\u2019s father or not. The District Court then dismissed the applicant\u2019s action without examining it on the merits.", "The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal (hovioikeus, hovr\u00e4tten) of Helsinki. He emphasised that the child\u2019s fundamental right to know her origins could not be denied on the grounds that the other biological parent had opposed it. From the applicant\u2019s point of view, the focus of his action was whether a woman, who had become pregnant while living in a relationship similar to marriage, had the right to prevent the examination of the paternity and judicially to kidnap the child on the formal ground that she had married somebody else. The applicant stated that he had only requested that the fact that he was the father of J be confirmed, without asking to establish a legal father-child relation. The applicant had a very strong need for the protection of law in the case. He argued that it was in the best interest of the child that the matter be solved before she herself reached the age of 15, thereby obtaining the right of action of her own. He requested that the District Court\u2019s judgment be quashed and the case be referred back to the District Court.", "On 23 December 1992, the Court of Appeal rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal. It reached the same conclusion as the District Court but its reasoning differed from that of the latter. The Court of Appeal noted that the applicant had only requested that it be determined whether or not he had fathered the child born when T was married to R. Biological paternity, as a fact separate from the kinship, did not in itself create any rights or obligations for the man or the child. Furthermore, the establishment of such a fact without the consent of the child\u2019s parents would disturb relations in the child\u2019s family. The best interests of the child did not require that biological paternity should be determined separately from the kinship. The Court of Appeal found that the action was not based on the Paternity Act. Furthermore, since the action in reality included a request for the annulment of the presumption of the husband\u2019s paternity, it was contrary to the aim of the Paternity Act. The Court of Appeal found that the applicant had no legal interest to have determined the biological paternity of J on any other grounds either. Lastly, the Court of Appeal found that the international conventions referred to in the District Court\u2019s judgment did not include provisions pursuant to which the applicant would have had the right to the examination in issue.", "The applicant requested leave to appeal. He referred, inter alia, to Article 8 of the Convention.", "On 24 May 1993, the Supreme Court (korkein oikeus, h\u00f6gsta domstolen) refused the applicant leave to appeal.", "B.
