{"ITEMID": "001-71885", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "DNK", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2005, "DOCNAME": "NORDISK FILM & TV A/S v. DENMARK", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant, Nordisk Film & TV A/S, is a private limited company, which is domiciled in Valby, Denmark. It is represented before the Court by Mr Tyge Trier, a lawyer practising in Copenhagen.", "The applicant company is a television producer. In October 1999 its documentary unit called \u201cFak2eren\u201d decided to produce a programme investigating paedophilia in Denmark which was to be broadcast on national television. In this connection the journalists employed by the applicant company unsuccessfully sought permission from an association named \u201cThe Paedophile Association\u201d to attend its meetings or conduct interviews with its members.", "The said association was formed \u201cto work toward the development of paedophiles\u2019 sense of responsibility towards children\u201d and it holds regular meetings, but they are generally closed to the public and the media. Its members include convicted sexual offenders. The association was not illegal under Danish law, a fact which had been the subject of public debate.", "Wishing to probe into the Paedophile Association\u2019s activities, a journalist, JB, using the pseudonym \u201cJacob Andersen\u201d, went undercover, posing as a member. In the course of his year long membership \u201cJacob Andersen\u201d participated in quasi-public meetings, was invited to so-called \u201cprivate meetings\u201d and was befriended by two other members \u201cMogens\u201d and \u201cPer\u201d. These two made many incriminating statements regarding the realities of paedophilia in both Denmark and India, including advice on how to induce a child to chat over the internet, comments about how difficult it was to procure sexual acts from children in Denmark, and how easy on the other hand it was to procure children in Eastern Europe and India. \u201cMogens\u201d recommended to \u201cJacob Andersen\u201d a specific hotel, run by a Danish paedophile in India, at which \u201cMogens\u201d had had sex with Indian boys in the past. JB visited the hotel in India and interviewed an Indian boy about his knowledge of \u201cMogens\u201d. Also, in front of the hotel, a young Indian boy was offering sexual services. JB made numerous notes and camera recordings, most of them hidden.", "Before the programme was to be broadcast on 30 October 2000, the Paedophile Association and its members who had been recorded by the hidden camera were contacted by the applicant company and given assurance that they would remain anonymous, when the documentary was shown. Thus, false names would be used and the members\u2019 faces and voices would be blurred.", "The association unsuccessfully sought an injunction to prevent the broadcast of the programme.", "The day after the broadcast of the programme, on 31 October 2000, the person named \u201cMogens\u201d was arrested and charged with sexual offences under sections 222 (1) taken together with sections 224 and 225 of the Penal Code (Straffeloven). The Copenhagen Police (K\u00f8benhavns Politi) had taken an interest in him before the broadcast of the programme and could therefore identify him. Their request that he be detained on remand was refused by the City Court, which found no specific reason to believe that \u201cMogens\u201d would impede the investigation, notably because the information leading to the charges against him on the whole appeared from the programme. Thus, \u201cMogens\u201d was released on the same day. During their further investigation, which also included the person in the programme named \u201cPer\u201d, the Copenhagen Police requested that the un-shown portions of the recordings made by JB be disclosed. JB, and the editor and head of the applicant company\u2019s documentary unit, refused the request following which the public prosecution requested a court order compelling the applicant company to hand over the un-shown footage to the police.", "By decision of 12 February 2001 the Copenhagen City Court (K\u00f8benhavns Byret) refused to grant the requested court order having regard to the need of the media to be able to protect their sources. Also, it found that the raw material had little or no evidential value, as it essentially covered the same matter as the broadcast footage. Moreover, it referred to section 172 of the Administration of Justice Act (Retsplejeloven) and Article 10 of the Convention.", "On appeal, the decision was upheld on 8 June 2001 by the High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret).", "Having been granted leave to appeal, the public prosecution brought the case before the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret), which on 29 August 2002 found against the applicant company, so that the latter was compelled to hand over limited specified unedited footage and notes which related solely to \u201cMogens\u201d and his activities in Denmark and India, including the recordings made outside the Indian hotel of the Indian boy. However, the recordings and notes were exempted from the order whenever the handover would entail a risk of revealing the identity of any of three named persons, namely \u201cthe victim [not the Indian boy], the police officer and the hotel manager\u2019s mother\u201d. The remainder of the unedited footage was to remain protected. In its decision the Supreme Court stated as follows:", "\u201cThe Supreme Court agrees that presumably the non-edited recordings and the notes made by the journalist JB may assist the investigation and production of evidence in the case against \u201cMogens\u201d and that therefore they may serve as evidence within the meaning of section 804, subsection 1, of the Administration of Justice Act.", "It is undisputed that in connection with the recording, three of the participants - the victim, the police officer and the hotel manager\u2019s mother - were promised that they could participate without the possibility of being identified, thus their identities are protected by the right of exemption from the duty to testify as a witness, pursuant to section 172, subsection 2(ii) first sentence, of the Administration of Justice Act.", "The charge against \u201cMogens\u201d concerns a criminal offence which is punishable with four years\u2019 imprisonment or more. The charge includes several instances of sexual relations other than intercourse, over a long time, with boys younger than 15 years of age, and the Supreme Court finds that the case concerns a criminal act, which is of a serious nature. However, having regard to the information about the content of the material which is related to the three participants mentioned [the victim, the police officer and the hotel manager\u2019s mother] compared with the investigation possibilities otherwise available, it cannot be presumed that the material is of vital importance for resolving the case. In these circumstances, the Supreme Court agrees that the conditions stated in section 804, subsection 4, and section 172, subsection 5, of the Administration of Justice Act are not fulfilled for issuing an order [to compel the applicant company to disclose or hand over the material which is related to those three participants] contrary to the right of exemption from the duty to give evidence.", "The recordings of the members of the Paedophile Association during its meetings and of \u201cMogens\u201d and \u201cPer\u201d were done with a hidden camera. Hence a promise of anonymity could only be given after the recordings. The media\u2019s extensive privilege of protecting their sources by virtue of section 172 of the Administration of Justice Act has been introduced in consideration of the sources\u2019 and the participants\u2019 opportunity to exercise the freedom of speech, since the promise of anonymity may be a vital premise for supplying a journalist with information. Thus, the main purpose of the rules concerning the right of exemption from the duty to testify as a witness is to protect persons who, relying on a promise of anonymity, agree to participate in a programme. Even though, in compliance with the rules on press ethics and the use of a hidden camera, [the applicant company] has subsequently given the participants a promise and has kept this promise in the programme, section 172, subsection 2(ii), of the Administration of Justice Act cannot, according to its wording and purpose, extend to a right of exemption from the duty to testify as a witness as regards the recordings in question. Nor can section 172, subsection 2(i).", "The programme contains recordings made outside an Indian hotel of a boy with whom \u201cMogens\u201d allegedly had had [sexual] relations. The boy\u2019s name does not appear and reasonable precautions have been taken to cover his identity, but this is not sufficient to establish a right of exemption from the duty to give evidence according to section 172, subsection 2, of the Administration of Justice Act.", "A court order pursuant to section 804 of the Administration of Justice Act may not be issued if it is disproportionate to the importance of the case and the disadvantage which such a ruling might entail (section 805, subsection 1, of the Administration of Justice Act). In this balancing exercise, regard must be had to the nature of the offence, the value which the items may have for the investigation of the case, and considerations for the media\u2019s working conditions as regards Article 10 of the Convention. In these circumstances, the Supreme Court finds that a court order should be limited to those recordings in which \u201cMogens\u201d or the Indian boy participates, and JB\u2019s notes which relate thereto.", "... [The Supreme Court] orders that [the applicant company] hand over those parts of the non-edited tapes with recording for the programme \u201cDanish Paedophiles\u201d in which \u201cMogens\u201d or the Indian boy participates. Also, [the applicant company] must hand over notes made by the journalist JB in connection with the said recordings. However, the recordings and notes may be exempted from the handover order whenever that would entail a risk of revealing the identity of the victim, the police officer or the hotel manager\u2019s mother.\u201d", "On 1 April 2003 the Copenhagen Police decided to discontinue its investigation against \u201cMogens\u201d and drop the charges against him.", "The provisions of the Administration of Justice Act (Retsplejeloven), in so far as relevant, read as follows:", "1. Editors and editorial staff employed by a publication covered by section 1, subsection 1, of the Media Responsibility Act (Medieansvarsloven) are under no obligation to testify as a witness about:", "the identity of the source of information or the author of an article, or the person who has taken a photograph or procured another figurative production.

If publication is made, exemption from the duty to testify as a witness applies as long as the identity [of the relevant persons] does not appear from the text.", "2.

As part of the investigation of a criminal offence, subject to public prosecution, any person who is not a suspect may be compelled to disclose or hand over items (edition) if there is reason to assume that such an item, which that person has possession of, may serve as evidence, ought to be seized, or has been removed during the criminal act from someone who may claim it back...", "2. ...", "3. ...", "4.

The protection of the relationship between a journalist and a source is the goal of this Recommendation, because of the \"potentially chilling effect\" an order of source disclosure has on the exercise of freedom of the media (see, Eu. Court H.R., Goodwin v. the United Kingdom, 27 March 1996, para. 39). Journalists may receive their information from all kinds of sources. Therefore, a wide interpretation of this term is necessary. The actual provision of information to journalists can constitute an action on the side of the source, for example when a source calls or writes to a journalist or sends to him or her recorded information or pictures. Information shall also be regarded as being \"provided\" when a source remains passive and consents to the journalist taking the information, such as the filming or recording of information with the consent of the source.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
