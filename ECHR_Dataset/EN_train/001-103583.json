CROATIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis;Elisabeth Steiner;George Nicolaou;Khanlar Hajiyev;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant, Ms Sonja Mavrinac, is a Croatian national who was born in 1960 and lives in \u010cavli. She was represented before the Court by Mr M. \u0160egota, an advocate practising in Rijeka. The Croatian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mrs \u0160. Sta\u017enik.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "In 1987 the applicant, whilst a passenger in a coach owned by company A., sustained injuries in a road traffic accident.", "In 1991 she instituted civil proceedings against the company in question before the Rijeka Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Rijeci). On 3 December 1991 that court delivered a judgment in favour of the applicant and awarded her compensation.", "On 29 March 1994 the applicant\u2019s doctor made a request for an assessment of her work capacity to the Croatian Pension Fund.", "On 1 June 1994 the Disability Commission of the Croatian Pension Fund carried out an expert medical evaluation and found that the applicant\u2019s work capacity was reduced. It stated depression as the main disorder significantly affecting the applicant\u2019s capacity to work and noted several physical ailments as other disorders affecting that capacity. On the same day the Disability Commission carried out an expert medical evaluation with a view to assessing whether, owing to her physical ailments, the applicant could be considered as having a physical impairment (tjelesno o\u0161te\u0107enje) within the meaning of the relevant legislation entitling her to certain benefits on that account. It found that no such impairment existed.", "On 27 June 1994 the Rijeka Regional Office of the Croatian Pension Fund issued a decision acknowledging the applicant\u2019s reduced work capacity and granting her the rights related thereto, such as the right to employment corresponding to her remaining work capacity and the right to compensation for the loss of salary resulting from a reduced capacity to work.", "On 9 October 1995 the Disability Commission of the Croatian Pension Fund, of its own motion, carried out an expert medical evaluation of the applicant\u2019s state of health and found that the applicant\u2019s health had deteriorated to the extent that she had lost her capacity to work completely and permanently and thus could be considered disabled for the purposes of awarding her a disability pension. It stated depression as the main disorder causing the applicant\u2019s disability and noted several physical ailments as other disorders contributing to that disability.", "On 20 November 1995 the Rijeka Regional Office of the Croatian Pension Fund issued a decision granting the applicant a disability pension on the basis of her incapacity to work.", "On 6 February 1997 the applicant brought a civil action in the Rijeka Municipal Court against company A., seeking compensation for lost earnings on account of her incapacity to work that had resulted from the injuries she had sustained in the road traffic accident in 1987.", "The Municipal Court heard evidence from a medical expert, who established that the 60% of the applicant\u2019s disability had been caused by the injuries sustained in the road traffic accident in 1987 and 40% by her previous health problems.", "On 26 February 2002 the Municipal Court delivered a judgment whereby it awarded the applicant 202,429.81 Croatian kunas (HRK) in compensation for lost earnings, together with statutory default interest running from the date of the adoption of the judgment.", "On 31 May 2006 the Rijeka County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Rijeci) dismissed an appeal by the defendant and upheld the first-instance judgment.", "However, following an appeal on points of law (revizija) by the defendant, on 30 May 2007 the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) reversed the lower courts\u2019 judgments and dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim, on the grounds that the civil courts had had no jurisdiction to question the findings of the competent administrative authority as to the reasons for the applicant\u2019s incapacity to work. The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows:", "\u201cIn the [...] proceedings it was established that the plaintiff was injured in a road traffic accident on 29 April 1987 while travelling in the defendant\u2019s coach. On that occasion she sustained blows to her head, torso, left knee, left hip and neck. In the proceedings for damages conducted before the same court ... the plaintiff obtained damages by a judgment of 3 December 1991. In those proceedings it was established, by taking evidence from a medical expert, that owing to the whiplash injury the plaintiff\u2019s capabilities were reduced by 10% [but] that an even greater reduction in her capabilities existed due to previously existing neural disorders and degenerative processes in the plaintiff\u2019s spine and joints, for which she had been treated in previous years.", "After the traffic accident, the plaintiff continued to work at her job until 1 January 1994 when her employment was terminated as redundant. From then until her retirement she had been registered as unemployed at the Employment Office.", "It was also established that by a decision of the Croatian Pension Fund of 20 November 1995, the plaintiff had been granted a disability pension as of 9 October 1995 on the basis of a loss of capacity to work due to an illness.", "Despite the finality of the definitive decision of the Croatian Pension Fund, the [first-instance] court decided to take evidence by obtaining an opinion from a medical expert with a view to establishing that the immediate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s retirement was the consequence of the whiplash injury sustained in the road traffic accident in 1987, and not the disorders that manifested before the tortious event, as established by the Disability Commission of the Croatian Pension Fund in the proceedings for awarding the right to a disability pension.", "...", "The defendant is right in arguing that the lower courts\u2019 judgments are based on a misapplication of substantive law. Where the Disability Commission of the Croatian Pension Fund has established that [a] plaintiff has lost capacity to work owing to an illness and where a final decision of a competent authority is based on that finding, it is not legally possible that the loss of capacity to work was caused by some other reason.", "A court is bound by this final decision as regards the reasons for the incidence of the loss of the plaintiff\u2019s capacity to work owing to an illness, and the content of that decision can no longer be decided as a preliminary issue. A court cannot examine whether the final decision rendered in the administrative proceedings was correct or assess its validity.", "Since there is no legal basis for the defendant\u2019s liability in damages for the lost earnings, the defendant\u2019s appeal on points of law has to be allowed and ... the plaintiff\u2019s claim dismissed ...\u201d", "On 19 November 2007 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment. She alleged a violation of her constitutional right to work guaranteed by Article 54 paragraph 1 of the Constitution. In her constitutional complaint the applicant wrote, inter alia:", "\u201cThe purpose and scope of the Croatian Pension Fund\u2019s decision [of 20 November 1995] is that it represents the basis for payment of the complainant\u2019s pension. The Croatian Pension Fund does not have a duty or a right to decide on the causes of one\u2019s difficulties, but [rather] only whether there was an incidence of disability, or alteration or reduction of the capacity to work. Therefore, it cannot be expected that the Croatian Pension Fund be accurate or meticulous when determining other circumstances. Given that the Supreme Court wrongly assessed or interpreted that decision, the constitutionally guaranteed right has been breached.\u201d", "On 30 April 2008 the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) dismissed the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint and served its decision on her representative on 5 June 2008. The relevant part of that decision reads as follows:", "\u201cHaving examined the arguments raised in the constitutional complaint, the contested judgment and the relevant statutory provisions, the Constitutional Court finds that the constitutional right relied on by the complainant was not breached by the contested judgment. ...", "The right to work and the freedom of work also entail the right of an individual that his or her employment is not terminated in a manner contrary to that prescribed by the relevant law. The content of this right is also to protect statutorily established rights of citizens arising from their work, including the protection in respect of termination of employment if that termination is contrary to the law.", "The Constitutional Court therefore finds that the complainant\u2019s constitutional right guaranteed by Article 54 paragraph 1 of the Constitution (Everyone shall have the right to work and enjoy the freedom of work) has not been breached by the contested judgment, which was rendered in accordance with the relevant legislation.\u201d", "The relevant provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia (Ustav Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette of the Republic of Croatia nos. 56/1990, 135/1997, 8/1998 (consolidated text), 113/2000, 124/2000 (consolidated text), 28/2001 and 41/2001 (consolidated text), 55/2001 (corrigendum) and 76/2010) read as follows:", "\u201cAll shall be equal before the law.\u201d", "\u201cIn the determination of his rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial court established by law.\u201d", "\u201cEveryone shall be guaranteed respect for, and the legal protection of, his personal and family life, dignity, reputation and honour.\u201d", "\u201cThe right of ownership shall be guaranteed.", "Ownership implies duties.

Anyone may lodge a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court if he or she deems that the decision of a state authority, local or regional government, or a legal person invested with public authority, on his or her rights or obligations, or as regards a suspicion or accusation of a criminal offence, has violated his or her human rights or fundamental freedoms, or the right to local or regional government, guaranteed by the Constitution (\u201cconstitutional right\u201d)...", "2.
