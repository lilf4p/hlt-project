On 21 September 1999 the applicant was convicted of a driving offence by the Board for Administrative Offences at the W\u0142odawa District Court (Kolegium d.s. wykrocze\u0144). He appealed.", "On 29 November 1999 the W\u0142odawa District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) dismissed his appeal.", "6. On 9 March 2001 the applicant was arrested by the police. On 12 March 2001 the W\u0142odawa District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody in view of the existence of a reasonable suspicion that he had committed several offences of fraud. The applicant had allegedly been corresponding with several men from different countries, passing himself off as a lady wishing to meet them.", "7. On 3 December 2001 the W\u0142odawa District Court prolonged the applicant\u2019s detention, finding that it was highly probable that he had committed the offences with which he had been charged. The court further found that there was a risk that the applicant might go into hiding or obstruct the proceedings.", "That decision was upheld on appeal on 17 December 2001.", "8. On 31 January 2002 the applicant was indicted on charges of fraud against ten Dutch, French and German nationals who had given him money under false pretences, believing that the applicant was a women interested in meeting and visiting them.

The applicant filed an application for release, but on 11 February 2002 the W\u0142odawa District Court dismissed it reiterating the original grounds for the detention. The court further prolonged his detention, finding that the applicant\u2019s place of permanent residence was far from the trial court and, if released, he would obstruct the proper course of proceedings. Simultaneously, the court dismissed the applicant\u2019s request to be released on bail.", "10. On 8 March, 6 June and 30 July 2002 the W\u0142odawa District Court prolonged the applicant\u2019s detention on remand.

On 5 August 2002 the W\u0142odawa District Court gave judgment. The applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine.", "12. The applicant lodged an appeal.", "13. On 14 August 2002 the Lublin Regional Court released the applicant on bail.

On 15 July 2003 the Lublin Regional Court partly amended the judgment. It appears that the judgment is final.", "15.

In March 2001 the W\u0142odawa District Prosecutor decided to obtain and control the correspondence from the applicant\u2019s post office box - apparently during the investigation stage. The applicant\u2019s appeals against those decisions were dismissed by the Lublin Regional Prosecutor.", "16.
