The original lawful asking price, CZK 22,540,000 (EUR 751,333), was not reached and the bidding finally stopped at 1,409,000 (EUR 46,967). On 1 July 1993 the applicant company concluded a purchase contract whereby the purchase price was fixed at CZK 1,409,000.", "On 23 February 1994 the Finance Office issued a tax order against the applicant company ordering it to pay a gift tax of CZK 3,877,548 (EUR 129,252), the base of assessment being fixed at CZK 21,134,100 (EUR 704,470) by virtue of the Taxation Act.", "On 10 March 1994 the Finance Office, in reply to the applicant company\u2019s letter of 7 March 1994, explained that the basis of the taxation had been the difference between the asking price and the final bid.", "On 19 December 1996, on the applicant company\u2019s appeal, the \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem Finance Directorate (Finan\u010dn\u00ed \u0159editelstv\u00ed) reduced the tax due to CZK 1,087,876 (EUR 36,263), taking into account a new expert assessment made of the taxation basis (CZK 8,488,200 (EUR 282,940)).", "On 10 February 1999 the \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem Regional Court (krajsk\u00fd soud) dismissed the applicant\u2019s action against the tax order finding, in particular:", "\u201cThe transfer of the estate was effected in 1993, when [the Taxation Act], as amended by Act no. 18/1993, was in force. If the real estate was transferred for a lower price than that established by the expert ... the tax liability is shared between the assignor and assignee. Under section 10 the real estate-transfer tax base is the price of the estate legally established on the date of the acquisition of the whole real estate, or part of it if the transfer was effected partly free of charge. Gift tax under section 6(1) of the [Taxation] Act was payable on real estates acquired by an act in law other than the death of an owner, provided that the act in law was effected fully or partly free of charge. ...", "Under section 7(1) of [the Taxation Act], the base of the gift tax was the price of the estate minus the price which was paid if the act in law was effected partly free of charge.

The first-instance authority\u2019s error in establishing the price and tax base was rectified by the [Finance Directorate] ... which requested that a new expert report be submitted on the price of the property at the date of its acquisition; it informed [the applicant company] about the findings of the expert, and discussed [the applicant company\u2019s] comments with the expert, who issued another report, which was not challenged by [the applicant company].\u201d", "On 10 April 1999 the applicant company lodged a constitutional appeal (\u00fastavn\u00ed st\u00ed\u017enost) alleging, inter alia, a violation of Article 11 \u00a7 5 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms (Listina z\u00e1kladn\u00edch pr\u00e1v a svobod).", "On 3 August 2000 the Constitutional Court (\u00dastavn\u00ed soud) dismissed the applicant company\u2019s constitutional appeal, endorsing the reasons on which the lower administrative and judicial authorities had based their decisions.", "Under section 5, persons liable to gift tax were those who had acquired property.

Under section 9(1) real estate-transfer tax is payable on the transfer of an estate carried out in return for payment. Section 10 provides that the real estate-transfer tax base was the price established under the relevant legal provisions on the day of the acquisition of the estate, even if the price agreed between the parties is lower than the legally established price; the difference is not taxable under the provisions on gift tax.
