The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in St Petersburg. At the time of introduction of the application he was detained in remand prison IZ-47/1 in St Petersburg.", "7. On 18 May 2004 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant and third persons for attempted swindling. At 9.10 p.m. on the same day the applicant was arrested. He was placed in the temporary detention facility of the Nevskiy District of St Petersburg.", "8. On 20 May 2004 the Nevskiy District Court of St Petersburg (\u201cthe trial court\u201d) remanded the applicant in custody. He was transferred to remand prison IZ-47/1 in St Petersburg (\u201cthe remand prison\u201d). The court held that the applicant was charged with a serious crime, had a disposition to commit crimes and could continue to pursue criminal activities if at liberty. The ruling was not appealed against.", "9. On 15 July 2004 the Kuybyshevskiy District Court of St Petersburg granted a request by the investigator to extend the applicant's detention until 26 August 2004, holding that investigative measures could not be taken prior to that date. The ruling was not appealed against.", "10. On 23 August 2004 the Smolninskiy District Court of St Petersburg prolonged the applicant's detention until 26 October 2004.", "11. On 25 October 2004 the Kuybyshevskiy District Court of St Petersburg prolonged the applicant's detention until 26 December 2004.", "12. On 24 December 2004 the bill of indictment was drawn up and the case file was transferred to the trial court.", "13. On 4 February 2005 the trial court scheduled a hearing for 25 March 2005. The issue of the application of a preventive measure to the applicant was not decided upon pursuant to Article 236 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (\u201cthe CCP\u201d).", "14. At the preliminary hearing of 24 March 2005 the trial court, relying on Article 237 of the CCP, returned the case to the prosecutor because certain procedural rules had not been complied with. In particular, some pages of the case file had been wrongly numbered and the accused had not been provided with the opportunity to study some documents. The trial court further noted that no application to vary the preventive measure had been lodged. The trial court found that the measure applied was lawful and appropriate in view of the gravity of the charges and the information about the accused, and ordered that it should remain unchanged. The trial court observed that the decision could be appealed against to the St Petersburg City Court within ten days from the date of its delivery. The applicant and his counsel N. were present at the hearing.", "15. The ruling of 24 March 2005 was not appealed against and became final on 4 April 2005. On 5 April 2005 the case file was transmitted to the prosecutor.", "16. On 7 April 2005 the prosecutor returned the case to the investigator for additional investigative measures. Having obtained the endorsement of the St Petersburg City Prosecutor, the investigator requested a court to extend the applicant's custodial detention for one month until 5 May 2005 so that the aggregate term of his detention amounted to eight months and five days. He argued that the extension sought would allow him to take the requisite investigative measures and to comply with the trial court's instructions.", "17. On 8 April 2005 the Kuybyshevskiy District Court of St Petersburg, relying on Article 109 of the CCP, granted the investigator's request to extend the applicant's detention for \u201cone month, up to eight months and five days in total, that is, until 5 May 2005\u201d. The applicant and his counsel M. were present at the hearing. His counsel M. objected, stating that the applicant had a permanent place of residence, had no intention of absconding \u2013 on the contrary, he had actively cooperated with the investigation \u2013 and that his state of health had worsened. The court held that the investigator's request should be granted and that there was no reason to vary the preventive measure in respect of the applicant since the circumstances that had constituted the grounds for its application had not changed. The applicant was charged with a serious offence and had no permanent job and no assets. Furthermore, he was suspected of having committed a further offence similar to the one he had been charged with. Therefore, if released, he might abscond, hinder the criminal prosecution and engage in further criminal activity. Moreover, certain investigative measures had to be conducted before the case was sent for trial. The court also found that the arguments put forward by the applicant's counsel concerning the applicant's personality and his state of health were not sufficient grounds for refusing the investigator's request. In particular, no medical documents had been provided to prove that placement in a remand prison was damaging to the applicant's health.", "18. The applicant appealed against the ruling of 8 April 2005, claiming that Article 109 of the CCP did not provide for the possibility of extending a period of detention pending additional investigation.", "19. On an unspecified date the applicant requested the Oktyabrskiy District Court of St Petersburg to declare that the prosecutor had not received the case file from the trial court as required by the ruling of 24 March 2005.", "20. On 26 April 2005 the Oktyabrskiy District Court of St Petersburg held a hearing on the complaint, during which the applicant was advised that the case file had already been sent to the prosecutor. The applicant then brought another complaint about the prosecutor's actions between 5 and 8 April 2004, claiming that the latter had failed to take the requisite measures to ensure the applicant's release from custody. The court dismissed the complaint, stating that the prosecutor's actions were lawful, and observed that the ruling could be appealed against to the St Petersburg City Court within ten days from the date of its delivery.", "21. It follows from the parties' submissions that the applicant did not appeal against the ruling of 26 April 2005.", "22. On 5 May 2005 the Kuybyshevskiy District Court of St Petersburg granted a request lodged by the St Petersburg City Prosecutor to extend the applicant's detention for one month to 5 June 2005 so that the aggregate term of his detention amounted to nine months and five days. The applicant and his counsel P. objected on the grounds that the court had no evidence of the applicant's intention either to abscond or to engage in further criminal activity. The court dismissed the objections and ordered the extension of the applicant's detention on the same grounds as those given in the ruling of 8 April 2005. The applicant's counsel P. was a legal-aid lawyer appointed by the court. At the beginning of the hearing the applicant applied to the court to have counsel replaced because he wished to be assisted by his own counsel, B., who had not been notified of the hearing. The court found that counsel B. had been notified by telephone of the hearing that had initially been scheduled for 4 May 2005. However, she had neither appeared nor provided any documents justifying her failure to do so. The hearing had then been postponed to 5 May 2005 and counsel B. had been notified accordingly. However, she had said that she could not attend the hearing because she was involved in other proceedings. Nevertheless, she had failed to provide any supporting documents. The applicant appealed.", "23. On 12 May 2005 the final bill of indictment was drawn up.", "24. On 13 May 2005 the case was sent to the trial court.", "25. On 14 May 2005 the trial court received the case file.", "26. On 27 May 2005 the trial court scheduled a hearing for 5 July 2005. It also ordered that the preventive measure imposed on the applicant was to remain unchanged.", "27. On 15 June 2005 the St Petersburg City Court dismissed the applicant's appeal against the ruling of 8 April 2005. The appeal court held that when a case was returned to the prosecutor, new time-limits for the investigation were to be fixed and a decision concerning a preventive measure was to be taken accordingly. It also upheld the first-instance court's findings that, if released, the applicant might abscond and engage in further criminal activity.", "28. On 12 July 2005 the St Petersburg City Court dismissed the applicant's appeal against the trial court's ruling of 5 May 2005. The appeal court upheld the first-instance court's conclusion that, if released, the applicant might abscond, engage in further criminal activity and hinder the prosecution. It also found that counsel B. had been duly notified of the hearing of 5 May 2005. However, she had not appeared and had failed to provide appropriate justification.", "29. On 22 November 2005 the St Petersburg City Court dismissed the applicant's appeal against the ruling of 14 May 2005.", "30. On 10 October 2006 the trial court sentenced the applicant to five years and two months' imprisonment.", "31. On 19 February 2007 the applicant's sentence became final.", "32. On 4 April 2007 the St Petersburg City Court dismissed the applicant's appeal against the decision of the Oktyabrskiy District Court of St Petersburg of 26 April 2005 concerning his complaint about the prosecutor's inaction. It held, in particular, that the prosecutor had requested authorisation of the applicant's detention for a period including the days that had preceded the court's ruling, that is, between 5 and 8 April 2005. It rejected the applicant's argument that his detention during that period had been unlawful, for the reason that \u201cthere was a judicial decision extending the detention for the period from 5 to 8 April 2005\u201d. No reference as to which judicial decision had authorised that period was given.", "33. On 30 April 1997 the applicant was diagnosed with hepatitis C. He underwent treatment between 30 April and 26 May 1997 and was subsequently diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C.", "34. On 20 May 2004, on his admission to remand prison IZ 47/1, the applicant was diagnosed as HIV-positive on the basis of a routine blood test.", "35. According to the applicant, his state of health had been deteriorating since October 2004. He had shown symptoms of immunodeficiency and there had been bad bouts of his chronic illnesses. The applicant had applied to the medical unit of the remand prison for treatment to boost his immune system. In reply, he had been advised to take aspirin, papaverine and analgesics. After the applicant had stated that this treatment would obviously be insufficient, he had been threatened with confinement in a solitary cell.", "36. On 29 October 2004 the applicant was placed in solitary cell no. 129 in wing 2/1 with restricted access. The wing was designed for the detention of inmates sentenced to life imprisonment.", "37. On 19 January 2005 the applicant was transferred to solitary cell no. 123 in wing 2/1 with restricted access. According to the applicant, the cell was the equivalent of a disciplinary cell. However, he had neither requested to be placed in solitary confinement, nor had there been any grounds for such placement since he had not broken prison rules. The cell was in the basement where there was no central heating, and the winter temperature there was about 7-10oC.", "38. On account of the conditions of detention in the solitary cell the applicant's health had deteriorated further. He had been put on a special diet which included a supplementary daily portion of margarine and sugar. Despite his regular requests, he had never been provided with either antiviral treatment or treatment stimulating liver function and had been offered only febrifuges and analgesics. Medical staff of the remand prison had stated that they had no medicines for HIV-positive prisoners because of lack of funding.", "39. The applicant requested to be placed in a hospital in August and September 2004. However, he was refused admission to the hospital at remand prison IZ 47/1 on the grounds that there were too many HIVpositive patients and not enough places. He was likewise refused admission to the hospital of the Federal Penitentiary Service, because the hospital only treated convicted prisoners and did not have the status of a remand prison.", "40. The applicant lodged numerous complaints concerning his inadequate medical assistance. However, he did not receive any formal replies to his complaints or a formal refusal to place him in a hospital. The replies he received were given in the course of private conversations. Nor was he provided with any documents confirming that his complaints had been forwarded to the appropriate authorities. According to the applicant, the officials of the remand prison had forwarded only his correspondence relating to his criminal case and had not provided his counsel B. with the medical documents contained in his personal file.", "41.

In part 3.2 of the ruling the Constitutional Court held:", "\u201cThe second part of Article 22 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation provides that ... detention is permitted only on the basis of a court order ...
