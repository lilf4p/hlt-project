The applicant was born in 1943 and lives in Jesenice.", "6. On 20 August 1994 the applicant\u2019s mother, A.K., died.", "7.

On 22 March 1995 the applicant was given notice of the court\u2019s intention to hold a hearing in the inheritance proceedings and received an invitation to attend it.", "9. The court held hearings on 5 April and 25 October 1995.", "10. Meanwhile, on 5 July 1995, the applicant lodged written submissions.", "11. On 16 June 1997 the court issued an interim decision concerning the inheritance of A.K.\u2019s ownership certificate (lastninski certifikat).", "12. On 27 June and 5 September 2000 hearings were held. They were adjourned so as to allow the heirs to reach an agreement in respect of the inheritance. The subsequent negotiations were apparently unsuccessful.", "13. On 8 November 2000 the applicant lodged written submissions.", "14. At the hearing held on 14 November 2000 the court decided to stay the proceedings and instructed the parties to institute separate contentious proceedings with a view to determining the extent of A.K.\u2019s estate which was disputed by the heirs.", "15. On 5 February 2001 one of the heirs lodged a civil claim with the Kranj District Court (Okro\u017eno sodi\u0161\u010de v Kranju) in accordance with the Jesenice Local Court\u2019s instructions (paragraph 14 above).

In the meantime, on 19 December 2000 the Jesenice Local Court rejected the applicant\u2019s request for interim measures. In addition, on 15 March 2001 the Jesenice Administrative Unit (Upravna enota Jesenice) issued a decision indicating that the farmland which was part of A.K.\u2019s estate was not under the special protection which would prevent its division. The Jesenice Local Court received that decision on 18 May 2001.", "17. On 28 November 2003 the Jesenice Local Court issued a decree of distribution (sklep o dedovanju) dividing the remainder of A.K.\u2019s estate (see paragraph 11 above) between her four daughters.

Section 164 of the Inheritance Act (Official Gazette SRS, no. 15-645/1976, with amendments, \u2013 Zakon o dedovanju) provides that inheritance proceedings should begin ex officio as soon as the court learns that somebody has died or has been pronounced dead. In inheritance proceedings the court should establish the heirs, the property which is to be included in the deceased\u2019s estate and the rights of heirs, beneficiaries and others (section 162).", "19. According to section 199, after receiving the coroner\u2019s certificate (a document concerning personal data about the deceased and his estate and information relevant for the inheritance, normally prepared by a registrar \u2013 mati\u010dar), the court examines whether it is competent to hold a hearing and, if not, sends the case to the competent court. According to sections 203 and 205, the court must hold a hearing if the deceased owned immovable property. It is the court\u2019s obligation to invite those who might be affected to the hearing (section 205).", "20.
