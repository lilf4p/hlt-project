The applicant's counsel appealed against the decision. He invoked Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention and argued, in particular, that the district court had not considered the possibility of applying other preventive measures, such as release on bail, and had not taken into account the applicant's personal circumstances.

If necessary, the suspect or accused may be asked to give an undertaking to appear in court (\u043e\u0431\u044f\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043e \u044f\u0432\u043a\u0435) (Article 112 of the CCP).", "64. When deciding on a preventive measure, the competent authority is required to consider whether there are \u201csufficient grounds to believe\u201d that the accused would abscond during the investigation or trial, reoffend or obstruct the establishment of the truth (Article 97 of the CCP). It must also take into account the gravity of the charge, information on the accused's character, his or her profession, age, state of health, family status and other circumstances (Article 99 of the CCP).", "65. Detention may be ordered by a court if the charge carries a sentence of at least two years' imprisonment, provided that a less restrictive preventive measure cannot be applied (Article 108 \u00a7 1 of the CCP).", "66. After arrest the suspect is placed in custody \u201cduring the investigation\u201d. The period of detention during the investigation may be extended beyond six months only if the detainee is charged with a serious or particularly serious criminal offence. No extension beyond eighteen months is possible (Article 109 \u00a7\u00a7 1-3 of the CCP). The period of detention \u201cduring the investigation\u201d is calculated up to the day when the prosecutor sends the case to the trial court (Article 109 \u00a7 9 of the CCP).", "67. From the date the prosecutor forwards the case to the trial court, the defendant's detention is \u201cbefore the court\u201d (or \u201cduring the trial\u201d). The period of detention \u201cduring the trial\u201d is calculated up to the date the judgment is given. It may not normally exceed six months, but if the case concerns serious or particularly serious criminal offences, the trial court may approve one or more extensions of no longer than three months each (Article 255 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the CCP).", "68. If the suspect is being kept in detention pending trial, the trial court should schedule a preliminary hearing or a trial session within fourteen days from the date of the arrival of the case file from the prosecutor (Article 227 \u00a7 3 of the CCP).", "69. Section 22 of the Detention of Suspects Act (Federal Law no. 103FZ of 15 July 1995) provides that detainees should be given free food sufficient to maintain them in good health according to the standards established by the Government of the Russian Federation. Section 23 provides that detainees should be kept in conditions which satisfy sanitary and hygienic requirements. They should be provided with an individual sleeping place and given bedding, tableware and toiletries. Each inmate should have no less than four square metres of personal space in his or her cell.", "70. In their Ruling no. 4-P of 22 March 2005 the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation examined compatibility of certain provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure with the Constitution of the Russian Federation. The Constitutional Court found that the provisions concerning detention on remand upon transfer of a criminal case from a prosecutor to a trial court complied with the Constitution. However, their practical interpretation by the courts might have contradicted their constitutional meaning. The Ruling, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:", "\u201cThe second part of Article 22 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation provides that ... detention is permitted only on the basis of a court order ... Consequently, if the term of detention, as defined in the court order, expires, the court must decide on the extension of the detention, otherwise the accused person must be released ...", "These rules are common for all stages of criminal proceedings, and also cover the transition from one stage to another. ... The transition of the case to another stage does not automatically put an end to the preventive measure applied at previous stages.", "Therefore, when the case is transmitted by the prosecution to the trial court, the preventive measure applied at the pre-trial stage ... may continue to apply until the expiry of the term for which it has been set in the respective court decision [imposing it]...", "[Under Articles 227 and 228 of the Code of Criminal Procedure] a judge, after having received the criminal case concerning a detained defendant, should, within 14 days, set a hearing and establish \u201cwhether the preventive measure applied should be lifted or changed\u201d. This wording implies that the decision to detain the accused or extend his detention, taken at the pre-trial stage, may stand after the completion of the pre-trial investigation and transmittal of the case to the court, only until the end of the term for which the preventive measure has been set.", "The prosecution, in its turn, when approving the bill of indictment and transferring the case file to the court, should check whether the term of detention has not expired and whether it is sufficient to allow the judge to take a decision [on further detention of the accused pending trial]. If by the time of transfer of the case file to the court this term has expired, or if it appears to be insufficient to allow the judge to take a decision [on detention], the prosecutor, applying Articles 108 and 109 of the Code of Criminal Proceedings, [must] ask the court to extend the period of detention.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
