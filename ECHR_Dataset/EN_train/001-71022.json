UKRAINE", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant, MPP \u201cGolub\u201d, is a Ukrainian company that is registered in Ternopil. The company belongs to a private entrepreneur Mr Ivan Mikheyevich Golub, born in 1947 and residing in Ternopil.", "Since August 1995 the applicant had been making plans for the construction of a building containing 30 apartments on 0,25 hectares of land situated in the village of Zhovtneve, in the Kamyanets-Podilsky District of the Khmelnytsky region. It alleged that it received all the necessary construction permits and concluded an agreement with the PMK-35 company (a private company; \u201cPMK-35\u201d) for construction of this building. On 4 October 1996 the Ternopil Regional Arbitration Court declared null and void the construction contract of 9 August 1995 concluded between the applicant and the PMK-35 (PMK-35 was later reorganised into the construction company \u201cKamyanets Ltd.\u201d).", "The applicant alleges that from November 1996 it was allegedly persecuted by the Ukrainian authorities for its attempt to construct the building. Allegedly as a result of this persecution, PMK-35 demolished the foundation of the building it was supposed to construct.", "In 1996-2001 the applicant was a respondent and / or plaintiff in unsuccessful litigation before different courts about the building. It did not provide a full account of the litigation, and submitted that the only proceedings of which it complains were the proceedings initiated by it on 24 January 2002 before the Khmelnytsky Regional Commercial Court (case no. 6/661). These proceedings were instituted by the applicant against the PMK-35. However, on 14 February 2002 the Khmelnytsky Regional Commercial Court (\u201cKhmelnytsky Court\u201d), changed the respondent to the construction company \u201cKamyanets Ltd.\u201d (hereinafter the \u201crespondent\u201d) as the successor of PMK-35. The applicant sought restitutio in integrum. In particular, it claimed that, as the respondent had demolished the building\u2019s foundations constructed by PMK-35, it was obliged to rebuild it.", "On 20 August 2002 the Khmelnytsky Court rejected the applicant\u2019s claims as the events about which the applicant complained dated back to 1996. It therefore considered that they were lodged outside the three-year statutory time-limit for the introduction of civil claims, envisaged by Article 71 of the Civil Code.", "On 19 November 2002 the L\u2019viv Regional Commercial Court of Appeal rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal as being unsubstantiated and upheld the judgment of 20 August 2002.", "On 16 March 2003 the Higher Commercial Court quashed the aforementioned judgment of 20 August and the ruling of 19 November 2002 and remitted the case for a fresh consideration to the Khmelnytsky Court.", "On 5 March 2003 the Khmelnytsky Court ruled that it had jurisdiction over the applicant\u2019s case. In the course of the new proceedings before the Khmelnytsky Court, the applicant asked the court to extend the three-year limitation period for lodging its claims against the respondent. It also requested the court to suspend or temporarily terminate the proceedings in its case in view of the criminal investigation pending against the respondent\u2019s director. It lodged additional claims for compensation against the respondent. Initially, the applicant claimed that the damage amounted to UAH 21, 211.0. Later, it increased its claims to UAH 256,579.89.", "On 31 March, 15 April and 10 June 2003 the Khmelnytsky Court ordered the applicant to produce substantiation for the amounts it claimed in damages. It also required the applicant to pay the State tax (\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0438\u0442\u043e) for the introduction of its additional claims.", "On 23 June 2003 the Khmelnytsky Court rejected all of the applicant\u2019s motions and requests as unsubstantiated. As to the increase in the applicant\u2019s claims, the Khmelnytsky Court stated that the applicant had failed to substantiate or pay the State tax on them. It further decided that the applicant\u2019s claim should be rejected as it was lodged outside the statutory three-year limitation period (Article 71 of the Civil Code).", "On 11 December 2003 the Zhytomyr Regional Commercial Court of Appeal rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal as unsubstantiated, and upheld the judgment of 23 June 2003. In particular, it referred to Articles 71 and 80 of the Civil Code that envisaged a three-year limitation period for lodging claims for damages.", "The applicant appealed in cassation directly to the Higher Commercial Court (\u0412\u0438\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u0413\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0421\u0443\u0434 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438).", "On 21 January 2004 the Higher Commercial Court rejected the cassation appeal as it should have been lodged through the first instance or appeal court which had considered the case and where the case file was. The court referred to Article 109 of the Code of Commercial Procedure.", "On 4 February 2004 the applicant re-lodged its appeal in cassation.", "On 10 March 2004 the Higher Commercial Court rejected the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal as it was lodged outside the one-month time-limit allowed for the introduction of such appeals (Article 110 of the Code of Commercial Procedure). It also held that the incorrect introduction of the cassation appeal by the applicant does not suspend the one-month time-limit envisaged by Article 110 of the Code of Commercial Procedure. As a result, the cassation appeal was returned to the applicant.", "On 5 April 2004 the applicant re-lodged its appeal in cassation for the third time. It also requested renewal of the time-limit for the introduction of the cassation appeal.", "On 6 May 2004 the Higher Commercial Court rejected the applicant\u2019s request to extend the time-limit as unsubstantiated. It also stated, inter alia, that the time-limit for lodging an appeal in cassation was 12 January 2004, but the applicant had lodged its appeal on 5 April 2004, i.e. out of time. Furthermore, the Higher Commercial Court reiterated that, under Article 110 of the Code of Commercial Procedure, the refusals of 21 January and 10 March 2004 to allow the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal had no influence on the one-month time-limit for the introduction of an appeal with the Higher Commercial Court. Moreover, Article 109 of the Code of Commercial Procedure clearly states that cassation appeals with the Higher Commercial Court had to be addressed to it through the court of first instance or the court of appeal. As a result, the cassation appeal and the court fees were returned to the applicant.", "On 2 June and 20 July 2004 the Higher Commercial Court informed the applicant, by letters, that its complaints about the partiality and lack of independence of the judges who rejected the applicant\u2019s cassation appeals were unsubstantiated. They also informed the applicant that it could appeal in cassation against the rulings of the Higher Commercial Court to the Supreme Court.", "On 31 May 2004 the applicant lodged a cassation appeal against the ruling of 6 May 2004 of the Higher Commercial Court with the Supreme Court (\u0412\u0435\u0440\u0445\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0421\u0443\u0434 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438).", "On 16 September 2004 the Supreme Court refused to initiate cassation proceedings.", "B.
