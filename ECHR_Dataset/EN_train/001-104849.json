At about 2 a.m. on 10 March 2003 about ten men in camouflage uniforms burst into the applicants\u2019 bedroom. All of the intruders wore masks, were armed with sub-machine guns and spoke unaccented Russian. The intruders blinded the applicants with their flashlights. When the first applicant asked them why they were there, they ordered her in Russian to lie on the floor and pushed her to the ground. One of the intruders stepped on her back, pressed his gun against her neck and told her to remain quiet. At the same time several other armed men pushed the second applicant out of bed, tied his hands and asked him where he kept his weapons. He replied that there were no weapons in the house and they then ordered him to be silent. One of the armed men pressed his gun against the second applicant\u2019s head. While the applicants stayed on the ground, several intruders went into another room where Isa Maayev was sleeping. After a while the armed men in the applicants\u2019 bedroom ordered the applicants not to move and left the room.", "9. The first applicant immediately ran to the window and saw four other men in the courtyard. One of them punctured the tyres of the applicants\u2019 car. Another man broke the lamp above the entrance to the house. All of the men then left the courtyard. The first applicant followed them outside and saw that they had turned right into Mayakovskogo Street. She then heard the noise of a vehicle and a sound as if someone was being thrown into it. When she returned home she realised that the armed men had taken Isa Maayev away and she started crying and shouting for help.", "10. According to a written statement by M.K., enclosed by the applicants, on the night of 10 March 2003 she felt unwell and went outside. She heard shouting coming from the applicants\u2019 house.

According to a written statement by A.M., at about 2 a.m. on 10 March 2003 she was returning home from her late shift at a bakery where she worked at the time. On her way home she saw several UAZ vehicles parked at the corner of Mayakovskogo and Bolnichnaya streets, and a number of camouflaged men whom she identified as servicemen. The servicemen were armed and some of them were masked. They were standing one metre apart from each other and kept themselves in formation. She quickly passed by them without being stopped (despite the curfew) and initially went in the direction of her home, but then heard the first applicant\u2019s screaming and turned back to go to the applicants\u2019 house. She found the first applicant and M.K. there.
