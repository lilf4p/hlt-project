On 25 May 2006, in response, the Cracow Regional Administrative Court delivered a judgment. It ordered the Sucha Beskidzka District Inspector of Construction Supervision to take all the necessary measures with a view to enforcing the decision of 29 September 1997, as upheld by the decision of 4 December 1997, within one month of the date on which it received the case file.", "14.
