The applicant was born in 1948. She lives in the village of Assinovskaya, in the Chechen Republic. The applicant is the mother of Luiza Mutayeva, born in 1984.", "6. The applicant, with her husband and two daughters, Luiza and Madina, lived at 60 Bershchanskaya Street in the village of Assinovskaya, in the Achkhoy-Martanovskiy district (in the submitted documents the district is also referred to as Sunzhenskiy district), in the Chechen Republic. Their house was located near a local hospital. At the material time the village was under the firm control of the federal forces, which maintained manned checkpoints at the entry and exit points to and from the village.", "7. In the night of 19 January 2004 (in the submitted documents the date is also referred to as 9 January 2004) the family was sleeping in their house at the above address.", "8. At about 2.30 a.m. on 19 January 2004 the applicant and her family members were woken up by someone knocking at the entrance door. The applicant approached the door and asked in Chechen: \u201cWho is it?\u201d The answer was given in Russian: \u201cPassport check\u201d. When the applicant wondered why the passport check was being conducted so late at night, she was told: \u201cYou better open the door; we have an order!\u201d The applicant opened the door and fifteen to twenty armed men in camouflage uniforms without insignia entered the house. All but five or six of the intruders were wearing masks. The applicant and her relatives noticed that the men without masks were of Slavic appearance. The intruders spoke unaccented Russian. The applicant inferred that they were Russian servicemen.", "9. The servicemen asked the applicant whether there were any men in the house. The only man in the household was the applicant's husband, a disabled person with one leg. The servicemen checked the family's passports and returned them to the applicant. Then the unmasked servicemen said to their colleagues that they should leave the applicant's house as no men were to be found there. However, one of the masked servicemen told them that they should search the house. The servicemen searched the house, turning everything upside down. It appears that they did not find anything of interest to them other than a few video cassettes which they took away.", "10. Having searched the house, the servicemen ordered the applicant's daughters, Luiza and Madina, to put on warm clothing as they were being taken to the vehicles for questioning. The applicant's younger daughter, fifteen-year old Madina, started crying. One of the masked servicemen told her: \u201cDo not be afraid; we will just question you and will let you go. I promise that nothing will happen to you.\u201d Before leaving the house, Luiza Mutayeva insisted that she should be the only one to go for questioning. The servicemen let Madina stay in the house; they took Luiza outside to the vehicles.", "11. The applicant managed to run outside and saw that Luiza Mutayeva was handcuffed and was standing next to a white GAZ minivan. Beside the minivan the applicant saw a white VAZ-2107, two grey UAZ vehicles, two military all-terrain UAZ vehicles (\u201c\u0442\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043a\u0430\u201d) and a grey VAZ-2109 vehicle, which were all parked around the applicant's house. The vehicles did not have number plates. According to the applicant, further vehicles belonging to the intruders were parked near her house but she was unable to recall their models or their colour. The applicant shouted at the servicemen and asked them to take her for questioning with her daughter. In response they pushed her away. Luiza Mutayeva was put into the GAZ minivan and the intruders drove away.", "12. A number of people witnessed the abduction of Luiza Mutayeva. In particular, M.K., who was a patient in the hospital across the street, was woken up by shouting coming from the applicant's courtyard and rushed outside. She saw that the applicant's house was surrounded by armed men in masks and camouflage uniforms. The men did not allow her to approach and pushed her back into the hospital. While they were doing so, she saw them take Luiza Mutayeva away.", "13. At about 3 a.m. on 19 January 2004 the applicant's neighbours, B.M. and S.B., were woken up by the noise of armoured vehicles and the applicant's shouting and saw armoured and other vehicles stationed at the street. B.M. and S.B. were afraid to approach the persons in camouflage uniforms and masks because they were armed. Another neighbour, Yu.D., who was woken up by a woman's shouting at about 3 a.m. on 19 January 2004, got outside and saw armoured and other vehicles parked on the street at the applicant's house; women at the entry gate to the applicant's house were shouting at several men wearing camouflage uniforms and masks. Afraid of the camouflaged men because of their weapons, Yu.D. returned home. When it was quiet he went to see the applicant and learnt from her that Luiza Mutayeva had been kidnapped.", "14. The applicant has had no news of Luiza Mutayeva since 19 January 2004.", "15. The description of the events above is based on the applicant's application form and written statements by M.K., B.M., S.B. and Yu.D., made on 19 October 2005.", "16. The Government submitted that on 19 January 2004 Luiza Mutayeva had been abducted by unidentified persons.", "17. On the morning of 19 January 2004 the applicant complained about her daughter's abduction to a number of law-enforcement agencies in Achkhoy-Martan. In particular, she complained to the Achkhoy-Martan District Department of the Interior (the ROVD), to a local department of the Federal Security Service (the FSB) and the security service of the Chechen President. The authorities denied having any information about the whereabouts of the applicant's daughter. However, unspecified officers from the security service of the Chechen President suggested to the applicant that her daughter had most likely been abducted by officers of the FSB Special Forces from Khankala, Chechnya.", "18. The applicant also complained about the abduction of Luiza Mutayeva to T., head of the local administration. The latter also suggested that her daughter had been probably taken to Khankala.", "19. Every day between 19 and 26 January 2004 the applicant went in person to a number of State authorities in Achkhoy-Martan, trying to obtain information concerning her daughter's whereabouts. It appears that her attempts produced no results.", "20. The applicant also contacted, both in person and in writing, various official bodies, such as the Chechen administration, military commanders' offices and prosecutors' offices at different levels, describing in detail the circumstances of Luiza Mutayeva's abduction and asking for help in establishing her whereabouts. The applicant retained copies of a number of those letters and submitted them to the Court. An official investigation was opened by the local prosecutor's office. The relevant information is summarised below.", "21. On 27 April 2004 the prosecutor's office of the Achkhoy-Martanovskiy district (\u201cthe district prosecutor's office\u201d) instituted an investigation into the abduction of Luiza Mutayeva under Article 126 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code (aggravated kidnapping). The case file was given number 49516. It does not appear that the applicant was informed about the decision.", "22. By a decision of 28 April 2004 the district prosecutor's office granted the applicant victim status in connection with criminal case no. 49516. The decision stated, among other things, that at about 2.30 a.m. on 19 January 2004 about fifteen unidentified armed men in camouflage uniforms and masks had arrived at the applicant's home at 60 Bershchanskaya Street in a GAZ minivan, a UAZ vehicle, two military all-terrain UAZ vehicles (\u201c\u0442\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043a\u0430\u201d), a VAZ-2109 and a VAZ-2107 and had taken Luiza Mutayeva to an unknown destination. The applicant was accordingly provided with a copy of the decision.", "23. On 27 August 2004 the district prosecutor's office informed the applicant that on that date the investigation in criminal case no. 49516 had been suspended for failure to identify the perpetrators; the operational and search measures aimed at solving the crime were under way.", "24. On 14 May 2005 the applicant's representatives from SRJI wrote to the district prosecutor's office, complaining about the lack of information concerning the investigation.

On 20 July 2005 the applicant's representatives wrote to the republican prosecutor's office and to the Prosecutor General's office. Referring to the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, they pointed out that the authorities' letter of 21 June 2005 had failed to provide the requested information or any plausible explanations for the authorities' failure to provide the applicant with copies of basic investigative decisions. The applicant's representatives repeated their request for information about the progress of the investigation and copies of those decisions.", "27.

Subsequently, several armed men in camouflage uniforms and masks burst into the house. They had asked the applicant in Russian where the men were.
