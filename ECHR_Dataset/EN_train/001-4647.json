The reasons for this decision read:", "\u201c[The applicant] was granted \u201cveteran status\u201d by virtue of the decisions issued by the Union of Fighters for Democracy and Liberty on the basis of declarations [of the relevant military authorities], stating that he had taken part in the armed struggle to consolidate the people\u2019s power and had served in the allied army. [He was later granted such a status] on the basis of a declaration issued by the Ministry of the Interior on 15 July 1976, stating that, from 15 February 1947 to 31 December 1956, he had been an officer of the former Ministry of Public Security and the former Committee for Public Security and that, from 15 February 1947 to 31 December 1947, he had taken part in armed fighting with [the so-called] reactionary underground resistance forces.", "Under Section 21 \u00a7 2 (4) (a) of the Law of 24 January 1991 cited above anyone who has served in organs of the public security service shall not acquire \u201cveteran status\u201d [in any circumstances and for whatever other reasons].", "Under Section 25 \u00a7 2 read together with Section 21 \u00a7 2 (4) (a) of the Law, anyone who has served in organs of the public security service shall be divested of such [previously acquired] status.", "That being so, the present decision is justified.\u201d", "On 23 May 1994 the applicant filed an appeal with the Supreme Administrative Court (Naczelny S\u0105d Administracyjny), submitting that the above-mentioned decision had been issued in breach of the rule of law and based on insufficient evidence. He maintained that he had been divested of his status of veteran on the basis of a single circumstance, namely, that he had served in the organs of the public security service, even though he had never committed any condemnable, illegal or immoral act. He stressed that he had never taken part in armed fighting with the underground resistance forces but had acquired \u201cveteran status\u201d for his fight for independence of Poland and against the Nazis. Finally, the applicant contested the accuracy of the certificates issued by the Union of Fighters for Liberty and Democracy, stating that they were inaccurate.", "On 21 February 1996 the Supreme Administrative Court held a hearing in the applicant\u2019s case. On the same day the court gave judgment dismissing the appeal. It held that, under Sections 21 and 25 of the Law of 24 January 1991 on Veterans and Other Victims of War and Post-war Repression, no one who had previously served, or been employed in, the organs of the public security service could receive or retain the status of veteran, whatever his merits. In the instant case, it was clear that the applicant had been an officer of the former Ministry of the Public Security and the former Committee for Public Security; this fact was, in itself, sufficient under the terms of the Law of 24 January 1991 to justify the decision to divest him of his previously acquired status. The impugned decision had therefore been taken in conformity with the relevant provisions of the substantive law.", "B. Relevant domestic law", "The Law of 24 January 1991 on Veterans and Other Victims of War and Post-War Repression repealed the Law of 26 May 1982 on the Special Status of Veterans (Ustawa o szczeg\u00f3lnych uprawnieniach kombatant\u00f3w).", "It was enacted in order to regulate the system of granting special privileges attached to the so-called \u201cveteran status\u201d and, partly, intended to condemn the political role played by the former Communist machinery (in particular, the so-called \u201cPublic Security Service\u201d, \u201caparat bezpiecze\u0144stwa publicznego\u201d) in establishing the Communist regime, implementing a Stalinist policy and repressing political opposition to the system. Considering that persons having served in the former organs of public security, whose task it had been, inter alia, to combat and eliminate all forms of democratic opposition, did not deserve the special privileges attached to \u201cveteran status\u201d, the legislator decided that they should be unconditionally deprived of that status.", "The \u201cPublic Security Service\u201d consisted of State organs, comprising the political police and special armed forces. It was patterned after the NKVD and the KGB and established (under the supervision of the NKVD) on 21 July 1944 with a view to securing Communist rule and combating, suppressing and eliminating groups of political opposition, including the post-war underground resistance against Communism and the Polish Church. In the 1950s these organs were in charge of prisons and labour camps; at that time, they were also competent to conduct criminal investigations under the rules of criminal procedure. Depending on the political circumstances, they were called by various names: \u201cDepartment of Public Security\u201d (Resort Bezpiecze\u0144stwa Publicznego), subsequently renamed \u201cMinistry of Public Security\u201d (Ministerstwo Bezpiecze\u0144stwa Publicznego) (July 1944-December 1954); \u201cCommittee for Public Security\u201d (Komitet do Spraw Bezpiecze\u0144stwa Publicznego) (1954-1956); and \u201cSecurity Service\u201d (S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa), as a special department of the Ministry of the Interior (1956-1990; dissolved after the collapse of Communism).", "The Law of 24 January 1991 also established a new public organ, the Office for Veterans and Persecuted Persons, which is competent to grant \u201cveteran status\u201d and has the duty to verify whether persons who have previously acquired such status meet the new statutory criteria.", "Section 21 \u00a7 2 (4) (a) of the 1991 Law, as applicable at the relevant time, provided as follows:", "\u201c2.

(4) shall be divested of such previously acquired status.\u201d", "Under the provisions of both the repealed Law of 26 May 1982 and the new Law of 24 January 1991 (Sections 12-20), veterans were (and still are) entitled to privileged status in comparison to other employees or retired persons; this status included, for example: a lower age of retirement; a particularly favourable method for calculating periods of employment; and various financial benefits paid in addition to the normal pension calculated in accordance with the rules of the general social insurance system.", "At the time when the applicant was divested of his \u201cveteran status\u201d, a retired veteran was, inter alia, entitled to a so-called \u201cveteran benefit\u201d equal to 10% of the average monthly salary in the public sector; a fare discount of 50% on travel by municipal transport, rail and public long-distance buses; a special allowance covering 50% of such household expenses as electricity, gas and heating; and a discount of 50% on motor-vehicle insurance.", "The loss of \u201cveteran status\u201d did (and does) not, however, entail any legal or practical consequences in respect of the right to receive a normal pension since, under Section 26 of the Law of 24 January 1991, a person divested of that status is still entitled to his pension calculated under the rules applicable within the general social insurance scheme."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
