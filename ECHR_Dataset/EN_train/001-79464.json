RUSSIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Civil proceedings;Enforcement proceedings;Article 6-1 - Access to court);Violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Protection of property", "JUDGES": "Loukis Loucaides", "TEXT": ["6. The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in the town of Bataysk of the Rostov Region.", "7. In 1986 the applicant took part in the emergency operation at the Chernobyl nuclear plant. As a result he suffered from extensive exposure to radioactive emissions. The applicant underwent medical examinations which established the link between his poor health and his involvement in the Chernobyl events. He was consequently granted status of a disabled person and awarded a monthly pension and a special allowance from the State, to be adjusted once a year in line with the minimum subsistence amount (\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0443\u043c\u0430).", "8. At a certain moment in 2001 the social security authorities ceased to increase regularly the amounts of pension and allowance, paid to the applicant in connection with his disability. Instead, he started to receive his pension in a fixed amount (2,851 Roubles), which was less than he expected. Presuming that this practice was illegal, the applicant brought proceedings against the regional social security office (\u201cthe defendant\u201d) claiming the increase of the monthly allowance and pension in line with the increase of the minimum subsistence amount during the relevant period.", "9. On 21 January 2003 the Bataysk Town Court of the Rostov Region (\u201cthe Town Court\u201d) rendered a judgment ordering the increase of the monthly allowance due to the applicant in line with the increase of the minimal subsistence amount in the Rostov region. In re-calculating the amount of the applicant's pension the court applied the multiplier of 1.92 based on the data provided by the regional committee on statistics. As a result, the monthly pension of the applicant increased to 5,474.5 Roubles. The court ordered the defendant to pay the applicant the recalculated amount as from 1 January 2002 less the sums already paid.", "10. The defendant appealed challenging, among other things, the multiplier of 1.92 applied by the first-instance court.", "11. On 16 April 2003 the Rostov Regional Court (\u201cthe Regional Court\u201d) upheld the judgment of 21 January 2003 in full. The enforcement proceedings were opened.", "12. On 13 May 2003 the defendant appealed to the Regional Court by way of supervisory review seeking to quash the judgment of 21 January 2003, as upheld on 16 Aril 2003.", "13. On 30 June 2003 the judge rapporteur refused to initiate the supervisory review proceedings and to remit the case for examination on the merits to the Presidium of the Rostov Regional Court (\u201cthe Presidium\u201d).", "14. On 14 July 2003 the defendant complained to the President of the Regional Court about the judgment of 21 January 2003, as upheld on appeal, and the judge rapporteur's decision of 30 June 2003 rejecting their previous application for supervisory review. They also requested that the enforcement proceedings be suspended pending the examination of the new supervisory review appeal.", "15. On 6 August 2003 a judge of the Regional Court requested the case-file from the court of first instance. On 24 October 2003 judge B. of the Regional Court initiated the review of the judgment of 21 January 2003, as upheld on 16 April 2003. The decision of 24 October 2003 referred in detail to the arguments adduced by the defendant but offered no explanation as to the grounds for overruling the judge rapporteur's decision of 30 June 2003. The case was transferred to the Presidium for the examination on the merits.", "16. On 4 November 2003 the applicant was informed about the date and venue of the hearing of his case by the Presidium.", "17. On 4 December 2003 the Presidium quashed the judgment of 21 January 2003, as upheld on appeal, stating that the first instance court's calculation of the minimum subsistence amount, based on the multiplier of 1.92, had been insufficiently supported by evidence. The Presidium also noted that the first instance court had misinterpreted the domestic law. The case was remitted to the first instance court for a fresh examination.", "18. On 22 April 2004 the Town Court examined the case anew. In the course of the proceedings the court established that the allowance should have been multiplied by 1.25 in 2002 and by 1.26 for 2003. The applicant maintained that he accepted that multiplier.", "19. As a result, the court held that the amount of pension due to the applicant for 2002 was 3,125 Roubles per month. In 2003 the pension of the applicant should have amounted to 3,937.5 Roubles per month. The court ordered the social security authorities to compensate the applicant for previous underpayments and, starting from January 2004, pay him 4,567.5 Roubles monthly, with subsequent readjustment.", "20. The judgment of the Town Court was not appealed against and became final.", "21. On 1 February 2003 the Code of Civil Procedure of the Russian Federation (\u201cthe CCivP\u201d) entered into force introducing, in particular, an amended system of supervisory review.", "22. The CCivP, in the relevant part, provides as follows:", "\u201c1.
