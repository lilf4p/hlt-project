On 30 June 2000 the applicant's husband filed a complaint with the police alleging that the applicant had beaten and wounded him on 25 June 2000.", "7. On 3 July 2000 the police department in Ko\u0161ice issued a decision by which it dropped the case on the ground that the applicant's husband did not agree to criminal proceedings being brought against her. The decision stated that although the police \u201cinvestigation\u201d had established that the applicant had committed a criminal offence, criminal prosecution was barred as the victim, the applicant's husband, had not given his consent as required under Article 163 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The applicant was not notified of this decision, nor is there any evidence in the case file that she was questioned or otherwise made aware of her husband's complaint.", "8.

On 16 July 2002 the applicant informed the competent police department in Ko\u0161ice that the text of its decision violated her right to be presumed innocent.

On 9 August 2002 the director of the police department replied to the applicant, stating that the above decision had been given in accordance with the relevant law.", "11. In a letter of 17 July 2002 the applicant requested that the Ko\u0161ice II District Prosecutor's Office quash the police decision of 3 July 2000. On 26 August 2002 the applicant was informed that the decision was not contrary to constitutional principles. The letter stated, in particular, that the task of the police had been to determine whether a justified reason existed to consider that a particular person had committed the offence in issue.

In rejecting the applicant's complaint as out of time, the Constitutional Court took 3 July 2000, the date on which the police decision was issued, as the key date.", "14.
