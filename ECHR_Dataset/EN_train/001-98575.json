The fifth applicant has lodged the application on his own behalf and on behalf of his brothers, Mr Erdo\u011fan \u00c7akir and Mr Mustafa \u00c7akir.

The United Nations Peace Force advised Turkish-Cypriot residents, through loudspeakers, to remain in their houses and the \u00c7akir family, including the applicants and Erdo\u011fan and Mustafa \u00c7akir, gathered in the house of Erdo\u011fan \u00c7akir.

Everyone in the house was in civilian clothes and unarmed. While they were in the house, members of the Greek-Cypriot forces fired at the door with automatic weapons. They subsequently kicked the door open while continuing to fire, shooting and wounding Erdo\u011fan \u00c7akir, who was close to the door. Mustafa \u00c7akir then entered from the adjacent room with his hands on his head pleading with the assailants not to shoot as there were women and children among them. He was taken outside and shot with an automatic weapon. He died immediately. The dead and wounded were taken outside while the women and children were kicked, humiliated, abused and struck with rifle butts before being pushed out of the house. Erdo\u011fan \u00c7akir, who was still alive at the time not having received fatal wounds, was taken away by the Greek-Cypriot forces, together with the dead body of Mustafa \u00c7akir.", "All the remaining Turkish Cypriots were taken from their houses to the football pitch in town.
