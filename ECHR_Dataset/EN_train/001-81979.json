However, in 1985 a medical commission restored him into the \u201csecond category\u201d, having found that the remaining effects of the injury could not justify the attribution of the \u201cfirst category\u201d. The applicant, however, ceased collecting wild produce allegedly due to deterioration of his health condition.", "In January 1984 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against the ATU seeking compensation for his medical expenses and the loss of earnings.", "On 29 January 1985 the Kyivsky District Court of Simferopil (\u201cthe District Court\u201d; \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0434 \u043c. \u0421\u0438\u043c\u0444\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044f) allowed the applicant\u2019s claims in part.

Subsequently, the court assumed first instance jurisdiction over the case.", "On 29 June 1999 the Supreme Court of the Crimea rejected the applicant\u2019s claims. It found that part of them had been finally adjudicated in other proceedings brought in 1984 and 1990 (see sections B and C above). As regards the other claims, the court found no causal link between the effects of the accident on the applicant\u2019s health and the expenses claimed. It further dismissed the claim for loss of earnings as unsubstantiated, since the applicant had subsisted on disability pension, while his produce collecting activities could not be regarded as \u201cearnings\u201d.", "On 27 October 1999 the Supreme Court of Ukraine quashed the judgment of 29 June 1999 and remitted the case for a fresh consideration. It instructed the trial court to assess the degree of work fitness lost by the applicant as a result of the accident, without regard to his prior disability, and to make an additional investigation into the importance of the produce collection as a source of the applicant\u2019s income.", "On 18 April 2001 the Supreme Court of the Crimea, relying on a new medical expert opinion, decided that the injury resulting from the accident was sufficient to entitle the applicant to a \u201cthird category invalidity\u201d (\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044f \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u0430 \u0456\u043d\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0456\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0456) and that the applicant\u2019s produce collecting activities could qualify as \u201clost earnings\u201d. Therefore, the court awarded the applicant 1,128 hryvnyas in compensation. The applicant appealed, considering this sum insufficient.", "On 20 June 2001 the Supreme Court of Ukraine quashed this judgment and remitted the case for a fresh consideration, referring to several contradictions in the opinions of medical experts as to the applicant\u2019s loss of work fitness and challenging the method of calculating the award.", "On 29 May 2002 the Crimean Court of Appeal (formerly the Supreme Court of the Crimea) rejected the applicant\u2019s claims as unsubstantiated. The applicant appealed in cassation.", "On 25 July 2002 the court suspended the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal and proposed that he rectify its formal shortcomings. On 2 September 2002 the court returned the appeal as \u201cnot lodged\u201d on account of the applicant\u2019s failure to rectify the above shortcomings.
