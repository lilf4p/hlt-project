Romania [GC], no. 28114/95, \u00a7 1, ECHR 1999-VI, and also Ahmet Sad\u0131k v.

It held that disc infection was a foreseeable complication of hernia operations, which had been treated appropriately in the applicant\u2019s case by his doctor. It concluded that the applicant\u2019s current health problems had not arisen from the surgery in question and therefore determined that no fault could be attributed to the doctor or the hospital.", "On 5 May 2005 the Court of Cassation rejected the applicant\u2019s request for leave to appeal on the grounds that the amount in dispute was less than the minimum amount (TRL 1,000,000,000,000) required under the recently amended legislation for an appeal to be lodged with the Court of Cassation. That being so, the applicant\u2019s request for leave to appeal had to be declared inadmissible in accordance with Article 427 of the Code of Civil Procedure as amended by Law No. 5219.", "On 24 October 2005 the Court of Cassation rejected a request for rectification brought by the applicant, as the sum in dispute in the matter also did not exceed the required threshold (TRL 6,000,000,000,000) for rectification pursuant to the aforementioned law."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
