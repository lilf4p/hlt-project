It was patterned on the NKVD (\u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0430\u0442 \u0432\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u043b/Narodnyy Komissariat Vnutrennikh Del, i.e. the Soviet People\u2019s Commissariat for Internal Affairs) and the KGB (\u041a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442 \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438/Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti, i.e. the Committee for State Security) and established (under the supervision of the NKVD) in 1944 with a view to securing Communist rule and combating, suppressing and eliminating groups of political opposition, including the post-war underground resistance against Communism and the Polish Church. In the 1950s these organs were in charge of prisons and labour camps; at that time, they were also competent to conduct criminal investigations under the rules of criminal procedure (see Domalewski v. Poland (dec.), no. 4610/97, ECHR 1999-V).", "From 1956 onwards, when the level and nature of repression changed, their tasks involved in the protection of the communist system included, among other things, the control and infiltration of Polish society secured by its own members and through a system of paid or unpaid informers and secret collaborators, denunciation, monitoring of persons in, or cooperating with, the opposition, political opponents, priests and other persons suspected of being in any way associated with anti-communist ideas or critical of the communist party\u2019s programme, its role and members", "3. The general information concerning the public security service published on the official website of the Institute of the National Remembrance - Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation (Instytut Pami\u0119ci Narodowej \u2013 Komisja \u015acigania Zbrodni przeciwko Narodowi Polskiemu \u2013 \u201cthe IPN\u201d) reads, in so far as relevant, as follows:", "\u201cSince 1944 until 1990 the functionaries of the security services constituted \u201cthe armed arm of the communist party\u201d. The main goal of the services was to protect the communists from society and to eliminate opposition.", "...", "First, the Security Services operated within the Ministry of Public Security which was created in summer 1944. The executive staff of the Ministry had been trained in NKVD school in Kuibyshev (USSR). Apart from the central office, the \u2018soviet advisers\u2019 were sent to all newly-created regional Offices of Public Security throughout Poland.", "The official activity of the Ministry of Public Security started on 1 January 1945 and its wide range of power was not limited by law. The Ministry focused on achieving goals set by the Polish Workers\u2019 Party (PPR) [Polska Partia Robotnicza] and later the Polish United Workers\u2019 Party (PZPR) [Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza]. At the peak of its expansion in 1953 there were 33,000 functionaries working within the ministry structures. Additionally, a network of 73,000 informers (in the mid 1950s) collaborated with the ministry. The informers were recruited by means of brutal intimidation or promises of financial gain. Nevertheless, some of the informers, especially members of the communist party, volunteered for the work.", "Offices of Public Security and their informants kept under surveillance the political parties, national and local public administration, social and religious organisations, factory workers and, in general, social attitudes. One third of adult Poles were registered in the ministry\u2019s files because they constituted \u2018a dubious element\u2019.", "In 1954 the Ministry of Public Security was replaced by the Ministry of Interior Affairs (MSW) and the Committee of Public Security Affairs. In 1956 the Committee was disbanded and its competences and staff transferred to the Ministry of [the] Interior ....", "The Security Service (SB) operated in Poland between 1956 and 1990. The fall of the communist system in Poland in 1989 brought an end to the existence of this political police and organ of terror, which was hostile to Polish society throughout its existence. ...\u201d", "4. The Security Service operated through the following main structures: Department I (for intelligence), Department II (for counter-intelligence); Department III (for anti-State activities against the country in the sphere of ideology, culture and education; the tasks involved, inter alia, infiltration of artistic, intellectual, academic, journalist and similar circles, finding secret collaborators within those groups as well as monitoring of targeted persons), Department IV (church and religious associations; the tasks involved infiltration of targeted groups, monitoring etc.), Department V (for protection of industry and anti-State activities in industry and within workers unions and circles), the Office of Foreign Passports (Biuro Paszport\u00f3w), the so-called Bureau \"A\" (cipher); Bureau \"B\" (observation) and Bureau \"W\" (oversight of correspondence), Bureau \u201cT\u201d (operational techniques). The subordinate units at local level had departments organised in the same way. In 1983-1990 they were organised in regional (wojew\u00f3dzkie) and district (rejonowe) offices for internal affairs (urz\u0119dy spraw wewn\u0119trznych).", "5. Following the fall of Communism in Poland, the Security Service was dissolved by virtue of the law of 6 Apri1 1990 on the Office for State Protection (ustawa o Urz\u0119dzie Ochrony Pa\u0144stwa) (\u201cthe 1990 Act\u201d), a new body responsible for intelligence and counter-intelligence. At that time the Security Service comprised around 30,000 persons, including some 24,000 functionaries. They could be re-employed by the Office for State Protection on condition that they successfully passed a vetting procedure, which some 14,000 officers underwent. 10,439 persons were eventually found suitable for re-employment and 3,595 were vetted negatively and not retained (see also paragraphs 57-62 below).", "6. On 23 January 2009 Parliament enacted the Act on amendments to the law on old-age pensions of professional soldiers and their families and to the law on old-age pensions of functionaries of the police, the Internal Security Agency, the Intelligence Agency, the Military Counter-Intelligence Service the Military Intelligence Service, the Central Anti-Corruption Bureau, the Border Guard, the Government Protection Bureau, the State Fire Service, the Prison Service and their families (ustawa o zmianie ustawy o zaopatrzeniu emerytalnym \u017co\u0142nierzy zawodowych oraz ich rodzin oraz ustawy o zaopatrzeniu emerytalnym funkcjonariuszy Policji, Agencji Bezpiecze\u0144stwa Wewn\u0119trznego, Agencji Wywiadu, S\u0142u\u017cby Kontrwywiadu Wojskowego, S\u0142u\u017cby Wywiadu Wojskowego, Centralnego Biura Antykorupcyjnego, Stra\u017cy Granicznej, Biura Ochrony Rz\u0105du, Pa\u0144stwowej Stra\u017cy Po\u017carnej i S\u0142u\u017cby Wi\u0119ziennej oraz ich rodzin \u2013 \u201cthe 2009 Act\u201d). The 2009 Act, which entered into force on 16 March 2009, introduced new rules for the calculation of the pensions of former functionaries of the State security service into the law of 18 February 1994 on old-age pensions of functionaries of the police, the Internal Security Agency, the Intelligence Agency, the Military Counter-Intelligence Service, the Military Intelligence Service, the Central Anti-Corruption Bureau, the Border Guard, the Government Protection Bureau, the State Fire Service, the Prison Service and their families (ustawa o zaopatrzeniu emerytalnym funkcjonariuszy Policji, Agencji Bezpiecze\u0144stwa Wewn\u0119trznego, Agencji Wywiadu, S\u0142u\u017cby Kontrwywiadu Wojskowego, S\u0142u\u017cby Wywiadu Wojskowego, Centralnego Biura Antykorupcyjnego, Stra\u017cy Granicznej, Biura Ochrony Rz\u0105du, Pa\u0144stwowej Stra\u017cy Po\u017carnej i S\u0142u\u017cby Wi\u0119ziennej oraz ich rodzin \u2013\u201cthe 1994 Act\u201d).

The scope and forms of social security shall be specified by statute.\u201d", "85. On 23 February 2009 a group of members of Parliament belonging mostly to the Democratic Left Alliance (Sojusz Lewicy Demokratycznej) asked the Constitutional Court (Trybuna\u0142 Konstytucyjny) to declare that the 2009 Act was in its entirety incompatible with Articles 2, 10, 31 \u00a7 3 and 32 of the Constitution. Subsequently, in their pleading of 30 August 2009, they also relied on Articles 18, 30, 42, 45 and 67 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.", "86. The main thrust of the very extensive arguments submitted in support of the application, which were made both in writing and at an oral hearing can be summarised as follows.", "1) The 2009 Act, drastically reducing the pensions of former functionaries, had deprived some of them of the possibility of living with dignity and consequently was contrary to the principle of respect for human dignity laid down in Article 30 of the Constitution. At the same time, it infringed the very essence of the right to social security set forth in Article 67 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.", "2) All the functionaries of the State security service who had been reemployed after 1990 had undergone a vetting procedure under the 1990 Resolution and had been considered fit for service in the democratic Republic of Poland. They had obtained their pension rights lawfully under the 1994 Act, a law enacted by independent, democratic Poland. The 2009 Act extinguished their rights acquired under a democratic system in an arbitrary fashion and unjustifiably, in breach of the principle of the protection of acquired rights laid down in Article 2 of the Constitution.", "3) Vetting and re-employing former functionaries of the State security service constituted a special declaration, made on behalf of the Republic of Poland by the State authorities, that they would be treated on an equal basis with all functionaries of services created after 1990. In turn, the functionaries, under oath, took upon themselves an obligation to serve the nation faithfully and protect the legal order established by the Constitution, and the security of the State and its citizens. They fulfilled their duties; otherwise, they would not have been granted their pensions.", "The 2009 Act, enacted some twenty years later, amounted to a breach of this special pact and, consequently, violated the principle of the citizens\u2019 confidence in the State and the laws made by it laid down in Article 2 of the Constitution.", "4) The 2009 Act was based on the rule of collective responsibility and presumption of guilt on the part of former functionaries of the State security service. It applied an automatic restriction of pension rights of all former State security service functionaries, notwithstanding their actual individual conduct and the nature of the duties they had performed in the past. As a result, the 2009 Act, drastically lowering the coefficient used for the determination of their pensions, constituted a form of unjustified repression against positively vetted and re-employed functionaries.", "This was tantamount to considering service before 1990 a noncontributory period. In particular, the legislature did not put functionaries on an equal footing with other persons receiving pensions under the general social security scheme, where a coefficient of 1.3% applies, which could give the deceptive appearance of a \u201cwithdrawal of privileges\u201d, but placed them in a decisively more disadvantageous position. This constituted a breach of the principle of social justice laid down in Article 2 of the Constitution.", "5) The legislature also violated the principle of separation and balance of powers laid down in Article 10 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution. It imposed collective punishment on all persons who had been functionaries of the State security service before 1990. The mere fact of service in those authorities was decisive. No legal procedure was available to review the legality, justification, adequacy and proportionality of the sanction imposed. For all practical purposes, the legislature took over the role of the courts of law. In consequence, functionaries were punished collectively, regardless of whether they had indeed been responsible for any acts which were unlawful, infringed human dignity or were morally reprehensible.", "6) The 2009 Act was in breach of the principle of proportionality laid down in Article 31 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution because it constituted an extremely serious restriction on the pension rights of positively vetted and re-employed functionaries and imposed an excessive burden on them. Moreover, the 2009 Act entirely disregarded the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly Resolution 1096 (1996) on measures to dismantle the heritage of former communist totalitarian systems (\u201cthe 1996 PACE Resolution\u201d) and its accompanying guidelines, recommending that that process should be terminated within ten years of the fall of the communist dictatorship (see also paragraph 115 below).", "7) The 2009 Act, contrary to the principles of equality before the law and non-discrimination laid down in Article 32 of the Constitution, introduced discrimination between functionaries who had been vetted positively and subsequently re-employed and functionaries who had not served in the State security authorities before 1990. There was no basis for this difference in treatment as both groups had the same characteristics.", "87. The deputies also stressed that the legislature had ignored the fact that functionaries of the State security service had performed various duties and that, in particular, many of them had been administrative personnel, had been teachers, secretaries, or drivers or they had dealt with common or economic crime and had not been involved in surveillance of or combat against the opposition. In their view, these persons should not be affected by the 2009 Act. It was profoundly unjust that a functionary who had worked all his professional life in the State security service in a lowly technical or administrative position, not infringing the rights of others, not combating the opposition and not acting for the preservation of the communist regime should now receive a pension of only PLN 600 zlotys.", "88. The other parties to the proceedings, namely the Sejm, represented by its Speaker (Marsza\u0142ek) and the Prosecutor General, also submitted extensive arguments.", "89. The Speaker of the Sejm asked the Constitutional Court to dismiss the application, stressing, in particular, that the impugned reduction could not be regarded as disproportionate or excessive having regard to the lowest benefits available under the general social security scheme or those received by persons who had been subjected to political repression under the totalitarian system.", "90. The Prosecutor General asked the Constitutional Court to dismiss the application in part contesting the reductions in pensions, and to discontinue the proceedings in respect of the remainder.", "91. The Constitutional Court, sitting in a panel of fourteen judges, heard the application on 13 and 14 January and 24 February 2010. It gave judgment on the last of these dates, holding that the contested amendments to the 1994 Act introduced by the 2009 Act were compatible with the Constitution. Five judges voted against the ruling and submitted dissenting opinions (see paragraphs 107-111 below). One of the judges submitted a concurring opinion.", "92. The judgment contains very extensive reasoning, which can be summarised as follows.", "93. As regards the scope of the constitutional review in the case, the Constitutional Court held that the application would eventually be examined under Articles 2, 10, 30, 32, 42 and 67 \u00a7 1 read in conjunction with Article 31 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution (see also paragraphs 77-84 above) and, finding that the deputies had not advanced meritorious arguments concerning the other alleged breaches, discontinued the proceedings in that respect.", "94. In an introductory part of the judgment the Constitutional Court referred at length to various general issues, such as the Polish Parliament\u2019s resolutions condemning the former communist regime and the decommunisation laws adopted by Poland. It also had regard to resolutions of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, in particular, the 1996 PACE Resolution and the Resolution 1481 (2006) on the need for international condemnation of crimes of totalitarian communist regimes (\u201cthe PACE 2006 Resolution\u201d; see also paragraphs 115-116 below), as well as to laws and measures affecting pension rights of functionaries of the former communist State security service in other countries (in particular, in Germany, the Czech Republic, Latvia and Romania). It referred to the Court\u2019s case-law on lustration and de-communisation measures and its own jurisprudence on settling accounts with the communist past.", "95. The Constitutional Court next referred to the essential features and activities of the communist State security service. This part of the reasoning reads, in so far as relevant, as follows:", "\u201c6.2. ... The State security authorities of the Polish People\u2019s Republic and their functionaries safeguarded the communist regime in Poland in the years 1944-89, they preserved the situation in which in Poland there was no liberty and democracy, no market economy and no affiliation with the Western world. [A] direct consequence thereof was a degradation of the country\u2019s civilisation, which was demonstrated by, among other things, a deep disintegration of its economy and financial situation.", "The [communist] system was founded on a secret political police apparatus which was extensive in terms of its structure and number [of employees]. The main objective of this apparatus was to preserve and support the communist regime. To this end, functionaries of the State security service of the Polish People\u2019s Republic in the initial period used terror and, routinely, humiliation, surveillance of innocent people, and fabrication of evidence; they violated fundamental human rights and freedoms. The methods they used and the scale and intensity [of their activities] changed over time, but their essence was the same \u2013 to support a political regime which was hostile to human rights. In reward, the ruling communist party gave those functionaries practical impunity for abuses of power, promotions that were faster than in other uniformed services, a high remuneration for service, other numerous additional economic and social privileges, and high retirement pension benefits.", "6.3. This court does not judge the individual motivations of the tens of thousands of people who chose voluntarily to serve in the State security authorities of the Polish People\u2019s Republic, mostly young men. It is likely that purely professional motivation (service in the secret police) was similar to that which exists today. A considerable difference lies in the object of the choice. In no case does the choice of service in the secret political police of the communist State merit approval, notwithstanding the organisational unit and the grade of the functionary ...", "By the closing days of the Polish People\u2019s Republic about 30,000 functionaries were employed by the State security authorities. Today there are in total about 10,000. This is not just one-third of the previous total. The security authorities of the Polish People\u2019s Republic, instead of serving to protect the political, social and economic aspirations of Poles, constituted a highly specialised net of institutions which worked against these aspirations. The \u201cproduct\u201d that remained after those security authorities had been disbanded is over eighty-six kilometres of files, of which only 850 m are important for national security today and are in the restricted archives of the IPN ...\u201d", "96. In respect of the deputies\u2019 argument that the functionaries adversely affected by the 2009 Act had been either positively vetted or not subjected to the vetting procedure, the Constitutional Court held, among other things, that:", "\u201c6.4 ...[A]s a result of democratic transformation in Poland the Security Service was ... dissolved. The ... sovereign Polish State needed new services, which would ensure its security and would at the same time act in accordance with the standards of a democratic state ruled by law. There were two possible options: 1) constructing the new services from scratch, and recruiting exclusively persons who had not served in the Security Service, with the prospect of a long period of preparation for their tasks or 2) setting up a new State protection police quickly, taking unavoidably large numbers of former functionaries of the dissolved Security Service, the legislature chose the second option. It meant that former functionaries of the Security Service could be admitted to service in the Office for State Protection.", "6.4.1. The object of the vetting procedure was not to issue certificates of good moral standing to functionaries of particular departments of the Security Service ...\u201d", "97. A considerable part of the reasoning was devoted to a comparison between pensions under the general social security scheme and the uniformed services system.", "In respect of the calculation of pensions under the general rules, it was noted that the system was organised in such a way that an ordinary employee on his retirement received 40% of his salary calculated for a period of ten calendar years chosen by him from the last twenty years preceding his retirement, including contributory and non-contributory periods. The longer the period of employment, the higher the pension. In practice, in order to receive a pension close to half the average salary in the last ten years, a person had to be employed for at least thirty years.", "In contrast, a functionary of the uniformed services acquired the right to a pension equal to 40% of his average salary after only fifteen years of service. The average salary of persons insured under the general scheme was 50% that of the uniformed services personnel and this difference was even more marked in comparison to the special services. Accordingly, a pensioner insured in the general scheme received 40% of his average salary for the last ten years for a period of employment which was twice as long.", "98. As regards the belated introduction of the new rules and nonconformity of the 2009 Act with the 1996 PACE Resolution, the Constitutional Court observed, inter alia, the following:", "\u201c ... The lapse of time since the Polish State gained sovereignty in 1989, although not without significance, cannot be a decisive criterion for the evaluation of constitutionality of the regulations adopted by the legislature in order to settle accounts with the former functionaries of the communist regime. There is no provision in the Constitution which would impose a prohibition on enacting such regulations. The Constitution does not set time-limits for the settling of accounts with the past communist regime. It is not within the competence of the Constitutional Court to give an opinion on whether, and if so by when, the legislature of free Poland can introduce such laws ... How much time elapses between the collapse of the communist regime and the adoption of a given law depends on the existence of a configuration of power capable of enacting the law during its parliamentary term. As shown by the examples of Poland and other countries in our region of Europe, as well as certain countries in South America, many years may elapse after the establishment or reestablishment of democracy before laws are enacted regulating a certain aspect of responsibility for systemic abuses of power ...", "8.4. Referring to the argument that the 2009 Act of 23 January 2009 is in \u2018flagrant contradiction\u2019 of the 1996 Pace Resolution and of the guidelines to that document ... the Constitutional Court finds that there is no suggestion in those documents that settling of accounts with the communist period should only take place during the first ten years after the overthrow of the dictatorship. Laws on settling accounts have been introduced in various [countries] and in various years over the past two decades, including in recent years ... As the Constitutional Court has noted above, pursuant to \u00a7 14 of the 1996 PACE Resolution: \u2018In exceptional cases, where the ruling elite of the former regime awarded itself pension rights higher than those of the ordinary population, these should be reduced to the ordinary level\u2019\u201d", "99. As regards the argument that an interference with the functionaries\u2019 right to social security was excessive, the Constitutional Court noted that, in essence, the legislature reduced the coefficient of the pension\u2019s basis of assessment from 2.6% to 0.7% only in respect of functionaries of the State security service who were in service before 2 January 1999 and who had been employed for at least fifteen years. Other elements relevant to the assessment of pensions remained unchanged, in particular the right to a pension after fifteen years of service, advantageous calculation of the pensions\u2019 basis of assessment in comparison to the general system, rules and terms regarding indexation, invalidity and survivor pensions benefits, special allowances and increases in pensions due to, for instance, service during the war, combating terrorism, serving in hazardous conditions or in the counter-intelligence service.", "In that context, the Constitutional Court also cited various information supplied by the social security authorities, concerning levels of pensions of functionaries as determined under the 2009 Act in comparison to ordinary pensioners. In January 2010 the average pension of the former amounted to 2,558.82 Polish zlotys (PLN), whereas the average pension received under the general social security scheme was PLN 1,618.70. At the material time the minimum statutory pension was PLN 675.10.", "In February 2010 the average pension received by former functionaries of the State security service was lowered by PLN 346 and was still higher by 58% than the average pension under the general scheme. Only in respect of ordinary functionaries was the average pension (PLN 1,499.64) slightly lower than under the general scheme. Junior officers received PLN 2,102.12 on average (formerly PLN 2,670.930, senior officers PLN 3,479.67 (formerly PLN 4,156.21) and generals received PLN 8,598.43 (formerly PLN 9,578.41).", "100. According to information produced by the Director of the Board for Pensions of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration on 5 February 2010, the board issued 38,563 decisions re-assessing pensions of former functionaries. In 7,227 cases the pensions remained unchanged due to the fact that certain periods of employment, which had not previously been included, were taken into account. In 589 cases the application of the 0.7% coefficient as established by the 2009 Act would have resulted in reducing pensions below the statutory minimum and, therefore, those pensions were increased so as to reach that amount.", "In view of the foregoing, the Constitutional Court held that the legislature, being guided by the principle of social justice, pursued the legitimate aim of adjusting the pensions of former functionaries of the State security service to the average level of pensions under the general social security scheme. In consequence, in January 2010 the average pension of a functionary was still higher that the average ordinary pension. This reduction limited, but did not extinguish, the excessive, unjustly acquired generous benefits of former state security functionaries. This demonstrated that the legislature was not seeking revenge but greater social justice.", "101. Considering the above circumstances, the Constitutional Court concluded that the impugned provisions were not incompatible with Article 67 \u00a7 1 read in conjunction with Article 31 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution. It held, inter alia, as follows:", "\u201c8.9. The Constitutional Court finds that the legislature did not infringe the essence of the right to social security by introducing the 2009 Act. Although it considers that the reduction in retirement pensions of ... the functionaries of the State security service of the Polish People\u2019s Republic was significant, it nevertheless remained within the margin of appreciation determined by the Constitution. An infringement of [their] right to social security would, in particular, have occurred if the legislature had taken away all their retirement pension rights or reduced their pensions to a level below the social minimum standards. By reducing [their] retirement benefits the legislature not only guaranteed that their benefits would not be lower than the minimum statutory retirement pension under the general social security system ... but also ensured that the amount of [their] average retirement pension under the new provisions remains still significantly higher than the average retirement pension paid under the general social security system.\u201d", "102. Rejecting the arguments as to the alleged incompatibility of section 13(1) and (1b) and section 15b of the 1994 Act as introduced by the 2009 Act with Article 30 of the Constitution (the principle of respect for human dignity), the Constitutional Court held:", "\u201c9.2. The impugned provisions are neither aimed at depriving the functionaries of security authorities of the minimum means of subsistence, nor at humiliating them. [The] aim is to reduce their retirement pension benefits, which ... stem from the privileged system of social security. As ... already established above .... after the entry into force of the 2009 Act, the average reduced retirement pension of a functionary of the State security authorities ... is still 58% higher than the average retirement pension in the general retirement pension system, and almost four times higher than the minimum statutory retirement pension. In this situation, the legislature under the impugned provisions still provides retired functionaries of the State security authorities .... with adequate, justified and fair social security benefits for the period of their service before 1990 ... In conclusion, the contested provisions conform to Article 30 of the Constitution.\u201d", "103. The Constitutional Court further rejected the arguments in respect of the alleged incompatibility of sections 13(1) and (1b) and 15b(1) of the 1994 Act as introduced by the 2009 Act with Article 2 of the Constitution (the principle of citizens\u2019 confidence in the state and the law made by it, the principle of protection of acquired rights and the principle of social justice). The relevant part of the reasoning reads as follows:", "\u201c10.2. ... The legislature was entitled \u2013 despite the lapse of over nineteen years since the transformation of the system \u2013 to introduce provisions reducing retirement pensions for periods of service in the State security authorities ... It does not follow from the constitutional principle of protection of citizens\u2019 confidence in the State and the laws made by it that everyone, regardless of his or her personal circumstances, may assume that the rules governing his social rights will never change to his disadvantage in the future ...", "The protection of acquired rights does not mean that those rights are inviolable, and does not exclude the enactment of less advantageous regulations. The Constitutional Court has stressed on many occasions that departure from the principle of protection of acquired rights is permissible, provided it has a basis in other constitutional principles, provisions or values .... According to the well-established jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court, the principle of protection of acquired rights does not apply to rights acquired unjustly or dishonourably, nor to rights which lacked a basis in the constitutional order binding at the time of adjudication ...", "By enacting the contested provisions the legislature expressed a negative opinion on the activities of ... the security authorities of the communist State, which was confirmed in the course of legislative work and in the preamble to the 2009 Act. In the preamble, the legislature declared it had been guided by the \u2018principle of social justice, which does not permit the toleration and reward of lawlessness\u2019. ... As already stated above, the legislature of free Poland has never expressed a single positive opinion on the secret political police of the years 1944-89, and in the years 1989-2009 this opinion has been reflected in laws and adopted resolutions many times. As long as constitutional principles and values are respected, the legislature has the right to draw conclusions from the historical experience of the Polish People\u2019s Republic ...", "The applicant seems to suggest that the impugned provisions would conform to the constitutional principle of social justice if the coefficient of the basis of assessment for the retirement pension was 1.3% ... which, in the applicant\u2019s opinion, might give a deceptive appearance of a \u201cwithdrawal of privileges\u201d. The 0.7%, however ...placed those affected by it in a position where their pension was significantly lower than in the general retirement pension system, which, according to the applicant, amounts to repression ...", "This argument is ill-founded ...", "As this court has already found ... the ... 0.7% for every year of service must be assessed taking into account the fact that functionaries of the State security authorities had been receiving remunerations significantly higher than the average salary in Poland .... The amount of the retirement benefit is not determined by the coefficient for the basis of assessment alone (2.6%, 1.3% or 0.7%), but is a result of the \u201cbase amount\u201d and other factors, relevant to the establishment of the final amount of the whole benefit ...", "This court has already established that, after the 2009 Act\u2019s entry into force, the average reduced retirement pension of a functionary of the State security authorities ... is still 58% higher than the average retirement pension in the general old-age pension system, and almost four times the statutory minimum retirement pension. ...", "10.7. In sum, the privileges in respect of retirement pension rights [of the functionaries] have been acquired dishonourably. The aims and methods of ... the State security service of the Polish People\u2019s Republic cannot be considered legitimate. This court finds that service in State institutions and authorities which systemically violated fundamental human rights and the rule of law may not justify claims that privileges acquired before the fall of the regime should be preserved in a democratic state ruled by law.", "One of the ways of rewarding [the functionaries] ... for service was, among many other things, providing them with retirement pension privileges. These privileges were preserved by their beneficiaries in free Poland, which was confirmed in the 1994 Act. In 2009, assessing negatively the State security authorities of the Polish People\u2019s Republic, the legislature was able to resort to the abolition or limitation of unjustly acquired retirement pension benefits. ... This court considers that the manner in which the legislature ... reduced unjustly acquired retirement privileges in 2009 was balanced, restrained and proportional.\u201d", "104. The argument that the impugned provisions were incompatible with Article 32 of the Constitution (the principle of equality before the law and non-discrimination) because all the functionaries were treated in the same way, despite the fact that most of them had been positively vetted, was likewise rejected. In that regard, the Constitutional Court once again stressed that the positive outcome of the vetting procedure did not mean an approval of service in the former communist secret political police and it did not eradicate the fact that the functionaries concerned had served in that institution voluntarily. All the functionaries were treated in exactly the same way and they were partly deprived of their pension benefits on the same ground, which was the fact that they had served in an institution which had engaged in reprehensible activities over the relevant period. Their service after the cut-off date in 1990 for democratic Poland was treated without discrimination since they acquired the same pension rights as the others, notwithstanding their past.", "105. The Constitutional Court found no breach of Article 10 of the Constitution (the principle of division and balance of power) in respect of the allegation that the legislature enacted the 2009 Act in order to impose a collective punishment on the former State security functionaries. It observed that Parliament had not overstepped its competences set out in the Constitution and that the contested provisions were not designed to punish the functionaries collectively but to reduce their pensions to the level of the average pension under the general social security scheme.", "106. Lastly, as regards the argument that the contested provisions of the 2009 Act were based on collective responsibility and presumption of guilt since all the functionaries of the State security service were equally considered criminals who did not deserve any rights, the Constitutional Court found that Article 42 of the Constitution (the principles of the right to defence, presumption of innocence, nulla poena sine lege) did not apply in the case. It stressed that this provision concerned only criminal responsibility and criminal proceedings and could not be interpreted extensively. There were no criminal sanctions included in the impugned provisions. Nor did they prejudge criminal guilt of functionaries, and they did not constitute a form of repression.", "107. In Judge Jamroz\u2019s view the 2009 Act was in its entirety incompatible with Article 2 and Article 10 of the Constitution. In his dissenting opinion he stated, among other things, the following:", "\u201cChanges in the retirement pension system are obviously permissible, and also in certain circumstances justly acquired rights cannot be absolute. However, this needs to be done with respect for constitutional principles, and in particular those in Article 2 of the Constitution ...", "The 2009 Act is in breach of Article 10 of the Constitution, since the legislature has imposed collective punishment on all those who were functionaries of the State security authorities before 1990, without considering the conduct of individual functionaries. The decisive factor is the mere fact of serving in the State security authorities of the Polish People\u2019s Republic. In this way the legislature entered the realm of authority which is constitutionally restricted to judicial bodies, without taking any action to check or verify the legitimacy, adequacy, legality, fairness and proportionality of the sanction imposed. As a consequence the legislature, relying on the principle of collective responsibility, has imposed severe punishment, regardless of whether the functionaries are responsible for any unlawful acts which violated human dignity, or whether their actions were morally reprehensible ...", "The judgment ... following the intentions of the legislature which have been expressed in the preamble, passes on political and moral judgment regarding the functioning of the State security authorities in the Polish People\u2019s Republic and draws from it legal consequences with regard to constitutional matters. However, I object to the methodology of adjudicating in the name of \u201cpure justice\u201d which has been assumed by the Constitutional Court, which has been inspired by political and moral opinions but has omitted the constitutional principles reflecting contemporary long-standing standards of a democratic state ruled by law established in its jurisprudence ....\u201d", "108. Judge \u0141\u0119towska considered that the Preamble to the 2009 Act was incompatible with Article 2 of the Constitution, that sections 1 and 2 read in conjunction with Article 3 of the 2009 Act were incompatible with Articles 2 and 67 \u00a7 1 read in conjunction with Article 31 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution and disagreed with the majority with regard to certain general ideas expressed in the reasoning.

[An] interpretation that they would preserve at least 40% of the basis of assessment ... would exclude or at least considerably limit ... the rule that their pensions should be calculated with reference to the 0.7% coefficient of the basis of assessment for each year of service in the State security authorities between 1944 and 1990 ...", "It should be firmly stressed that the aim of the provisions under consideration, added by [the 2009 Act], was not to deprive pensioners of the rights acquired due to service in the totalitarian State security authorities between 1944 and 1990. [T]he legislature did not take away from them the right to take advantage of the uniformed services\u2019 pension scheme, including for their periods of service in the State security authorities of the Polish People\u2019s Republic, but, in accordance with the constitutional principles of social justice and elementary (ordinary) decency, adjusted the levels of their benefits ... only in respect of periods of service which consisted in betraying the values of independence, freedom and democracy \u2013 to the level of benefits under the general social security scheme, without a further (pro futuro) possibility of taking advantage of the privileges unjustly or dishonourably acquired due to service in the totalitarian State security authorities between 1944 and 1990. Including this period in the \u2018pensionable service\u2019 under the unformed services\u2019 pension scheme and giving them 0.7% of the basis of assessment calculated in relation to the last, namely in principle the highest monthly salary in their last post, does not in any way discriminate against these persons. On the contrary, this is still a comparable, and even more advantageous [solution] than under the general social security scheme, having regard to the fact that [a pension\u2019s basis of assessment under the general scheme] is determined not with reference to the highest income in one (last) month of employment but to the average basis for social security contributions for ten subsequent calendar years selected from the last twenty years, or twenty calendar years selected from the entire contributory period ....", "In that context, the impugned legislation does not constitute any breach of the common principle of equality or proportionality of benefits received under the pension scheme for uniformed services by persons who served in the security authorities of the totalitarian state, who engaged in unlawful and dishonourable acts or methods of political violence against compatriots \u2013 in comparison to benefits available under the general social security system.", "It is worth noting that the provisions governing pension rights of victims of political repression by the State security service are still less advantageous [Their] periods of imprisonment on political grounds are included in the contributory periods but the relevant coefficient for a pension\u2019s basis of assessment is 0% because of their lack of income ... whereas those who subjected them to that repression are entitled to the 0.7% coefficient ...", "Moreover, the 0.7% coefficient calculated with reference to the highest remuneration normally does not differ unfavourably from the 1.3% coefficient of the basis of assessment under the general social security scheme ... having regard to the fact that uniformed services pensions are calculated with reference to a higher (2.6%) or at least equal (1.3%) coefficients of the basis of assessment for periods before or after the termination of service ...", "Admission to ... public service in the State security institutions of the democratic state governed by the rule of law restored in Poland after 1990 does not constitute rehabilitation for the time of service in the security structures of the totalitarian state according to the standards of the democratic state ... which does not have the right or duty to maintain the privileges [acquired] on account of unlawful suppression of citizens\u2019 inherent rights and freedoms by the State security service of the totalitarian state. ...", "The Supreme Court unequivocally criticises and disqualifies any arguments for maintaining privileges acquired due to, or in connection with, participation in the system of enslavement and political repression by the State security service of the communist totalitarian state ...

On 27 June 1996 PACE adopted Resolution 1096 (1996) on measures to dismantle the heritage of former communist totalitarian systems. It reads, in so far as relevant:", "\u201c1. The heritage of former communist totalitarian systems is not an easy one to handle. On an institutional level this heritage includes (over)centralisation, the militarisation of civilian institutions, bureaucratisation, monopolisation, and overregulation; on the level of society, it reaches from collectivism and conformism to blind obedience and other totalitarian thought patterns. To re-establish a civilised, liberal state under the rule of law on this basis is difficult - this is why the old structures and thought patterns have to be dismantled and overcome. ...", "4. Thus a democratic state based on the rule of law must, in dismantling the heritage of former communist totalitarian systems, apply the procedural means of such a state. It cannot apply any other means, since it would then be no better than the totalitarian regime which is to be dismantled. A democratic state based on the rule of law has sufficient means at its disposal to ensure that the cause of justice is served and the guilty are punished - it cannot, and should not, however, cater to the desire for revenge instead of justice. It must instead respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as the right to due process and the right to be heard, and it must apply them even to those people who, when they were in power, did not apply them themselves. A state based on the rule of law can also defend itself against a resurgence of the communist totalitarian threat, since it has ample means at its disposal which do not conflict with human rights and the rule of law, and are based upon the use of both criminal justice and administrative measures.", "5. The Assembly recommends that member states dismantle the heritage of former communist totalitarian regimes by restructuring the old legal and institutional systems, a process which should be based on the principle(s) of:", "i. demilitarisation, to ensure that the militarisation of essentially civilian institutions, such as the existence of military prison administration or troops of the Ministry of the Interior, which is typical of communist totalitarian systems, comes to an end;", "ii. decentralisation, especially at local and regional levels and within state institutions;", "iii. demonopolisation and privatisation, which are central to the construction of some kind of a market economy and of a pluralist society;", "iv. debureaucratisation, which should reduce communist totalitarian over-regulation and transfer the power from the bureaucrats back to the citizens.", "6. This process must include a transformation of mentalities (a transformation of hearts and minds) whose main goal should be to eliminate the fear of responsibility, and to eliminate as well the disrespect for diversity, extreme nationalism, intolerance, racism and xenophobia, which are part of the heritage of the old regimes. All of these should be replaced by democratic values such as tolerance, respect for diversity, subsidiarity and accountability for one\u2019s actions.", "7. The Assembly also recommends that criminal acts committed by individuals during the communist totalitarian regime be prosecuted and punished under the standard criminal code. If the criminal code provides for a statute of limitations for some crimes, this can be extended, since it is only a procedural, not a substantive matter. Passing and applying retroactive criminal laws is, however, not permitted. On the other hand, the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which at the time when it was committed did not constitute a criminal offence according to national law, but which was considered criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations, is permitted. Moreover, where a person clearly acted in violation of human rights, the claim of having acted under orders excludes neither illegality nor individual guilt. ...", "9. The Assembly welcomes the opening of secret service files for public examination in some former communist totalitarian countries. It advises all countries concerned to enable the persons affected to examine, upon their request, the files kept on them by the former secret services. ....", "11. Concerning the treatment of persons who did not commit any crimes that can be prosecuted in accordance with paragraph 7, but who nevertheless held high positions in the former totalitarian communist regimes and supported them, the Assembly notes that some states have found it necessary to introduce administrative measures, such as lustration or de-communisation laws. The aim of these measures is to exclude persons from exercising governmental power if they cannot be trusted to exercise it in compliance with democratic principles, as they have shown no commitment to or belief in them in the past and have no interest or motivation to make the transition to them now.", "12. The Assembly stresses that, in general, these measures can be compatible with a democratic state under the rule of law if several criteria are met. Firstly, guilt, being individual, rather than collective, must be proven in each individual case - this emphasises the need for an individual, and not collective, application of lustration laws. Secondly, the right of defence, the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, and the right to appeal to a court of law must be guaranteed. Revenge may never be a goal of such measures, nor should political or social misuse of the resulting lustration process be allowed. The aim of lustration is not to punish people presumed guilty - this is the task of prosecutors using criminal law - but to protect the newly emerged democracy.", "13. The Assembly thus suggests that it be ensured that lustration laws and similar administrative measures comply with the requirements of a state based on the rule of law, and focus on threats to fundamental human rights and the democratisation process.", "14. Furthermore, the Assembly recommends that employees discharged from their position on the basis of lustration laws should not in principle lose their previously accrued financial rights. In exceptional cases, where the ruling elite of the former regime awarded itself pension rights higher than those of the ordinary population, these should be reduced to the ordinary level. ...\u201d", "116. On 25 January 2006 PACE adopted Resolution 1481 (2006) on the need for international condemnation of crimes of totalitarian communist regimes in which it referred, in particular, to its Resolution 1096(1996), cited above (see paragraph 115 above). It read, in so far as relevant, as follows:", "\u201c2. The totalitarian communist regimes which ruled in central and eastern Europe in the last century, and which are still in power in several countries in the world, have been, without exception, characterised by massive violations of human rights. The violations have differed depending on the culture, country and the historical period and have included individual and collective assassinations and executions, death in concentration camps, starvation, deportations, torture, slave labour and other forms of mass physical terror, persecution on ethnic or religious grounds, violation of freedom of conscience, thought and expression, of freedom of the press, and also lack of political pluralism. ...", "5. The fall of totalitarian communist regimes in central and eastern Europe has not been followed in all cases by an international investigation of the crimes committed by them. Moreover, the authors of these crimes have not been brought to trial by the international community, as was the case with the horrible crimes committed by National Socialism (Nazism).", "6. Consequently, public awareness of crimes committed by totalitarian communist regimes is very poor. Communist parties are legal and active in some countries, even if in some cases they have not distanced themselves from the crimes committed by totalitarian communist regimes in the past.", "7. The Assembly is convinced that the awareness of history is one of the preconditions for avoiding similar crimes in the future. Furthermore, moral assessment and condemnation of crimes committed play an important role in the education of young generations. The clear position of the international community on the past may be a reference for their future actions. ...", "13. Furthermore, [the Assembly] calls on all communist or post-communist parties in its member states which have not yet done so to reassess the history of communism and their own past, clearly distance themselves from the crimes committed by totalitarian communist regimes and condemn them without any ambiguity.", "14. The Assembly believes that this clear position of the international community will pave the way to further reconciliation. Furthermore, it will hopefully encourage historians throughout the world to continue their research aimed at the determination and objective verification of what took place.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
