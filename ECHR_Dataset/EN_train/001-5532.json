They were travelling in a car driven by the second applicant\u2019s husband, \u0130smail Karaalio\u011flu.", "Medet Serhat was a well-known Kurdish lawyer and was active in the defence of Kurdish rights. One of his clients, a Kurdish businessman. was murdered by persons unknown on 14 January 1994. Medet Serhat was arrested in 1994 and detained for sixty days. It is alleged that he was tortured during that time. \u0130smail Karaalio\u011flu had been working as his chauffeur for four years.", "When they were close to home, a white Renault car containing several passengers forced them to stop. A man emerged from the car and fired shots at the second applicant. He then started firing at Medet Serhat, saying: \u2018I\u2019ve got you.\u2019 The first applicant tried to shield her husband and was herself shot several times. Medet Serhat and \u0130smail Karaalio\u011flu died either immediately or almost immediately in the attack.", "The gunman got back into the car and the car drove off at speed.

When the second applicant arrived at the hospital she was told that her husband had been shot dead and that his body was in the hospital morgue. According to the second applicant, the security forces never asked her for a statement although they put questions to her neighbours about her deceased husband. She has not been informed of any investigation having been carried out into his death.", "The applicants state that as of October 1996 there have been no developments in the case file. They report that, according to the competent public prosecutor, the case file has still not been sent back by the police homicide department. The first applicant draws attention to her claim that the autopsy report on her husband went missing from the file at one stage. The second applicant states that her husband\u2019s address book was not returned to her along with his belongings."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
