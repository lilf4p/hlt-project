MOLDOVA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Alvina Gyulumyan;Egbert Myjer;Ineta Ziemele;Josep Casadevall;Kristina Pardalos;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra;Mihai Poalelungi", "TEXT": ["1. The applicants are Bucuria Inc, a joint-stock company registered in Chi\u015fin\u0103u, and three Moldovan nationals residing in Chi\u015fin\u0103u: Mr Pavel Filip, born in 1966; Mr Serghei Covtoniuc, born in 1961 and Ms Liuba Novi\u0163caia, born in 1960. They were represented before the Court by Ms J. Hanganu, a lawyer practising in Chi\u015fin\u0103u. The Moldovan Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr V. Grosu.", "2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "3. The first applicant, Bucuria Inc (\u201cthe Company\u201d) is the biggest producer of chocolate and other confectionary in Moldova. The second applicant is the Company\u2019s current Director General and a shareholder and the third and the fourth applicants are also shareholders.", "4. Article 2 \u00a7 1 of the Company\u2019s Statute describes the Company\u2019s object as making \u201ca permanent profit\u201d. Article 7.10(k) of the Company\u2019s Statute provides that the Board of the Company is competent to approve decisions to stand security for third parties and to pledge the Company\u2019s assets.", "5. On 29 August 2000 Mr Visile Tarlev, who was then the Director General of the Company, sent a letter to Moldindcombank (\u201cthe Bank\u201d). The letter stated that the Company agreed irrevocably and unconditionally to guarantee a loan to be made by the Bank of 1,850,000 United States dollars (USD), a sum subsequently assessed to represent 18.5% of the share value of the Company. The money was to finance the purchase by a Moldovan company, Feodosia Ltd, of 837,787 shares in the Company from Agroprodimpex Cyprus Ltd, a company registered in Limassol.", "6. In March 2001, following the victory in the parliamentary elections by the Communist Party, Mr Tarlev resigned from his post as Director General of the Company. On 19 April 2001 he was appointed Prime Minister by the President of Moldova and he remained in this post until 18 March 2008. The second applicant became the Director General of the Company.", "7. On 28 June 2001 the Bank demanded full repayment of the loan secured.", "8. Following the demand for payment, the Company filed a criminal complaint against Mr Tarlev. The complaint was dismissed by the Prosecutor General on 19 July 2002, on the ground that the alleged facts did not reveal an offence. It does not appear that the Company sought judicial review of the Prosecutor General\u2019s decision.", "9. On 10 December 2008 the Company was informed that on 1 December 2008 the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office reopened the criminal investigation into Mr Tarlev\u2019s alleged unlawful conduct.", "10. On 22 October 2001 the Company initiated civil proceedings against the Bank and Feodosia Ltd, seeking a declaration that the guarantee issued by Mr Tarlev was null ab initio. The Company relied on Rule 7.10(k) of its Statute, according to which only the full Board was competent to guarantee a loan contracted by a third party, and also on Articles 50 and 61 of the Civil Code and Article 83 of Law No. 1134 of 2 April 1997 on Joint-Stock Companies (\u201cLaw No. 1134\u201d), which required the unanimous vote of a Company\u2019s Board for any \u201cimportant transaction\u201d (see below).", "11. The Chi\u015fin\u0103u Economic Court held a hearing on 11 December 2001 and dismissed the action on 23 January 2002. The court found that neither the Company\u2019s Statute nor Law No. 1134 prevented the Director General from standing as security for third parties and that the guarantee agreement did not constitute an \u201cimportant transaction\u201d within the meaning of Articles 82 and 83 of Law No. 1143 since it affected less than 25 % of the Company\u2019s capital. The letter signed by Mr Tarlev on 29 August 2000 therefore validly bound the Company.", "12. The court further ruled that, even if no decision of the Company\u2019s Board was required by law, it appeared from the minutes submitted by the defendants that the Board had held an extraordinary meeting on 19 January 2001 during which all five members had approved the guarantee agreement set out in Mr Tarlev\u2019s letter of 28 August 2000.", "13. The Company filed an appeal on points of facts and law (apel) with the Appeal Chamber of the Economic Court, submitting, inter alia, that the first instance tribunal had erred, first, in finding that neither the Company\u2019s Statute nor domestic law prevented the Director General from entering into a binding guarantee on behalf of the Company for such a large sum and, secondly, in finding that the Board of the Company had met and approved the agreement on 19 January 2001. The Company contended that the minutes of that meeting had been forged and it requested the court to hear evidence from the members of the Company\u2019s Board who had allegedly been present.", "14. On 14 May 2002 the Appeal Chamber rejected the Company\u2019s request that it hear witness evidence and upheld the first instance judgment, on the ground that the minutes of the meeting of 19 January 2001 were valid unless declared invalid by a court. The court also held that the provisions of sections 82 and 83 of the Law on Joint-stock Companies (see below) were inapplicable because the guarantee agreement did not qualify as an \u201cimportant transaction\u201d.", "15. On 24 May 2002 the Company\u2019s Board held an extraordinary meeting with a view to examining the validity of the minutes of the meeting of 19 January 2001. The Board agreed that they had never met on 19 January 2001. They found that the minutes had been signed by Mr Tarlev and an engineer employed by the company, Eugenia G., who gave evidence that she had not attended any meeting and had signed at the request of Mr Tarlev, without understanding the significance. Contrary to the requirements of Articles 50, 52 and 61 of the Civil Code, Articles 2.1 and 7.10 (k) of the Company\u2019s Statute and Article 68 of Law No. 1134, the minutes included neither the names of the persons who had allegedly attended the meeting, the agenda nor the names of the persons appointed as President and Secretary of the meeting, and had not been signed by the meeting\u2019s Secretary or President. The Board decided unanimously to declare the minutes of 19 January 2001 invalid as a forgery.", "16. The Company filed an appeal on points of law (recurs) to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Appeal Chamber of 14 May 2002. It contended in particular that the minutes of the meeting when the guarantee agreement had allegedly been approved did not comply with the formalities required by law and had been declared invalid by the Company\u2019s Board at its meeting on 24 May 2002.", "17. In response to the Company\u2019s appeal, the Bank and Feodosia Ltd filed written statements from four of the five members of the Company\u2019s Board in office in January 2001, including Mr Tarlev. In the statements, dated 13 December 2002, the Board members confirmed that they had, in fact, held a meeting on 19 January 2001 and had voted to approve the guarantee agreement. The Supreme Court found that this evidence, together with the minutes, confirmed that a unanimous vote had been taken during the meeting of 19 January 2001. It also upheld the ruling of the Appeal Chamber that the minutes were valid since the Company had not brought proceedings specifically to challenge their validity before a court. As to the refusal of the Prosecutor General to open a criminal investigation against Mr Tarlev, the Supreme Court considered that it had been based on the finding that the Company was in the practice of preparing minutes of meetings which did not comply with the formal legal requirements. The Supreme Court therefore found that the lower courts had decided correctly and it dismissed the appeal on 18 December 2002.", "18. On 13 May 2003 the General Assembly of shareholders met and decided that both the guarantee letter issued by Mr Tarlev on 29 August 2000 and the minutes of the alleged meeting of 19 January 2001 were null and void.", "19. Following this meeting the third applicant, a shareholder, commenced proceedings against the Company in the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Economic Court, requesting the annulment of the minutes of 19 January 2001 on the ground that they had not been drawn up in accordance with legal requirements. The Company accepted before the court that the minutes of the meeting of 19 January 2001 had been forged.", "20. On 2 September 2002 the Bank had sold the debt owed by Feodosia Ltd and guaranteed by the Company to Fuchsia Ltd, a company registered in Mauritius. At the date of the sale the debt, including capital and interest, totalled USD 2,603,873. The Bank, Feodosia Ltd and Fuchsia Ltd intervened in the proceedings brought by the third applicant against the Company, alleging that the proceedings were simply a manoeuvre by the Company and its shareholders to avoid paying the debt.", "21. The Economic Court heard evidence from two of the Directors, who had allegedly attended the meeting of 19 January 2001, as well as the engineer, Eugenia G., who had signed the minutes. The two Directors stated that they had not attended a meeting on that date and that their statements of 17 December 2002 had been made as a result of pressure and threats. Eugenia G. stated that she did not attend the meeting and that Mr Tarlev\u2019s secretary had asked her to sign the minutes.", "22. In a judgment dated 23 September 2003 the Economic Court found that no meeting had taken place on 19 January 2001. Referring to Article 7.10(k) of the Company\u2019s Statute, according to which only the Board of the Company was competent to approve decisions to stand security for third parties, the court found that the guarantee letter signed by Mr Tarlev on 29 August 2000 had been ultra vires and that the minutes of the meeting of 19 January 2001 were null and void ab initio.", "23. The defendant Bank appealed against this judgment. On 5 November 2003 the Appeal Chamber of the Economic Court, without holding a hearing, quashed the judgment of 23 September 2003. The Appeal Chamber noted that two contradictory sets of written statements had been submitted to the Economic Court. Without referring to the oral evidence of the three witnesses heard by that court, it held that the statements of the Directors dated 20 March 2003 might have been made under pressure by the newly appointed Director General of the Company (the second applicant) while the other statements were in the court\u2019s eyes more trustworthy because their authors had made them personally in front of a notary. The court concluded on the basis of the evidence in its possession that all the five members of the Board had been present at the meeting of 19 January 2001 and had voted to approve the guarantee agreement. Irrespective of the above conclusion, the Appeal Chamber found that the Supreme Court had already ruled, in its final judgment of 18 September 2002, that the Board had met in an extraordinary meeting on 19 January 2001, when they had confirmed the validity of the guarantee letter. Consequently, the validity of the minutes and of the guarantee letter could no longer be challenged and the third applicant\u2019s action was dismissed.", "24. The third applicant submitted an appeal on points of law to the Supreme Court. It was rejected on 26 February 2004 for the following reasons:", "\u201cthe appellate court has based its decision to reject [the applicant\u2019s] claim on the fact that the [applicant\u2019s] claim has been examined in the proceedings about the nullity of the guarantee letter, which concluded with the decision of the Supreme Court of 18 December 2002. It is clear from that decision that the court found that the validity of the guarantee letter was confirmed at the specially convened Board meeting of 19 January 2001. It follows that the court has determined the lawfulness of the act and the minutes of the Board meeting.\u201d", "25. A writ of enforcement was issued by the Economic Court of Appeal on 11 June 2004. Pursuant to the writ, the Company paid Fuchsia Ltd USD 2,330,012.19 between September and October 2004.", "26.
