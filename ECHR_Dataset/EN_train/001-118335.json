De Gaetano;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["5. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "6. The applicant was born in 1975 and is currently detained in HMP Brixton.", "7. The applicant arrived in the United Kingdom on 7 May 1995 and claimed asylum. The asylum claim was refused but he was granted exceptional leave to remain until February 2000.", "8. On 23 July 1998 the applicant was convicted of offences of rape and indecency with a child and sentenced to eight years\u2019 imprisonment.", "9. On 20 May 2002 the Secretary of State for the Home Department issued the applicant with a decision to make a deportation order and on 27 May 2002 he issued an authority for detention until the making of a deportation order.", "10. On 2 July 2002 the applicant appealed against the decision to make a deportation order and made a fresh claim for asylum. The appeal was unsuccessful and his appeal rights were exhausted on 4 December 2003.", "11. In early 2003 the applicant was interviewed by probation officers who found that he was not suitable for parole. During his time in prison he had received fourteen charges relating to offences against prison discipline. Six of these offences involved fighting. Moreover, he was assessed as presenting a high risk of sexual offending and a medium risk of general offending on release.", "12. On 3 September 2003 the applicant\u2019s release became automatic. However, he remained in detention pursuant to the authority issued on 27 May 2002.", "13. On 5 April 2004 the Secretary of State for the Home Department issued a deportation order which included a paragraph authorising the applicant\u2019s detention until his deportation. The order was served on the applicant on 19 April 2004.", "14. The applicant had claimed to be a member of the Isaaq tribe, which comes from Somaliland, an autonomous region in north-west Somalia. He further claimed that his parents were born in Hargeisa, the capital of Somaliland, although it was accepted that he was born in Mogadishu, in south-central Somalia. Consequently, the authorities initially sought to return the applicant to Somaliland. However, in order to secure the agreement of the Somaliland authorities to the return of a Somalilander to their territory, detailed information about clan-history was required. This was normally done through the provision of bio-data, but this was often difficult to obtain as it required the co-operation of the Somalilander. Consequently, few Somalilanders were returned to Somaliland at this time. As the applicant did not co-operate with the provision of bio-data, the Government decided that it would be preferable to remove him to Somalia.", "15. In August 2004 the last carrier willing to take \u201cenforced returns\u201d to Somalia withdrew, with the consequence that it was no longer possible for the Government to remove people without their consent. The carriers were, however, willing to carry those who had signed a disclaimer confirming that they were returning voluntarily. In November 2004 the applicant refused a formal request to sign such a disclaimer.", "16. On 20 December 2004 an application for bail was refused by the Chief Immigration Officer.", "17. In March 2005 the applicant made further representations for asylum. In September 2005 the Secretary of State for the Home Department refused to treat those representations as a fresh claim.", "18. On 11 October 2005 the applicant was again refused bail. In the course of the hearing, however, the immigration judge was wrongly informed that enforced removals to Somalia would be possible in the foreseeable future.", "19. In July 2006 the Government concluded an agreement with African Express Airlines which made enforced removals to Somalia possible. The first enforced removal to Somalia took place on 30 November 2006.", "20. On 25 September 2006 the applicant was granted permission to apply for judicial review of the decision to detain him but an application for interim relief in the form of an order that he be released from detention was refused.", "21. The applicant was issued with removal directions set for 29 November 2006. He sought leave to apply for judicial review of the removal directions and the directions were cancelled pending a decision on that application.", "22. The application for judicial review of the decision to detain the applicant was considered by Mr Justice Calvert-Smith in a judgment handed down on 7 December 2006. The judge reiterated the principles established by domestic case-law, most notably in the case of R v Governor of Durham Prison, ex parte Hardial Singh [1984] WLR 704: first, that the Secretary of State for the Home Department could only detain a person that he intended to deport for what amounted to a reasonable period in all the circumstances; and secondly, that if, before the expiry of a reasonable period, it became apparent that the Secretary of State would not be able to effect deportation within a reasonable period, he should not seek to exercise the power of detention.", "23. The judge first considered the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention up until August 2004. He was satisfied that from 3 September 2003 to August 2004 the Secretary of State had exercised comparative diligence to overcome the obstacles and remove the applicant. In particular, he noted that the applicant could not have been removed between September 2003 and December 2003 because his asylum and deportation appeals were still pending, and between December 2003 and April 2004 he could not be removed because no deportation order had been served. When considered alongside the objections to bail (the risk of re-offending and the risk of absconding), he held that on balance the continued detention of the applicant up to August 2004 was lawful.", "24. The period of detention from 3 December 2004, which was the date of the applicant\u2019s first review following his refusal to return voluntarily, to 30 June 2006 was found to be unlawful because of its length, the impossibility during that period of achieving removal, and the misleading statements which had misled decision-makers both inside and outside the Home Department.", "25. The judge held that the applicant\u2019s detention after 30 June 2006 was lawful as once again there was a prospect of immediate removal.", "26. Both the applicant and the Secretary of State were granted leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. The Secretary of State contended that the application for judicial review ought to have been dismissed, while the applicant submitted that his continued detention after 30 June 2006 should have been held to be unlawful.", "27. In a judgment handed down on 30 July 2007, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal by the Secretary of State and dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal. The court held that the period of detention between 3 December 2004 and 30 June 2006 was lawful because the applicant could have returned to Somalia voluntarily. Moreover, the risk of the applicant reoffending was high, which was a worrying prospect in view of the nature of his previous offence. The court held that it was wrong in principle to offset those factors against the applicant\u2019s concerns about returning to Somalia as his removal had already been held not to be in breach of the Refugee Convention or Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.", "28. On 13 December 2007 the applicant was refused permission to appeal to the House of Lords.", "29. On 1 February 2007 the Secretary of State issued a decision refusing to revoke the deportation order. An Immigration Judge allowed the applicant\u2019s appeal. On 10 May 2007 the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal ordered reconsideration of the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision. The reconsideration hearing took place on 26 February 2008. The Tribunal held that the Immigration Judge had materially erred in law and ordered that the case be reheard. The rehearing took place on 18 December 2008 and, in a determination promulgated on 1 July 2009, the Tribunal dismissed the appeal. The applicant was granted permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal on 18 December 2009. In a judgment dated 23 April 2010 the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, finding that the applicant would be at risk of ill-treatment which reached the threshold required by Article 3 of the Convention if he were to be removed to Mogadishu. However, on 24 November 2010 the Supreme Court allowed the appeal by the Secretary of State for the Home Department.", "30. On 6 December 2010 the applicant was issued with removal directions to Somalia. The removal was to take place on 8 December 2010. On 7 December 2010 the Court granted the applicant interim measures under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court to prevent his removal.", "31. The applicant remains in immigration detention pending removal. On 13 April 2007 the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal had ordered that he be released from detention on bail. He was released early the following week but was re-detained on 3 April 2008 after breaching his bail conditions.", "32. The present application is only concerned with the first period of detention, which ended shortly after 13 April 2007.", "33. During the applicant\u2019s detention from 3 September 2003 to 13 April 2007, reviews were carried out in November 2003, March 2004, June 2004, September 2004, October 2004, November 2004, January 2005, March 2005, May 2005, July 2005, September 2005, October 2005, December 2005, January 2006, February 2006, June 2006, September 2006, October 2006, December 2006, January 2007, February 2007 and March 2007.", "34. In April 2006 the Home Office introduced a \u201csecret\u201d policy creating a presumption in favour of the detention of Foreign National Prisoners pending their deportation. The policy, which was not disclosed until mid-2008 and was not formally published until September 2008, constituted a \u201cnear blanket ban\u201d on release. During this period, the Secretary of State\u2019s published policy on the detention of Foreign National Prisoners stated that there was a presumption in favour of release. The lawfulness of this policy was considered by the Supreme Court in the cases of Walumba Lumba and Kadian Mighty v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 12 (see paragraph 37, below).", "35. The power to detain a person against whom a decision has been taken to make a deportation order is contained in Paragraph 2 (2) of Schedule 3 to the Immigration Act 1971 (\u201cthe 1971 Act\u201d), which provides:", "\u201cWhere notice has been given to a person in accordance with regulations under section 105 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (notice of decision) of a decision to make a deportation order against him, and he is not detained in pursuance of the sentence or order of a court, he may be detained under the authority of the Secretary of State pending the making of the deportation order.\u201d", "36. The power to detain an individual in respect of whom a deportation order is in force is contained in Paragraph 2 (3) of Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act. It provides:", "\u201cWhere a deportation order is in force against any person, he may be detained under the authority of the Secretary of State pending his removal or departure from the United Kingdom (and if already detained by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) or (2) above when the order is made, shall continue to be detained unless [he is released on bail or] the Secretary of State directs otherwise).\u201d", "37. There are, however, limitations on the power to detain. Four distinct principles emerge from the guidance given in R v Governor of Durham Prison, ex parte Hardial Singh [1984] WLR 704:", "\u201ci. The Secretary of State must intend to deport the person and can only use the power to detain for that purpose;", "ii. The deportee may only be detained for a period that is reasonable in all the circumstances;", "iii. If, before the expiry of the reasonable period, it becomes apparent that the Secretary of State will not be able to effect deportation within that reasonable period, he should not seek to exercise the power of detention;", "iv. The Secretary of State should act with reasonable diligence and expedition to effect removal.\u201d", "38. In the case of Walumba Lumba and Kadian Mighty v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 12, the Supreme Court briefly considered the Hardial Singh principles. In his leading judgment, which was accepted by the majority of the court, Lord Dyson found that in assessing the reasonableness of the length of the period of detention, the risk of re-offending would be a relevant factor. In this regard, he noted that if a person re-offended, there was a risk that he would abscond either to evade arrest or, if he was arrested and prosecuted, that he would receive a custodial sentence. Either way, his re-offending would impede his deportation. He also considered that the pursuit of legal challenges by the Foreign National Prisoner could be relevant. However, he considered the weight to be given to the time spent on appeals to be fact-sensitive. In this regard, he noted that much more weight should be given to detention during a period when the detained person was pursuing a meritorious appeal than to detention during a period when he was pursuing a hopeless one.", "39. Lord Dyson further noted that while it was common ground that the refusal to return voluntarily was relevant to the assessment of the reasonableness of the period of detention because a risk of absconding could be inferred from the refusal, he warned against the danger of drawing such an inference in every case. On the contrary, he considered it necessary to distinguish between cases where the return to the country of origin was possible and cases where it was not. Where return was not possible for reasons extraneous to the person detained, the fact that he was not willing to return voluntarily could not be held against him since his refusal had no causal effect. If return was possible, but the detained person was not willing to go, it would be necessary to consider whether or not he had issued proceedings challenging his deportation. If he had done so, it would be entirely reasonable that he should remain in the United Kingdom pending the determination of those proceedings, unless they were an abuse of process, and his refusal to return voluntarily would be irrelevant. If there were no outstanding legal challenges, the refusal to return voluntarily should not be seen as a trump card which enabled the Secretary of State to continue to detain until deportation could be effected, otherwise the refusal would justify as reasonable any period of detention, however long.", "40. In the same case of Lumba and Mighty the Supreme Court was called upon to consider the lawfulness of detention which was effected pursuant to the unpublished policy which was inconsistent with the Secretary of State\u2019s published policy (see paragraph 34 above). The applicants in that case were Foreign National Prisoners detained pursuant to the \u201csecret\u201d policy creating a presumption in favour of detention pending deportation, while at all material times the published policy indicated that there was a presumption in favour of release. The question of whether the applicants were lawfully detained divided the court, which concluded, by a narrow margin, that the unpublished policy applied to the applicants was unlawful. As a consequence, they were unlawfully detained and their civil claims in false imprisonment had to succeed. However, as the court found that the power to detain would have been exercised even if the lawful, published policy had been applied, it concluded \u2013 once again by a narrow majority \u2013 that the applicants should receive only nominal damages.", "41. Lord Phillips, Lord Brown and Lord Roger dissented, preferring to find that the applicants\u2019 detention was not unlawful because they would have been detained even if the published policy had been applied.", "42. Chapter 38 of the document formerly referred to as the Home Office Operations Enforcement Manual provided that detention had to be reviewed each month and written reasons for maintaining detention had to be provided each month. In the case of Shepherd Masimba Kambadzi v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 23, the applicant had been detained pending the making of a deportation order for twenty-seven months. There was no question of a breach of the Hardial Singh principles (see paragraph 37 above) but nevertheless the applicant alleged that his detention had been unlawful as it had not been subject to regular reviews as required by the Secretary of State\u2019s published policy. The Supreme Court concluded by a majority that it was the Secretary of State\u2019s duty to give effect to his published policy if that policy was sufficiently closely related to the authority to detain. In the present case, the court found that this test was met and that the applicant\u2019s detention was unlawful. However, in view of the fact that the applicant would have remained in detention even if the reviews had taken place, the court considered it likely that he would only be entitled to nominal damages."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-f"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
