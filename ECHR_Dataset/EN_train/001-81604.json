On 6 November 2000 the Chechnya Department of the FSB informed the applicants' mother that the officers of the Kurchaloy District department of the FSB had not participated in the operation of 2 October 2000. At the same time the letter stated that on 2 October 2000 the head of the district department of the FSB, following a request from the Oktyabrskiy VOVD, had met with an \u201coperative group\u201d at the checkpoint between the villages of Oktyabrskoye and Novaya Zhizn. The letter further explained that Ayubkhan Magomadov had visually resembled a \u201cwanted fighter\u201d and that because of that the servicemen of the Ministry of the Interior \u201chad invited him to the Oktyabrskiy VOVD in Grozny to clarify some questions of interest to them\u201d.

On 20 December 2000 the Chechnya Department of the Interior informed the first applicant that on 2 October 2000 Ayubkhan Magomadov had been detained by the FSB officers on suspicion of involvement in illegal armed groups. He had been taken to the Oktyabrskiy VOVD in Grozny. Following an inquiry, it had been established that the detainee had no connection to the illegal armed groups and he had been released on the same day. However, in view of the curfew, he had requested to spend the night at the VOVD and had been permitted to do so. In the morning of 3 October 2000 he had left the VOVD and had never been seen again. The letter further stated that pre-trial detention centre IZ-4/2 in Chernokozovo had denied that Mr Magomadov had ever been detained there. On 8 November 2000 a search file (no. K-031/2000) had been opened and forwarded to the Oktyabrskiy VOVD as it was the last place where he had been seen.", "17. On 29 January 2001 the head of the criminal investigations unit of the Chechnya Department of the Interior stated that the initial complaint about Ayubkhan Magomadov's disappearance had arrived at the Department on 15 November 2000. It had first been forwarded to the Kurchaloy VOVD and then, on 6 December 2000, to the Oktyabrskiy VOVD. No news had been obtained in the case after that. The Department's missing persons database contained no reference to an A.A. Magomadov.", "18. On an unspecified date the Chechnya Department of the Interior issued a notice which stated that Ayubkhan Magomadov had been detained on 2 October 2000 by officer R. of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD, accompanied by the staff of the Kurchaloy district department of the FSB, on suspicion of having committed a crime. The detainee had been delivered to the Oktyabrskiy VOVD, where he had been checked and it had been established that he had no involvement in the crime.

A document concerning the \u201coperative measures\u201d conducted to investigate Mr Magomadov's involvement in a crime had been issued to the officers of the Kurchaloy department of the FSB.", "19. On an unspecified date a testimonial as to the character of Ayubkhan Magomadov was issued and signed by a number of sports officials from the Kurchaloy district and by more than 40 members of the football team and its supporters. It attested that he was a good player and a reliable member of the team and stated that, since 1994, when the hostilities had started in Chechnya, Ayubkhan Magomadov \u201chad nothing to do with illegal armed groups or with terrorist activities, was not interested in the Wahhabist movement, did not use or distribute illegal drugs, and did not sell arms\u201d.", "20. On two occasions the NGO Memorial, acting on the first applicant's behalf, contacted the Prosecutor General with requests for information. Its letter of 5 March 2001 referred to the contradictory information obtained by his relatives from law-enforcement bodies. It indicated that there had been no entries in the register of detainees of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD referring to a Mr Magomadov. They also attached a copy of a statement by the head of the Kurchaloy village administration to the effect that on 2 October 2000 there had been a \u201cspecial operation\u201d in the village, as a result of which Ayubkhan Magomadov had been detained by unknown \u201cmilitary servicemen\u201d.

On 19 December 2002 the Chechnya Prosecutor's Office informed the first applicant that on 17 December 2002 a decision to adjourn the criminal investigation in the case in which he was a victim had been quashed and the proceedings had been resumed. No further details were given.", "22. On 17 March 2003 Memorial again contacted the Prosecutor General, requesting information about the criminal investigation into Ayubkhan Magomadov's disappearance. It appears that this letter remained unanswered.", "23. The Government in their memorial of 16 September 2004 referred to documents received from different authorities, and gave several inconsistent versions of what had happened to Ayubkhan Magomadov on 2 and 3 October 2000. They submitted that the investigation had failed to identify the persons responsible for his kidnapping or to establish his whereabouts. Mr Magomadov had been declared a missing person and put on the federal missing persons list. They also stated that there existed information that in November and December 2000 he had been spotted in internally displaced persons' (IDP) camps in Ingushetia, recruiting fighters for the field commander Ruslan Gelayev.", "24. On 31 May 2004 the applicants' representatives informed the Court about the first applicant's \u201cdisappearance\u201d. They referred to Article 34 of the Convention and linked the first applicant's arrest with his application to the Court in connection with his brother's disappearance. They submitted that in April 2004 the first applicant had been in Moscow. He had last contacted his relatives on 19 April 2004.", "25. The second applicant referred to information received from another of his brothers, Ibragim Magomadov, and his nephew, Khisir Magomadov. They had apparently been visited in their house in Kurchaloy on 29 April 2004 by a group of persons wearing camouflage and masks who had been looking for the first applicant. After intervention by other security officers the men in camouflage had presented FSB identity documents. They had instructed Ibragim Magomadov to come to the local FSB office. Several days later at the local FSB office Ibragim Magomadov was told that a criminal case had been opened against his brother, the first applicant. No further details were given.", "26. On 16 May 2004 a man claiming to be a member of the Security Service of the President of Chechnya brought a note to the applicants' mother's house. The note was allegedly written by the first applicant and addressed to his family. This note was interpreted by his family as meaning that the applicant was at that time detained at the main Russian military base in Chechnya, in Khankala. It was dated 16 May 2004 and signed \u201cMagomadov\u201d. The applicants submitted a copy of this note to the Court. It says:", "\u201cHello, mother, father and the rest,", "I am fine. I am in good health, I am alive and well, and wish you the same. Mother, you probably recognise my handwriting. Grandmother Makka, grandfather Makhmud. Mother, your father's name was Yapu, your mother's was Shumiyat.", "Elisa, Timur from Geldagen will bring the letter. Please help him to find Yusup, in order to release me. At present I am in our republic. Yusup will be fine. You should find Doda through Yusup.\u201d", "27. On 7 June 2004 the Russian Human Rights Commissioner sent a letter to the Ministry of the Interior, asking them to take steps to discover the whereabouts of Mr Yakub Magomadov, an applicant to the Court.", "28. On 24 June 2004 the Court requested the respondent Government to submit additional factual information concerning the first applicant's whereabouts and asked them whether he had been detained by a State authority in April or May 2004.", "29. On 5 July 2004 the Ministry of the Interior responded to the Human Rights Commissioner. It had established that at the beginning of 2004 the first applicant had arrived in Moscow. On 8 February 2004 the first applicant had been briefly detained by officers from the Department of the Interior of the Moscow South-Eastern Administrative Circuit for an administrative offence, namely a breach of the requirement to be registered at his place of temporary residence. The letter further stated that the first applicant was not registered as residing in the capital, and that he had not been found on the lists of victims of accidents, missing persons, inmates of pre-trial detention centres or wanted persons. No applications were recorded at the bodies of the Ministry of the Interior about his abduction or search.", "30. On 22 July 2004 the Department for Organised Crime of the Ministry of the Interior forwarded a letter to the Russian Human Rights Commissioner. The letter stated that the criminal case concerning Ayubkhan Magomadov's abduction was pending with the Kurchaloy District Prosecutor's Office. As to the first applicant, the Ministry of the Interior had no information about his whereabouts or alleged kidnapping.", "31. On 1 July 2004 the Kurchaloy District Prosecutor's Office decided not to open criminal proceedings into the alleged abduction. On 19 July 2004 the Chechnya Prosecutor's Office quashed this decision and opened criminal investigation file no. 44032 under Article 126 of the Criminal Code (kidnapping). The Kurchaloy District Prosecutor's Office was entrusted with the investigation. Documents from the investigation file, submitted by the Government, are summarised below in Part B.", "32. The Government in their memorials stated that it was impossible to establish the first applicant's whereabouts. No evidence had been obtained in support of the allegation that the first applicant had been detained at the Khankala military base, or that he had been kidnapped by servicemen of the State in connection to his application to the Court. Nor was there any information available to connect the first applicant with the illegal armed groups operating in Chechnya. The Government referred to the information from the Ministry of the Interior and the FSB, which denied having ever detained the first applicant and stated that they had no information about his whereabouts. The Government also stated that in July 2004 the investigation into the first applicant's kidnapping had questioned two relatives of the first applicant and that his mother had been granted victim status in the proceedings. One serviceman of the Ministry of the Interior of Chechnya, M.D., was questioned and stated that he had heard that the first applicant had been in Moscow prior to his disappearance. It also follows from the documents submitted by the Government that the first applicant was under arrest warrant for illegal handling of explosive devices.", "33. It follows from the Government's memorials and from a copy of the prosecutor's order of 26 January 2006, submitted by them, that the criminal investigation into the first applicant's kidnapping was adjourned on 5 July 2005, on account of the failure to identify the culprits. On 26 January 2006 the investigation at the Chechnya Prosecutor's Office was resumed.", "34. The applicants submitted a copy of an information letter from the Prosecutor General's Office, containing details of a number of allegations of persecution of human rights activists in the Northern Caucasus, based on the relevant report by the Amnesty International. In respect of the alleged abduction of the first applicant, the letter stated that in July 2004 the first applicant had been charged in absentia with illegal storage and transfer of explosive devices and put on the wanted list. They also cited data from the transport police, according to which the first applicant had travelled in May 2004 from Gudermes (Chechnya) to Rostov-on-Don. The Prosecutor General's Office noted that his relatives had not applied to the law-enforcement bodies with regard to his disappearance. In this connection, the Prosecutor General's Office concluded that there were reasons to suspect that the first applicant had staged his disappearance in order to evade justice (see Part B below).", "35. The parties submitted a number of relevant documents, summarised below.", "36. In September 2004 the Government submitted copies of the entire investigation file no. 38305 opened in relation to Ayubkhan Magomadov's disappearance. The case file consisted of three volumes comprising about 700 pages. In addition to these, in February 2006 the Government submitted an update and copies of documents produced after September 2004. The most important documents can be summarised as follows:", "37. On 9 December 2000 the Kurchaloy District Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal investigation into the arrest of Ayubkhan Magomadov, born in 1969, by unidentified armed persons on 2 October 2000 at his home in Kurchaloy. The decision referred to Article 127, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (unlawful deprivation of liberty).", "38. On 17 October 2000 the applicants' mother wrote a letter to the Chechnya Prosecutor in which she described the circumstances of her son's arrest and asked him to establish his whereabouts.", "39.

On 17 November 2000 the first applicant and his parents contacted the Prosecutor General, the Chief Military Prosecutor, the head of the FSB and the Minister of the Interior with a complaint about the inaction of the investigating bodies. They referred to the inconsistent statements made by various bodies and asked the authorities to carry out a number of investigative steps to find out the whereabouts of their relative.", "41. On 7 and 13 February 2001 the first applicant wrote to the Chechnya Prosecutor and complained about the inefficiency of the investigation. He requested the prosecutor to inform him of the results of the investigation. He also offered to assist the investigation in organising the search for his brother.", "42. On 17 December 2002 the investigator informed the first applicant that the investigation of the criminal case had been resumed.", "43. On 22 December 2000 the first applicant was questioned as a witness about the circumstances of his brother's arrest and disappearance. In his statement he referred to the document signed by the head of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD stating that his brother had allegedly been released on 3 October 2000, but added that the family had had no news of him.", "44. On 23 December 2000 the investigators questioned the applicants' mother. She submitted an account of her son's detention and the search for him. She also submitted a photograph of Ayubkhan Magomadov.", "45. On 23 April 2002 the investigators questioned the first applicant.

On 29 May 2002 the first applicant was again questioned about the circumstances of his brother's detention and the search for him.", "47. On 17 June 2002 the investigators questioned the head of the Kurchaloy village administration. He stated that on 2 October 2000 at about 2 p.m. he had been alerted by the residents to the fact that a \u201csweeping\u201d operation was taking place at the Magomadovs' home. When he arrived there he saw two APCs with concealed numbers and about 20 men in camouflage around the house, mostly wearing masks. The witness did not know the servicemen who had conducted the operation and they had refused to identify themselves. The officers of the military commander's office and of the local police station, to whom he had applied, had not been aware of the operation and had refused to accompany him to the site. When a couple of hours later he had returned there, Ayubkhan Magomadov's mother had told him that her son had been taken away by the military. About two weeks later he had gone to the Oktyabrskiy VOVD to assist the relatives in the search for Ayubkhan Magomadov, together with officer B. from the district FSB department. The officer had gone inside and had returned about half an hour later with a letter which confirmed that on 2 October 2000 Mr Magomadov had been detained there and released on the following day. He had had no news of Ayubkhan Magomadov since.", "48. On 24 December 2000 the investigator examined the log entries of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD listing the persons who had been delivered to the department premises and the persons who had been detained in the temporary detention unit (\u0438\u0437\u043e\u043b\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u2013 \u0418\u0412\u0421) between 30 September and 8 October 2000. Ayubkhan Magomadov was not listed in either of the logs.", "49. On 2 January 2001 the Oktyabrskiy VOVD confirmed that Ayubkhan Magomadov's name was not listed in their records.", "50. On 9 January 2001 the investigator requested the prosecutor of the Khanty-Mansiysk Region to question the police staff who had been on an assignment in the Oktyabrskiy VOVD in October 2000 about the circumstances of Ayubkhan Magomadov's detention, questioning and release.", "51. On 28 March 2003 the investigator instructed the Tyumen Regional Prosecutor to question Major I., who at the relevant time had headed the criminal police at the Oktyabrskiy VOVD.", "52. On 4 June 2002 the investigator requested the Khanty-Mansiysk Regional Prosecutor to question Major I. and officer R., who had at the time served at the Oktyabrskiy VOVD.", "53. On 19 and 20 December 2002 the investigator again requested the Khanty-Mansiysk and Tyumen Regional Prosecutors to question officer R., Major I. and other servicemen, and supplied them with a detailed list of questions concerning the events of 2 to 3 October 2000.", "54. On 21 January 2003 officer R. was questioned and stated that he had served at the Oktyabrskiy VOVD between 29 August and 11 November 2000. During that period he had on many occasions participated in operations in the village of Kurchaloy, and therefore he could not recall any specific details about the operation of 2 October 2000. He remembered that he had received operational information from undisclosed sources according to which Ayubkhan Magomadov had been an active member of the illegal armed group headed by Gelayev. On 2 October 2000 he had taken part in the cordoning-off of the Magomadovs' house in Kurchaloy, while other servicemen had been in charge of Ayubkhan Magomadov's arrest and questioning. R. stated that Mr Magomadov had been released from the VOVD before the end of the curfew hours and that he was not aware of any documents drawn up in respect of his detention, questioning or release. He further stated that he had heard from other servicemen of the VOVD and of the FSB that in late October or early November 2000 Mr Magomadov had been seen recruiting new members to Gelayev's group in the IDP camps in Ingushetia.", "55. On 14 May 2003 R. was again questioned. He stated that on 2 October 2000, along with other officers of the VOVD, he had accompanied the FSB officers from Grozny to Kurchaloy, where they had detained Ayubkhan Magomadov and brought him to the VOVD. R. stated that when the group had arrived at Kurchaloy they had first visited the district department of the FSB and two officers from that department had accompanied them to the Magomadovs' house. R. could not recall the names of these officers, but he was certain that they were from the Grozny Department of the FSB where he had been on many occasions and seen them. He was also certain that they had a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with the head of the VOVD and that that was the reason why the officers of the VOVD had accompanied them and had afterwards allowed them to question the detainee on their premises. R. stated that some FSB officers had told him that Mr Magomadov had been involved in illegal arms transfers and that later he had been seen in Ingushetia recruiting fighters. On 18 December 2003 R. was shown a photograph of Ayubkhan Magomadov, but did not identify him.", "56. On 11 March 2003 the investigation questioned Major I., who at the relevant time had headed the criminal police of the VOVD. Major I. stated that a group of FSB officers had brought a detainee to the premises of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD and questioned him there. He was not aware of the details of the case and had not given any orders to detain or to question Ayubkhan Magomadov. The officers of the VOVD had not participated in the detention or questioning of the detainee, and he had not been placed in the administrative detention cell. Major I. testified that he had seen the detainee being questioned by the officer in charge of the FSB group, that the detainee had looked normal and that no physical pressure had been put on him. On the following day he had asked the FSB officers if there were any unauthorised persons on the VOVD premises, to which they had replied in the negative. Major I. denied that he had issued the notice of 12 October 2000 which had confirmed Mr Magomadov's detention on the VOVD premises, and denied that he had seen it before or had signed it. He alleged that some FSB officers had requested him to issue such a notice but that he had refused to do so.", "57. In June 2003 a handwriting analysis concluded that it was impossible to determine whether it was indeed Major I.'s signature on the notice, owing to the insufficient amount of material under examination.", "58. On 7 December 2003 the investigator was informed that further questioning of Major I. was not possible because the latter had quit the service and left his previous place of residence.", "59. On 28 April 2003 the investigation questioned Colonel S., who at the relevant time had headed the Oktyabrskiy VOVD in Grozny. He stated that the officers of the department had participated in many special operations, that he could not recall any details about the one of 2 October 2000 and that all the information should be available in the appropriate records of the VOVD.", "60. Between January and June 2003 the investigators questioned more than 60 servicemen of the Khanty-Mansiysk and Tyumen regional departments of the interior who from August to November 2000 had served at the Oktyabrskiy VOVD in Grozny. Nobody admitted taking part in the detention or questioning of Ayubkhan Magomadov, and no one identified him on the photograph. The officers responsible for the administrative detention cell stated that all detainees had been properly recorded, that the cell was the only place used for detention in the department and that the records were left in the VOVD for the next shift. They stated that the detainees could only be transferred to another law-enforcement body, such as the FSB, further to a written order from the head of the VOVD.", "61. The investigators also identified persons who had been detained in the administrative detention cell at the Oktyabrskiy VOVD. Two of them were questioned in December 2003, and stated that Ayubkhan Magomadov had not been detained with them there or in the Chernokozovo pre-trial detention centre (SIZO) between August 2000 and March 2001.", "62. In response to the investigator's request of March 2002, the Kurchaloy district department of the FSB on 10 April 2002 denied any involvement in the detention of Ayubkhan Magomadov.", "63. On 27 April 2002, following a request by the first applicant, the investigator requested the head of the Chechnya Department of the FSB to identify and question officer P., who had headed the Kurchaloy district department of the FSB in October 2000, and who had allegedly participated in Ayubkhan Magomadov's arrest and questioning.", "64. On 4 June 2002 the investigator requested the Kurchaloy District department of the FSB to submit a copy of the document issued to them by the Oktyabrskiy VOVD concerning the \u201coperative measures\u201d conducted to check Ayubkhan Magomadov's involvement in a crime. He also requested the department to find and question officer P. and any other persons who had been involved in the operation of 2 October 2000 and Mr Magomadov's questioning.", "65. On 18 June 2002 the Kurchaloy District department of the FSB replied to the investigator that its office had no archives and therefore was unable to submit a copy of the document requested.", "66. On 23 June 2002 the Chechnya Department of the FSB informed the investigator that it had no information about the operation of 2 October 2000 or about Mr Magomadov's arrest. They also stated that the officer who had been in charge of the district department at the relevant time had returned to his permanent place of service after the completion of his assignment, and that his whereabouts would be communicated later.", "67. On 26 November 2003 the Chechnya Department of the FSB again stated that its service had not detained Ayubkhan Magomadov and had no information about him.", "68.
