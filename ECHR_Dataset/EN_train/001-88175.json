Moldova and Russia [GC], no. 48787/99, \u00a7\u00a7 28-31 and 87-91, ECHR 2004VII)).", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.", "Starting from 1962 the applicant deposited 16,582 Soviet roubles in the Savings Bank situated in Tighina/Bender. He claimed that the value of his personal savings, which he had deposited with the Savings Bank, had dropped significantly following economic reforms, and that the State had not properly discharged its obligation to revalue the deposits in the Savings Bank in order to offset the effects of inflation.", "The applicant lodged an action with the \u201cMRT Supreme Court\u201d asking for compensation for the loss of value of his deposits. On 26 October 2004 the court informed him that it was not competent to deal with such actions and that he should address the regular \u201cMRT courts\u201d.", "The applicant lodged an action with \u201cBender county court\u201d (which is part of the \u201cMRT court system\u201d; there exists another Tighina/Bender county court under Moldovan jurisdiction and located in Varni\u0163a village). On 21 December 2004 the court left the action unexamined, finding that it was incomplete since he had failed to fully identify the respondents and to provide evidence in support of his action, and omitted other necessary information. Following the applicant\u2019s failure to submit the missing documents, on 17 January 2005 his action was returned to him unexamined.", "The applicant complained to the Supreme Court of Justice of the Republic of Moldova, which on 6 July 2004 informed him of his right to lodge an action with the Tighina/Bender county court located in Varni\u0163a village. On an unknown date the applicant lodged an action with that court. On 6 January 2005 the court informed him that his action was incomplete, in particular lacking the necessary documentary evidence and proof of payment of court fees. It appears that the applicant submitted no further documents to the Tighina/Bender District Court.", "The applicant also complained to the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office of the Republic of Moldova about the loss of value of his deposits. His complaint was forwarded to the Tighina/Bender prosecutor\u2019s office. On 29 March 2004 the Tighina/Bender prosecutor\u2019s office informed the applicant that Moldova and the unrecognised \u201cMRT\u201d had separate budgetary systems and that he should address any claim for compensation to the \u201cMRT authorities\u201d under applicable local legislation.", "The applicant states that in 2005 he attempted to obtain compensation for the loss of value of his deposits from a Russian bank in Kirov. This was refused since the law did not allow the payment of compensation to persons who had deposited money in the Savings Bank outside Russia.", "As concerns Moldovan legislation regarding compensation for losses caused by inflation, on 12 December 2002 Parliament adopted the Act \u201cConcerning the indexing of citizens\u2019 savings in the Savings Bank of Moldova\u201d (Legea nr.1530-XV din 12 decembrie 2002 privind indexarea depunerilor b\u0103ne\u015fti ale cet\u0103\u0163enilor \u00een Banca de Economii) (hereinafter \u201cthe Moldovan Savings Act 2002\u201d).", "Article 1 of that law reads as follows:", "\u201cArticle 1.
