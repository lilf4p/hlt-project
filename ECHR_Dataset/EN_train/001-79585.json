In its final decision of 28 May 1993, the Supreme Court held that the Articles of Association had been in force until the day of its decision, but were void thereafter.

Despite the representative\u2019s failure to comply with this order, on 30 November 1993 the Court of Registration declared the applicant company\u2019s dissolution as of 28 May 1993, and registered the fact that it was in the process of winding-up.", "9.

On 17 April and 30 May 2000 respectively, this court ordered that the decisions of 12 December 1995 and 6 February 1996 be amended.

Subsequently, the District Court suspended the proceedings until the termination of the proceedings described in chapter \u201cA\u201d above.

Subsequently, a manager employed by the plaintiff withdrew the action, and the proceedings were discontinued on 22 May 1991. This decision was not served on the applicant company.", "48. On 9 March 2004 the applicant company requested proper service of the decision. On 10 September 2004 the Szeged Court of Appeal observed that the manager in question had not been entitled to act on behalf of the plaintiff, which in any case had ceased to exist in 1997. Consequently, the proceedings had to be declared as having been interrupted (f\u00e9lbeszakadt) as of 10 December 1997.", "49.
