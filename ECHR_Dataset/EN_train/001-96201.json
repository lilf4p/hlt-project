The Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.", "The applicant was captured by the invading German army on 1 September 1939, while returning from a scout outing. In the evening of that day he was transported to a camp in Nieborowice (Neubesdorf). He was detained there along with former Silesian insurgents.", "On 19 September 1939 the applicant escaped and was subsequently in hiding. In June 1940 he moved to Krak\u00f3w. He was soon arrested in a round-up and deported to Germany. He worked as a forced labourer in a construction company, then in a food-processing factory and lastly for the German railways.", "On an unspecified date in 2001 the applicant applied to the PolishGerman Reconciliation Foundation (\u201cthe Foundation\u201d) for compensation on account of his forced labour during the war. That request was made under the scheme for slave and forced labourers (\u201cthe second compensation scheme\u201d) established under the Joint Statement of 17 July 2000, the German Law of 2 August 2000 on the Creation of the \u201cRemembrance, Responsibility and Future\u201d Foundation (\u201cthe German Foundation Act\u201d) and the subsequent Agreement of 16 February 2001 between the Remembrance, Responsibility and Future Foundation (\u201cthe German Foundation\u201d) and the Polish-German Reconciliation Foundation.", "On an unspecified date the Foundation\u2019s Verification Commission found that the applicant was eligible for compensation, his persecution falling under the 3rd category which included persons who had been deported to Germany and subjected to forced labour in industry. It appears that the applicant was awarded DEM 4,400.", "On 15 June 2002 the applicant filed an appeal against that decision. It appears that he contested the fact that the Verification Commission had not taken into account his internment in the Nieborowice camp.", "On 12 July 2002 the Appeal Commission upheld the decision under appeal, holding that the applicant had not adduced any new evidence of persecution which could justify the change of his eligibility status.", "In the letter accompanying the decision, the Appeal Commission informed the applicant that his request to consider his internment in the Nieborowice camp as falling under the 1st category of eligibility could not be granted. It underlined that according to the applicable regulations persons falling under the 1st category of eligibility were only the detainees of those camps which had been listed in the German Indemnification Act. However, that had not been the case with the Nieborowice camp.", "On 21 July 2002 the applicant appealed against that decision. On 28 August 2002 the Appeal Commission upheld its previous decision.", "By a letter dated 17 September 2002 the German Foundation informed the applicant that the list of concentration camps as defined in the Indemnification Act could not be supplemented. All other camps with conditions similar to those prevailing in concentration camps were placed on the list of \u201cother persecution camps\u201d which had been accepted by the German Foundation and communicated to the Polish Foundation. The applicant was further informed that the Nieborowice camp had not been placed on that list and that the Polish Foundation could request the German Foundation to place a particular camp on the list.", "Subsequently, on 27 September 2002 the applicant requested the Polish Foundation to apply to the German Foundation with a view to including the Nieborowice camp on the list of \u201cother persecution camps\u201d.", "On 27 October 2002 the Appeal Commission informed the applicant that the Nieborowice camp was not listed in a specialised publication of the Chief Commission for the Examination of the Nazi Crimes in Poland (G\u0142\u00f3wna Komisja Badania Zbrodni Hitlerowskich w Polsce). Accordingly, the Foundation could not request the German Foundation to place that camp on the list of \u201cother persecution camps\u201d.", "The applicant contested that finding. He submitted that the Nieborowice (Neubesdorf) camp was not listed in the Chief Commission\u2019s publication since it had been located in Germany as its borders had stood before the outbreak of the Second World War.", "On 9 December 2002 the applicant received a letter from the Institute of National Remembrance (Instytut Pami\u0119ci Narodowej). He was informed that the Katowice Regional Commission for the Examination of the Nazi Crimes in Poland had carried out in 1967 an investigation concerning the Nieborowice camp. It had been established that the camp had been set up on 1 September 1939 as a transitional camp for Polish activists, in particular Silesian insurgents. It had operated until November 1939. On two occasions the German army had carried out executions in which at least 34 persons had died.", "The investigation concerning that crime had been finally discontinued on 24 June 2005 as its perpetrators could not be established.", "From 1998 to 2000 international negotiations took place on the issue of compensation for persons subjected to slave or forced labour by Nazi Germany. The government of Poland was one of the parties to these negotiations. They were prompted by a number of lawsuits against certain German companies before the courts in the United States in which compensation was sought on account of forced labour during the Second World War. The German companies against which the lawsuits had been brought wished to bring them to an end and secure legal peace. The negotiations concluded on 17 July 2000 with the adoption of a Joint Statement which was signed by all the parties to the negotiations, including the government of Poland.", "The parties to the Joint Statement acknowledged the intention of the Government of Germany and of the German companies concerned to accept moral and historic responsibility arising from the use of slave and forced labourers and from other injustices committed during the National Socialist era and the Second World War. They affirmed their consensus of 17 December 1999 on the establishment of the Remembrance, Responsibility and Future Foundation, which was to be a means of providing funds for victims from central and eastern Europe, most of whom had benefited little from prior German compensation and restitution programmes. The parties to the Joint Statement further agreed to base their decisions regarding the distribution of funds on the eligibility criteria set out in the German Foundation Act.", "According to the Joint Statement, the Government of Germany and the German companies concerned undertook to contribute DEM 5 thousand million to the Remembrance, Responsibility and Future Foundation. The Joint Statement stipulated that the governments of the participating central and eastern European States, including Poland, and the government of Israel agreed to implement the necessary specific measures within the framework of their national legal systems to achieve legal peace.", "Subsequently, on 2 August 2000 the German parliament enacted the Law on the creation of the Remembrance, Responsibility and Future Foundation (Gesetz zur Errichtung einer Stiftung \u201cErinnerung, Verantwortung und Zukunft\u201d). It came into force on 12 August 2000. However, the disbursement of payments only started on 30 May 2001, once the relevant guarantees had been secured by the German companies concerned with regard to the dismissal of the lawsuits filed against them in the United States courts. The disbursement of payments terminated at the end of 2006.", "The relevant parts of the Law on the creation of the Remembrance, Responsibility and Future Foundation provide:", "Recognising", "that the National Socialist State inflicted severe injustice on slave labourers and forced labourers, through deportation, internment and exploitation, which in some cases extended to destruction through labour, and through a large number of other human-rights violations,", "that German companies which participated in the National Socialist injustice bear a historic responsibility and must accept it,", "that the companies which have come together in the Foundation Initiative of German Industry [Stiftungsinitiative der deutschen Wirtschaft] have acknowledged this responsibility,", "that the injustice committed and the human suffering it caused cannot be truly compensated by financial payments,", "that the Law comes too late for those who lost their lives as victims of the National Socialist regime or have died in the meantime,", "the German Bundestag acknowledges political and moral responsibility for the victims of National Socialism. The Bundestag also intends to keep alive the memory of the injustice inflicted on the victims for coming generations. (...)", "(1) A legally recognised Foundation with the name \u2018Remembrance, Responsibility and Future\u2019 shall be established under public law. (...)", "(1) The purpose of the Foundation is to make financial compensation available through partner organisations to former forced labourers and to those affected by other injustices from the National Socialist period. (...)", "(1) The approval and disbursement of one-off payments to those persons eligible under section 11 will be carried out through partner organisations. The Foundation is neither authorised nor obligated in this regard. The board of trustees may opt for another mode of payment. (...)", "(1) Eligible under this Law are:", "1. persons who were held in a concentration camp as defined in section 42(2) of the German Indemnification Act [Bundesentsch\u00e4digungsgesetz] or in another place of confinement outside the territory of what is now the Republic of Austria or a ghetto under comparable conditions and were subjected to forced labour;", "2. persons who were deported from their homelands into the territory of the German Reich within the borders of 1937 or to a German-occupied area, subjected to forced labour in a commercial enterprise or for public authorities there, and held under conditions other than those mentioned in paragraph 1, or were subjected to conditions resembling imprisonment or similar extremely harsh living conditions; (...)", "(2) Eligibility shall be demonstrated by the applicant by submission of documentation. The partner organisation shall take into account relevant evidence. If no relevant evidence is available, the claimant\u2019s eligibility may be substantiated in some other way.", "(1) Specific characteristics of other places of confinement referred to in Section 11, Paragraph 1, Number 1 are inhumane conditions of detention, insufficient nutrition and lack of medical care. (...)\u201d", "Section 42 \u00a7 2 of the German Indemnification Act (Bundesentsch\u00e4digungsgesetz) provided that the German Government would issue a decree containing a list of concentration camps within the meaning of the Act. The German Government issued the decree in 1967 with an annex listing concentration camps. It was twice amended, most recently in 1982. The list of concentration camps does not contain the camp where the applicant was detained during the Second World War.", "On 10 August 2000 the Polish government submitted to Parliament a bill on the exemption from tax and duties of payments received in connection with Nazi persecution. In the explanatory memorandum to the bill, the government stated that payment of benefits in respect of forced labour for the Nazi regime had been agreed in the course of negotiations involving the respective governments, German companies and the victims. They further stated that, as a result of the agreement with the Germans, Poland would receive more than DEM 1.8 thousand million. On 21 September 2000 the Polish parliament enacted the Law on exemption of payments received in connection with Nazi persecution from tax and duties. That Law also exempted the Polish-German Reconciliation Foundation from taxes due on funds received by the Foundation for the distribution of payments. The Law came into force on 17 November 2000.", "On 16 February 2001 an agreement was concluded between the Remembrance, Responsibility and Future Foundation and the PolishGerman Reconciliation Foundation (\u201cthe partnership agreement\u201d). Under its terms the PolishGerman Reconciliation Foundation was to act as a partner organisation of the German Foundation, with a view to securing prompt disbursement of compensation payments to slave and forced labourers (paragraph 1 of the agreement). Both parties agreed to implement fully the provisions of the GFA and declared that their agreement was in compliance with the Joint Statement of 17 July 2000.", "The above agreement further stipulated that the Polish Foundation, as a partner organisation, was entrusted with determining eligibility for compensation payments in respect of all claimants who resided on the territory of Poland on 16 February 1999 (paragraph 2). The partner organisation was to verify and determine whether the relevant conditions for awarding payment had been established or substantiated in some other way (paragraph 5.1). A claimant could appeal against a decision taken by the partner organisation in respect of the grounds of the decision or the amount of compensation awarded before an independent appeal body established within the partner organisation (paragraph 5.5). Under paragraph 6.3 of the agreement, decisions taken by the appeal body were final and could not be challenged before a court (paragraph 3).", "The Agreement of 16 February 2001 was accompanied by three annexes. Annex no. 3 contained a declaration by the Polish government with regard to responsibility for the disbursement of compensation payments. The relevant parts provide:", "\u201cSince 1998 the government of the Republic of Poland has made exceptionally concerted efforts to secure payment of compensation for slave and forced labour imposed by Nazi Germany. In the negotiations, the government has played a significant role on behalf of the representatives of the victims. Due to the government\u2019s efforts, former slave and forced labourers will receive in total DEM 1.812 thousand million, which constitutes a very positive outcome to the negotiations.", "The government of the Republic of Poland will endeavour to ensure that the payments from the Remembrance, Responsibility and Future Foundation, handled by the Polish-German Reconciliation Foundation with the participation of Polish financial institutions, will be processed properly. To that end the Polish authorities will take steps with regard to the Polish-German Reconciliation Foundation within their founding and supervisory competences.\u201d", "The statutes of the Polish-German Reconciliation Foundation was amended on the initiative of its founder, namely the Minister of the State Treasury, with a view to implementing the provisions of the GFA and the Agreement of 16 February 2001; those amendments were subsequently registered by the Warsaw District Court on 26 June 2001.", "The amended statutes stipulated that the Foundation was to disburse compensation payments to the victims specified in section 11 of the GFA from the funds contributed by the German Foundation on the basis of the same Act (paragraphs 6.2 and 9.2). It further specified that the Foundation\u2019s decisions in individual cases were to be taken on the basis of internal regulations. A decision in an individual case could be appealed against; however, a decision taken after an appeal had been considered was final and no appeal lay against it (paragraphs 6.4 and 6.5).", "Pursuant to paragraph 20 of the amended statutes, the Verification Commission was to determine individual claims for assistance filed by victims of Nazi persecution. Members and the president of the Verification Commission were to be appointed and dismissed by the Foundation\u2019s management board (paragraph 21.1). Detailed regulations as to the organisation of the Verification Commission and the rules and criteria on the granting of assistance were specified in the internal regulations of the Verification Commission, drafted by the management board and adopted by the supervisory board (paragraph 21.2).", "Decisions taken by the Verification Commission could be appealed against to the Appeal Commission. Its president and members are appointed and dismissed by the Foundation\u2019s management board, having consulted the supervisory board. The Appeal Commission operates on the basis of internal regulations drafted by the management board and adopted by the supervisory board (paragraph 23.2). The amended statutes stipulated that the decisions of the Appeal Commission were final (paragraph 23.3).", "In 1997 the Ombudsman referred to the Supreme Court a question of law (pytanie prawne), as to whether decisions given by the organs of the Foundation could be appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court and, if not, whether they could be subjected to judicial review in civil proceedings. On 31 March 1998 the Supreme Court adopted resolution no. III ZP 44/97, holding that, since administrative functions could only be delegated by statute, which was not the case with regard to the Polish-German Reconciliation Foundation, its decisions did not meet the requirements of an administrative decision and thus could not be appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court. However, the Supreme Court refused to give a definite answer as to whether the Foundation\u2019s decisions could be subject to judicial review in civil proceedings. It nevertheless observed that entitlement to receive a benefit from the Foundation did not fall within the scope of civil law, and thus could not be raised before a civil court. In exceptional cases, such as where the claimant\u2019s eligibility had been established but the benefit was not paid, a claim could arise under civil law.", "In Resolution no. OPS 3/01 of 3 December 2001, the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the earlier case-law to the effect that it did not have jurisdiction to review the decisions of the Foundation and observed that:", "\u201cThe Polish-German Reconciliation Foundation, which awards benefits to the victims of Nazi persecutions using the financial resources allocated to it by foreign entities, does not perform functions in the area of public administration. Thus, the source of the entitlement to receive an award from the Foundation does not stem from actions of the public administration.\u201d", "It further observed:", "\u201cThere is no doubt that the Agreement of 16 October 1991, concluded between the Polish and German Governments, which was not ratified, as well as subsequent acts [starting with the Joint Statement and the German Foundation Act] concerning grants of financial assistance by the Foundation on account of Nazi persecution do not fulfil the criteria which would make it possible to classify them as sources of binding Polish law. No administrative-law relation arises between a claimant and the Foundation on the basis of the aforementioned acts, and consequently the Foundation is not an organ of public administration established by law to determine cases in the sphere of public administration.\u201d", "On 27 June 2007 the Supreme Court adopted Resolution no. III CZP 152/06 in response to a question of law put forward by the Ombudsman. It revisited its earlier case-law on the interpretation of the notion of a \u201ccivil case\u201d laid out in Article 2 of the Code of the Civil Procedure in relation to claims against the Foundation. The Supreme Court held that:", "\u201cThe [civil] courts have jurisdiction in the case where a claimant \u2013 due to an unfavourable decision by the \u201cPolish-German Reconciliation\u201d Foundation \u2013 is seeking a payment [from the Foundation] in respect of Nazi persecution.\u201d", "In the reasons for its Resolution the Supreme Court found, inter alia, that:", "\u201cThe procedure concerning examination of claims under the first and the second German fund ... may not be currently instituted. The relevant funds were allocated and the disbursement of payments has been finally concluded. (...)", "There is no doubt that the current state of affairs resulting from the relevant case-law, under which those persons interested in challenging before a court the Foundation\u2019s refusal to grant them a suitable payment are deprived of such a possibility, cannot be accepted in the light of the binding constitutional and Convention standards. Article 184 \u00a7 1 in conjunction with Article 177 of the Constitution establishes a presumption in favour of jurisdiction of the ordinary courts which indicates \u2013 at least indirectly \u2013 that a possible jurisdiction of the administrative courts should be based on a specific statutory rule. (...)", "The need for extensive interpretation of the individual\u2019s access to a court, or in other words, the right to bring an action (the right to a court) follows also from Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and Article 14 \u00a7 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which stipulate that everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law in the determination of his civil rights and obligations. It may be assumed from the established case-law of the European Court of Human Rights that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention guarantees to everyone the inalienable right to submit for a judicial determination any claims concerning civil rights and obligations.... Obviously, the right to a court does not denote the right to \u201cwin\u201d a case, but it signifies that the filed claim should be examined by a court and determined on the merits (judgment of the Supreme Court of 3 January 2007, no. IV CSK 312/06, unpublished).", "The results of interpretation of Articles 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure thus require us to acknowledge that the [civil] court has jurisdiction where a case has the features of a civil case in the substantive sense and where no particular provision delegates its examination and determination to a different organ than an ordinary court. The [civil] court also has jurisdiction where a case has the features of a civil case only in the formal sense.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
