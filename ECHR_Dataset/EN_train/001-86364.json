The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Fa\u0142kowo, Poland.", "6. On 24 December 1998 the applicant and his wife attended a dinner organised by their neighbours. An argument broke out between the applicant and his neighbour. They left the room and began struggling in the kitchen. Subsequently, they stopped the tussle and the applicant returned home. Apparently, a few minutes later, when the neighbour was on his way to a church, the applicant assaulted him and beat him unconscious.", "7. On 25 December 1998 the applicant was arrested on charges of aggravated assault and placed in the Gda\u0144sk District Detention Centre (Rejonowy Areszt \u015aledczy).", "8. On the same date the applicant\u2019s wife gave a statement to the police. She stated that she had attended the dinner, but she had not known anything about the struggle in which her husband had taken part, as she had stayed in the room with the other women. She had found out about it only after her husband had been arrested by the police.", "9. On 26 December 1998 the applicant\u2019s wife confirmed her previous statement.", "10.

On 4 February 1999 the applicant applied for permission to be visited by his wife. On 19 February 1999 the Sopot District Prosecutor refused this request. The prosecutor held that on account of the fact that the applicant\u2019s wife had been called as a witness by the prosecution no such permission could be granted.", "12. Meanwhile, on 11 February 1999 the applicant\u2019s wife again gave a statement to the police. Having been duly informed of her rights, she refused to testify against her husband in the case.", "13. On 18 March 1999 the prosecutor allowed the applicant\u2019s wife to visit the applicant in prison.", "14. On 23 March 1999 the applicant\u2019s wife visited him in prison.

On 27 May 1999 the applicant requested the Gda\u0144sk District Court to allow his wife to visit him.

On 23 June 1999 the Gda\u0144sk Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) informed the applicant that he should not be allowed to have any personal contact with his wife as she was a witness in the proceedings against him. However, the court stressed that the applicant could be visited by adults who were not witnesses in his case and by his four-year old son. The court further noted that the next hearing was set for 16 August 1999. If the applicant\u2019s wife testified on that date she would be allowed to visit him in prison.", "17. On 29 June 1999 the applicant asked the Regional Court to indicate a person who could accompany his son to the detention centre. The court in reply informed the applicant that he should indicate such a person. As the applicant failed to do so, his son did not visit him in prison.", "18. On 8 July 1999 the President of the Regional Court informed the applicant that his wife was not allowed to visit him in the detention centre since she had testified twice in the investigative stage of the proceedings and those testimonies were relevant to the offences with which the applicant had been charged. The date of the hearing in the applicant\u2019s case had been set for 20 May 1999 and his wife ought to have testified on that date. However, a request by the applicant\u2019s lawyer for an expert psychiatrist\u2019s report caused an adjournment of the trial until 16 August 1999. The president further noted that until the applicant\u2019s wife testified in the trial the court had the right to refuse her requests to visit the applicant, in order to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings.", "19. The applicant\u2019s wife failed to appear at the hearing held on 16 August 1999 before the Gda\u0144sk Regional Court and in consequence she was fined.", "20. The applicant\u2019s wife subsequently applied again for permission to visit him in prison.", "21.

On 24 March 2000 the applicant and his wife were deprived of their parental rights in respect of their son S. F. The child was placed in a care institution. The court held that the applicant was in prison and the mother was a regular abuser of alcohol. The court further pointed out that on 19 March 2000 the mother had left her son unattended in the street, which had considerably endangered her child\u2019s security.", "25.
