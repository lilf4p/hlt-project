On 9 November 1994 the Braunau District Administrative Authority (Bezirkshauptmannschaft) convicted the applicant twice under the Motor Vehicles Act (Kraftfahrgesetz) for failure to comply with the instructions of the Authority to inform them who had used his car on specific days (Lenkerauskunft), and sentenced him, on each offence, to a fine of 4,000 ATS or six days\u2019 imprisonment in default. The Authority noted that the applicant had given information but found it to be incorrect.", "10. On 29 November 1994 the applicant filed an appeal against this decision with the Upper Austrian Independent Administrative Panel (Unabh\u00e4ngiger Verwaltungssenat). He complained that the District Administrative Authority had incorrectly applied the law and failed to sufficiently assess the evidence before it or clarify why the information he had given was untrue. The applicant did not request a hearing, nor did he expressly waive this right. No oral hearing was held.", "11. On 2 January 1995 the Independent Administrative Panel dismissed the appeal on the merits but reduced the sentence.", "12. On 28 February 1995 the applicant filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof).

Such a hearing would have been necessary because his appeal was not limited to points of law. He had also criticised the District Administrative Authority\u2019s assessment of evidence. Therefore an oral hearing would have been necessary. In such a hearing the Independent Administrative Panel could have properly assessed this evidence, which had already been obtained at first instance, as well as fresh evidence.", "13. On 13 July 1995 the Constitutional Court declined to deal with the applicant\u2019s complaint on the ground that it did not have sufficient prospects of success.

A legal question of fundamental importance is involved in particular if the challenged decision of the Independent Administrative Panel is at variance with the Administrative Court\u2019s case-law, if no such case-law exists or if the legal questions at issue have not been answered uniformly in the Administrative Court\u2019s case-law.\"", "18.
