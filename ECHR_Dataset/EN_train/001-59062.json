The decision noted that the suspicion was based on files of the East German State security authorities and the Hungarian intelligence service, and that the applicant herself admitted having been a member of the Carlos group. In view of this membership, there was an urgent suspicion (dringender Verdacht) that she had participated in the various events. Furthermore, there existed a danger of collusion and of absconding.
