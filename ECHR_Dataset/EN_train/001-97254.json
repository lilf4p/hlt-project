In particular, the article mentioned a \u201cmysterious\u201d publisher of textbooks which it linked to the dismissal of the then head of the Bryansk Department of Education, I.

Prokopenko spends more than 13,000 [roubles] a month per boarding school pupil. Education in a vocational school is more expensive than in a prestigious commercial college.

However, the number of children playing truant from the boarding schools is no smaller in winter, when it is freezing outside and the child has neither a place to sleep nor food. What is the explanation for this? Children are being kept in boarding schools in unbearable conditions. Material resources there are very scarce and there is a high turnover of tutors because of low wages.", "One third of a billion roubles is allocated annually to 38 vocational schools in Bryansk. However, the picture is not any better in these schools. Ugly walls, obsolete equipment, low wages for the teachers ... The quality of training also leaves much to be desired. It is notable that 90% of the school leavers do not take up their chosen profession.", "Fortunately, school financing is not within the competence of the local education officials. However, significant finances aimed at the development of school education pass through the Department. And very strange things happen there!", "For instance, take the 'School Textbook' programme. The Department's senior officials manage to convince the councillors that there are not enough textbooks in the schools and that children from low-income families are in a particularly difficult situation. However, as soon as the councillors take a decision on the allocation of funds, these officials immediately forget the acuity of the problem. Nobody remembers the children from low-income families any more. Thus, between three and five million [roubles] of budgetary funds are spent year in, year out. This year the officials bought textbooks out of the budgetary funds from a single supplier without an open tender. This is a gross violation of the presidential decree on fighting economic crime and corruption.", "Another sphere within the Department's competence is the advanced training of educational staff. Bryansk teachers became accustomed a long time ago to working without any methodical support. However, 36,000 roubles from the regional budget is allocated annually to each school for advanced training and retraining. Headmasters in rural areas have not seen this money for a long time and do not even know that it has been allocated.", "Why does this happen? There are two reasons. First, the money is not received by the schools as earmarked funds, but by entities subordinate to the Department, such as the Bryansk Institute of Advanced Training of Educational Staff, irrespective of the quality of their work.", "And if you enter the rector's reception area, you will see fashionable splendour, an incredible number of secretaries ... The maintenance of the 'Institute of Advanced Training' costs the regional budget more than 16 million per year. Teachers and headmasters cannot even rebel against it, the point being that the rector of the 'Institute of Advanced Training' is the selfsame Mr Geraschenkov, who heads the Department.", "Clearly, in an organisation as secretive as the regional Department it is very hard to get at the truth. For instance, we have still to find out where one million roubles for computer and communications equipment in the Department's account left over from 2004 have disappeared to.

However, the schools do not receive it.", "The saddest thing about this situation is that the heads of the Department do not even think about trying to change things for the better. They wearily give instructions for decisions taken at meetings held five years previously to be rewritten. Indeed, why change anything when they are comfortable with everything.", "The Department is remarkable not only because of the inefficient expenditure of taxpayers' money but because of the inertia of its senior officials.

We repeat: 13,000 per month! This is in addition to the funds provided by the benefactors.", "However, there is another sad fact: notwithstanding such heavy expenditure, in most cases the region still ends up with social misfits. Many of the boarding school pupils engage in alcohol abuse, become dependent on state benefits or end up being prosecuted and sent to jail.", "However, it is not the children's fault, but the fault of the system which the abovementioned heads have been building for years.", "Vocational schools are also directly dependent on the regional Department of Education and receive taxpayers' money through the Department. Getting acquainted with the way the vocational schools function brings you down. The material resources of most of them are in decline: ugly walls, obsolete equipment and low wages for teachers. School leavers have extremely low levels of knowledge and professional skills. Unfortunately, 90% of the school leavers do not take up their chosen profession, so that budgetary money is effectively wasted.", "One third of a billion roubles is seemingly allocated annually to 38 vocational schools. Despite this they are in decline and those they have trained are not in demand in the labour market, even though nowadays highly qualified workers are in sufficient demand and earn quite good money.", "Fortunately, school financing is not within the competence of the local education officials. However, significant finances aimed at the development of school education pass through the Department, including the material resources for the schools and methodical support for teacher training.

When it is time to allocate funds, the Department's senior officials go to the council and convince the councillors that there are not enough textbooks in the schools and that children from low-income families are in a particularly difficult situation and cannot get the basic books. This is true. However, as soon as the councillors take a decision on the allocation of funds \u2013 these officials immediately forget the acuity of the problem. Books are purchased randomly, distributed among the districts even more chaotically and incomprehensibly large sums (around one hundred roubles) are spent on shipping the educational materials. Nobody remembers the children from low-income families any more.", "Thus, between three and five million [roubles] of budgetary funds are spent year in, year out. This year the officials bought textbooks out of the budgetary funds from a single supplier without an open tender. This is a gross violation of the presidential decree on fighting economic crime and corruption.", "One more sphere within the Department's competence is the advanced training of educational staff. Bryansk teachers became accustomed a long time ago to working without any methodical support. The situation is absurd even: many teachers prefer to avoid methodical institutions as they do not expect anything from them but admonition and disrespect. However, 36,000 roubles from the regional budget are allocated annually to each school for advanced training and retraining. Headmasters in rural areas have not seen this money for a long time and do not even know that it has been allocated.", "Why does this happen?", "There are two reasons.

The maintenance of the 'Institute of Advanced Training' costs the regional budget an incredible figure of more than 16 million per year.", "Not only are the teachers and headmasters of the schools deprived of money that is due to them, they cannot even rebel against it, the point being that the rector of the 'Institute of Advanced Training' is the selfsame Mr Geraschenkov who heads the Department. He is responsible not only for training, but for performance appraisal as well. If a teacher claims that he was offered a poor quality or uninteresting course, the training specialist who appraises him will unnerve and humiliate him, and perhaps reduce his marks and leave him with a pittance.", "These are the conditions in which teachers work: with the feeling that as far as professional development is concerned they can count only on themselves and their colleagues. Or, as a teacher of literature, a teacher of the highest grade, said: 'You work and work, try and try, and then a newly fledged training specialist comes along and humiliates you for no reason.'", "The other reason for the stalemate and mismanagement in education is the following. The former Governor released Geraschenkov from the post of director of the regional Department. However, the new Governor reappointed him for some reason, thus violating the law for a third time. Section 18 of the Law on State Service of the Bryansk Region provides that only persons under 60 can be appointed to such posts and that the appointment should be made on the basis of a competition advertised in the media. The executive branch is not a private clique, everything here is subject to State laws. However, the competition did not take place, not even superficially.", "And the third: Geraschenkov holds two posts of head of department at the same time. This is a flagrant violation of the Law of the Bryansk Region and of the Law on Education. The appointments of the first deputy head of the Department N. Prokopenko and the other deputy L. Kletskina were gross violations.", "Then followed the dismissal of uncooperative members of staff presumptuous enough to hold their own point of view. This was followed by multimillion purchases without tenders and the concealment of the unauthorised expenditure by subordinate entities.", "Clearly, in an organisation as secretive as the regional Department it is very hard to get at the truth. For instance, we have still to find out where one million roubles for computer and communications equipment in the Department's account left over from 2004 has disappeared to. Pursuant to the agreement with the Ministry of Education the schools of the Bryansk Region were to be provided with modern communication systems in the first half of this year. We have not found any evidence that the modern communication systems have arrived in the schools, but the million is not in the account either. We would hope that the new authority will put things right in the education system of the region.", "[signature]", "(an abridged version of this material was published in Rossiyskaya Gazeta.

Furthermore, despite the significant financial support provided to boarding schools from local budgets and private sponsors, many pupils developed alcohol addiction and upon leaving the boarding schools became dependent on the welfare system or went to jail.
