At the request of the counselling service\u2019s psychologist, the applicant explained on 16 October 2003 that he was requesting prison leave for one day and had no objection to being escorted while on leave. He stated that the reason for the request was to complete certain administrative formalities, which he listed as follows:", "\u201c(i) go to a photographer or photo booth to obtain passport photos;", "(ii) go to the Transport Ministry to renew my driving licence (medical certificate already obtained);", "(iii) go to the embassy to renew my consular registration card;", "(iv) go to see Mr [B.] at Luxembourg police station, investigations division, to pick up an envelope containing documents needed by a former client;", "(v) go to see the manager of [B.] bank in Esch/Alzette;", "(vi) go to the tax office in Esch/Alzette;", "(vii) meet a group of friends in a restaurant near Esch/Alzette;", "(viii) go to my flat in Differdange to collect the remaining documents for the same client;", "(ix) take some measurements for items I might make in the [prison] workshop;", "(x) go to Differdange town hall for a personal meeting with the mayor;", "(xi) go to the home of Ms [S.] in Luxembourg to meet her husband;", "(xii) go to my lawyer\u2019s office to hand over the missing documents for my former client;", "(xiii) if possible, go to the bookshop near [S.]\u2019s house.\u201d", "In his reply, the applicant stated further:", "\u201c... Unfortunately, the civil damages are still far from being paid, as I have not even had enough funds to make a down-payment. At the moment I am still busy repaying my loans and other debts to the various authorities under the arrangements entered into with the legal departments in order to avoid an unending series of seizures of my property. ...\u201d", "19. On 29 October 2003 a psychologist issued a certificate stating that the applicant had begun a course of psychotherapy on 19 May 1999 which had been discontinued on 30 September 2002 for reasons beyond his control. She stressed that the applicant was anxious to understand what had driven him to commit the offences and to do everything possible to avoid reoffending. On 25 November 2003 a second psychologist, who certified that he had had regular meetings with the applicant since the beginning of 2003, agreed with the comments made in the certificate of 29 October 2003.", "20. On 5 November 2003 the Attorney-General\u2019s representative sent a memorandum to the prison governor stating, in particular, as follows:", "\u201c... please inform the prisoner Thomas Boulois", "that by decision of the Prison Board", "[the] request for prison leave ... [is] refused in view of the risk of deportation (an application was made to the Ministry of Justice on 25 June 2003, but no decision has yet been taken). There is also a risk that the prisoner might abscond, given that he has failed to reflect on his crime. Before being allowed any privileges he must begin to pay the civil party.\u201d", "21. On 17 January 2004 the applicant reiterated his request, giving the same reasons and the same programme for the day\u2019s prison leave. On 27 January 2004 his lawyer confirmed the request and added, inter alia, the following:", "\u201c... granting [the applicant] a day\u2019s prison leave during which he could begin to put his affairs in order with a view to leading an independent life [outside] prison, [would] not only aid [the applicant\u2019s] rehabilitation and reintegration into society, but [would] also enable him to start paying damages to the civil party as quickly as possible. ...\u201d", "22. On 17 March 2004 the Attorney-General\u2019s representative sent a memorandum to the prison governor containing the following passage:", "\u201c... please inform the prisoner Thomas Boulois", "that by decision of the Prison Board", "the decision of 5 November 2003 refusing his request for prison leave ... remains valid.\u201d", "23. On 25 May 2004 the applicant lodged an application with the Administrative Court (tribunal administratif) for judicial review of the decisions of the Prison Board of 5 November 2003 and 17 March 2004.", "24. At a hearing held on 6 December 2004, the Administrative Court raised of its own motion the question whether it had jurisdiction to examine the application for judicial review. The government, who had not raised an objection alleging lack of jurisdiction, left the matter to the discretion of the court. The applicant pleaded that the latter had jurisdiction.", "25. On 23 December 2004 the Administrative Court declined jurisdiction to examine the application for judicial review, for the following reasons:", "\u201c... A distinction must be made between administrative measures relating to the treatment of prisoners in prison (such as a decision to place them in a more secure wing of the prison, and in particular imposing a strict confinement regime \u2013 see Administrative Court ruling no. 14568 of 10 July 2002), which are administrative decisions taken in the context of the running of the prison service, and decisions which may alter the nature or scope of a sentence imposed by the ordinary courts, which should be regarded as judicial rather than administrative decisions.", "In the instant case it should be noted that the granting or refusal of the privilege of prison leave constitutes a measure which alters the \u2018scope\u2019 of the sentence imposed on the applicant by the ordinary court.", "Hence, the two decisions in question are judicial in nature.", "Accordingly, having regard to their nature as identified above, the impugned decisions cannot be the subject of an application to the administrative courts ...\u201d", "26. On 14 April 2005 the Higher Administrative Court (cour administrative) upheld that ruling in the following terms:", "\u201cThe [applicant] submitted that the court had erred in declining jurisdiction to examine his application for judicial review, arguing that: no other remedy existed in respect of such refusal, with the result that section 2(1) of the Law of 7 November 1996 on the organisation of the administrative courts should be applied; the impugned decisions did not alter the scope of the sentence; and the court had denied him justice in breach of Article [6 \u00a7 1] of the [Convention] by depriving him of a fair hearing.", "... The [applicant]\u2019s case concerns a request for prison leave, in other words, a decision which alters the terms of execution of the sentence imposed by the ordinary courts and which should therefore be classified as a judicial rather than an administrative decision.", "The expression \u2018the scope of the sentence imposed\u2019, used by the court, is not to be understood in the present case as the length of the sentence but as the manner of its execution in a broad sense.", "The Administrative Court was therefore correct in declining jurisdiction to examine the application.", "A finding by the administrative courts that they lack jurisdiction cannot be construed as a declaration of unwillingness on their part to rule on the issue; the allegation of a denial of justice should therefore be dismissed as unfounded.", "Article [6 \u00a7 1] of the [Convention] is not applicable in respect of a body which has no power to rule on the merits. ...\u201d", "27. On 11 August 2004 the applicant submitted a third request for prison leave, stating, inter alia, as follows:", "\u201c... I have successfully attended several classes run by the CEP-L [Chamber of Employees] and would like to continue with a view to obtaining the corresponding diplomas.", "The diplomas concerned are in accounting and computer (PC) use. I completed the previous courses successfully, but if I am to achieve my aim it is now essential for me to be able to attend the classes of the autumn session at the CEP-L itself. ...\u201d", "28. In a decision of 21 September 2004, the request was refused on the ground that the applicant could attend courses in prison and that he had as yet made no substantial efforts towards paying compensation to the victim. The decision also referred to the reasoning of the decision of 5 November 2003.", "29. On 14 October 2004 the applicant submitted a fourth request for prison leave \u2013 which he produced for the first time before the Grand Chamber \u2013 seeking permission to spend a day with his children over the St Nicholas weekend.", "30. In a decision of 14 December 2004, the request was refused on the ground that the applicant\u2019s visiting rights in respect of his children had not yet been clearly established.", "31. In a fifth request submitted on 24 February 2005, the applicant stated, among other things, that he could not understand why, in view of the need for him to reintegrate into society, he had been refused permission to attend the final classes required in order to obtain the diplomas in accounting and computing. He added that the reason he had requested prison leave was to renew his identity papers and driving licence and find a solution regarding the repayment of his debts to the various institutions and the civil party.", "32. On 23 March 2005 his request was refused for failure to give reasons.", "33. On 12 July 2005 a sixth request for prison leave was refused on the ground that there was a risk that the applicant would not return to prison.", "34. On 4 May 2006 a seventh request for prison leave was refused on the grounds that the applicant had been making no efforts, especially with regard to paying compensation to the civil party, and had been refusing to abide by the conditions imposed on him.", "35. Following the refusal of 4 May 2006, the applicant applied to the Attorney-General\u2019s Department on five occasions between 10 May and 29 October 2006. He requested assistance in putting in place a repayment plan appropriate to his circumstances and the demands of the civil party, and sought an explanation of the conditions imposed on him with a view to his reintegration into society, so that he could comply with them. On 6 November 2006 the Attorney-General\u2019s representative wrote to the applicant informing him that, as matters stood, he did not intend to reply to the various letters, which, in his view, did not call for any comment.", "36. On 20 November 2006 the Attorney-General acknowledged receipt of a request from the applicant for an interview and said that he would meet him during one of his forthcoming visits to the prison. According to the applicant, the meeting never took place.", "37.
