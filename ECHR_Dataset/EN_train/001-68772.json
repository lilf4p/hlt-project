He said in the course of the investigation that he was no fool and was aware that many of the exchanges that took place on 36-15 ALINE involved men and women offering services as prostitutes.", "The defendants point to precautionary measures that had been taken, essentially monitoring, as evidence of their good faith and of the lack of mens rea to commit the offence charged.", "However, that argument does not stand up to examination when the facts uncovered by the investigation are considered. No warning was issued or account disconnected in response to the simultaneous posting of numerous and, for the most part, wholly unambiguous pseudos, to the detailed CVs indicating measurements and the services on offer, or to the replies to messages setting out rates and telephone numbers.", "On the contrary, these facilities enabled clients to find and speak to prostitutes, who in this instance were women.", "The second argument advanced by the defendants is that it was impossible for them to intervene directly in the private sphere, the online discussions, without infringing the right to freedom to communicate in private.", "... Eurofinacom S.A.R.L., the service provider, undertook to ensure constant monitoring of the service in accordance with Article 5-2 and Appendices 1 and 2 [of its] agreement.

The applicant company was represented in the Court of Appeal by a lawyer instructed by Mr Rossignol.", "The Court of Appeal dismissed an initial objection by the applicant company that the proceedings were a nullity owing to Mr Rossignol's exclusion from the proceedings in the Criminal Court. The Court of Appeal found that, since the Criminal Court had duly heard the submissions and arguments of counsel chosen by the judicial administrator, the applicant company had been properly represented and had had a fair trial at first instance. An objection by Mr Sourieau that the interception of private communications by the investigators was null and void was dismissed on the grounds that it had not been raised at first instance and could not be raised for the first time on appeal. On the merits, the Court of Appeal held, inter alia:", "\u201c...", "Mr Sourieau's and Eurofinacom's guilt ... is established by the fact that the relevant messages related to prostitution ... and by the evidence of several female prostitutes who confirmed that they frequently used the '36-15 ALINE' server, as it was a well-known and habitual part of the prostitution network. They even said that it enabled them to avoid soliciting on the street and to select clients more easily.", "Mr Sourieau's affirmation that a team working twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week was assigned to monitor messages in order to eliminate those which were contra bonos mores is not accepted. Such affirmations are in total contradiction with the results of the investigation.", "Inquiries made by the police services who accessed the server on 12 December 1996, and 2, 3 and 7 January 1997 confirmed that none of the large number of prostitution-related messages were removed. Similarly, none of the prostitutes who used the server said in evidence that they had been 'disconnected' after posting their advertisements and some ... even categorically stated that they had not been. Accordingly, Mr Sourieau has not established good faith on this point.", "Likewise, it is not possible to accept Mr Sourieau's argument that he was prevented from directly intervening in online discussions because they were private communications. Referring to the impugned judgment, the Court of Appeal finds, like the court below, that the '36-15 ALINE' server did not constitute a messaging service intended for one or more specific, identifiable persons but a means of audiovisual communication offered to a non-specific and unidentifiable public. The server was accordingly governed by the Law of 30 September 1986, and in particular the provisions relating to the dignity of the human being and the preservation of law and order.", "In particular, it was established that the police accessed the server by following the standard procedure available to the public at large and that the connection ended when the two correspondents decided to transform the non-specific audiovisual communication into a personalised exchange on a private telephone line. Accordingly, despite the defendant's denials, it is established that Mr Sourieau knowingly supported an extensive prostitution network from which he made considerable profit.", "There is also no doubt that there was a community of interest between Mr Sourieau, Eurofinacom's manager, and the company he ran, as the investigation revealed that Eurofinacom's activity was in fact the alleged criminal activity and that it achieved an estimated turnover between July 1995 and December 1996 of 30,941,878 francs.", "...\u201d", "The applicant company and Mr Sourieau appealed to the Court of Cassation. They submitted, firstly, that there had been a violation of Article 6 of the Convention in that the trial court had ruled that the applicant company was represented in the proceedings by the representative ad litem appointed by the President of the Paris Criminal Court instead of the person it had appointed to that end. Relying, inter alia, on the same provision, they argued, secondly, that the alleged offence had been \u201cthe result of provocation and subterfuge\u201d. Thirdly, they submitted that the offence of living on immoral earnings with aggravating circumstances had not, in the absence of a positive act, been made out in law, as a failure to act or acquiescence did not suffice.", "The Court of Cassation (Criminal Division) dismissed the appeal in a judgment of 12 January 2000.
