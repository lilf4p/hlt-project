They claimed not to have been afforded the opportunity to participate in those proceedings, which had violated their constitutional rights and international environmental treaties as the sewer would not be equipped with a proper biological purification system.", "On 2 August 2002 the Ministry requested the applicants to substantiate their complaints and submit additional documents.

Moreover, in their constitutional complaint the applicants requested an interim measure in order to stop the ongoing building works.", "On 30 January 2003 the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) declared the applicants\u2019 constitutional complaint inadmissible for non-exhaustion of legal remedies.", "On 13 March 2003 the applicants requested the Split Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Splitu) to issue an interim measure in order to stop the building works. On 22 May 2003 the court scheduled an on-site inspection for 29 May 2003. Following the inspection, on 31 July 2003 the court experts submitted an offer, charging 42,000 Croatian kunas (HRK) for their opinion. The applicants never advanced the amount sought; the proceedings are still pending.", "Sometime in 2003, three of the 72 applicants lodged a civil action with the Split Municipal Court seeking compensation for damage resulting from the construction of the sewer outlet. The proceedings are still pending before the first-instance court.", "With a view to securing the building site, the police cordoned off the area.

The same applies to the failure of a first-instance authority to issue a decision, if no appeal against that decision is allowed.", "The relevant part of section 63 of the Constitutional Act on the Constitutional Court (Ustavni zakon o Ustavnom sudu Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette no. 49/2002, of 3 May 2002; \u201cthe Constitutional Court Act\u201d) reads as follows:", "\u201c(1) The Constitutional Court shall examine a constitutional complaint whether or not all legal remedies have been exhausted if the court with jurisdiction fails to decide a claim concerning the applicant\u2019s rights and obligations or a criminal charge against him or her within a reasonable time ...", "(2) If a constitutional complaint ... under paragraph 1 of this section is upheld, the Constitutional Court shall set a time-limit within which the court with jurisdiction must decide the case on the merits...", "(3) In a decision issued under paragraph 2 of this section, the Constitutional Court shall assess appropriate compensation for the applicant for the violation of his or her constitutional rights ...
