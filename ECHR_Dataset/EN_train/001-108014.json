On 19 July 2006 the ARC Department of the Ministry of Interior acknowledged to the applicant that the Feodosiya ITT had not been properly equipped and that the detainees had been taken out for exercise only once every ten to twelve days because of the overcrowding of the ITT facilities. They noted that the ITT building had been constructed in 1944 and had not undergone any capital renovations since that time.
