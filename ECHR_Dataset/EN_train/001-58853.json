In a communication of 27 September 1996, the prosecution informed the prison administration that the pre-trial investigation had been concluded and access to the case-file had commenced.", "15. On 30 October 1996 the applicant applied to the prosecution for bail, contesting the lawfulness of his detention after 9 October 1996. On 8 November 1996 a prosecutor informed the applicant that there were no reasons to vary the remand. The prosecutor stated inter alia, \u201cthe access by the accused and their counsel to the case-file was completed on 7 November 1996.

On 15 January 1997 the judge of the Kretinga District Court, in the presence of the applicant\u2019s counsel, ordered further investigations in the case.

However, no victims had been established and questioned. In addition, the company\u2019s audit had not been properly carried out. The judge held that the trial could not continue until these procedural requirements were met.", "21. By the same decision the judge also dismissed the applicant\u2019s request for bail and extended the term of his detention on remand for three months. The dangers of the applicant absconding and \u201cobstructing the establishment of the truth\u201d in the case were mentioned as reasons for this decision. The judge did not mention the applicant\u2019s allegations about the unlawfulness of his detention since 9 October 1996.", "22.

On 20 February 1997 the Ombudsman drew the attention of the Minister of Interior and the prison authorities to the fact that from 7 November to 5 December 1996 the applicant had been remanded in custody in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention.", "26.

On 21 July 1997 a judge of the Kretinga District Court committed the applicant to trial.", "27. On 6 October 1997 the judge again decided to order further investigations. He noted that the investigating authorities had breached domestic criminal procedure in its conduct of the pre-trial investigation and the collection of additional evidence. The judge held inter alia that the company\u2019s audit had been defective and that the prosecution had not established or questioned victims in connection with the damage suffered by the company.", "28. Upon the prosecution\u2019s appeal against the above decision, on 17 November 1997 the Klaip\u0117da Regional Court quashed the decision of 6 October 1997. The Regional Court held that no breaches of domestic criminal procedure had been specified by the District Court, which might warrant the collection of additional evidence. The appellate court stated inter alia that the District Court could itself establish and summon victims in connection with the company\u2019s losses, without returning the case back to the prosecution for further investigations.", "29. On 17 December 1997 a judge of the Kretinga District Court joined the case against the applicant and the three co-accused with a case against another defendant. The judge withdrew from the case on the ground inter alia that he had taken decisions on the applicant\u2019s detention on 5 December 1996 and 15 January 1997.", "30. On an unspecified date, jurisdiction was transferred from the Kretinga District Court to the Skuodas District Court. On 2 April 1998 a judge of the Skuodas District Court committed the applicant to trial.
