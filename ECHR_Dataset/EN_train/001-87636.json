The eleventh applicant, Jasmin Bogdan, was enrolled in the first grade of elementary school in the school year 1997/1998. The preliminary tests carried out before his assignment to a particular class showed that he had no knowledge of the Croatian language. He scored fifteen out of ninety-seven points, or 15.5 percent.

The twelfth applicant, Josip Bogdan, was enrolled in the first grade of elementary school in 1999/2000.

He was therefore assigned to a Roma-only class, where he stayed until 2006 when, after reaching the age of fifteen, he left school. In 2005/2006 he passed third grade. He was provided with additional classes of Croatian. His school report showed that he was reprimanded for poor attendance in third grade since he missed ninety classes without justification.", "19. The fifteenth applicant, Danijela Kalanjo\u0161, was enrolled in the first grade of elementary school in the school year 2000/2001. The preliminary tests carried out before her assignment to a particular class showed that her knowledge of the Croatian language was poor. She scored thirty-seven out of ninety-seven points, or 38.14 percent. She was therefore assigned to a Roma-only class, where she has stayed ever since. In the school year 2006/2007 she attended fourth grade. She was provided with additional classes of Croatian.", "20. The second to fifteenth applicants submitted that they had been told that they had to leave school at the age of fifteen. Furthermore, the applicants submitted statistics showing that in the school year 2006/2007 sixteen percent of Roma children aged fifteen completed their elementary education, compared with ninety-one percent for the general elementary school population in the county. The drop-out rate of Roma pupils before completing elementary school was eighty-four percent, which was 9.3 times higher than for the general population. In school year 2005/2006 seventy-three Roma children were enrolled in first grade and five in eighth.", "21. On 19 April 2002 the applicants brought an action under section 67 of the Administrative Disputes Act in the \u010cakovec Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u \u010cakovcu) against the above-mentioned primary schools and the Kur\u0161anec Primary School, the State and Me\u0111imurje County (\u201cthe defendants\u201d). They submitted that the teaching organised in the Roma-only classes formed in those four schools was significantly reduced in volume and in scope compared to the officially prescribed curriculum. The applicants claimed that the described situation was racially discriminating and violated their right to education as well as their right to freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment. They requested the court to order the defendants to refrain from such conduct in the future.", "22. The applicants also produced the results of a psychological study of Roma children attending Roma-only classes in Me\u0111imurje, carried out immediately before their action was lodged, showing the following:", "- most children had never had a non-Roma child as a friend;", "- 86.9% expressed a wish to have a non-Roma child for a friend;", "- 84.5% expressed a wish to attend a mixed class;", "- 89% said they felt unaccepted in the school environment;", "- 92% stated that Roma and non-Roma children did not play together.", "Furthermore, the report asserted that segregated education produced emotional and psychological harm in Roma children, in terms of lower self-esteem and self-respect and problems in the development of their identity. Separate classes were seen as an obstacle to creating a social network of Roma and non-Roma children.", "23. The defendants each submitted replies to the arguments put forward by the applicants, claiming that there was no discrimination of Roma children and that pupils enrolled in school were all treated equally. They submitted that all pupils were enrolled in school after a committee (composed of a doctor, a psychologist, a pedagogue, a social pedagogue and a teacher) had given an opinion that the candidates were physically and mentally ready to attend school. The classes within a school were formed depending on the needs of the class, the number of pupils etc. In particular, it was important that classes were formed in such a way that they enabled all pupils to study in a stimulating environment.", "24. Furthermore, the defendants submitted that pupils of Roma origin were grouped together not because of their ethnic origin, but rather because they often did not speak Croatian well and it took more exercises and repetitions for them to master the subjects taught. Finally, they claimed that Roma pupils received the same quality of education as other students as the scope of their curriculum did not differ from that prescribed by law.", "25. On 26 September 2002 the \u010cakovec Municipal Court dismissed the applicants' action, accepting the defendants' argument that the reason why most Roma pupils were placed in separate classes was that they were not fluent in Croatian. Consequently, the court held that this was not unlawful and that the applicants had failed to substantiate their allegations concerning racial discrimination. Lastly, the court concluded that the applicants had failed to prove the alleged difference in the curriculum of the Roma-only classes.", "26. On 17 October 2002 the applicants appealed against the first-instance judgment, claiming that it was arbitrary and contradictory.", "27. On 14 November 2002 the \u010cakovec County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u \u010cakovcu) dismissed the applicants' appeal, upholding the reasoning of the first-instance judgment.", "28. Subsequently, on 19 December 2002, the applicants lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) under section 62 of the Constitutional Court Act. In their constitutional complaint the applicants reiterated their earlier arguments, relying on the relevant provisions of the Constitution and of the Convention.", "29. On 3 November 2003 the applicants' lawyer lodged an application with the Constitutional Court to expedite the proceedings. On 7 February 2007 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicants' complaint in its decision no. U-III- 3138/2002, published in the Official Gazette no. 22 of 26 February 2007). The relevant parts of the decision read as follows:", "\u201cThe first-instance court established in the impugned judgment that the criteria for formation of classes in the defendant elementary schools had been knowledge of the Croatian language and not the pupils' ethnic origin. The [first-instance] court considered that the complainants had failed to prove their assertion that they had been placed in their classes on the basis of their racial and ethnic origin. The [first-instance] court stressed that the complainants relied exclusively on the Report on the activities of the Ombudsman in the year 2000. However, the Ombudsman said in his evidence that the part of the Report referring to the education of Roma had been injudicious because all the relevant facts had not been established.", "The first-instance court relied on section 27 paragraph 1 of the Elementary Education Act ... which provides that teaching in elementary schools is in the Croatian language and Latin script, and considered lack of knowledge of the Croatian language as an objective impediment in complying with the requirements of the school curriculum, which also transpires from the conclusion of a study carried out for the needs of the Croatian Helsinki Committee. The [first-instance] court found: 'pupils enrolling in the first year of elementary schools have to know the Croatian language so that they are able to follow the teaching, if the purpose of elementary education is to be fulfilled. It is therefore logical that classes with children who do not know the Croatian language require additional efforts and commitment of teachers, in particular to teach them the Croatian language.'", "The first-instance court found that the defendants had not acted against the law in that they had not changed the composition of classes once established, as only in exceptional situations was the transfer of pupils from one class to another allowed. The [first-instance] court considered that this practice respected the completeness of a class and its unity in the upper grades.", "The [first-instance] court considered that classes should be formed so as to create favourable conditions for an equal approach to all pupils according to the prescribed curriculum and programme, which could be achieved only where a class consisted of a permanent group of pupils of approximately the same age and knowledge.", "Furthermore, the [first-instance] court found that the complainants had failed to prove their assertion that ... they had a curriculum of significantly smaller volume than the one prescribed for the elementary schools by the Ministry of Education and Sport on 16 June 1999. The [first-instance] court found that the above assertion of the complainants relied on the Ombudsman's report. However, the Ombudsman said in his testimony that he did not know how the fact that in Roma-only classes the teaching followed a so-called special programme had been established.", "The [first-instance] court established that teaching in the complainants' respective classes and the parallel ones followed the same curriculum, according to the submitted school curriculum. Only in the Kru\u0161anec Elementary School were there some deviations from the school curriculum, but the [first-instance] court found those deviations permissible since they had occurred ... at the beginning of the school year owing to low attendance.", "After having established that the complainants had not been placed in their classes according to their racial and ethnic origin and that the curriculum had been the same in all parallel classes, the first-instance court dismissed the complainants' action.", "...", "The reasoning of the first-instance judgment ... shows that the defendant elementary schools replied to the complainants' allegations as follows:", "'The [defendant schools] enrolled in the first year those children found psycho-physically fit to attend elementary school by a committee composed of a physician, a psychologist, a school counsellor (pedagog), a defectologist and a teacher. They did not enrol Croatian children or Roma children as such, but children found by the said committee to be psychologically and physically fit to be enrolled in elementary school. (...) The defendant elementary schools maintain that the first obstacle for Roma children in psychological tests is their lack of knowledge of the Croatian language in terms of both expression and comprehension. As to the emotional aspect of maturity, these children mostly have difficulty channelling their emotions. In terms of social maturity, children of Roma origin do not have the basic hygienic skills of washing, dressing, tying or buttoning, and a lot of time is needed before they achieve these skills. (...) It is therefore difficult to plan class structures with sufficient motivation for all children, which is one of the obligations of elementary schools. There are classes composed of pupils not requiring additional schooling to follow the teaching programme and classes composed of pupils who require supplementary work and assistance from teachers in order to acquire the necessary [skills] they lack owing to social deprivation. ...'", "The reasoning of the same judgment cites the testimony of M.P.-P., a school counsellor and psychologist in the Ma\u010dinec Elementary School, given on 12 December 2001 ...:", "'Before enrolment the committee questions the children in order to establish whether they possess the skills necessary for attending school. Classes are usually formed according to the Gauss curve, so that the majority in a given class are average pupils and a minority below or above average. ... However, in a situation where 70% of the population does not speak Croatian, a different approach is adopted so as to form classes with only pupils who do not speak Croatian, because in those classes a teacher's first task is to teach the children the language.'", "The above shows that the allocation of pupils to classes is based on the skills and needs of each individual child. The approach is individualised and carried out in keeping with professional and pedagogical standards. Thus, the Constitutional Court finds the applied approach correct since only qualified experts, in particular in the fields of pedagogy, school psychology and defectology, are responsible for assigning individual children to the appropriate classes.", "The Constitutional Court has no reason to question the findings and expert opinions of the competent committees, composed of physicians, psychologists, school counsellors (pedagog), defectologists and teachers, which in the instant case found that the complainants should be placed in separate classes.", "None of the facts submitted to the Constitutional Court leads to the conclusion that the placement of the complainants in separate classes was motivated by or based on their racial or ethnic origin.", "The Constitutional Court finds that their placement pursued the legitimate aim of necessary adjustment of the elementary educational system to the skills and needs of the complainants, where the decisive factor was their lack of knowledge or inadequate knowledge of Croatian, the language used to teach in schools.", "The separate classes were not established for the purpose of racial segregation in enrolment in the first year of elementary school but as a means of providing children with supplementary tuition in the Croatian language and eliminating the consequences of prior social deprivation.", "It is of particular importance to stress that the statistical data on the number of Roma children in separate classes in the school-year 2001-2002 ... are not in themselves sufficient to indicate that the defendants' practice was discriminatory (see also the European Court of Human Rights judgments Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, \u00a7 154, and D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic, \u00a7 46).", "Moreover, the complainants themselves maintain in their constitutional complaint that in the school-year 2001-2002 40.93% of Roma children in Me\u0111imurje County were placed in regular classes, which tends to support the Constitutional Court's conclusion that there is no reason to challenge the correct practice of the defendant elementary schools and expert committees.", "...", "In their constitutional complaint the complainants further point out that: 'Even if lack of knowledge of the Croatian language on enrolment in the first year was a problem, the same could not be said of the complainants' enrolment in upper grades.' They therefore consider that their rights were violated by the courts' findings that it had been justified to maintain separate [Roma-only] classes in the upper grades in order to preserve the stability of the wholeness of a given class. The complainants submit that the stability of a class should not have been placed above their constitutional rights, multiculturalism and national equality.", "In that regard the Constitutional Court accepts the complainants' arguments.", "While the Constitutional Court considers correct and acceptable the courts' findings that lack of knowledge of the Croatian language represents an objective obstacle justifying the formation of separate classes for children who do not speak Croatian at all or speak it badly when they start school, ... bearing in mind the particular circumstance of the present case, it cannot accept the following conclusion of the first-instance court:", "'Furthermore, the wholeness and unity of a class is respected in the upper grades. Therefore, transfer of children from one class to another occurs only exceptionally and in justified cases (...) because a class is a homogeneous whole and transferring children from one class to another would produce stress. (...) The continuity of a group is a precondition for the development of a class collective ...'", "Accordingly, the Constitutional Court cannot accept the following view of the appellate court:", "'The classes are formed when the children enter the first year of their schooling, not every year, and their composition changes only exceptionally. They become a settled whole which makes for work of a higher quality and it is not pedagogically justified to change them. Therefore this court, like the first-instance court, concludes that maintaining established classes did not amount to an unlawful act.'", "The above views of the courts would have been acceptable had they referred to the usual situations concerning the assignment of pupils to upper grade classes in elementary schools where no objective need for special measures exists, such as forming separate classes for children with inadequate command of Croatian.", "Considering the circumstances of the present case, the Constitutional Court finds that it is in principle objectively and reasonably justified to maintain separate classes in the upper grades of elementary school only for pupils who have not attained the level of Croatian necessary for them to follow the school curriculum of regular classes properly. ...", "However, there is no objective or reasonable justification for not transferring to a regular class a pupil who has attained proficiency in Croatian in the lower grades of elementary school and successfully mastered the prescribed school curriculum.", "...", "Keeping such a pupil in a separate class against his or her will ... for reasons unrelated to his or her needs and skills would be unacceptable from the constitutional point of view with regard to the right of equality before the law, guaranteed under Section 14 paragraph 2 of the Constitution.", "...", "... a constitutional complaint is a particular constitutional instrument for the protection of a legal subject whose human right or fundamental freedom guaranteed under the Constitution has been infringed in an individual act of a State or public body which determined his or her rights and obligations.", "The present constitutional complaint concerns impugned judgments referring to the school year 2001/2002. However, not a single complainant alleges that in that school year he or she was a pupil in a separate [Roma-only] upper-grade class or was personally affected or concerned by the contested practice ...", "Although it does not concern the individual legal position of any of the complainants ..., in respect of the complainants' general complaint about the maintaining of Roma-only classes in the upper grades of elementary school the Constitutional Court has addressed the following question:", "- was the continued existence of Roma-only classes in the upper grades of elementary school ... caused by the defendants' intent to discriminate those pupils on the basis of their racial or ethnic origin?", "... none of the facts submitted to the Constitutional Court leads to the conclusion that the defendants' ... practice was aimed at discrimination of the Roma pupils on the basis of their racial or ethnic origin.", "...", "The complainants further complain of a violation of their right to education on the ground that the teaching organised in those classes was more reduced in volume and in scope than the Curriculum for Elementary Schools adopted by the Ministry of Education and Sport on 16 June 1999. They consider that 'their placement in Roma-only classes with an inferior curriculum stigmatises them as being different, stupid, intellectually inferior and children who need to be separated from normal children in order not to be a bad influence on them. Owing to their significantly reduced and simplified school curriculum their prospects of higher education or enrolment in high schools as well as their employment options or chances of advancement are slimmer (...)'", "After considering the entire case-file, the Constitutional Court has found that the above allegations are unfounded. The case-file, including the first-instance judgment ..., shows that the allegations of an inferior curriculum in Roma-only classes are not accurate. The Constitutional Court has no reason to question the facts as established by the competent court.", "The possible difference in curricula between parallel classes for objective reasons (for example the low attendance at the Kru\u0161anec Elementary School where in the first term of school year 2001/2002 the pupils in classes 1c,, 1d, 2b and 2c missed 4,702 lessons in total, 4,170 of which were missed for no justified reason) does not contravene the requirement that the curriculum be the same in all parallel classes.", "The Constitutional Court is obliged to point out that neither the Constitution nor the Convention guarantees any specific requirements concerning school curricula or their implementation. First and foremost the Constitution and the Convention guarantee a right of access to educational institutions existing in a given State, as well as an effective right to education, in other words that every person has an equal right to obtain official recognition of the studies which he or she has completed (a similar view was expressed by the European Court of Human Rights in a case relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium v. Belgium, \u00a7 B4). ...", "... the Constitutional Court finds the evidence submitted in the present proceedings insufficient to show beyond doubt that the complainants had to follow a school curriculum of lesser scope. ...", "Thus, the Constitutional Court considers the complainants' assertion about being stigmatised as a subjective value judgment, without reasonable justification. The Constitutional Court finds no factual support for the complainants' assertion that the source of their stigmatisation was an allegedly reduced curriculum owing to which their prospects for further education were lower, and dismisses that assertion as arbitrary. The competent bodies of the Republic of Croatia recognise a completed degree of education to everyone, irrespective of his or her racial or ethnic origin. In that respect everyone is equal before the law, with equal chances of advancement according to their abilities.\u201d", "30. The relevant provisions of the Constitution read as follows:", "\u201cEveryone in the Republic of Croatia shall enjoy rights and freedoms, regardless of race, colour, gender, language, religion, political or other belief, national or social origin, property, birth, education, social status or other characteristics.", "All shall be equal before the law.\u201d", "31.
