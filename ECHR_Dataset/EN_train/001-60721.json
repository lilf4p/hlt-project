The applicant was born in 1934 and lives in Katowice, Poland.", "10. On 13 November 1981 the Katowice District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) declared the applicant the sole heir of his mother\u2019s estate. Consequently, he became a co-owner of an apartment building situated in Katowice. The building was owned in equal parts by the applicant and his brother, Mr M. P., who had inherited his share of the property from their father in 1973. It consisted of two separate apartments, a staircase and several rooms situated in the basement and in the attic.", "11. On 10 January 1983 Mr M.P. instituted non-contentious proceedings (post\u0119powanie nieprocesowe) before the Katowice District Court in which he sought a ruling on how the property should be used by the co-owners.", "12. The Government averred that the proceedings were stayed between 1 March and 11 November 1983 because the parties had failed to make a downpayment to cover expert fees. The applicant claimed that he had made the required payment on time.", "13. The Government submitted that before 1 May 1993 the trial court had held fifteen hearings and that the applicant had failed to attend six of them. The applicant contested that submission.", "14.

On 25 October 1994 the Regional Court held the first hearing, which was adjourned because of the applicant\u2019s absence. The applicant submitted that he had not attended the hearing because he had not been served with the summons.", "19. On 24 November 1994 the Katowice Regional Court quashed the judgment of the District Court except for a part concerning the division of the garden and remitted the case to the first-instance court. The Regional Court considered that the decision to award the applicant exclusive access to a room situated in the attic could lead to further conflicts between the parties. It also pointed out that on several occasions the applicant had changed his claims and that the District Court had failed to take into account certain proposals submitted by the plaintiff in the first-instance proceedings.", "20. On 28 January 1995 Mr M. P. died and was replaced as a party to the proceedings by his widow, Mrs K. P. and his son, Mr L. P.

The applicant disagreed with that submission.", "24. During the hearing held on 4 March 1997 the court allowed the applicant\u2019s request and appointed an expert witness. On 23 December 1997 the witness submitted his report. The Government submitted that a delay in taking evidence from the expert witness resulted from the trial court\u2019s \u201cunsuccessful attempts to find an expert who was able to prepare the opinion\u201d.", "25. On 10 March and 7 May 1998 the District Court held hearings.", "26. On 27 May 1998 the presiding judge and the parties visited the property.

On 24 August 1998 the challenge was dismissed by the District Court but the applicant appealed to the Katowice Regional Court.", "29. On 25 August 1998 the District Court held a hearing. The Government submitted that it had been adjourned since the applicant had failed to attend it and his challenge to the judge had not been decided.

Furthermore, he noted that fifteen hearings had taken place since 24 November 1994. The inspection of the property on 27 May 1998 had been necessary since a new judge had taken over the case and in order to establish the actual condition of the house. The President concluded that in those circumstances the court could not be blamed for the lack of activity in the case.", "34. On 11 March 1999 the Katowice District Court decided that rooms situated in the attic should be used exclusively by the plaintiffs, whereas a room in the basement should be shared with the applicant. Both parties appealed to the Katowice Regional Court.", "35.
