The applicant, Mr Viktor Rozsa, is a Romanian national who was born in 1963 and lives in T\u00e2rgu-Mure\u015f.", "2. The Romanian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr R\u0103zvan-Hora\u0163iu Radu, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.", "3. On 11 May 2004 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of theft. He was later sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment for the said offence.", "4. On the same day the applicant was taken to a cell at T\u00e2rgu-Mure\u015f police station, where he was detained for twenty-nine days. He alleged that, before, while and after being taken to the police station that day, he was repeatedly hit by the police officers accompanying him because he was drunk and refused to answer their questions until a lawyer and a prosecutor were present. Consequently, he asked to be taken to the local Institute of Forensic Medicine to be examined by a forensic doctor.", "5. On 11 May 2004 the applicant was examined by the T\u00e2rgu-Mure\u015f police detention centre\u2019s doctor. A medical report produced the same day stated that the applicant had bruises and contusions on his face, a deformed nasal pyramid and had suffered thoracic trauma as a result of aggression. On the same date he was also examined at the T\u00e2rgu-Mure\u015f County Hospital by a cardiologist, who recorded inter alia in a further medical report of that date that the applicant had suffered cranio-facial injuries.", "6. On 14 May 2004 the applicant was taken to the T\u00e2rgu-Mure\u015f Institute of Forensic Medicine and was examined by a forensic specialist. A report produced on the same date stated that the applicant\u2019s face and body bore several bruises and abrasions and that the injuries could have been caused on 11 May 2004 as a result of direct hitting with or against hard objects. The report also stated that the injuries would require seven to eight days of medical care in order to heal.", "7. On 14 May 2004 the applicant brought criminal proceedings with civil claims for abusive conduct and unlawful arrest against the two police officers who had detained him on 11 May 2004, namely S.R. and C.I.P. He was assisted by a lawyer during the entire course of the proceedings and argued that the two police officers had insulted, threatened and hit him for two hours on 11 May 2004 and had forced him to provide them with statements.", "8. By an order of 20 September 2004 the T\u00e2rgu-Mure\u015f Prosecutor\u2019s Office discontinued the criminal investigation opened against the two police officers on the grounds that no unlawful act had been committed. It found that at 4 a.m. on 11 May 2004, P.H. had witnessed from the window of his home two individuals who were taking things out of the boot of a car. Suspecting that the two individuals were thieves, he decided to go out of his house and stop them. He asked L.S. to call the police and proceeded towards the two individuals, who started to run away. P.H. pursued them and managed to catch the applicant, who was drunk and kept falling over. Although P.H. tried to hold him up until the police arrived, the applicant kept pushing him away in repeated attempts to escape. The applicant was taken to the police station by officers S.R. and C.I.P. and was left in the company of S.R., who attempted to question him. C.I.P. returned to the scene of the crime to take statements from the witnesses, L.S. and P.H. According to the police officers\u2019 statements, the applicant had refused to answer any questions and denied that he had committed any crime. They also stated that he had threatened the officers, which was confirmed by the witness, P.H. The officers alleged that the applicant had become angry because he had not been allowed to leave and had vigorously smashed his head into the window of the room in which he was detained, but had not managed to break it because it was fitted with metal rods. Consequently, the T\u00e2rgu-Mure\u015f Prosecutor\u2019s Office held that the two police officers had acted within the scope of their duties prescribed by law and that the applicant\u2019s injuries, confirmed by the medical forensic report, had been caused by the fight the applicant had had with a third party, namely P.H., and by his own deliberate actions. The applicant appealed against the decision before the hierarchical prosecutor.", "9. By a final order of 27 October 2004, the chief prosecutor of the T\u00e2rgu-Mure\u015f Prosecutor\u2019s Office dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal on the grounds that there was no evidence in the file that the applicant had been hit or insulted by the police officers and that his injuries could have been caused by the third party who had immobilised him. The chief prosecutor held that according to the witness, P.H., the applicant was drunk and when the witness caught him, he attempted to start a fight, but fell and hit the curb, which made his clothes dirty with dust and mud and his face bleed. The same witness stated that although the police officers forced the applicant to get into the police car, they were not violent. The second witness, L.S., confirmed that the applicant attempted to escape from P.H.\u2019s hold several times and that P.H. pinned him to the ground each time. L.S. also confirmed that the applicant\u2019s face was already bleeding and his clothes were covered in dust and mud prior to the police officers\u2019 arrival. Furthermore, the police officers denied having committed an offence and declared that by the time they arrived at the scene, the applicant had been pinned to the ground by P.H., who informed them that there had been a struggle between him and the applicant. The officers further stated that they had taken the applicant to the police car and asked him to lie down because he was bleeding. They also contended that at the police station the applicant had become angry and smashed his head against a glass window. The applicant appealed against the decision before the Mure\u015f County Court, arguing that the forensic investigation, which had taken place several days after the incident, had been superficial because the forensic specialist had not x-rayed his ribs, which had been broken as a result of police aggression.", "10. By a judgment of 28 January 2005, the Mure\u015f County Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal and upheld the order of the Prosecutor\u2019s Office. It held that the injuries suffered by the applicant on 11 May 2004 were undeniable, but that they had been caused as a result of the physical interaction between the applicant and P.H., and the applicant\u2019s own deliberate actions. The applicant appealed against the judgment.", "11. In his written submission before the T\u00e2rgu-Mure\u015f Court of Appeal lodged on 4 April 2005, the applicant stated that he had been beaten by the two police officers. He argued that he had only been taken to a forensic doctor eight or nine days after the incident and that the forensic investigation had been superficial as the doctor had not x-rayed his ribs. Moreover, he had been ill-treated by the police officers before and after being taken to the police station and his requests for a lawyer and a prosecutor to investigate his case had been ignored. Consequently, in an attempt to stop the ill-treatment to which they were subjecting him, he had jumped and smashed into a window fitted with metal rods.", "12. By a final judgment of 4 April 2005 the T\u00e2rgu-Mure\u015f Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal as ill-founded on the grounds that there was no evidence in the file to support the applicant\u2019s claims that his injuries had been caused by the two police officers.", "13. The applicant was transferred to T\u00e2rgu-Mure\u015f Prison from 9 June 2004 to 25 August 2006.", "14.

He claimed that he was suffering from pain in his legs as a result of his condition, which prevented him from sleeping at night.
