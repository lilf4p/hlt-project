No hearings were scheduled between May 1997 and May 1998 on account of the pending expert assessment.", "8. On 16 March 1999 the court rejected the applicant\u2019s claim. In particular, the court found that the applicant had not shown that the apartments in question had defects which were such as to make them uninhabitable. Moreover, having being aware of the state of the apartments before moving in, the applicant had not taken the opportunity to request alternative housing. Furthermore, he had never properly documented the defects he had repaired and the expenses he had borne.", "9. On 29 April 1999 the Zaporizhzhya Regional Court (\u0417\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0456\u0437\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0434)", "10.

Between October 1995 and February 2003 the Melitopil City Court scheduled a total of fifty hearings, forty of which were set up after September 1997, the date, when the Convention entered into force in respect of Ukraine. Some fifteen of them were adjourned on account of the failure of one or more of the defendants to appear or following a defendant\u2019s request for adjournment. Some five hearings were adjourned to allow the court and the defendants to familiarise themselves with adjustments of the applicant\u2019s claims. Three hearings were adjourned on account of the applicant\u2019s requests for adjournments. Seven adjournments were initiated by the court for various reasons. Most hearings were scheduled at intervals from several days to two months. On four occasions the intervals between hearings were between four and six months.", "13.

S.\u2019s civil case. The applicant started arguing with Mr E. Sh. and refused to leave his office when requested to do so. Mr E. Sh. having stepped out into the corridor, the applicant followed and continued to say that the judicial officers were unprofessional and lacked integrity. Several other judges and personnel heard the noise and came to the area seeking to calm the applicant down. The police were called, but the applicant had left the court building before they arrived. The incident lasted for some half an hour.", "16. On 16 August 2001 the Melitopil City Court found that the applicant\u2019s conduct could qualify as hooliganism under the Criminal Code of 1960, in force on the date of the incident, discontinued administrative proceedings and transferred the case to the Melitopil Prosecutor (\u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0440 \u043c. \u041c\u0435\u043b\u0456\u0442\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044f) for a decision on initiating criminal proceedings.", "17.

On 18 April 2002 the new investigator altered the charge, from hooliganism to insult of a judicial officer, pursuant to the provisions of the old Criminal Code. He noted in particular that the charge of hooliganism implied disruption of public order, while in the case at issue there was no evidence that the incident, which had taken place at lunchtime, had in fact disrupted the court\u2019s operation. On the same date the investigator discontinued proceedings in view of the fact that following adoption of the new Criminal Code, insulting a judicial officer was no longer a criminal offence.", "22. On 21 August 2002 the prosecutor\u2019s office annulled this decision and reopened the proceedings. The case was transferred to another investigator.", "23. On 25 November 2002 the new investigator discontinued proceedings on essentially the same grounds as above.", "24. On 16 October 2003 the prosecutor\u2019s office annulled this decision and reopened the proceedings.", "25. On 31 October 2003 the investigator altered the charge to that of hooliganism under the new Criminal Code.", "26. On 5 November 2003 the applicant was placed under an obligation not to abscond.

In particular, the court found that the case file contained insufficient information on whether the incident had disrupted the normal operation of the Melitopil District Court.", "28. On 30 June 2004 the Regional Court upheld this ruling. The case was assigned to a new investigator.", "29. On 27 April 2005 the investigator, having found no evidence that the court\u2019s operation had been in fact disrupted by the applicant\u2019s conduct, altered the charge to insulting a judicial officer pursuant to the Criminal Code of 1960 and discontinued the proceedings in view of the decriminalisation of the offence in question.", "30.

On 4 December 2006 the investigator transferred the case to the Melitopil City Court, requesting it to absolve the applicant of criminal liability in view of the decriminalisation of the offence.", "34. On 18 January 2007 the Melitopil City Court dismissed this request. In particular, it found that since the formal criminal proceedings against the applicant had been instituted after the entry into force of the new Criminal Code, the applicant could not have been charged under the old Code in the first place. The court returned the case to the investigation authorities for rectification of the formulation of the charges. It further ordered that the applicant remain under an obligation not to abscond.", "35. On 12 March 2007 the Regional Court upheld this ruling.", "36.
