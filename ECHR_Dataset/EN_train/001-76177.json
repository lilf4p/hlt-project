On 3 February 1992 the court secured the claim and ordered the applicant to pay 500,000 old zlotys (PLZ) in monthly maintenance for his daughter.

On 11 June 1993 the applicant appealed against the decision of 15 April 1993 by which his previous appeal against the fine imposed on him had been rejected. On 22 June 1993 his appeal was rejected as having been lodged outside the prescribed time-limit.", "16. On 27 July 1993 the court amended its decision concerning maintenance, increasing it to PLZ 900,000. It considered that as a construction engineer the applicant was able to earn approximately PLZ 3,000,000 per month. The applicant appealed.", "17. On 2 September 1993 the applicant appealed against the decision imposing a fine on him. On 9 September 1993 his appeal was rejected as having been lodged after the prescribed time-limit. The applicant appealed against this decision and his appeal was rejected on 29 November 1993.", "18. On 22 October 1993 the court ordered him to comply with the formal requirements in respect of his appeal against the decision of 27 July 1993.

On 12 July 1994 the Warsaw District Prosecutor (Prokurator Rejonowy) submitted to the Warsaw District Court a bill of indictment concerning that charge.", "On 20 June 1994 the prosecutor submitted to the District Court another bill of indictment against the applicant. The applicant was charged with domestic violence against his wife. On 15 September 1994 the Warsaw District Court joined those two cases.", "On 27 November 1995 the Warsaw District Prosecutor submitted to the court another bill of indictment in which he charged the applicant with evading the payment of maintenance for his daughter. Apparently the case was joined to the earlier proceedings.", "On 30 September 2003 the District Court convicted him of the first two charges and acquitted him of the third charge and sentenced him to two years' imprisonment. Upon his appeal, on 6 May 2004 the Warsaw Regional Court stayed the execution of the sentence for a probationary period of five years.", "21.

On 24 November 1995 the Warsaw Regional Court amended its decision of 16 March 1993 in that it increased the frequency of the applicant's meetings with his daughter.

The court also ordered a guardian (kurator s\u0105dowy) to supervise those meetings. Having regard to the opinion of the psychologists, it considered that in the ongoing conflict between the parents, the daughter, who was emotionally attached to her mother, had become more and more unfriendly towards her father, which called for more frequent contacts with the father.", "30. On 29 December 1997 the applicant requested the written grounds for the decision. They were sent to him on 5 February 1998. On 18 February 1998 he appealed against the decision.

On 29 January 1999 the Warsaw Regional Court gave judgment, granting a divorce based on the applicant's fault, and deciding on the daughter's custody and child maintenance.

The applicant appealed on 30 September 1999. On 18 November 1999 the Court of Appeal rejected the applicant's appeal.", "36.

It was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 27 October 2000.", "40. On 28 June 2000 the applicant's appeal against the judgment of 29 January 1999 was rejected on formal grounds for non payment of the appeal fee. The Regional Court noted that the applicant's repeated and unsubstantiated motions for exemption had been dismissed several times and he had failed to pay the fee despite two summonses. The court emphasised that the applicant's only intention was to delay the proceedings, to the detriment of the plaintiff. The applicant appealed on 19 July 2000.", "41.

The judgment of 29 January 1999 became final on 8 August 2001.", "48. Articles 417 et seq. of the Civil Code (Kodeks cywilny) provide for the State's liability in tort.", "In the version applicable until 1 September 2004, Article 417 \u00a7 1, which lays down a general rule, read as follows:", "\u201c1. The State Treasury shall be liable for damage caused by a State official in the course of carrying out the duties entrusted to him.\u201d", "49. Article 418 of the Civil Code, as applicable until 18 December 2001, provided for the following exception in cases where damage resulted from the issue of a decision or order:", "\u201c1. If, in consequence of the issue of a decision or order, a State official has caused damage, the State Treasury shall be liable only if a breach of the law has been involved in the issue of the decision or order and if that breach is the subject of prosecution under the criminal law or of a disciplinary investigation, and the guilt of the person who caused the damage in question has been established by a final conviction or has been admitted by the superior of that person.", "2. The inability to establish guilt by way of a criminal conviction or in a decision given in disciplinary proceedings shall not exclude the State Treasury's liability for damage if such proceedings cannot be instituted in view of a [statutory] exception to prosecution or disciplinary action.\u201d", "50. On 1 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on amendments to the Civil Code and other statutes (Ustawa o zmianie ustawy \u2013 Kodeks cywilny oraz niekt\u00f3rych innych ustaw) (\u201cthe 2004 Amendment\u201d) entered into force. While the relevant amendments have in essence been aimed at enlarging the scope of the State Treasury's liability for tort under Article 417 of the Civil Code \u2013 including the addition of a new Article 4171 and the imposition on the State of tortious liability for its omission to enact legislation (the so-called \u201clegislative omission\u201d; \u201czaniedbanie legislacyjne\u201d) \u2013 they are also to be seen in the context of the operation of a new statute introducing remedies for the unreasonable length of judicial proceedings.", "Following the 2004 Amendment, Article 4171, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:", "\u201c3. If damage has been caused by failure to give a ruling (orzeczenie) or decision (decyzja) where there is a statutory duty to give them, reparation for [the damage] may be sought after it has been established in the relevant proceedings that the failure to give a ruling or decision was contrary to the law, unless otherwise provided for by other specific provisions.\u201d", "51. However, under the transitional provisions of Article 5 of the 2004 Amendment, Article 417 as applicable before 1 September 2004 shall apply to all events and legal situations that subsisted before that date.", "52. On 4 December 2001 the Constitutional Court (Trybuna\u0142 Konstytucyjny) dealt with two constitutional complaints in which the applicants challenged the constitutionality of Article 417 and 418 of the Civil Code. They alleged, in particular, that those provisions were incompatible with Articles 64 and 77 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.", "On the same day the Constitutional Court gave judgment (no. SK 18/00) and held that Article 417 of the Civil Code was compatible with Article 77 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution in so far as it provided that the State Treasury was liable for damage caused by the unlawful action of a State official carried out in the course of performing his duties. It further held that even though Article 418 of the Civil Code was compatible with Article 64 of the Constitution, it was contrary to Article 77 \u00a7 1 since it linked the award of compensation for such damage with the personal culpability of the State official concerned, established in criminal or disciplinary proceedings.", "53. On 18 December 2001, the date on which the Constitutional Court's judgment took effect, Article 418 was repealed. The Constitutional Court's opinion on the consequences of the repeal read, in so far as relevant:", "\u201cThe elimination of Article 418 of the Civil Code from the legal system ... means that the State Treasury's liability for the actions of a public authority consisting in the issue of unlawful decisions or orders will flow from the general principles of the State liability laid down in Article 417 of the Civil Code. This, however, does not rule out the application in the present legal system of other principles of State liability laid down in specific statutes and not necessarily only those listed in the Civil Code.\u201d", "54.
