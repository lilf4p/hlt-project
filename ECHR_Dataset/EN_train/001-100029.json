At about 9 a.m. on 2 April 2003 the first applicant went with Artur Akhmatkhanov to the Shali town centre to run errands.

About ten minutes after the applicant returned home she heard shooting coming from the former medical storehouse located about 250 metres from her house.

Having fetched the document, the applicant walked back to the town centre. On her way there she approached the storehouse and saw that the area was cordoned off by Russian military servicemen, who were not letting people in or out of the cordon. About half an hour later the applicant saw the military leaving in four APCs (armoured personnel carriers). About ten masked soldiers in new camouflage uniforms with white stripes on their sleeves were on each vehicle. One of the APCs was painted in camouflage colours.", "10. As soon as the military left, the applicant and other locals went to the site. There the applicant found a white bandage with traces of blood on it and blood spattered around it on the ground.", "11. After that the first applicant went to the town centre where she was supposed to meet her son. She did not find him there and decided to ask their relative Mr A.A. whether Artur Akhmatkhanov had called in at his office. She went to the ROVD, where she was told that her son had stopped off, looking for Mr A.A., but the latter had not been in the office and the applicant's son had left.", "12. Meanwhile, the second applicant informed the ROVD that his son's yellow cap had been found at the site of the shooting.

From a distance she saw that the armed men were dragging a young man in black clothing with a sack over his head. They forced the man into one of the APCs and drove away.", "15. According to another resident of Shali, Ms R.Kh., at about 10.30 a.m. on 2 April 2003 she was walking down the applicants' street when she saw military servicemen in four APCs.
