On 16 May 1991 the court requested the expert to supplement his opinion. In this connection the defendants were asked to deliver additional documents.

On 26 September 2005 the applicant asked the Nowy Dw\u00f3r Mazowiecki District Court to issue an enforcement order for the judgment of 24 July 2002, submitting that the defendants, by lodging successive procedural motions and subsequently appealing against all decisions, were aiming solely at prolonging the proceedings and avoiding the execution of the judgment.

At the same time she asked the court to have her complaint transferred to the Warsaw Regional Court, which was competent to examine it. She described in two pages the delays in the proceedings, and submitted that: \u201cfor these reasons I lodge a complaint about the excessive length of the proceedings\u201d. She also asked the court to instruct the lower court to terminate the proceedings without further delay.", "54.

On 31 March 2005 the Warsaw Regional Court rejected her complaint on formal grounds. It considered that it was tainted with a formal shortcoming, namely that it did not contain an express request to find that there had been an unreasonable delay in the proceedings.", "56. On 14 April 2005 the applicant lodged a fresh complaint of excessive length of proceedings. In the title of her application she referred in direct terms (by providing the case\u2019s exact register number) to the currently pending appeal proceedings, as required by the relevant law. In the substance of her complaint she described in detail the proceedings in their entirety as pending from 1984. She also indicated the different register numbers with which the case was designated throughout the entire period of its examination. She concluded her complaint by requesting the court to immediately terminate the proceedings in her case, which had been pending as of 1984. It transpires that she complied with all the formal requirements of a complaint as provided by the 2004 Act.", "57. On 5 July 2005 the Warsaw Regional Court rejected her complaint as unfounded. The court considered only the length of the appeal proceedings, the applicant had referred to in her complaint\u2019s title, namely after the decision of 24 July 2002 had been given, and found that there were no unreasonable delays in the examination of the numerous requests made by the defendants after that date. They were considered speedily. On several occasions the defendants had to be summoned to rectify formal shortcomings in their requests. In this connection the court observed that the time-limits given had been complied with. Hence, no evidence was found in support of the conclusion that unreasonable delays had occurred in the case. The court concluded that nothing in the case file could suggest that the length of proceedings was excessive.", "58. On 17 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w post\u0119powaniu s\u0105dowym bez nieuzasadnionej zw\u0142oki) (\u201cthe 2004 Act\u201d) entered into force. It lays down various legal means designed to counteract and/or redress the undue length of judicial proceedings. A party to pending proceedings may ask for the acceleration of those proceedings and/or just satisfaction for their unreasonable length under Article 2 read in conjunction with Article 5(1) of the 2004 Act.", "Article 6 \u00a7 2 provides that a complaint must include:", "1) a request to find that there was an unreasonable delay in the impugned proceedings;", "2) an indication of circumstances that would justify the request.", "According to Article 9 of the Act, when a complaint does not meet the requirements of Article 6 of the Act, it must be rejected without a prior request to the plaintiff to remedy the shortcomings in the complaint.", "59.
