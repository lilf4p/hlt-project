U-I-60/98) that the disputed provisions of Sections 145A and 145C of the 1998 Act did not conflict with the Constitution because such interference with the constitutional rights granted in Articles 30 (right to rehabilitation and compensation in criminal proceedings) and 33 (right to own and inherit property) of the Constitution was indispensable for the protection of the rights of other claimants under the DA.", "Placing unjustly convicted persons on an equal footing with all other rightful claimants regarding the redress of post-war wrongs was an appropriate means through which the legislator had achieved his aim.
