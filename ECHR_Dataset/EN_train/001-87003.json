The applicant company was established in 1995 and has its registered office in Yerevan. The second applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Yerevan.", "5. The second applicant first became involved in TV broadcasting in January 1991 when he established the A1+ television company, the first independent television company in Armenia. Initially, A1+ operated as a collector, producer and disseminator of news and information. Information was gathered from and sent to all districts of Armenia, as well as foreign television broadcasting companies via satellite communication.", "6. In 1994 A1+ acquired a State television licensed frequency on which it broadcast during assigned periods. According to the second applicant, in 1995 A1+ experienced difficulties with the State regarding its broadcasts: telephone calls were received from public officials on a daily basis threatening to deprive A1+ of its assigned broadcasting hours and criticising the contents of A1+ programmes perceived to be directed against Government policy. A1+ was informed that the broadcast frequencies were granted by the State in order to defend and further State interests rather than to criticise State authorities. During the run-up to the presidential election, A1+ refused to broadcast only pro-Government material. As a result, its State broadcasting operation was suspended in May 1995.", "7. In 1995 the second applicant established and registered the applicant company. The applicant company was set up as an independent broadcasting company outside State control. Later the second applicant created the A1+ television company within the structure of the applicant company. On 1 January 1996, in preparation for broadcasting, the applicant company opened a school to train personnel, such as journalists, cameramen and technicians, who were later employed by the applicant company and other television companies. On 25 August 1996 the applicant company started television broadcasting, sharing capacity and content with Moscow \u201cREN\u201d TV, a Russian television company. Over time, the volume of the content produced by the applicant company increased significantly.", "8. On 22 January 1997 the applicant company was granted a licence by the then Ministry of Communication (\u0540\u0540 \u056f\u0561\u057a\u056b \u0576\u0561\u056d\u0561\u0580\u0561\u0580\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0576) permitting it to install a television transmitter in Yerevan and to broadcast within the decimetric wave band via its A1+ television channel. The licence was granted for a period of five years.", "9. In September 1999 the applicant company established \u201cHamaspyur\u201d, a network of nine private licensed regional television companies, broadcasting 24 hours a day. According to the applicants, the television network was widely recognised as one of the few independent voices in television broadcasting in Armenia. The primary focus was upon the dissemination of independent, well-processed news information and analysis. The content of the broadcasts included international and domestic news analysis (30%), advertising (32%) and various entertainment programmes.", "10. In 2000-2001 legislative changes were introduced in the sphere of television and radio broadcasting.

During 2001 all existing broadcasting licences were temporarily re-registered by the NTRC until the relevant calls for tenders were announced.", "12. On 3 September 2001 the NTRC replaced the applicant company's licence with a new licence. The new licence was granted for band 37 and was due to expire on 22 January 2002.", "13.

The applicant company and two other companies, Sharm Ltd and Dofin TV Ltd, submitted bids for band 37. The applicant company alleged that Sharm Ltd had never previously operated in the field of television broadcasting and its main focus had been as the organiser of entertainment shows for young people and students. None of its employees had a background in professional journalism and the company had no premises, equipment or financial or technical infrastructure to commence broadcasting at the time of its bid. It further alleged that Dofin TV Ltd had been registered less than a month before the tender process took place and had had no previous experience of any sort in the field of broadcasting.", "18.

On 16 April 2002 the applicant company lodged an additional claim with the Commercial Court seeking, inter alia, to annul the decision of 2 April 2002.", "22. On 25 April 2002 the Commercial Court rejected the applicant company's claims.", "23. On an unspecified date the applicant company lodged an appeal on points of law with the Court of Cassation (\u0540\u0540 \u057e\u0573\u057c\u0561\u0562\u0565\u056f \u0564\u0561\u057f\u0561\u0580\u0561\u0576).", "24.

On 18 November 2002 the tender process was suspended in connection with court proceedings instituted against the NTRC by some other participants in the call for tenders.", "34. On 18 July 2003 the NTRC held points-based votes and recognised the winners of the call for tenders: band 31 was assigned to ArmenAakob TV, band 39 to TV 5 and band 51 to Yerevan TV. The NTRC's decisions were identical in wording to its decision of 11 June 2003. Copies of these decisions were sent to the applicant company on 19 July 2003.", "35. On an unspecified date, the second applicant submitted a letter to the Chairman of the NTRC requesting the latter to inform him of the reasons for the refusal of a licence in accordance with section 51 of the Broadcasting Act. The second applicant also requested the NTRC to adopt a decision refusing a licence following its consideration of the applicant company's bid, as required by sections 63 and 67 of the NTRC Regulations Act. He further requested the NTRC to provide the results of the examination of the applicant company's bid, the minutes of its hearings and the separate opinions of its members.", "36. In another letter, the second applicant requested the Chairman of the NTRC to provide copies of the bids submitted by the companies which submitted the winning tenders for bands 25, 31, 39 and 51.", "37. By two letters, both dated 11 August 2003, the NTRC replied to the second applicant in terms identical to its letter of 1 July 2003. The letters added that the second applicant could familiarise himself with the minutes of the hearings and the relevant bids at the NTRC's office, where he could also make photocopies of the bids with his own technical means.", "38. On an unspecified date, the NTRC announced a call for tenders for bands 3 and 63.", "39. The applicant company and two other companies, AR TV and Cinemax, submitted bids for both bands.", "40.

On 29 September 2003 the applicant company lodged two applications with the Commercial Court complaining about the NTRC's inaction. In particular, the applicant company submitted that the NTRC was obliged under Section 51 of the Broadcasting Act to notify in writing the reasons for the refusal of a licence in the calls for tenders for band 25 and bands 31, 39 and 51 within ten days after taking the relevant decisions, and under section 63 of the NTRC Regulations Act to take a decision to grant or refuse a licence in respect of each bid submitted. The applicant company sought, inter alia, a declaration that the failure of the NTRC to notify the reasons for the refusals and to take any decision in respect of its bids was unlawful, and an order obliging the NTRC to give reasons for the refusals.", "47. On 22 March 2004 the applicant company lodged another application, supplementing the initial two with similar complaints in respect of the calls for tenders for bands 3 and 63 and band 56.", "48. On 23 March 2004 the Commercial Court decided to dismiss the applicant company's applications as unfounded. In doing so, having examined the parties' arguments, the Commercial Court found, inter alia, that:", "\u201cIt is understood from section 47 of [the Broadcasting Act], sections 30, 47, 61 and 63 of [the NTRC] Regulations Act, and Paragraphs 18 and 19 of [the Tendering Rules] that [the NTRC] must adopt only one of the decisions envisaged by section 63 of [the NTRC] Regulations Act, and in the cases in question [the NTRC] adopted the decision recognising the winner and granting a television and radio broadcasting licence not in respect of each bid but based on the results of the call for tenders. The above is also directly implied in the wording of section 61 Paragraph 2 of [the NTRC] Regulations Act, according to which decisions to award television and radio broadcasting licences shall be adopted by [the NTRC] based on the results of the tender process and not as a result of the examination of a bid.", "The law actually distinguishes between cases where licences are awarded on the basis of the results of a tender process and cases where they are awarded without a call for tenders, as in the case of cable broadcasting licences. That being so, [the NTRC], based on the results of the tender process, adopted one of the decisions envisaged by section 63 of [the NTRC] Regulations Act, namely to grant a television and radio broadcasting licence.", "...", "[The NTRC's] decision to grant a licence to the winner of the call for tenders cannot be interpreted other than as a decision refusing a licence to the other participants in the bidding. Following the adoption of a decision by [the NTRC] determining the winner of the call for tenders and awarding a licence to it, there can be no uncertainty for the other participants in the tender process as to whether their bid has or has not been refused, since they are told who the winner is and, consequently, that they have not won.", "...", "It has been established in the court proceedings that [the NTRC], in keeping with the requirements of section 50 of [the Broadcasting Act], section 63 of [the NTRC] Regulations Act and Paragraph 19 of the Rules, adopted decisions granting television broadcasting licences and sent them to [the applicant company] within the period prescribed by section 67 of [the NTRC] Regulations Act and Paragraph 22 of the Rules, as evidenced by [the letters of 12 June, 19 July, 14 October and 30 December 2003].", "The above-mentioned letters actually serve as evidence that [the NTRC] informed [the applicant company] that it was not selected as the best organisation in the tender process, and, having been informed of the decisions concerned, [the applicant company] also learnt that it had not won the television broadcasting licences for decimetric bands 25, 31, 39, 51, 56 and 63, and metric band 3 in the Yerevan area, meaning that its bid was rejected, which substantiates the fact that [the applicant company] was informed of the reasons and legal grounds for the above-mentioned decisions of [the NTRC], and in particular that [the NTRC], in adopting its decision, was guided by the requirements of section 50 of [the Broadcasting Act], which establishes the selection criteria for licence holders.", "Thus, in the light of the above the court concludes that [the second applicant] was informed in a timely and lawful manner about the decisions concerning the results of the television broadcasting licensing tender processes for decimetric bands 25, 31, 39, 51, 56 and 63, and metric band 3 in the Yerevan area, which in substance contained the grounds and reasons for the refusal of [the applicant company's] bids. Consequently, [the NTRC] did not display inaction and did not violate [the applicant company's] rights guaranteed by law, therefore these claims are unfounded and must be dismissed.\u201d", "49. On 1 April 2004 the applicant company lodged an appeal on points of law, raising the same arguments as in its initial applications.", "50. On 23 April 2004 the Court of Cassation dismissed that appeal, repeating verbatim the relevant findings of the Commercial Court and concluding that:", "\u201cIn such circumstances the arguments raised in the appeal on points of law are unfounded because they are rebutted in detail by the findings contained in the Commercial Court's judgment.\u201d", "51. On 11 December 2003 the applicant company instituted proceedings in the Commercial Court against the NTRC, contesting its decision of 13 October 2003 awarding the licence for band 63 to Cinemax Ltd. The applicant company submitted, inter alia, that Cinemax Ltd had provided false, incomplete and misleading information in its tender which the NTRC had ignored when granting the licence. It further submitted that Cinemax Ltd had neither the means nor the intention to broadcast on that frequency and would effectively pass on its broadcasting licence to a company called Armnews TV, which was unregistered as a media entity.", "52. In the proceedings before the Commercial Court, the applicant company lodged several requests for the NTRC to be ordered to provide certain documents which it allegedly had in its possession and which, according to the applicant company, were relevant to the outcome of the case, including an agreement signed between Cinemax Ltd and Armnews TV allegedly contained in the former's tender documents. It also requested the court to call Mr S., the head of Armnews TV, as a witness.", "53. The Commercial Court examined and dismissed these requests. As to the request to order the provision of certain documents, the Commercial Court found that the applicant company had failed to substantiate its inability to obtain this evidence on its own, as required by the law. Nor was it proven that the evidence in question was actually in the NTRC's possession. As to the request to call Mr S., the Commercial Court found this to be unnecessary because there was sufficient written evidence to decide on the disputed matters.", "54. On 21 January 2004 the Commercial Court decided, in a judgment containing two and a half pages of legal reasoning, to reject the applicant company's claims as unfounded. In doing so, having examined the parties' arguments, the Commercial Court found, inter alia, that the relevant tender process had been conducted, and the resulting decision taken, in compliance with the law.", "55. On 4 February 2004 the applicant company lodged an appeal on points of law, which it later supplemented on 10 February 2004, raising the same arguments as in its initial application.", "56.
