The applicant was born in 1936 and lives in Ko\u0161ka.", "5. On 8 October 1996 the applicant brought a civil action against a certain artisan B.P. in the Pula Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Puli) seeking payment.", "6. The court held hearings on 12 November (in the applicant's absence) and 19 December 1997, 28 January 1998, 3 September and 4 October 1999, 3 February, 3 March and 5 December 2000 and 9 January and 7 May 2001.", "7. The hearings scheduled for 15 July 1998 and 16 November 1999 were adjourned on the applicant's request. Those scheduled for 14 December 1999 and 14 March 2001 were also adjourned.", "8. The hearing scheduled for 31 October 2000 was adjourned since the parties attempted to reach an in-court settlement (sudska nagodba).", "9. At the hearing held on 7 May 2001 the Municipal Court gave judgment accepting the applicant's claim in part. The respondent appealed on 24 December 2001 and on 1 February 2002 his appeal was together with the case-file forwarded to the Pula County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Puli).", "10. On 13 October 2003 the Pula County Court quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case.", "11. In the resumed proceedings, the Pula Municipal Court held hearings on 2 March and 22 November 2004 and 21 February 2005.", "12. At the hearing held on 7 March 2005 the court gave new judgment accepting the applicant's claim in part.", "13. On 16 January 2006 the Pula County Court dismissed the respondent's appeal and upheld the first-instance judgment.", "14. On 24 March 2006 the applicant applied to the Pula Municipal Court for enforcement of the above judgment by garnishment of funds from the debtor's bank accounts. On 29 March 2006 the court issued a writ of execution (rje\u0161enje o ovrsi) garnishing temporarily the funds on all debtor's bank accounts. After having received the relevant information from the banks, on 9 May 2006 the court invited the applicant to specify, within eight days, from which savings account the funds should be seized. Since the applicant did not do so within the prescribed period, on 3 July 2006 the court issued a decision discontinuing the enforcement proceedings. The decision became final on 16 July 2006.", "15. Meanwhile, on 7 June 2006 the applicant instituted new enforcement proceedings before the same court seeking execution of the same judgment. However, in these proceedings he sought to satisfy his claim, alternatively, by garnishment of funds from the debtor's bank account or by seizure and sale of his movable property. On 9 June 2006 the court issued a writ of execution. On 27 November 2006 the court scheduled the intervention of the bailiff (sudski ovr\u0161itelj) for 17 January 2007. A day before the intervention the applicant asked for postponement of enforcement. The request was granted and the enforcement postponed until 8 May 2007. Afterwards the court continued the proceedings and on 15 June 2007 served the writ of execution to the debtor's bank with a view to seizing the funds and transferring them to the applicant's account. Following the applicant's request of 19 July 2007 to continue with the seizure of the debtor's movables, the court scheduled the bailiff's intervention for 19 November 2007. The bailiff effected the in situ inspection as scheduled but found no movable property susceptible to seizure.", "It appears that the proceedings are still pending.", "16.

The court held hearings on 4 April, 4 and 20 May and 14 September 1999. The hearings scheduled for 4 March and 24 August 1999 were postponed because the applicant had not received the summons whereas the one scheduled for 7 October 1999 was postponed at his request. The hearing scheduled for 2 November 1999 was postponed because the summoned witness failed to attend.", "19. As the applicant did not attend two successive hearings held on 2 December 1999 and 2 May 2000, the court issued a decision declaring that his action was considered withdrawn. The applicant then filed a request for restoring the proceedings to the status quo ante (prijedlog za povrat u prija\u0161nje stanje), which the court granted on 20 June 2000.", "20.

On 6 July 2006 the bailiff effected an in situ inspection at the address provided by the applicant only to find that the debtor company was no longer doing business at that address. Accordingly, on 6 July 2006 the court issued an instruction inviting the applicant to submit another address within the following three months in the absence of which it would discontinue the enforcement proceedings. The instruction was served on the applicant on 18 October 2006.", "34. On 15 January 2007 the applicant requested the court to summon the debtor company's director with a view to disclosing the company's assets (prokazni popis imovine). The court granted the request and scheduled a hearing for 25 April 2007, which the summoned director failed to attend. After the director had failed to appear at the next hearing scheduled for 13 July 2007, the court requested the police authorities to inquire about his address. The next hearing was scheduled for 6 November 2007.", "It appears that the proceedings are still pending.", "35.

Having regard in particular to the applicant's conduct (who failed to attend one hearing and asked for adjournment of another two hearings), it held that the first proceedings had not exceeded a reasonable time.", "42. However, it would appear that the Constitutional Court is still examining the applicant's first complaint in respect of the second set of proceedings.", "43. On 7 April 2005 the Constitutional Court also dismissed the applicant's second constitutional complaint. Taking into account particularly the applicant's conduct (who brought his action in the first-instance court having no territorial jurisdiction), it held that the length of the proceedings complained of had not been excessive.", "44.
