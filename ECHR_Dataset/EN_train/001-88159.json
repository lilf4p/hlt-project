POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson;Giovanni Bonello;J\u00e1n \u0160ikuta;Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Mihai Poalelungi", "TEXT": ["The applicant, Mr Janusz Kopij, is a Polish national who was born in 1953 and lives in Malbork. He was represented before the Court by Mr M. Romanowski, a lawyer practising in Gda\u0144sk. The Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "On 22 May 2002 the applicant was arrested by the police.", "On 23 May 2002 the Gda\u0144sk District Court decided to place the applicant in pre-trial detention in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed an armed robbery as a member of an organised criminal gang.", "On 13 August and 14 November 2002 the Gda\u0144sk Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) further extended his detention relying in particular on the risk that a heavy sentence would be imposed, which made it probable that the applicant would interfere with the course of the investigation. Moreover, the complexity of the proceedings justified keeping the applicant in detention.", "Subsequently, the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention was extended, inter alia, on 19 December 2002 and 11 March 2003. The Regional Court reiterated the original grounds given for his detention and held that keeping the applicant in custody was necessary for securing the obtaining of evidence.", "On 7 May 2003 the Gda\u0144sk Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny), upon an application from the Gda\u0144sk Regional Prosecutor (Prokurator Okr\u0119gowy), further extended the applicant\u2019s pretrial detention. In addition to reiterating the grounds relied on previously, the court considered that the complexity of the case and the large number of coaccused justified the fear that, if released, the applicant would interfere with the course of the proper conduct of the proceedings.", "On 16 June 2003 the applicant and 14 other co-accused were indicted before the Gda\u0144sk Regional Court. The applicant was accused of having participated in an organised criminal gang, having committed two armed robberies and having been in possession of an illegal firearm.", "On 26 June and 18 December 2003 the Gda\u0144sk Regional Court extended the applicant\u2019s pretrial detention. It considered that the severity of the possible sentence justified the fear that, if released, the applicant would attempt to influence witnesses or abscond.", "Afterwards, as the length of the applicant\u2019s detention had reached the statutory timelimit of 2 years laid down in Article 263 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Kodeks post\u0119powania karnego), the Regional Court applied to the Gda\u0144sk Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) asking for the applicant\u2019s detention to be extended beyond that term. On 12 May, 22 September and 28 December 2004 the Gda\u0144sk Court of Appeal allowed the applications and extended his pretrial detention. The court reiterated the grounds given previously.", "On 14 June and 22 November 2005 the applicant\u2019s detention was further extended. The court observed that the period of detention had not been excessive given the complexity of the case and the need to secure the proper course of the final stages of the trial.", "On 27 February 2006 the applicant\u2019s detention was further extended.", "The applicant\u2019s numerous applications for release and appeals against the decisions prolonging his detention were to no avail.", "On 30 May 2006 the Gda\u0144sk Regional Court gave a judgment convicting the applicant as charged. The applicant was sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment.", "On 26 April 2007 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Gda\u0144sk Court of Appeal. The proceedings are pending and the applicant remains in detention.", "Between 15 April 2004 and 17 January 2007 the applicant served a sentence of imprisonment ordered in another set of criminal proceedings.", "The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of pre-trial detention (aresztowanie tymczasowe), the grounds for its extension, release from detention and rules governing other, so-called \u201cpreventive measures\u201d (\u015brodki zapobiegawcze) are set out in the Court\u2019s judgments in the cases of Go\u0142ek v. Poland, no. 31330/02, \u00a7\u00a7 27-33, 25 April 2006 and Celejewski v.
