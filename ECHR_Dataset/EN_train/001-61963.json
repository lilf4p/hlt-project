In response, the villagers requested the commander's permission to remain in the village long enough to harvest their crops.", "11. Commander Hac\u0131 \u0130lba\u015f began to pressurise and intimidate the villagers. No cars were allowed in or out of the village. The livestock was taken away from the villagers.

On 15 October 1996 Hac\u0131 \u0130lba\u015f sent all the documents concerning the incident to the office of the Lice Public Prosecutor along with an explanatory letter. In his letter he explained that the death of Sariye Y\u0131lmaz and H\u00fcrriyet Do\u011fan's injuries were the result of random shooting by the terrorists.

On 23 July 2001, upon the Lice District Governor's inquiry, the Lice Gendarmerie Commander sent him a letter stating that it was clear from the incident report and the witness statements that the applicant's wife was killed by members of the PKK. He maintained that there was no documentation in their files which proved that, after examining the corpse of the applicant's wife, a senior lieutenant drafted a report in which the cause of death was described as resulting from artillery shell fire. Moreover, he stated that the letter sent by them to the Registry Office in which the PKK was stated to be responsible for the death of Sariye Y\u0131lmaz, had not been found in their files.

Moreover, it was incorrect that a senior lieutenant had examined the corpse of the applicant's wife and drafted a report which concluded that she had died due to a shrapnel wound caused by an artillery shell fired by soldiers. Such a report did not exist. It was apparent from the witness statements and from the incident report that the perpetrators of the incident were members of the PKK.
