The applicant was born in 1943 and lives in \u015e\u0131rnak.", "5. The facts surrounding the arrest and detention of the applicant are disputed between the parties.", "6. On an unspecified date, the applicant was contacted by two persons in the centre of \u015e\u0131rnak who asked him either to give them money or to help them. They did not specify what they wished the applicant to do. The applicant refused their request. On 11 June 1998, one week after this incident, they again contacted the applicant, asked him to help them and threatened him with death. As the applicant was scared, he followed their instructions. He went near to a cemetery outside the city centre where two armed men appeared. They asked him about the supplies and when the applicant told them that he did not know about the supplies, they beat him. Subsequently, four or five other plain-clothes persons carrying weapons arrived. They tied the applicant\u2019s hands and covered his mouth. One of them had a radio with which he talked to someone whom he addressed as \u201cmy commander\u201d. The applicant was then blindfolded, put in a vehicle and taken to the \u015e\u0131rnak provincial gendarmerie command.", "7. During his detention in the custody of the gendarmerie the applicant was subjected to ill-treatment. In particular he was stripped naked and beaten.

Furthermore, the gendarmerie officers attempted to rape him.", "8. In the evening of 11 June 1998, the applicant\u2019s son, Mehmet \u00d6zen, applied to the \u015e\u0131rnak Security Directorate claiming that his father left home at around 8 - 8.30 a.m. to go to their farm and that he was seen by one of their neighbours, \u00d6mer Katar, at around midday being abducted by an armed group of six or seven persons. On 12 June 1998 an official report was drawn up concerning Mehmet \u00d6zen\u2019s claim.", "9. On 13 June 1998 a similar protocol was drawn up containing \u00d6mer Katar\u2019s statement about the applicant\u2019s arrest.

On 15 June 1998 the applicant was brought before a forensic doctor, Mr Veli G\u00fcl.

The applicant was forced to apply his thumbprint to this document.", "12. On 24 June 1998 the applicant was examined by the same doctor who noted the presence of the traces of old bruises on his shoulders and arms.", "13. On the same day the applicant was brought before the \u015e\u0131rnak public prosecutor. He denied the accusations against him. The statements that he had allegedly made at the gendarmerie command were read to him. The applicant denied that he had made these statements and maintained that he had been forced to sign them. He claimed that he had been threatened with death by two men unless he delivered a bag to some people whose identity was not known to him.", "14. After being questioned by the public prosecutor he was brought before the \u015e\u0131rnak Magistrates\u2019 Court (Sulh Ceza Mahkemesi), where he denied the charges against him. He further pleaded not guilty and reiterated his statement that he had made before the Chief Public Prosecutor. The \u015e\u0131rnak Magistrates\u2019 Court ordered the applicant\u2019s detention on remand. The court also took note of the applicant\u2019s allegation that he was threatened with death and decided to refer his complaint to the public prosecutor\u2019s office.", "15.

Although on 11 June 1998 the applicant\u2019s son lodged a petition with the security directorate and on 13 June 1998 the applicant\u2019s neighbour stated that he had seen the applicant being taken away by seven men, there is no statement indicating that the persons who abducted the applicants had been gendarmerie officers.", "18. According to the arrest report signed by four gendarmerie officers, on 15 June 1998, at around 8.30 a.m., following information received by the gendarmerie officers the applicant was captured in a rural area while carrying a bag containing clothes that he was taking to members of the PKK.

On 21 December 1998 the applicant\u2019s representative stated before the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court that the applicant was arrested on 11 June 1998. He alleged that the protocols prepared by gendarmerie officers contained false information. He maintained that the medical report of 15 June 1998 established the ill-treatment of the applicant received at the hands of gendarmerie officers. He further complained that the length of the applicant\u2019s detention was excessive. He made an oral complaint against the gendarmerie officers in relation to the ill-treatment of the applicant before the State Security Court and requested the court to notify the public prosecutor\u2019s office concerning their complaint. In reply to the request of the applicant\u2019s representative the State Security Court stated:", "\u201cIt has been decided that the representative of the accused be authorised to lodge a complaint with the public prosecutor\u2019s office where the act took place and that the copy of the hearing minutes be provided if needed.\u201d", "24.

On the same day, the applicant made statements before the court with the assistance of the interpreter. He maintained, inter alia, that he was at his farm on the day of his arrest when two persons arrived and asked him to give them money. When he refused their request, they beat him. Subsequently, they tied his hands and covered his mouth and took him to a place, where there were supplies. They then asked him to accept that the supplies belonged to him but he refused. The applicant further denied the accuracy of the arrest and scene of the incident reports. The first-instance court decided to postpone the hearing as the statements of the gendarmerie officers had not been taken. It further ordered the applicant\u2019s release pending trial.", "27. On 22 March 1999 the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court postponed the hearing as the statements of the gendarmerie officers had not been taken.", "28.

The applicant\u2019s lawyer maintained before the Court that the contents of these statements and the arrest and scene of the incident reports were contradictory. The court once again postponed the hearing as it had not received the statements of two gendarmerie officers.", "29. On an unspecified date, the statements of the two officers were sent to the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court.", "30. On 18 June 1999 Turkey\u2019s Grand National Assembly amended Article 143 of the Constitution and excluded military members from State Security Courts.

At the hearing held on 27 September 1999 the first-instance court heard the applicant\u2019s lawyer\u2019s final submissions on the merits of the case. On the same day, the court noticed that the applicant\u2019s statements of 8 February 1999 had been taken without the bill of indictment having been read to him. The court therefore requested the \u015e\u0131rnak Assize Court to read out the bill of indictment to the applicant and to take his statements with the assistance of an interpreter.", "33. On an unspecified date the applicant made statements before the \u015e\u0131rnak Assize Court with the assistance of an interpreter. These statements were sent to the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court.", "34.

The military judge sitting on the bench of the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court was present at one preliminary hearing and six hearings on the merits until June 1999.
