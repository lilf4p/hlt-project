In the period between 10 September and 13 October 1999 the applicant had in-patient treatment in the Odessa Region Psychiatric Hospital (\u201cthe hospital\u201d) which is a State-run institution.

On 24 September 2003 the applicant was assessed by a doctor at the psychoneurological dispensary and referred to the hospital for in-patient treatment for a serious mental disorder. However, the applicant ignored the referral and stayed at home with her mother. A report of the applicant\u2019s assessment was provided to the hospital.", "8. In the next few days the applicant\u2019s condition worsened and her behaviour became aggressive towards her mother and neighbours. The mother and the housing maintenance authority therefore complained to the hospital about the applicant\u2019s conduct.", "9. In the morning of 28 September 2003 the applicant was taken to the hospital by ambulance and was assessed by a psychiatrist of the hospital, who concluded that she needed to be hospitalised for a serious mental disorder. The applicant was therefore kept in the hospital.", "10. On 29 September 2003 a panel of three different psychiatrists of the hospital assessed the applicant once again and issued a report stating that she was a danger to society due to her serious mental disorder, which required in-patient psychiatric treatment. The psychiatrists specified in the report that the applicant\u2019s manner of communication with her mother and neighbours was aggressive; she threatened them, threw glass jars, bottles and vases off the balcony, which was on the fifth floor, played loud music at night and damaged property in the apartment.", "11. The hospital therefore lodged an application with a local court, seeking authorisation for compulsory admission to hospital in accordance with sections 14 and 16 of the Psychiatric Assistance Act.", "12. On 30 September 2003 a judge at the local court conducted an onsite hearing of the applicant\u2019s case in the administration wing of the hospital.

After the assessment, the applicant\u2019s condition worsened in a similar way as before the second hospitalisation and the neighbours and the housing maintenance authority complained to the hospital about her behaviour.", "17. In the morning of 19 July 2004 the applicant was taken to the hospital by ambulance and assessed by a psychiatrist there, who concluded that she was suffering from a mental disorder and needed to be hospitalised. The applicant was therefore kept in the hospital.", "18. On 20 July 2004 a panel of three psychiatrists of the hospital, including the psychiatrist who had assessed the applicant the previous day, issued a report stating that the applicant was a danger to society due to her serious mental disorder and that she needed in-patient treatment. The hospital therefore applied to the court for an order for compulsory admission.", "19. On 21 July 2004 the local court allowed the application, following an on-site hearing held in the administration wing of the hospital. The hearing was attended by the prosecutor and one of the psychiatrists who had previously assessed the applicant. The court held as follows:", "\u201c... having examined the case file and heard a representative of [the hospital] and a prosecutor, the court considers that the application in question should be allowed.", "It appears from the case file that on 19 July 2004 the patient was taken from home to [the hospital] by ambulance after showing signs of a serious mental disorder. For this reason a panel of psychiatrists found that the applicant was a danger to society and should be compulsorily admitted to [the hospital] for in-patient treatment.", "The representative of [the hospital] has submitted that the patient should be admitted to the hospital and treated for a serious mental disorder.", "Having regard to all the circumstances, the court comes to the conclusion that the patient\u2019s compulsory hospitalisation is required.", "Relying on the Psychiatric Assistance Act and Article 202 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the court", "has decided that", "[M.] should be compulsorily hospitalised to undergo medical treatment.", "The decision shall not be subject to appeal. ...\u201d", "20.

Patients should, as a matter of principle, be placed in a position to give their free and informed consent to treatment. The admission of a person to a psychiatric establishment on an involuntary basis should not be construed as authorising treatment without his consent.

Any derogation from this fundamental principle should be based upon law and only relate to clearly and strictly defined exceptional circumstances.", "Of course, consent to treatment can only be qualified as free and informed if it is based on full, accurate and comprehensible information about the patient\u2019s condition and the treatment proposed. ... Consequently, all patients should be provided systematically with relevant information about their condition and the treatment which it is proposed to prescribe for them. Relevant information (results, etc.) should also be provided following treatment. ...", "52. The procedure by which involuntary placement is decided should offer guarantees of independence and impartiality as well as of objective medical expertise. ...", "55. The CPT also attaches considerable importance to psychiatric establishments being visited on a regular basis by an independent outside body (eg. a judge or supervisory committee) which is responsible for the inspection of patients\u2019 care. This body should be authorised, in particular, to talk privately with patients, receive directly any complaints which they might have and make any necessary recommendations. ...", "56. Involuntary placement in a psychiatric establishment should cease as soon as it is no longer required by the patient\u2019s mental state. Consequently, the need for such a placement should be reviewed at regular intervals. ...\u201d", "40.

In practice, they did not have the slightest opportunity to benefit from the safeguards provided by the 2000 Law on Psychiatric Care, in particular the opportunity to contest their admission to hospital. In many cases, the files contained only a request for treatment made by a relative.", "Worse still, an examination of the patients\u2019 files revealed that some of them had been admitted to hospital without their consent simply on the basis of a letter from a public prosecutor or at the request of the Militia, without an involuntary committal request having been submitted to the competent court.", "By letter of 15 April 2003, the Ukrainian authorities informed the CPT that instructions had been issued to put into practice at Chernivtsi the 2000 Law on Psychiatric Care. The CPT wishes to receive confirmation that this is currently the case.
