On 13 May 2005 a Pre-Trial Chamber of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (\u201cthe State Court\u201d) decided to take over the case from the Isto\u010dno Sarajevo District Court in view of its sensitivity and a sympathetic attitude of the local police towards the applicant, a police officer, which had been manifested in their failure to arrest him despite an international arrest warrant against the applicant. The decision entered into force in June 2005.", "5. On 11 July 2006 a Trial Chamber of the State Court found the applicant guilty of aiding and abetting rapes and enforced disappearances as crimes against humanity under Article 172 \u00a7 1 (g) and (i) of the 2003 Criminal Code and sentenced him to five years\u2019 imprisonment.", "6.
