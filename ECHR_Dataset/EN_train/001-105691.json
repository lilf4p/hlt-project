The Government alleged that on 16 June 2009 in the evening Z.\u00d0., a son of the first and second applicants and brother to the third applicant, was having dinner at the \u201cYogi\u201d restaurant in Ivani\u0107 Grad when M.\u0160., obviously very drunk, approached him, insulted him because of his Roma origin and spat in his food.

At about 10.30 p.m. the same day a small group of Roma, including the first and the second applicants, arrived at the police station in search of M.\u0160. When the police officers warned them off, they left the police station. However, the second applicant continued to shout in front of the police station, insulting and threatening the police officers. Police officers S.M. and A.B., now dressed in plain clothes as they were no longer on duty, approached the second applicant asking her to calm down, without using any force. The second applicant then left.", "12. The applicants had then gone to the Ivani\u0107 Grad Medical Emergency Centre, where the doctor was unable to detect any injuries to them.", "13. On 16 June 2009 the Ivani\u0107 Grad police interviewed Z.\u00d0., M.\u0160. and the third applicant, as well as a witness, I.G., a waitress in the \u201cYogi\u201d restaurant.", "14.

She had heard noise coming from a nearby car park, the noise of a car horn and shouting. Police officer A.B. had gone to see what was going on. She had heard female voices shouting. Other police officers soon joined him. Shortly afterwards she had heard S.M. shout \u201dStop! Police!\u201d. She had gone back into the bar and then come out again. She had seen police officers approaching the car and the situation had calmed down. Soon after that M.S., who lived nearby, had come to the bar saying that the noise had woken him. She had told him not to go there and that the police had already taken care of the situation. She also said that it was not true that the police officers had used force, they had only asked the unknown persons to calm down.", "25.

He had heard noise from the nearby car park \u2013 someone had been sounding a car horn. Officer A.B. had gone over to see what was going on. The shouting had continued and judging by the voices he had heard he had concluded that they belonged to several women. Police officer S.M. had also gone to the car park. Soon after that he had heard S.M. shout \u201cStop! Police!\u201d. He had then left the terrace and approached the car park, where he had seen a group of Roma coming from the direction of the police station, talking loudly. One of the women in the group had probably called the Zagreb Police telling them that she had been beaten by two police officers in Ivani\u0107 Grad, which was untrue. Soon after that one or two uniformed police officers had appeared and the situation had calmed down. He also said that it was not true that the police officers had used force, they had only asked the unknown persons to calm down.", "26.

Danijel was covered in blood and she took him out of the police station and they sat in their car parked in front of the police station. While she was lighting a cigarette a police officer opened the car door, grabbed her by her right arm, almost breaking it, dragged her out of the car and kicked her in the chest and belly. S.M., who was with the police officer, took Danijel out of the car, kicked him in the belly, grabbed him by the neck and lifted him against the car. This whole event was recorded by the surveillance video camera, and she suggests that the recording be seen.", "S.M. said that he was employed as a police officer in the Ivani\u0107 Grad police station and that on 16 June 2009 he had been sent to Klo\u0161tar Ivani\u0107 because [someone was] disturbing the peace. At about 9.45 p.m. he had arrived at the \u201cYogi\u201d restaurant, where he had found M.\u0160. sitting in front of the restaurant, obviously drunk, and several persons of Roma origin who were shouting at M.\u0160.

At about 10.30 p.m. he had heard noises and cursing outside the bar ... so he had gone with another police officer to see what was going on. As they approached an \u201cOpel\u201d type car with Dutch licence plates he had heard a woman\u2019s voice shouting even louder and someone was also sounding the car horn, so they had tried to calm them down. They had not calmed down, however, and more police officers had come out of the police station, and he had returned to the bar.

He was also curious and had gone out onto the terrace to see what was going on. He had seen a large group of Roma persons coming from the direction of the police station, talking loudly, and one of the women had called the police complaining that she had been beaten by two policemen, which was untrue since M.S. had been standing only a couple of metres away and had seen everything.

She alleged that on 16 June 2009 at about 10.30 p.m. the two police officers had beaten her and her son Danijel. On 29 January 2010 the court asked the second applicant to amend her submissions within three days. The second applicant complied. However, on 4 March 2010 the Municipal Court found that the second applicant\u2019s submissions did not take the form required by the Code of Criminal Procedure.", "30. The second applicant has seen doctors on several occasions since the alleged incident. On 8 February 2010 she was diagnosed with a mild chronic neural lesion (bla\u017ea kroni\u010dna neuralna lezija).", "31. The medical report of 27 October 2008 on the third applicant shows that he complained that he had been hit by a pupil at the school he was attending. He had a deviation of the nasal septum which could be of a post-traumatic character. There were no signs of broken nasal bones.", "32. On 19 December 2008 the first applicant complained to the Government that his son, the third applicant, had been constantly insulted and frequently beaten by other pupils because of his Roma origin.", "33. An interview with the third applicant was conducted at the Ivani\u0107 Grad police station on 12 January 2009. He explained that on an unspecified date in late October 2008, after physical training, he had gone to the changing room to pick up his things. Pupil L.R. had been in front of him. Someone had pushed L.R. and his head had hit the third applicant\u2019s face, hurting his nose. He had reported it to the class teacher, who had sent him to see a doctor. He had not had any other symptoms and the pain had ceased after a few days.", "34. On 9 January 2009 the Ministry of Science, Education and Sport asked the school authorities to reply to the first applicant\u2019s allegations of 19 December 2008. The school prepared two reports. The relevant part of the first report, drawn up on 14 January 2009 by the applicant\u2019s class teacher, reads:", "\u201c... after only two weeks at this school I encountered conflicts between pupils. D. \u00d0ur\u0111evi\u0107 first reported a run-in with another pupil when pupil L.R. unintentionally hit him on the nose with his head because Danijel was standing behind L.R. when L.R. swung his head back. ... Danijel came to me complaining that his nose hurt and told me that L.R. had hit him hard. He made it quite clear that the blow had been unintentional, which other pupils who witnessed the incident confirmed. The next day Danijel complained that his nose still hurt, so I sent him to see a doctor. I also tried to inform the \u00d0ur\u0111evi\u0107 family, but their mobile telephone was switched off. Since it was established that the contact between Danijel and L.R. had been accidental, with no intention of hurting Danijel, I had no reason to punish anyone. This happened on 21, 22 and 23 October 2008.", "On 22 October 2008, during a break, a verbal and physical conflict involving pupils I.D., M.K., L.R. and D. \u00d0ur\u0111evi\u0107 occurred. From interviews with these pupils I learned that I.D., M.K. and L.R. were playing with a box ... which annoyed Danijel, who wanted to throw the box away, so Danijel and the other pupils started arguing. Pupils I.D., M.K. and L.R. said that after some pushing and shoving Danijel threatened them with physical violence and I.D., M.K. and L.R. answered by swearing at him. Danijel then hit M.K. and L.R. During the following break the pupils reported the incident to me and I reported it to the authorities. A class teacher gave pupils I.D., N.K. and L.R. oral warnings. Pupil D. \u00d0ur\u0111evi\u0107 was given a written warning because he had already had oral warnings.", "On 16 December, during a break, my pupils came to me to report a fight started by Danijel. They told me that P.G. and D.A. had been standing outside the history classroom talking when Danijel had arrived and kicked P.G.\u2019s bottom. D.A. had asked him why had he done it and Danijel had insulted her. She had returned the insults and entered the classroom. Danijel had followed her in, pressed her against a wardrobe in the classroom, grabbed her by her hair and kneed her in the hip and belly. The pupils had seen Danijel hit her seven times before the boys had managed to separate them. With the help of the history teacher ... Danijel confessed that he had started the fight and explained what he had done ... He confirmed the pupils\u2019 version of events and wrote it all down on paper, as did the girls who witnessed it. He even demonstrated how he had pressed D.A. against the wardrobe and held her while he hit her. I reported the incident to a pedagogue, V.V., who immediately talked to Danijel, D.A. and the pupils who witnessed the incident, then called Danijel\u2019s and A.\u2019s parents and the police. Defectologist A.N. was also informed and set about resolving the situation. I informed the teachers of the incident at their meeting on 19 December 2008 and suggested giving Danijel \u00d0ur\u0111evi\u0107 a written reprimand for causing and participating in verbal and physical conflicts, inflicting bodily injuries on D.A. and violating the school rules by not wearing school slippers, and that suggestion was unanimously accepted.", "As regards unacceptable behaviour towards pupil \u00d0ur\u0111evi\u0107, Danijel complained to me on three occasions that other pupils had been teasing him ... about his age and his alleged liking for a pupil in another class. After Danijel\u2019s complaint I warned the pupils concerned and instructed them to avoid verbal conflicts. I also talked to Danijel on several occasions, and he told me that if the teasing continued he would hit the pupils concerned. On the basis of these interviews I concluded that Danijel identified verbal insults with physical violence and considered it appropriate to react to teasing with violence, without showing any remorse.", "After the incident in December when Danijel inflicted injuries on D.A, the pupils told me that Danijel\u2019s usual reaction to teasing among the pupils included threats of physical violence, swearing and inappropriate comments about a girl pupil from his class, with allusion to her physical attributes and to sexual activity. As an example of his typical behaviour, the pupils mentioned Danijel\u2019s kicking of pupils in passing. He would bend his knee and kick them with a sudden backwards movement of his leg. During our latest conversation the pupils told me that they had been avoiding Danijel for some time, explaining that they had stopped teasing him out of fear that he would put his threats of physical violence into practice. Danijel, on the other hand, has never complained to me that any of the pupils have tried to harm him.\u201d", "35. The relevant part of the second report, drawn up on 15 January 2009 by the pedagogue at the same school, reads:", "\u201cDanijel \u00d0ur\u0111evi\u0107, has very frequent verbal conflicts with his classmates and sometimes with his teachers as well. The interviews with him reveal that in his opinion the cause of these conflicts is that he \u2018wants to have fun and make jokes but the others do not see it that way.\u2019 On innumerable occasions the class teacher, the defectologist and I have explained to him that what he perceives as a joke is not necessarily [seen as such] by others, and that sometimes people are not in the mood for jokes but that does not require a vehement reaction.", "He is repeating the sixth grade and at the beginning of the school year he said he missed his friends from his former class, but he also promised to be a better pupil, to listen to teachers, me and the defectologist and to refrain from arguing with other pupils. I praised him for that attitude; he showed some improvement in his school work, but the conflicts with other pupils have persisted. Mostly pupils from his class are involved, but sometimes he would go to the class attended by his sister D. and try to solve her problems, in an inappropriate manner, shouting and threatening younger pupils. As regards educational measures, on 23 September [2008] he was issued an oral reprimand by a class teacher and on 28 October 2008 a written warning for fighting with other pupils, of which the parents were informed orally by the class teacher. The other pupils involved in the fighting were given oral warnings while Danijel got a written warning for repeating the unacceptable behaviour for which he had been warned orally on 23 September 2008.", "On 16 December 2008 during a break ... there was a scuffle between Danijel and pupil D.A. The pupils who witnessed it came to me and the class teacher. [We found] D.A. at the scene, crying, with dishevelled hair, obviously in shock, clutching her belly with both hands. The pupils told us what had happened. I took D.A. to my office and assessed whether an ambulance had to be called. D.A. said that she was frightened and had pains in her head and belly, but that there was no need to see a doctor. She had no external injuries, save for pulled hair and red marks on her belly.", "Danijel had no injuries, he said that he had hit her because they had said something to him which had made him angry. The parents of both pupils were informed. The \u00d0ur\u0111evi\u0107 parents came immediately, and D.A.\u2019s mother came later ... The \u00d0ur\u0111evi\u0107 parents wanted to talk with D.A. immediately to see what had happened. Since they were shouting and talking at the same time as Danijel, I asked them to calm down and told them that they had no right to question D.A. without her parents being present. As they had been informed about the incident, I told them to go home and that my duty was to report the incident to a welfare centre and the police, and I asked them to take Danijel home. Dissatisfied with what I had said, they reacted inappropriately, especially Mrs \u00d0ur\u0111evi\u0107, complaining that when Danijel had been insulted there had been no reaction and the police had not been called. They said they would deal with it in their own way. An hour later D.A.\u2019s father came to my office, upset and disappointed that I had not called an ambulance and that the police had not come to the school.", "At a teachers\u2019 meeting on 19 December 2008 it was decided that a written reprimand would be issued against Danijel for serious physical conflict in which he had inflicted bodily injury. Although this was not his first attack on a pupil at the school and the usual measure would be a harsh reprimand, in view of his overall social condition, which affected his development, a more lenient punishment was issued.", "It is to be stressed that we regularly talk to Danijel, at his request (at least two or three times a week), and we also provide him with adequate aid in terms of conversations with him, alone and together with other pupils; he receives help with his school work (once I personally cleaned the muddy sneakers he wore to school instead of slippers, because he did not know how to do it).", "Today he is reported to have punched pupil I.M. on the left cheek because I.M. threw his cap at him.", "As regards the incident when his nose was hurt on 21 and 22 October 2008 (I do not know the exact date because Danijel cannot remember exactly when it happened), Danijel said in the presence of his parents that he happened to be standing behind a boy who swung his head back because he had long hair, and that his nose had been like that before, which is confirmed by medical documents submitted by the parents ...", "I would like to stress that in both my personal and my professional capacity I have done a lot to help the \u00d0ur\u0111evi\u0107 parents and their children. Many times the \u00d0ur\u0111evi\u0107 parents have objected that we do not know how to resolve problems with Roma people, alleging that the pupils at school, as well as other people, had been denigrating them. I expressed my regret at such behaviour and stressed that they could not have experienced anything like that from me (which they confirmed), and reassured them that I would certainly react in the event of such behaviour by the pupils, in order to protect their children, and direct the pupils as to the correct attitude to adopt towards the Roma. I could not be held responsible for other people\u2019s reactions because these things are a matter of personal culture.", "I advised them to tell their older, grown-up children who come to the school to take their younger siblings home to wait outside the school or not to enter the school before the end of classes without registering with a pupil on duty (they would get angry when asked to show their identity cards by pupils on duty, and would go to the classrooms without authorisation). In conversations with them, they have admitted that their children also sometimes use bad language they hear at home, and I think that their complaint that their children are the only ones ill-treated at school is not true.", "The social services and the police were informed about the supervision of pupils in order to help them with their existential problems.", "36. On an unspecified date the second applicant lodged a criminal complaint with the Velika Gorica Municipal State Attorney\u2019s Office (Op\u0107insko dr\u017eavno odvjetni\u0161tvo u Velikoj Gorici) on charges of bodily harm (tjelesna ozljeda).

On 8 February 2010 the third applicant was examined again, and was diagnosed as having serious impairment to the sight in his right eye as a result of a contusion (cephaela gradus gravis post contusionem). The applicant said that he had been beaten up at school and out of school. The doctor observed that there had been no response from the school authorities or the school psychologist and asked once again for their opinion. The third applicant was referred to a neurologist and a brain surgeon. There is no indication that he followed the recommendation.", "42.

On an unspecified date the second applicant complained about the violence against the third applicant in school and submitted medical documentation. She alleged that she and the boy\u2019s father had complained to the school about Danijel being beaten by other pupils on many occasions and that nothing had been done. She also alleged that they (the parents) had been thrown out of the school and not allowed to pay insurance for Danijel at the school. She enclosed medical documentation concerning the third applicant dated 17 March 2010, showing that he had been hit on the head on 26 March and 9 December 2009 and 16 February 2010.", "44.

The interviews with him reveal that in his opinion the cause of these conflicts is that he \u2018wants to have fun and make jokes but the others do not see it that way\u2019. On innumerable occasions the class teacher and professional assistants at school have explained to him that what he perceives as a joke is not necessarily [seen as such] by others and that sometimes people are not in the mood for jokes, but that does not require a vehement reaction.", "The police intervened for the first time during Danijel\u2019s sixth grade in December 2008, after an serious incident with a pupil. ...Danijel grabbed the girl by the head and kicked her in the belly. After our intervention with the relevant outside services the parents, possibly dissatisfied with our conduct, complained to the Office for National Minorities, which asked for our observations.", "[the incident when Danijel was hit on the nose is described]", "...", "In December last year Danijel complained about having a headache because \u2018he had been hit with an iron bar\u2019. During the interview with him, we learned that the previous day Danijel had been hit by unknown persons ..., out of school, after lessons. He refused our suggestion to call his parents to come to take him home. Instead, he asked for painkillers as he frequently does ... After a few moments he left the school without authorisation, went to see a doctor and returned after an hour with two prescriptions ...", "On 4 March 2010 the \u00d0ur\u0111evi\u0107 parents were invited to the school to fetch their daughter, who was in sixth grade and who was throwing chairs and benches in her classroom following a verbal conflict with other pupils in her class. When Danijel heard about it, he tried to \u2018solve the situation in his way\u2019, by threatening the pupils and teachers (he mentioned a knife). The teachers calmed him down but he had already called his brother or father on a mobile telephone and soon his grown-up elder brother arrived at the school. At the entrance he brushed past the pupil on duty and shouted at him, and opened various classroom doors looking for his sister and brother. One of the teachers ... heard the noise and asked the young man to stop making noise and disturbing classes and told him that he would find his brother and sister. But the brother continued to address the teacher in an inappropriate manner and threatened to \u2018take things into his own hands\u2019. The teacher immediately called the police and it is possible that this is incident the \u00d0ur\u0111evi\u0107 parents were referring to in connection with police intervention.", "Danijel frequently complains to teachers of headaches and asks for pills and permission to leave the classroom.
