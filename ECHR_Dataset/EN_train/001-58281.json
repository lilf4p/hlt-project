The applicant is a Turkish citizen who was born in 1957 and lives in Istanbul.", "9. At the material time, the applicant was the major shareholder in Deniz Bas\u0131n Yay\u0131n Sanayi ve Ticaret Organizasyon, a Turkish limited liability company which owns a weekly review entitled Haberde Yorumda Ger\u00e7ek (\u201cThe Truth of News and Comments\u201d), published in Istanbul.", "10. In issue No. 42 of the review, dated 9 January 1993, a news commentary entitled \u201cIn Botan the poor peasants are expropriating the landlords!\u201d was published.", "The relevant parts of this news commentary read:", "\u201c...", "\u2018The waves of the earthquake centred on Botan have reached all of Kurdistan. The national liberation struggle, growing like the ripples caused by a stone cast into a pool of water, has already gone past Botan in waves, currently embracing 50 districts in 8 provinces in the active front of armed struggle.\u2019", "PKK [Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party ] sources briefly describe the extent of the national struggle in Kurdistan as follows: the said 8 provinces (together with their districts) are Hakkari, \u015e\u0131rnak, Siirt, Mardin, Batman, Urfa and Diyarbak\u0131r; while the provinces of Van, Malatya, Bitlis, Mu\u015f and Gaziantep and their districts are described as being partially involved in the war.", "The popular movements in the Botan area, where approximately 4.5 to 5 million Kurds live, which have developed with the rise of the national liberation movement, have made rapid strides in the years 1990-92. The political point reached in the area is that the State has almost become inoperative. ...", "The domain vacated by the State in the political sense has since been occupied by the PKK in the rural areas and H.E.P. organisations in the cities. ...", "Land cannot be redistributed before it is transferred to the free will of the Kurdish people, because it is inconceivable to distribute land that bears the seal of the Republic of Turkey. ...", "Today, our struggle is an external war directed against the forces of the Republic of Turkey. ...", "We want to wage a total liberation struggle. ...\u201d", "11. On 10 January 1993 the Istanbul National Security Court (\u0130stanbul Devlet G\u00fcvenlik Mahkemesi) ordered the seizure of this edition of the review on the ground that, allegedly, it disseminated propaganda against the indivisibility of the State.", "12. In an indictment dated 28 January 1993, the Public Prosecutor at the Istanbul National Security Court charged the applicant, being the owner of the review, with disseminating propaganda against the indivisibility of the State. The charges were brought under section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 (-\u201cthe 1991 Act\u201d; see paragraph 16 below) on account of the publication of the above news commentary, which concerned, inter alia, the activities of the PKK.", "13. In the proceedings before the National Security Court, the applicant denied the charges. He pleaded that the commentary on which the charges were based in fact criticised the activities of the PKK. He invoked Article 10 of the Convention and referred to the case-law of the Commission and the Court. He stated that pluralism of opinions, including those opinions which shock or offend, is essential in a democratic society. He argued that the provisions of section 8 of the 1991 Act restrict the right to freedom of expression in contravention of the Turkish Constitution and the criteria laid down by the case-law of the Commission and the Court.", "14. In a judgment dated 27 September 1993, the National Security Court found the applicant guilty of making propaganda against the indivisibility of the State.

Thereupon the Court, considering the good conduct of the applicant during the trial, reduced the fine to TRL 83,333,333.", "The National Security Court, considering those parts of the news commentary cited at paragraph 10 above in the light of the article as a whole, observed that it referred to certain parts of Turkey as \u201cKurdistan\u201d. Moreover, in the words of the Court, it described the acts of the \u201cPKK terrorist organisation\u201d as a national liberation struggle, which amounted to propaganda aimed at undermining the indivisibility of the State.", "15. The applicant appealed. He, inter alia, reiterated the defence he had relied on before the National Security Court. On 18 February 1994 the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal, upholding the cogency of the National Security Court\u2019s assessment of evidence.", "16.
