He was represented before the Court by Ms M. \u010culenov\u00e1, a lawyer practising in Bratislava. The Government of the Slovak Republic (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mrs M. Piro\u0161\u00edkov\u00e1.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "On 30 July 2005 the applicant\u2019s daughter, Ms Vanda Furd\u00edkov\u00e1, who was then 27 years old, died as a result of injuries which she sustained while climbing the \u0160irok\u00e1 ve\u017ea peak in the High Tatras. The peak\u2019s summit is at 2,461 metres above sea level.", "Ms Furd\u00edkov\u00e1 and her partner started the climb in excellent weather conditions at 9 a.m. on 30 July 2005. Both climbers were sufficiently experienced for the climb.", "At 12.14 p.m. Ms Furd\u00edkov\u00e1 fell when a block of rock came loose. She remained hanging on the rope with her head pointing downwards some 25 metres below her co-climber. Some 120 metres below her two other climbers, Mr. and Mrs. J., were preparing to start the same climb and witnessed the accident.", "At 12.16 p.m. and at 12.18 p.m. Mrs J. attempted to contact the Air Rescue Service and the Mountain Rescue Service using a mobile phone. Both lines were busy. After another attempt she reached the Mountain Rescue Service at 12.19 p.m. She was told that a helicopter would be sent immediately and that it would arrive at the place of the accident in 20-25 minutes.", "The accident had also been reported to the operations centre of the Mountain Rescue Service in Poprad by a tourist passing near the foot of the mountain. The records indicate that the operations centre received the first emergency call about the accident at 12.15 p.m.", "Between 12.15 and 12.25 p.m. the co-climber fixed the ropes with a view to preventing Ms Furd\u00edkov\u00e1 from any further falls and descended by rope to the latter. Ms Furd\u00edkov\u00e1 was badly injured, but she remained conscious and communicated with her partner until 4 p.m. At 12.23 p.m. Mr. and Mrs. J. decided to climb up to Ms Furd\u00edkov\u00e1 and her partner.", "At 12.30 p.m. the duty officer of the Mountain Rescue Service informed Mr J. by phone that the helicopter would arrive in some 20 minutes as it was on a different rescue mission in Smrekovica at that time.", "At 1 p.m. the doctor of the Air Rescue Service called Mr J. to tell him that the rescue team was on its way.", "The three climbers supported Ms Furd\u00edkov\u00e1, hydrated her and communicated with her.", "At 1.17 p.m. the rescue service helicopter landed in Poprad to fill the fuel tank and to prepare the equipment needed for the rescue of Ms Furd\u00edkov\u00e1. At 1.40 p.m. the helicopter took off from Poprad. On its flight to the mountain it landed in Star\u00fd Smokovec at 1.45 p.m., to board one member of the Mountain Rescue Service. It reached the place of the accident at 2 p.m.", "At 2.02 p.m. the pilot informed the land operator that strong turbulence was preventing Ms Furd\u00edkov\u00e1 from being rescued directly from the helicopter in flight. A reinforcement of the rescue team and special equipment were required in order to reach the injured person.", "The helicopter returned to Poprad. Between 2.25 and 2.45 p.m. a member of the Mountain Rescue Service with the necessary equipment joined the rescue team and the fuel tank was refilled.", "At 3.30 p.m. another two members of the Mountain Rescue Service boarded the helicopter in Star\u00fd Smokovec.", "At 3.45 p.m. the rescue team was dropped on the summit of the mountain. The helicopter flew off to attend to another accident. Several minutes later the three climbers who had stayed with the injured person spotted the members of the rescue team some 15 metres above them.", "The Government submitted that the team reached Ms Furd\u00edkov\u00e1 at 3.47 p.m.", "According to the climbers involved, the rescue team reached the injured at approximately 4 p.m.", "By that time Ms Furd\u00edkov\u00e1 had lost consciousness.", "The Government submitted that Ms Furd\u00edkov\u00e1 had by that time already reached the stage of clinical death.", "The members of the rescue team and the climbers fixed Ms Furd\u00edkov\u00e1 to a transport stretcher. She died at 4.10 p.m.", "Her body was lowered to the foot of the mountain by ropes at 4.45 p.m.", "A forensic doctor concluded, on 4 August 2005, that her death had been caused by the shock resulting from the injuries and by bleeding, and by a third degree embolism. The report indicated that Ms Furd\u00edkov\u00e1 had dislocated her right thigh bone, that the soft tissues of her right arm and thigh had been massively contused and that she had suffered from an intracranial haemorrhage.", "The applicant requested the Health Care Supervisory Office (\u00darad pre doh\u013ead nad zdravotnou starostlivos\u0165ou) to examine whether appropriate medical assistance had been provided to his daughter.", "On 30 September 2005 the Pre\u0161ov branch office of that institution replied to the applicant that no shortcomings had been established in the providing of medical assistance to Ms Furd\u00edkov\u00e1.", "The letter stated that the helicopter team had been trained and equipped in accordance with the relevant law. The doctor, who had entered the climbing area of the mountain despite the fact that he had not been obliged to do so, found that Ms Furd\u00edkov\u00e1 had died before she was released from the rope and put on a transport stretcher. Resuscitation had not been possible in the situation. The question as to whether the life of the injured person could have been saved had there been an earlier intervention was purely hypothetical.", "The letter further stated that nothing indicated that the actions of the Air Rescue Service and the Mountain Rescue Service had not been duly coordinated. According to the Mountain Rescue Service, it had been more efficient to have recourse to Air Rescue Service in the case of the applicant\u2019s daughter. In a letter of 19 September 2005 the Minister of the Interior informed the Health Care Supervisory Office that he had discovered no shortcomings in the action of the Mountain Rescue Service which fell under the authority of his Ministry.", "On 3 October 2005 the sister of Ms Furd\u00edkov\u00e1 challenged the conclusions of the Pre\u0161ov branch office.", "On 7 November 2005, in its protocol, an expert commission under the authority of the President of the Health Care Supervisory Office found an infringement of the relevant health care legislation by the Air Rescue Service.", "The commission held that the operator of the Air Rescue Service had proceeded erroneously when sending a helicopter based in Poprad to intervene at the very extreme point of its operation area in Smrekovica while a different helicopter based in Slia\u010d had been available for the same territory.", "The commission qualified the operator\u2019s misjudgment as a \u201chuman factor\u201d failure. It had resulted in a delay of 53 minutes during which the helicopter based in Poprad had not been available for operations in the High Tatras.", "On 14 November 2005 the Health Care Supervisory Office informed the Ministry of Health of the commission\u2019s findings. The Ministry was requested to bring administrative proceedings against the Air Rescue Service and to impose a fine for the latter\u2019s failure to comply with its duties.", "The Ministry of Health discontinued the proceedings, on 28 June 2006, holding that the Air Rescue Service had not contravened any of the duties imposed by law.", "Between 17 and 25 August 2005 the Supervision Office of the Ministry of the Interior examined the way in which the operators of the Mountain Rescue Service had organised the rescue of the applicant\u2019s daughter.", "The report indicates that the operators had correctly decided to organise the rescue in co-ordination with the Air Rescue Service. To that effect they had contacted the latter at 12.22 p.m., immediately after the incident had been reported.", "In particular, access to the place of the incident had been difficult. The rescue team would have needed three and a half hours to reach it on foot. In addition, the operators had correctly presumed that the assistance of the Air Rescue Service was required with a view to ensuring the rapid transportation of the injured person to hospital. The members of the Mountain Rescue Service had been prepared to intervene in co-operation with the Air Rescue Service within ten minutes after the receipt of the information about the incident.", "The Supervision Office found no shortcomings in the way in which the Mountain Rescue Service had acted.", "On 30 July 2005 criminal proceedings were brought within the Poprad District Police Directorate in the context of the accident as a result of which the applicant\u2019s daughter had died. The investigator questioned thirteen witnesses. He considered a forensic report and questioned a forensic expert. Records of communications and reports on the rescue action were submitted by the Air Rescue Service and the Mountain Rescue Service. The investigator also considered other documentary evidence including reports of the Slovak Hydrometeorological Institute and the Slovak Aviation Office.", "On the basis of the evidence obtained the police investigator concluded, on 30 January 2006, that the death of the applicant\u2019s daughter was the result of the injuries which she had suffered during the climb. Criminal liability of a third person in that context was not established. The criminal proceedings were therefore discontinued.", "The applicant filed a complaint. He argued, inter alia, that the investigator had disregarded the above protocol of the expert commission of the Health Care Supervisory Office.", "On 20 February 2006 a prosecutor of the District Prosecutor\u2019s Office in Poprad, after having obtained additional documentary evidence, dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint. The decision stated that the rescue helicopter had been intervening at a different place within its operation area at the time when the emergency call about the incident of the applicant\u2019s daughter had reached the operations centre. It had started attending to the incident in the High Tatras immediately after it had ended the previous rescue action. The expert commission\u2019s conclusion that a different helicopter could have been used for the intervention in Smrekovica did not provide a sufficient basis for prosecuting any person for injury to health. The prosecutor found no shortcomings in the way in which the rescue action had been carried out. Reference was made to a report indicating that the doctor had attended to the victim directly in the exposed climbing area despite the fact that he had not been obliged to do so and that the scope of the climber\u2019s injuries were such that only immediate intervention at a specialised health care centre could have saved her life.", "On 15 June 2006 a prosecutor of the Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office in Pre\u0161ov upheld the above conclusion that no criminal offence had been committed. The letter admitted, however, that the rescue of the applicant\u2019s daughter had not been organised in an optimal manner. In particular, the decision to send the helicopter based in Poprad to a remote place, albeit within its operation area, had not been correct. It was also questionable whether the helicopter should not have deposited the rescue climbers on the summit of the mountain immediately instead of attempting to rescue the injured person directly from the air. With reference to the statement of a forensic expert the prosecutor held that those considerations could not affect the position in the case. In particular, the saving of the life of the injured person would only have been possible in the case of immediate medical intervention which had not been possible for objective reasons.", "On 13 November 2006 the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office, with reference to the above conclusions, dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim that appropriate medical assistance had not been provided to his daughter in a timely manner. The letter stated that there was no justification for the criminal proceedings to be resumed.", "At the request of the sister of Ms Furd\u00edkov\u00e1, the Security Commission of the Czech Mountaineering Association carried out an analysis of the accident and of the subsequent events.", "The report dated 7 October 2005 states, inter alia, that the decision of the three climbers present not to attempt to lower Ms Furd\u00edkov\u00e1 to the foot of the mountain by ropes had been correct given that they had been informed that a professional rescue team would arrive shortly. However, that information had turned out to be false. The speediness of the rescue in such cases was of primordial importance. Timely medical intervention could probably have saved the life of the injured climber. There were obvious mistakes as regards the professional rescue system. The most important one seemed to be the late arrival of the helicopter for which no satisfactory explanation existed at the time when the report was drafted.", "The report further contains recommendations on action to be taken by mountaineers in cases of similar accidents.", "In July 1998 the Council of the European Society for Emergency Medicine adopted a Manifesto for Emergency Medicine in Europe. It provides, inter alia, that emergency medical care of a high standard should be available to every person in need in all situations and at all times. This requires a dedicated system which provides appropriate care for all acutely ill or injured persons.", "In a speech given at the Congress of Emergency and Disaster Medicine held in Germany in 1998, Professor Dr. B. Domres, President of the German Association of Disaster Medicine, stated, inter alia, that one of the essential elements of the rescue chain was the statutory definition of delays in first-aid intervention while taking into account the territorial and geographical situation of the country concerned. While it was not realistic to require that an emergency team should reach a person whose life was in danger within 10-15 minutes in all European states, that period should be set as a standard in densely populated and highly developed countries.", "The applicant submits that, as from the moment when an accident is reported, a physician attached to an emergency service is required to start life-saving intervention within 10 to 12 minutes in various L\u00e4nder in Germany, within 15 minutes in the Czech Republic and within 8 minutes in the United Kingdom.", "Pursuant to Article 15 \u00a7 1, everyone has the right to life.", "Article 40 guarantees to everyone the right to protection of health.", "Article 127 enacted with effect from 1 January 2002 provides:", "\u201c1. The Constitutional Court shall decide on complaints lodged by natural or legal persons alleging a violation of their fundamental rights or freedoms or of human rights and fundamental freedoms enshrined in international treaties ratified by the Slovak Republic ... unless the protection of such rights and freedoms falls within the jurisdiction of a different court.", "2. When the Constitutional Court finds that a complaint is justified, it shall deliver a decision stating that a person\u2019s rights or freedoms set out in paragraph 1 were violated as a result of a final decision, by a particular measure or by means of other interference. It shall quash such a decision, measure or other interference. When the violation found is the result of the failure to act, the Constitutional Court may order that [the authority] which violated such rights or freedoms should take the necessary action. At the same time the Constitutional Court may return the case to the authority concerned for further proceedings, order that such an authority abstain from violating fundamental rights and freedoms ... or, where appropriate, order that those who violated the rights or freedoms set out in paragraph 1 restore the situation existing prior to the violation.", "3. In its decision on a complaint the Constitutional Court may grant adequate financial satisfaction to the person whose rights under paragraph 1 were violated.\u201d ...", "In accordance with its established practice, the Constitutional Court lacks jurisdiction to examine a complaint lodged by natural or legal persons when the determination of the point in issue involves the preliminary question of conflict of legal rules (see, for example, I. \u00daS 96/93, decision of 16 November 1993; II. \u00daS 806/00, decision of 16 November 2000; II. \u00daS 19/2001, decision of 22 March 2001; or IV. \u00daS 11/04, decision of 22 January 2004).", "Act 576/2004 governs health care and health services.", "Pursuant to section 4(3), health care is provided correctly where, without delay, medical intervention occurs which is necessary for the correct identification of a disease and for ensuring timely and efficient treatment with a view to healing or improving the state of a person with due regard to the current state of medical science.", "Act 578/2004 Coll. governs, inter alia, persons providing health services.", "Under section 11(1), the Ministry of Health gives permission for the operation of an aerial ambulance as an emergency health service.", "Section 79(1)(b) obliges persons providing health services to give to any person indispensable medical assistance without any unjustified delay.", "Act 579/2004 Coll. governs the emergency health service, that is urgent assistance to persons whose life or health is at immediate threat (section 1).", "The emergency health service comprises operation centres and providers of emergency health services. The latter run emergency ambulances on the basis of an authorisation issued by the Ministry of Health and form part of the integrated rescue system of Slovakia (section 2).", "Operation centres are established by the Ministry of Health, and they direct and co-ordinate the emergency service in a manner which makes it possible to maintain its fluid and permanent character. They are entitled to order the provider of a health service to intervene (section 3).", "Persons providing health services in an emergency are obliged, inter alia, to establish a response centre in the district concerned so that an ambulance can leave within one minute from the receipt of an order by the operations centre or co-ordination centre involved.
