The Sofia City Court held five trial hearings.", "16. On 4 July 1997 the Sofia City Court heard four witnesses, the applicant and two experts. Several witnesses did not appear. Both the prosecution and the applicant sought to adduce additional evidence. The hearing was adjourned until 12 September 1997.", "17. On 12 September 1997 the court heard one witness. The remaining witnesses did not appear. The prosecution requested an adjournment as it considered important the examination of the witnesses who had not appeared. The applicant objected. The court granted the prosecutor\u2019s request and listed the next hearing for 10 December 1997.", "18. On that day the Sofia City Court heard one witness. The other witnesses failed to appear. The prosecutor insisted on them being heard and sought an adjournment. The applicant\u2019s lawyers objected, stating that reading out those witnesses\u2019 testimony given before the investigator would be sufficient. The court granted the prosecutor\u2019s request for an adjournment and scheduled the next hearing for 26 January 1998.", "19. On 26 January 1998 the court heard two witnesses. One witness did not appear. The applicant\u2019s lawyers stated that they considered the examination of the remaining witness important and sought an adjournment. The court granted the request. It fixed the next hearing for 15 June 1998.", "20. On the day of the last trial hearing, 15 June 1998, the applicant was found guilty under Articles 212 \u00a7 2 and 308 of the Penal Code and sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment. He was acquitted on certain of the initial charges. The court reserved its reasoning.", "21. On 25 June 1998 the applicant appealed to the Sofia Appellate Court. The prosecution also appealed.", "22. On an unspecified date in September 1998 the Sofia City Court delivered the reasoning of its judgment of 15 June 1998.", "23. The Sofia Appellate Court listed a hearing for 12 February 1999 which was however cancelled as the prosecution had not supplemented its appeal following the delivery of the reasoning of the first instance judgment.", "24. The hearing took place on 28 May 1999. On the same day the Sofia Appellate Court upheld the applicant\u2019s conviction of forgery of bank guarantees with intention to use them (Article 308 of the Penal Code) and acquitted him for the remainder. It accordingly reduced the applicant\u2019s sentence to three years\u2019 imprisonment.", "25. On 25 June 1999 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court of Cassation. It was dismissed on 10 December 2000.", "26. On an unspecified date in 1992 the applicant was sentenced by the Peshtera District Court to a suspended term of imprisonment.

Separately, on 27 January 1997 the Pazardzik Regional Court found the applicant guilty of mismanagement of assets belonging to a cooperative for which he had been working during the period 1986-1988.

On 2 May 1997 the judge-rapporteur dismissed the application in private. She found that since other criminal proceedings were pending against the applicant, those concerning mismanagement of assets of a cooperative, Article 152 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (\u201cCCP\u201d) made his remand in custody mandatory. Therefore, it was \u201cnot possible to substitute pre-trial detention for a more lenient measure despite the information concerning the [applicant\u2019s] difficult family circumstances\u201d.", "31. The applicant\u2019s appeal against the above decision was not examined owing to a clerical error of the Sofia City Court.", "32. On 2 July 1997 and at the hearing on 4 July 1997 the applicant reiterated his arguments seeking release on bail. He also made extensive additional submissions arguing that Article 152 \u00a7 3 CCP, which provided for a mandatory detention of persons against whom more than one set of criminal proceedings were pending and of recidivists, was incompatible with the Convention. Further, he maintained that there was insufficient evidence that he had committed the offence he was charged with.", "33. On the same day, 4 July 1997, the Sofia City Court dismissed the renewed application for bail. It stated, inter alia:", "\u201cThe court finds that there is a danger of the applicant\u2019s absconding as ... he and his wife sought asylum in the Netherlands at the time when ... the investigation proceedings were pending ... The charges ... concern an offence allegedly committed during the operational period of [the applicant\u2019s] suspended [imprisonment sentence]... of 1992. That fact is sufficient to justify a finding that there is a danger of reoffending...\u201d", "34. Addressing the applicant\u2019s arguments against mandatory detention under Article 152 \u00a7 3 CCP, the Sofia City Court stated that it had no power to disregard the law on the ground that it was contrary to the Constitution or international treaties and noted that the Supreme Court had submitted the matter to the Constitutional Court.", "35. On 7 July 1997 the applicant appealed to the Supreme Court of Cassation on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence that he had committed the offence and that there was no danger of his obstructing the course of justice. Confiscation of his passport and bail would be sufficient guarantees against absconding.", "36. On 11 August 1997, pursuant to an amendment to the CCP, mandatory detention under paragraph 3 of Article 152 was abolished.", "37. On 12 September 1997, before transmitting the appeal of 7 July 1997 to the Supreme Court of Cassation, the Sofia City Court sitting in private refused to reconsider its decision of 4 July 1997.", "38. In the end of September and the beginning of October 1997 the applicant submitted additional appeals against his detention pending trial.", "39. On 23 October 1997 the Supreme Court of Cassation examined the appeal of 7 July 1997 in closed session in the presence of a prosecutor and in the absence of the applicant or his representative. The prosecutor submitted written comments and made an oral statement inviting the court to dismiss the appeal. The applicant was not informed thereof and could not comment in reply.", "40. The Supreme Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal and upheld the Sofia City Court\u2019s decision of 4 July 1997 finding that the applicant\u2019s detention was justified under Article 152 \u00a7 1 CCP. It also upheld the Sofia City Court\u2019s findings that there was a danger of the applicant\u2019s absconding or committing further offences.", "41. The Supreme Court of Cassation also stated that issues of \u201csufficient evidence\u201d within the meaning of domestic law or \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention could not be considered in proceedings on applications for bail. They could only be decided by way of judgment on the merits of the criminal case.", "42. At the hearing on 10 December 1997 before the Sofia City Court the applicant renewed his appeal against detention. He referred to the fact that on 13 October 1997 his conviction of 27 January 1997 had been quashed as the prosecution had become time-barred. He also reiterated his previous arguments.", "43. On the same day the Sofia City Court dismissed the appeal, stating that the applicant\u2019s attempt to remain in the Netherlands and the fact that the charges against him concerned an offence allegedly committed during the operational period of his 1992 suspended imprisonment sentence (see above) indicated that there was a danger of his absconding and re-offending. The court also confirmed its earlier position that in the context of the applicant\u2019s appeal against detention it would not entertain arguments as to whether or not the charges were well founded, that being an issue going to the merits of the criminal case.", "44. On 16 December 1997 the applicant appealed to the Supreme Court of Cassation against the decision of 10 December 1997.", "45. The Supreme Court of Cassation examined the appeal on 15 January 1998 sitting in closed session in the presence of a prosecutor and in the absence of the applicant and his representative. The court heard the prosecutor\u2019s opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. The court dismissed the appeal.", "46. It stated that remand in custody was justified under Article 152 \u00a7 1 CCP as the applicant was charged with a serious offence within the meaning of the Code. Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s attempt to settle in the Netherlands with his family demonstrated a clear danger of absconding. The court also found that there had been no unjustified delays in the criminal proceedings.", "47. At the hearing on 26 January 1998 before the Sofia City Court the applicant again requested his release. He argued that the facts had been clarified and that therefore there would be no danger of him obstructing the course of justice.", "48. The appeal was dismissed on the same day. The Sofia City Court reiterated the reasoning of the previous decisions.", "49. On 29 January 1998 the applicant appealed against the above decision to the Supreme Court of Cassation. On 11 March 1998 the appeal was dismissed on the same grounds. The appeal was dealt with in closed session in the presence of a prosecutor who sought its dismissal and in the absence of the applicant and his representative.", "50. On 15 June 1998 the Sofia City Court convicted the applicant on some of the charges and sentenced him to five years\u2019 imprisonment.", "51.
