POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "George Nicolaou;Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Nicolas Bratza;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Vincent A.

The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.", "3. In 1993 the applicant married R.B. The couple had a son O., born on 10 April 1994. The family lived together until November 2002 when the applicant took O. and moved back to her old house. On the same day, after a scuffle with the applicant, R.B. took O. from her and from that time onwards maintained the actual custody over the child.", "4. On 12 December 2002 the applicant filed a petition for divorce. At the Cz\u0119stochowa Regional Court\u2019s (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) request, on 30 April 2003 three experts of the Family Diagnostics Centre (Rodzinny O\u015brodek Diagnostyczno-Konsultacyjny, hereinafter: the Family Centre) gave an expert opinion, in which they pointed to O.\u2019s clear entanglement in the strong marital conflict between the applicant and R.B. The experts observed that O. was being strongly influenced by his father and that many of his statements were \u201cinduced\u201d statements deprecating the applicant whom the child perceived very negatively. They found the existing family situation to be detrimental to the child and proposed to separate him temporarily from both parents and place him in a health resort (sanatorium). They moreover advised the court to consider the supervision of the family situation by an appointed court guardian (kurator s\u0105dowy).", "5. On 22 May 2003 the Cz\u0119stochowa Regional Court specified the access arrangements, allowing the applicant to visit O. once a week for four hours at R.B.\u2019s house and under the supervision of a court guardian. On 20 November 2003 the Katowice Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal, holding that the access arrangements specified by the Regional Court were reasonable.", "6. At the court hearing held on 24 May 2004, an expert of the Family Centre recommended that the applicant\u2019s contacts with O. take place in a neutral place instead of the father\u2019s house. Consequently, on 23 August 2004 the Cz\u0119stochowa Regional Court provisionally changed the access arrangements, allowing the applicant to meet O. on three consecutive Sundays in a fast-food restaurant under the supervision of a court guardian. Due to unspecified organisational problems, only one of the three planned meetings took place.", "7. On 18 October 2004 the Regional Court permanently changed the access arrangements, allowing the applicant to see O. once a week for two hours in a fast-food restaurant under the supervision of a court guardian. On 9 December 2004 the Katowice Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal, finding that the right of access was primarily the right of the child and not that of the applicant. The Court noted that the child apparently did not wish to see the applicant and pointed to the applicant\u2019s lack of patience and her unwillingness to cooperate with the supervising court guardian.", "8. At the hearing held on 18 April 2005, the court guardian informed the court that during the meetings in the restaurant O. had not wanted to see the applicant without his father\u2019s presence.", "9. At the Cz\u0119stochowa Regional Court\u2019s request, on 12 December 2005 the Family Centre prepared another opinion. The opinion stated that the reason for O.\u2019s aversion to the applicant had been his father\u2019s behaviour. The experts noted that the child was under the strong influence of his father and reacted hysterically to the applicant\u2019s presence. They urged the court to suspend O.\u2019s meetings with the applicant and to undertake steps aimed at improving their mutual relations. The opinion moreover recommended placing the child under psychological assistance and stated that the child\u2019s father should be persuaded to participate in the meetings with a psychologist in order to correct his attitude.", "10. On 6 January 2006 the applicant requested the court to change the access arrangements and allow her to meet O. at her own home. On 13 January 2006 the Regional Court dismissed her request, holding it to be premature, on account of the Family Centre\u2019s recommendation that the applicant\u2019s contacts with O. be temporarily suspended. The Regional Court noted that O. clearly did not wish to see his mother and that it would be contrary to the child\u2019s best interests if the meetings were to take place at the applicant\u2019s home.", "11. On 14 March 2006 the Katowice Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal. The Court of Appeal observed that the Regional Court should issue appropriate decisions in view of the expert findings indicating the child\u2019s father\u2019s incorrect parental behaviour. The Court of Appeal urged the Regional Court to consider changing the access arrangements and, in particular, to consider the possibility of allowing the applicant to meet her son without the father\u2019s presence, under the supervision of the court guardian, in order to improve the relations between the applicant and the child. It further noted that it would be detrimental to the child\u2019s emotional health if the existing situation were to persist.", "12. On 13 June 2006 the Cz\u0119stochowa Regional Court dissolved the applicant\u2019s marriage without attributing the fault to either party. The court awarded custody rights to R.B., finding that O. demonstrated strong affection for his father who, in the court\u2019s view, offered better prospects for the proper exercise of custody. The court restricted the applicant\u2019s custody rights over O., holding her to have been an inept mother who in the past had largely neglected O.\u2019s education. The Regional Court further decided that the access arrangements would be specified by the Public Psychological and Pedagogical Counselling Service (Publiczna Poradnia PsychologicznoPedagogiczna, hereafter: the Counselling Service) in Cz\u0119stochowa. The divorce court also held that placing O. in a health resort (sanatorium) would only constitute a temporary remedy while putting him in a foster family would be contrary to his best interests, given his affection for, and dependence on, his father.", "13. The applicant did not appeal against the divorce decision and it subsequently became final.", "14. In March 2007 the Director of the Counselling Service informed the applicant that her weekly meetings with O. would be one hour long and take place on the premises of the Counselling Service. It appears that no psychologist has ever assisted in the meetings.", "15. In June 2007 the Director of the Counselling Service requested the court to discharge the Counselling Service from the duty to organise the applicant\u2019s meetings with O., due to the child\u2019s and his father\u2019s visible unwillingness to comply with the access arrangements. The Director explained that from the very outset the meetings had met with difficulties and that from 13 April 2007 onwards O. had no longer been coming to the meetings.", "16. On 3 July 2007 the Cz\u0119stochowa District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) ordered R.B. to comply with the access arrangements, on pain of a fine in the amount of PLN 500 (approx. EUR 125) being imposed on him. R.B.\u2019s appeal was dismissed by the Cz\u0119stochowa Regional Court on 6 September 2007. It appears that R.B. has since then complied with the access arrangements and brought O. to the meetings with the applicant.", "17. On 28 August 2007 the applicant requested the court to fine R.B. once more for his non-compliance with the access arrangements. The applicant argued that O. would only briefly appear at the meetings and not talk to her, after which he would leave the Counselling Service and be driven home by his father or grandfather.", "18. On 16 April 2008 the Cz\u0119stochowa District Court dismissed her request, finding that R.B. had complied with the access arrangements by bringing O. to the meetings and that he could not be blamed for O.\u2019s own reluctance to see the applicant. On 26 June 2008 the Cz\u0119stochowa Regional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal. In passing, the Regional Court expressed a view that the child was clearly being harmed, a circumstance which both parents \u2013 R.B. and the applicant alike \u2013 refused to admit.", "19. On 18 March 2008 the Cz\u0119stochowa District Court ex officio issued a temporary order on access arrangements, allowing the applicant to meet O. at her home every first Sunday of each month for three hours and for another three hours on Easter Sunday. The applicant\u2019s appeal was dismissed by the Cz\u0119stochowa Regional Court on 19 June 2008.", "20. At the Cz\u0119stochowa District Court\u2019s request, on 27 November 2008 the Family Centre in Zawiercie issued another expert opinion. Without giving any excuse, the applicant did not appear at either of the two interviews with the Family Centre\u2019s experts. The experts found that in the past several years the applicant had been absent from O.\u2019s life and that O.\u2019s attitude towards her was hostile. They noted that O. did not wish to see the applicant and they recommended a temporary suspension of their contacts. The experts moreover recommended that psychological assistance be given to O. with a view to analysing and rectifying his relations with the applicant. At the same time, they criticised the applicant for her inability to deal with her role as a mother and observed that her motivation for having access to her son appeared to be superficial.", "21. On 9 December 2008 the Cz\u0119stochowa District Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s renewed request for changing the access arrangements. It noted that O. had come to the applicant\u2019s home on several occasions and invited her out for a walk or for coffee but that the applicant, to O.\u2019s disappointment, had shown no flexibility and insisted that the meetings only take place at her home. The District Court concluded that the applicant\u2019s inflexible stance did not warrant changing the access arrangements. The applicant\u2019s appeal was dismissed by the Cz\u0119stochowa Regional Court on 12 March 2009.", "22. At the applicant\u2019s request filed on 8 August 2008, on 8 April 2009 the Cz\u0119stochowa District Court ordered R.B. to comply with the access arrangements, on pain of a fine in the amount of PLN 500 (approx. EUR 125) being imposed on him, as the applicant had had no effective access to O. since 23 November 2008.", "23. On 20 May 2009 the Cz\u0119stochowa District Court ex officio changed the access arrangements, deciding that the venue of the applicant\u2019s contacts with O. was to be a local caf\u00e9 instead of the applicant\u2019s house. The Court recognised that O. was disappointed with the applicant\u2019s lack of flexibility as to the venue of the meetings and it acknowledged the findings of an expert psychologist, according to which O.\u2019s attitude towards the applicant was now genuinely his own and no longer influenced by his father. The applicant\u2019s appeal was rejected by the Cz\u0119stochowa Regional Court on formal grounds on 22 October 2009.", "24. On 4 August 2009 the Cz\u0119stochowa District Court refused the applicant\u2019s request to fine R.B. for non-compliance with the access arrangements, finding the applicant to be at fault for the unsuccessful meetings with O. on account of her bringing other members of her family to the meetings without seeking O.\u2019s prior consent. The applicant\u2019s appeal was dismissed by the Cz\u0119stochowa Regional Court on 29 October 2009.", "25. According to the applicant, O., who is now seventeen years old, currently does not come to the meetings with her or appears at the meetings in the caf\u00e9 but stays for no longer than half an hour, instead of the two hours specified by the access arrangements. On several occasions, the applicant unsuccessfully requested the court to change the venue of the meetings with O. back to her house.", "26. If the court obliges a parent exercising custody rights to ensure access by the other parent to the child, Article 1050 of the Code of Civil Proceedings (Kodeks post\u0119powania cywilnego) is applicable to the enforcement of this obligation.", "27. Article 1050 provides, in so far as relevant:", "\u201c1. If the debtor is obliged to take measures which cannot be taken by any other person, the court in whose district the enforcement proceedings were instituted, on a motion of the creditor and after hearing the parties, shall fix the time-limit within which the debtor shall comply with his obligation, on pain of a fine being imposed on him.", "2. If the debtor fails to comply with this obligation, further time-limits may be fixed and further fines may be imposed by the court.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
