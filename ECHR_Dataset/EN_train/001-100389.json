However, the offenders mentioned therein did not exist.", "7. On 27 June 2002 the Bobrynets District Court (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe District Court\u201d) found that the acts imputed to the applicant had ceased to be a danger to society.

On 26 November 2002 the Kirovograd Regional Court of Appeal (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Court of Appeal\u201d) quashed the decision of 27 June 2002, having noted that the lower court had not verified whether the applicant had consented to the discontinuation of the proceedings against him, and that it had examined the case in the applicant's absence. It ruled, however, to discontinue the proceedings against the applicant. According to the applicant's submissions he was not provided with a copy of that decision in due time and this therefore caused delays in appealing in cassation against it.", "9.

On 9 March 2004, having allowed the applicant's appeal in cassation, the Supreme Court found that, contrary to the requirement of the law, the courts in both instances had examined the case in the applicant's absence and that they had discontinued the proceedings against him without his consent.

However, he alleges that this was without a proper court order.", "15. According to the Government's submissions, the applicant failed to appear on 8 February 2005.", "16. On 16 February 2005 the District Court found the applicant guilty of abuse of authority and forgery but amnestied him.", "17. On 12 April 2005 the Court of Appeal, pointing out a number of shortcomings of the lower court (for example, the failure to indicate in the judgment the punishment given to the applicant, the failure to indicate the date of the amnesty act referred to, the failure to resolve the matter of court fees), quashed the judgment of 16 February 2005 and ordered a retrial.", "18. The applicant appealed in cassation. On 18 July 2005 the Supreme Court rejected his request for leave to appeal.", "19. Meanwhile, on 11 and 18 May 2005 the applicant failed to appear.

According to the applicant, these orders were enforced on 25 May 2005.", "20. On 25 May 2005 the District Court found the applicant guilty of the aforesaid crimes and sentenced him to one year's imprisonment. The court also banned the applicant from holding positions in the organs of the Ministry of the Interior. By the same judgment the court amnestied the applicant.", "21. On 16 August 2005 the Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of 25 May 2005.", "22. On 25 April 2006 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant's appeal in cassation. However, it ruled that the applicant should be exempted from punishment because the statutory time-limit for prosecuting him had elapsed.", "23.
