It appears that the applicant has been serving his prison sentence in different correctional facilities. From 6 April to 23 December 2005 the applicant was held in correctional colony no. IK- 4 in the Magadan region. Throughout the period in question, he was repeatedly sanctioned for failure to comply with the colony\u2019s internal regulations and was continuously detained in disciplinary cells.", "8. In particular, on 12 and 20 April 2005 the applicant was placed in a punishment cell for ten days for refusal to participate in cleaning work in the colony.

All the cells were equipped with a ventilation system in working order. There was access to natural light. During the night the cells were lit with a 40-watt electric bulb. The windows measured 50 x 90 centimetres and were covered with a steel grille whose openings measured 0.3 x 3 centimetres. The grille did not prevent access to daylight. The toilet was located in the corner of the cell, some 1.5 metres from the dining table and the nearest bed. It was separated by a 1.1-metre-high brick wall with a door. The temperature in the cells was at least 160C. The colony\u2019s disciplinary premises were provided with six exercise areas measuring from 7.5 to 10.6 square metres.

There was no ventilation or hot water. The potable water contained yellowish residue and sand. The beds and mattresses were in poor condition and uncomfortable. The cells were overcrowded. The one-and-a-half-hour\u2019s exercise took place in small yards which were always overcrowded. Nor was any exercise equipment available there.

On numerous occasions the applicant challenged in court the actions taken against him by the authorities of correctional colony no. IK-4, including the disciplinary sanctions imposed on him. Each time the courts considered his complaints in his absence, noting that the domestic rules of civil procedure did not impose on the court an obligation to ensure the convict\u2019s presence in the courtroom. The applicant\u2019s representative attended all the hearings, and made submissions to the court on the applicant\u2019s behalf.", "16. Article 99 \u00a7 1 of the Russian Code on the Execution of Criminal Sentences of 8 January 1997 (the \u201cCode\u201d) provides for a minimum standard of two square metres of personal space for male convicts in correctional colonies.

The Code provides for five main types of penal institutions for convicted criminals: correctional settlement, general regime colony, strict regime colony, special regime colony, and prison (Article 74 of the Code).", "18. The convicts have a different scope of rights depending on the regime of the correctional facility where they serve a sentence. In particular, the number of family visits and parcels the convicts may receive per year, as well as the amount of cash they are allowed to spend vary depending on the regime of the correctional facility.", "19. The conditions imposed on an inmate serving a sentence in a correctional settlement are the mildest. In particular, the convicts do not live in cells or barracks but in unguarded dormitories. They have the right to move freely within the correctional settlement during the day. The number and length of family visits are not limited, nor is the possibility of receiving parcels and money from home. As an incentive for good behaviour, and subject to approval by the administration, the convicts may, inter alia, live outside the correctional settlement with their families, live in rented flats, leave the correctional settlement for holidays and weekends, and move freely within the city or district where the settlement is situated. They do not wear a uniform and can dispose of their money as they please. The convicts may even be granted leave to work in another town or district, or participate in distance-learning programmes of higher education establishments (Article 129 of the Code).", "20. The regime in a prison is the most severe. The convicts are detained in cells. They are allowed daily outdoor exercise not exceeding one hour and a half. The number of family visits and parcels received per year is limited. So is the amount of money the convicts may spend during a month (Article 131 of the Code).", "21. The convicts serving a sentence in the strict regime colonies are placed in dormitories. They are allowed six family visits per year. They may receive eight parcels per year. These numbers may be decreased or increased subject to the convict\u2019s compliance with internal regulations of the correctional colony (Articles 122-23 of the Code).", "22. For failure to comply with the colony\u2019s internal regulations a convict may be placed in a disciplinary cell. During the period of detention in a punishment cell a convict has a right to one-hour daily outdoor exercise. In the event of repeated violations, a convict can be transferred to a prison-type cell. During the period of detention there, a convict has a right to a 1.5-hour daily outdoor exercise which may be increased up to 2 hours per day (Article 155 of the Russian Code on the Execution of Criminal Sentences)."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
