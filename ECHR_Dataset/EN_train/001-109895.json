The court ruled the bailiff\u2019s actions unlawful, annulled the decision to return the writ of execution and ordered the bailiff to institute enforcement proceedings. On 15 September 2004 the Altay Regional Court, acting on appeal, found that the writ of execution had indeed been defective and that the bailiff could have returned it for correction to the court, but not to the applicant. The appeal court removed the order to institute enforcement proceedings upholding the rest of the judgment. The applicant did not re-submit the writ of execution to the bailiffs\u2019 service as it was prescribed by the domestic law.", "6.
