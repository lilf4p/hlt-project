They stated, further, that there had been no censorship of the remaining letters as the relevant applicable legislation had been amended and the European Court of Human Rights had been added to the list of bodies with which a prisoner could correspond without censorship.", "29.

The letter stated that in September 2004 some officials from the Prosecutor\u2019s Office and the Main Directorate for the Execution of Sentences of the Ministry of Justice had visited him and had forced him to sign some papers.

Mr Ch.\u2019s explanatory note to the interview stated that he had not requested the applicant to withdraw his application to the European Court of Human Rights, and that the interview had been conducted in the correct form, without any rough, rude or degrading treatment on his part. The applicant\u2019s explanatory note stated that he had not made any complaints or critical remarks in respect of the prison administration and that he had not been subjected to any psychological or physical pressure.", "35.

The Government submitted that on 14 October 2004 Mr K. from the Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office had had an interview with the applicant. The applicant had made the following statement to Mr K.:", "\u201c... My correspondence with the European Court of Human Rights started in January 2001 during my detention in establishment UCh-398/9 in the town of Shakhty. From that prison I sent out eight letters (22 January 2001, 15 May 2001, 28 May 2001, 31 August 2001, 1 December 2001, 10 December 2001, 20 May 2002, 15 August 2002). All the above letters were received by the addressee and I retain proof of that. There were no instances of refusal to dispatch letters from prison IK-9. However, all letters were only accepted by the administration in an unsealed form and were dispatched with considerable delay. I made attempts to send out sealed envelopes but the head of the special department returned them to me with reference to the corresponding instructions from higher authorities.", "Since 11 February 2003 I have been serving my sentence in UCh 398/1 of the Main Directorate for the Execution of Sentences of the Ministry of Justice. From this correctional establishment I dispatched five letters to the European Court of Human Rights (3 March 2003, 25 May 2003, 20 October 2003, 13 April 2004 and 30 September 2004). I only know that my letter of 13 April 2004 was dispatched on 11 May 2004, whilst three previous letters never reached the Court. As to the letter of 30 September 2004, I am unaware of its fate. All these letters were not accepted from me in sealed form. The authority forced me to present them unsealed. As regards the answers from the European Court, I received three whilst serving the sentence in IK1, and all were sealed. The incoming numbers of IK-1 were: 5727 of 3 August 2004, 1751 of 6 April 2004. I do not know the number of the third answer, because I did not keep it. But I remember the date of receipt \u2013 28 June 2004.", "With all confidence I can state that I signed the receipt in respect of one of the answers and don\u2019t remember in respect of the others. Whilst serving the sentence in IK-1 I received copies of three answers from the European Court. They had been forwarded from IK-9 since I had not received them there.", "Apart from the foregoing, I don\u2019t have any other complaints in respect of the conditions of detention ...\u201d", "37. On 20 January 2005 the applicant was interviewed by Mr Zh., the head of the Department responsible for supervising the lawfulness of the execution of sentences at the Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office. The applicant confirmed that on 12 October 2004 he had had a word with Mr Ch. from the Ministry of Justice and on 14 October with Mr K. from the Prosecutor\u2019s Office. The applicant submitted that they had not put any pressure on him whatsoever and that all explanations had been given by him voluntarily.", "38. On 21 January 2005 the applicant made the following statement to Mr Zh.:", "\u201cIn a supplementary application form I mentioned that I had been forced to sign some papers and this was formulated in such a way that it could be understood that I had signed the documents under pressure from the representative of the prosecutor\u2019s office and the Main Directorate for the Execution of Sentences. In fact, this did not correspond to reality because in that case I was referring to the relations that I had previously had with the prison administration, when correspondence had been dispatched with delays and the administration had requested me to withdraw the complaints and had refused to send them out.", "At present the administration has been replaced and many officials fired, which is why I have normal relations with the administration and have no complaints. ... I have given no explanations against my will.\u201d", "39. In their statements of 20 January 2005, Mr Ch. and Mr K. explained that they had visited the applicant to check the facts outlined in his complaints to the European Court of Human Rights and interview the persons allegedly involved and that no coercion whatsoever had been put on the applicant in connection with his application to the Court.", "40. In their further observations, the Government said that the above-mentioned interviews had taken place during the check carried out by the competent bodies of the Russian Federation in connection with the request of the European Court of Human Rights dated 2 September 2004 to the Representative of the Government to clarify the applicant\u2019s allegations. They also submitted that the difference in the applicant\u2019s position in his statements of 12 and 14 October 2004 did not prove the alleged coercion as the applicant could have changed his position for other reasons.", "41. Section VI, Chapter 30 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1960, (\u0423\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e-\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441 \u0420\u0421\u0424\u0421\u0420), as in force at the material time, allowed certain officials to challenge a judgment which had become operative and to have the case reviewed.", "42. Pursuant to Article 356 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1960, a judgment became operative and was subject to execution as of the day when the appeal (cassation) instance pronounced its judgment or, if it had not been appealed against, when the time-limit for appeal had expired.", "\u201cThe grounds for quashing or changing a judgment [on supervisory review] are the same as [those for setting aside judgments which have not become operative on cassation appeals].\u201d", "\u201cThe grounds for quashing or changing a judgment on appeal are as follows:", "(i) prejudicial or incomplete inquest, investigation or court examination;", "(ii) inconsistency between the facts of the case and the conclusions reached by the court;", "(iii) grave violation of procedural law;", "(iv) misapplication of [substantive] law;", "(v) inadequacy of the sentence in relation to the gravity of the offence and the convicted person\u2019s personality.\u201d", "43. Article 371 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1960 provided that the power to lodge a request for a supervisory review could be exercised by the Prosecutor General, the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation and their respective Deputies in relation to any judgment other than those of the Presidium of the Supreme Court, and by the Presidents of the regional courts in respect of any judgment of a regional or subordinate court. A party to criminal or civil proceedings could solicit the intervention of such officials for a review.", "44. Articles 374, 378 and 380 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1960 provided that a request for supervisory review was to be considered by the judicial board (the Presidium) of the competent court. The court could examine the case on the merits, and was not bound by the scope and grounds of the extraordinary appeal. The Presidium could dismiss or uphold the request. If the request was dismissed, the earlier judgment remained in force. If it upheld the request, the Presidium could decide whether to quash the judgment and terminate the criminal proceedings, or remit the case for a new investigation or fresh court examination at any instance, or uphold a first-instance judgment reversed on appeal, or amend and uphold any of the earlier judgments.", "45. Article 380 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1960 provided that the Presidium could in the same proceedings reduce a sentence or amend the legal classification of a conviction or sentence to the defendant\u2019s advantage. If it found a sentence or legal classification too lenient, it had to remit the case for a new examination.", "46. In accordance with Article 377 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1960, a public prosecutor took part in hearings before a supervisory review instance. A convicted person and his or her counsel could be summoned if a supervisory review court found it necessary. If summoned, they were to be given an opportunity to examine the application for supervisory review and to make oral submissions at the hearing.", "47. On 14 February 2000 the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation ruled that Article 377 \u00a7 3 of the Code was unconstitutional in so far as it allowed supervisory review proceedings to be conducted in the absence of the defence where a special appeal against the previous decisions would, if successful, result in the worsening of the convicted person\u2019s situation.", "48. Under Article 407 of the new Code of Criminal Procedure of 2001, which entered into force on 1 July 2002, a convicted person and his counsel are notified of the date, time and place of hearings before the supervisory review court. They may participate in the hearing provided that they have made a specific request to that effect.", "49.

Law no. 26-FZ of 20 March 2001 amended this Article to provide for an exception from the rule in respect of correspondence with a court, a prosecutor\u2019s office, higher officials of the penitentiary system and the Ombudsman of the Russian Federation. A prisoner\u2019s correspondence with his lawyer or representative could be censored in certain cases upon a reasoned decision of the director or deputy director of the prison authority.", "51. Law no. 161-FZ of 8 December 2003 introduced further amendments to the Article.
