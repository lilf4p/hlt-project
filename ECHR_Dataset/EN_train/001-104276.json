He was represented before the Court by Ms N. Stus, a lawyer practising in the same village.", "On 9 September 1944 the Polish Committee of National Liberation and the former Soviet Socialist Republic of Ukraine concluded an agreement on the mutual resettlement of Ukrainians from Poland and Poles from Ukraine.", "In 1945 the applicant\u2019s family was moved from Poland to Ukraine. In Poland they left behind property, namely a house, a garden and a ten hectare plot of land.", "In March 2007 the applicant lodged a claim with the Ternopil Local Court against the Department of the State Treasury, the Ministry of Finance, the Ternopil Department of Finance, and the Ternopil State Notary\u2019s Office seeking recovery of the property which had belonged to his father and mother who had died in 1982 and 1992 respectively.", "On 1 June 2007 the court found against the applicant. It established that he was one of the heirs of his deceased parents and on this basis he had claimed compensation for the property left behind by them in Poland in 1945. According to information obtained by the court from the Ministry of Justice, payments to resettled people had been conducted through local governments prior to 1975 and special funds had been allocated for the implementation of the Agreement of 9 September 1944. The court further noted that since 1975 no funds had been allocated for implementation of the above-mentioned Agreement and current Ukrainian legislation did not provide for compensation for property left behind in Poland. On this basis, the court rejected the applicant\u2019s claim as unsubstantiated.", "On 2 August 2007 the Ternopil Regional Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the first-instance court. Having agreed with its reasoning, the court of appeal noted that the applicant had not proved that his father had not received any compensation for the property in question or that his father had made any claims for such compensation whilst he had still been alive and during the period that such compensation had been paid.", "On 2 October 2007 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal in cassation as unsubstantiated.", "The Agreement between the Polish Committee of National Liberation and the Government of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic on the evacuation of Polish citizens from the territory of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and of the Ukrainian population from the territory of Poland (Uk\u0142ad pomi\u0119dzy Polskim Komitetem Wyzwolenia Narodowego a Rz\u0105dem Ukrai\u0144skiej Socjalistycznej Republiki Rad dotycz\u0105cy ewakuacji obywateli polskich z terytorium U.S.R.R. i ludno\u015bci ukrai\u0144skiej z terytorium Polski / \u0423\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u043c\u0456\u0436 \u0423\u0440\u044f\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0457 \u0420\u0430\u0434\u044f\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0457 \u0421\u043e\u0446\u0456\u0430\u043b\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0457 \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0456\u043a\u0438 \u0456 \u041f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u043c \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0456\u0442\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043c \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0456\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0438\u0437\u0432\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e \u0435\u0432\u0430\u043a\u0443\u0430\u0446\u0456\u044e \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0437 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u0457 \u041f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0449\u0456 \u0456 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0434\u044f\u043d \u0437 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u0457 \u0423\u0420\u0421\u0420 \u2013 \u201cthe Agreement\u201d) was signed on 9 September 1944 and entered into force the same day.
