At present, women in the United Kingdom become eligible for a State pension at the age of sixty, whereas men are not eligible until sixty five.", "In their Observations, the Government submitted that the applicant received a total of GBP 236.15 per week in State benefits, including income support, disability living allowance and invalid care allowance.
