Constitutional Court decision no. 8/2011. (II.18.) AB contains the following passages:", "\u201cIV. 1. ... Within the confines of the Constitution, the legislator enjoys great freedom in regulating public service relationships. ... In 1992 in the public sector \u2013 where the legal positions of both the employers and the employees are determined by their dependence on the State budget \u2013 public-law regulations, basically corresponding to the characteristics of the closed public service system, were introduced. The legal status of the individuals who perform work in the service of the State was \u2013 according to the specific features of the activities performed \u2013 governed by the legislature in separate Acts of Parliament. ... The basic feature of the closed public service system is that the content of the public service relationship and the rights and duties of the subjects of the legal relationship are governed not by the parties\u2019 agreement but by statutes, by law. ... The content of the public service relationship is regulated under the law, regard being had to the fact that public servants carry out the tasks of the State, and, in performing their tasks, they exercise public powers, consequently \u2013 compared to other employees \u2013 additional statutory requirements must be imposed on them. The activity of public servants must serve the interest of the public, it must be professional, impartial, devoid of influence and bias, therefore public servants must meet up-to-date and high-standard professional requirements, must bear particular responsibility for their work and are subject to strict conflict-of-interest rules; however, the incomes earned in the public service remain below the wages that can be obtained in the private sector, since the source of public servants\u2019 remuneration is the State budget. The starting point for the closed public service system ... is that \u00ab additional requirements \u2013 compliance with which may and must be demanded from persons engaged in public service \u2013 may only be imposed in return for additional entitlements \u00bb. Such additional entitlements include the career system regulated and the salary guaranteed in an Act of Parliament, the predictable and safe \u2018public service life career\u2019 system and the additional allowances. A basic characteristic of the closed public service system is the stability of public service relationship, namely that a public servant may be removed from office only where the conditions specified in an Act of Parliament are met. While until the 1980s the public service systems of various States were characterised by the gradual extension of the closed public service system, since then a strongly critical approach to the closed systems has become more and more dominant. As a consequence, in almost all European States, public service reform processes have been launched in order to enhance the efficiency, performance and standards of the public administration. The direction of the reforms is to loosen the rigidity of the closed system, and to bring it closer to the regulation of private sector labour relations. The method generally applied for the loosening of the rigidity of the closed system is the loosening of the previously strictly interpreted concept of \u2018non-dismissibility\u2019 and the widening of the grounds of dismissal.", "The Hungarian Act on the Legal Status of Public Servants (\u201cKtv.\u201d) has never been based on the principle of \u2018non-dismissibility\u2019, as it has widely recognised the possibility of dismissing public servants from office and the grounds and conditions of dismissal have even been widened in the period having elapsed since 1992. ...", "2. ... The Act on the Legal Status of Government Officials (\u201cKtjt.\u201d) \u2013 with its rules on the termination of government official legal relationship \u2013 introduced essential changes in the system of public service as it had been created under the Ktv. and terminated the relative stability of the public service relationship guaranteed under the Ktv. ... The Ktv. rules on the termination of the legal relationship by dismissal from office not being applicable ... the government officials\u2019 legal relationship may be terminated by release from office by the employer without giving reasons. ...", "3. ... In the context of labour relations as regulated under the Labour Code (\u201cMt.\u201d) ... the Constitutional Court [...] evaluated the duty of giving reasons \u2013 interpreted as a restriction on the employer\u2019s right freely to dismiss an employee \u2013 as a privilege providing additional protection for employees, to which protection no person had a constitutional right. The employer\u2019s right freely to dismiss an employee can only be interpreted in the context of employment relationships based on contract, not in the context of civil service relationship based on the Ktjt. In public service relationships the right of dismissal from office is based not on the freedoms of contract but an Act of Parliament; in case of dismissal from office by the employer the duty to give reasons cannot be regarded as a \u201cpreference rule\u201d; on the contrary, it is a guarantee flowing from the nature of the legal relationship. ... In public service relationships, the statutory regulations concerning the grounds of dismissal from office constitute an issue of constitutionality, it being a guarantee corresponding to the specific features of public service relationships. [These] regulations and, consequently, the obligation to give reasons for dismissal has ... been regarded by the Constitutional Court ... as a guarantee having constitutional significance ...", "4. ... The special features of public-servant and government-official legal relationships ... are determined by the fact that ... officials hold public offices, perform State duties, adopt and prepare State decisions ... therefore those relationships are basically public-law relationships by their nature.", "Article 70(6) regulates the right to hold a public office as citizens\u2019 fundamental right. The protection of the right to hold a public office shall primarily mean that the State cannot make employment to public offices dependent on conditions which exclude, without constitutional reasons, Hungarian citizens from the possibility of acquiring a public office or make it impossible for a citizen or a group of citizens to hold a public office. ... The constitutional protection flowing from the right to hold a public office does not mean that the holder of a public office cannot be dismissed from office. ... Within the confines of the Constitution, the legislature enjoys a wide margin of freedom in regulating the grounds for release from office; this freedom, however ... shall not extend to granting free and unrestricted power to the person exercising the employer\u2019s rights to dismiss an incumbent from office. Free decisional power granted without any statutory limitation to the person exercising the employer\u2019s rights ... restricts, according to the Constitutional Court, in an unconstitutional manner the right to hold a public office, provided for by Article 70(6) of the Constitution. [It is required] that the substantive-law framework of the employer\u2019s decision be determined in an Act of Parliament. ...", "5. ... As to government officials\u2019 dismissal from office, the absence of grounds for dismissal and the lack of any statutory rules concerning the employer\u2019s obligation to give reasons endangers the \u2018party-neutrality\u2019, the independence from political influence, the impartiality and, therefore, the lawfulness of decisions of the public administration. Officials working in the organisation of public administration perform their tasks in a strictly hierarchical organisation. [If] government officials are not granted protection from dismissal from office, the person exercising the employer\u2019s rights may, at any time and without giving reasons, discontinue their employment, [and] they cannot be expected openly to stand up for their professional and legal position, if they risk losing their jobs. ...", "6. ... The general judicial legal protection enshrined in Article 57(1) of the Constitution is also guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In its recent case-law, the European Court of Human Rights \u2013 which has gradually extended the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 to labour disputes concerning the service of civil servants (Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, ECHR 2000VII; Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland [GC], no. 63235/00, ECHR 2007II; Iordan Iordanov and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 23530/02, 2 July 2009) \u2013 considers the right to effective judicial review as part of the right to a fair trial included in the right to access to a court. For the European Court of Human Rights, the judicial legal protection is not effective if there is a procedural or substantive obstacle to a genuine judicial examination of the parties\u2019 claims on the merits (Delcourt v. Belgium, 17 January 1970, Series A no. 11; Barber\u00e0, Messegu\u00e9 and Jabardo v. Spain, 6 December 1988, Series A no. 146). ...", "The Constitutional Court holds that by failing to regulate the statutory conditions of dismissal from office by the employer and by allowing for the possibility of not giving reasons for the decision, the legislature disproportionately restricted the right of government officials to judicial legal protection, guaranteed under Article 57(1) of the Constitution. In the absence of an obligation to give reasons and of any rules providing guidance for the determination of the lawfulness of a dismissal, the scope of cases (nullity of and barrier to dismissal, violation of equal treatment, misuse of rights) in which a government official may turn to court with any prospect of success and in which the court can decide on the merits of a dismissal has become significantly reduced. Under the Ktjt., in public service-related legal disputes the unlawfulness of a dismissal by the employer must be proved by the government official. An exception to this rule is made in cases when the legal dispute is based on a violation of the equal treatment requirement; in such proceedings \u2013 under section 19 of Act no. CXXV of 2003 on Equal Treatment and the Promotion of Equal Opportunities \u2013 the injured party needs only to substantiate the violation, and it is for the employer to prove that he complied with the equal treatment requirement. Public servants may also turn to court for improper use of rights, violating section 4 of Mt.", "... As it can be concluded from the reasoning of the Act, section 8 (1) of the Ktjt. allows \u2013 in the interest of simpler realisation of government endeavours \u2013 for the possibility of the termination by the employer of government officials\u2019 legal relationship without any legal limits.", "... The Constitutional Court holds that this vulnerable position of government officials, their being treated as \u201cmeans\u201d for resolving State tasks, is contrary to human dignity.\u201d", "17. Constitutional Court decision no. 35/2011. (V.6.) AB contains the following passages:", "\u201c1. The Constitutional Court holds that it is a constitutional requirement that legal disputes put before a judge be determined on the basis of constitutional laws. If a judge perceives the unconstitutionality of a law applicable in the case pending before the court, he shall ... be obliged to initiate proceedings before the Constitutional Court, under section 38(1) of Act no. XXXII of 1989 on the Constitutional Court (\u201cAbtv.\u201d).", "2. In the \u2018concrete norm control\u2019 proceedings instituted upon a judge\u2019s initiative, the Constitutional Court may pronounce a general prohibition of the application of the law found unconstitutional in all civil actions with identical factual basis, to be determined under the same law. If only specific, rather than general, prohibition of application has been ordered by the Constitutional Court, the latter shall \u2013 upon a further initiative of the judge \u2013 conduct the proceedings motioned by the judge solely in respect of the prohibition of application of the law. The legal consequences of the Constitutional Court ruling on the general or specific prohibition of application shall be drawn by the judge in charge who shall deliver a decision in the action in compliance with the ruling.", "3.1. An essential objective of the Constitution-protecting tasks of the Constitutional Court is to prevent the prevalence of unconstitutional norms in the legal system. The judge authorised to determine individual legal disputes ... is bound to adopt a decision on the basis of the constitutional interpretation of the applicable law. However, in case of unconstitutionality irresolvable by the interpretation of the law, the judge \u2013 lacking the power to set aside the law \u2013 shall necessarily cooperate with the Constitutional Court, on the basis of his statutory obligation. To put it another way, in case of unconstitutionality irresolvable by the interpretation of the law, the litigant\u2019s right to a lawful judge shall only prevail in the course of the Constitutional Court proceedings. ... The judge turning to the Constitutional Court shall, on the basis of his obligation flowing from Article 50(1) of the Constitution, act in order to protect the individual rights of the parties concerned in the legal dispute, but he can only comply with this constitutional obligation upon the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision on the merits of the case. ...", "3.5. Thus, the purpose of the institution of the judge\u2019s initiative is partly to enforce the litigant\u2019s fundamental right to a lawful judge, and \u2013 beyond the abstract protection of constitutionality \u2013 partly to prevent that any individual legal dispute be determined ... on the basis of an unconstitutional law.", "Thus, when in a given litigation the judge \u2013 complying with his constitutional obligation \u2013 initiates an examination of the constitutionality of the applicable law, the scope of the unconstitutionality found by the Constitutional Court shall, as a rule, extend to all pending litigations having the same factual and legal basis as the one giving rise to the Constitutional Court proceedings. The legal consequences of the unconstitutionality found and of the general prohibition of application imposed as a result of the examination of the constitutionality in the \u2018concrete norm control\u2019 proceedings shall be drawn by the judges sitting in those pending legal actions which do not form part of the Constitutional Court proceedings but have arisen from an identical factual basis and have to be determined under the same law. ....\u201d", "18.
