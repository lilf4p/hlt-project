From 1994 to 1996 elections to the VMC were fixed and postponed several times. The elections took place in 1996 and 1997, but were found invalid because of certain informalities, including insufficient participation by the electorate and a disputed outcome.", "In 1997 and 1998 the VMC was not elected as the local executive and law enforcement authorities were involved in a number of court disputes as to the proper manner in which to hold the elections. During those proceedings a number of administrative decisions were taken, but subsequently quashed. In late 1998 and early 1999 the elections took place several times, but were found invalid because of various informalities including, once more, insufficient participation by the electorate and a disputed outcome.", "On 5 July 1998 the applicant\u2019s mandate as the mayor of Vladivostok expired. On 26 September 1998 the Maritime Territory Electoral Registry refused to register him as a candidate in the next mayoral elections.

Upon the applicant\u2019s appeal against the decision preventing his candidacy, on 5 October 1998 the Maritime Territory Regional Court upheld that decision. The applicant appealed to the Supreme Court. The applicant contends that the appeal is currently pending.", "", "By a decree of 11 December 1998 the President of Russia authorised the Governor of the Maritime Territory to appoint an acting mayor of Vladivostok on the ground that the applicant\u2019s mandate had expired. On 14 December 1998 the Governor appointed an acting mayor. The applicant applied to court, contesting the lawfulness of that appointment. He stated in particular that his term continued as long as his successor was not elected. On 19 January 1999 the Maritime Territory Regional Court confirmed the lawfulness of the Governor\u2019s decision. On 4 February 1999 the Supreme Court rejected at first instance the applicant\u2019s action whereby he had alleged that the presidential decree of 11 December 1998 had been null and void. On 15 April 1999 the Appellate Chamber of the Supreme Court upheld that decision. On 14 May 1999 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal against the judgment of 19 January 1999.", "It appears that to date neither the Vladivostok Municipal Council nor the mayor has been elected.", "B.
