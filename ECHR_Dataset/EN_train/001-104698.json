The applicant was born in 1946 and lives predominantly in Germany.", "7. Upon the death of her parents, the applicant, together with her brother, B.R., inherited a house and plot of land in Sofia, a plot of land in the village of Dolni Pasarel, and two fields.", "8. On 9 July 1996 B.R. brought a claim against the applicant with the Sofia District Court (\u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d \u0441\u044a\u0434), seeking the division of the house and of the two plots.", "9. At the first hearing, held on 10 December 1996, the applicant requested that the two fields be included in the division as well. The court allowed the request and adjourned the case, instructing the parties to submit evidence, including plans of the two plots.", "10. A hearing listed for 6 March 1997 was adjourned because the plans, which had to be provided by the municipal authorities, were not ready, and another hearing, scheduled for 6 May 1997, failed to take place because counsel for B.R. was absent.", "11. On 23 September 1997 the court asked an expert to determine the value of the properties and say whether it was possible to divide them up. A hearing listed for 20 January 1998 did not take place because the expert report was not ready. The report was apparently never drawn up.", "12. On 19 March 1998 the court, on a request by the parties, stayed the proceedings to allow them to settle the case. However, as they could not reach an agreement, the proceedings resumed on an unspecified later date in 1998.", "13. Two hearings, fixed for 29 October 1998 and 2 February 1999, did not take place because the applicant was not duly summoned and was absent. A hearing was held despite the applicant\u2019s absence on 16 March 1999.", "14. In a judgment of 15 April 1999 the Sofia District Court allowed the division of the properties into two equal shares. As neither party appealed, the judgment became final and the court proceeded with the second phase of the proceedings.", "15. At a hearing held on 19 October 1999 the applicant requested that the house be allotted exclusively to her. B.R. requested the appointment of an expert to answer the same questions as the one appointed during the first phase of the proceedings.", "16. A hearing listed for 18 November 1999 was adjourned because the expert report was not ready.", "17. At a hearing held on 16 December 1999 the court admitted the report in evidence. Its conclusion was that none of the properties was divisible. The parties did not contest that conclusion.", "18. In a judgment of 10 January 2000 the Sofia District Court allotted the house and plot of land in Sofia to the applicant, and the plot in Dolni Pasarel and the two fields to B.R.", "19. B.R. appealed, requesting, among other things, an expert report on the value of the properties and on the possibilities of their being divided up.", "20. The first hearing before the Sofia City Court (\u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u044a\u0434) was held on 6 July 2000. The court refused to order the expert report requested by B.R., and adjourned the case to allow the parties to call witnesses and present additional evidence.", "21. At the next hearing, held on 25 October 2000, the court heard two witnesses. It agreed to order the expert report sought by B.R.", "22. Two hearings, listed for 31 January and 3 May 2001, were adjourned because the report had not been drawn up.", "23. The report, which concluded that the house in Sofia was divisible but that the plot in Dolni Pasarel was indivisible, was ready on 23 October 2001. It was admitted in evidence at a hearing held on 31 October 2001. The applicant objected to the report\u2019s conclusions, and requested a second expert report, to be drawn up by three experts. B.R. requested an expert report on the possibility of dividing up one of the fields.", "24. At the next hearing, held on 20 March 2002, B.R. presented a blueprint, approved by the technical services of the municipality, for the division of the house. The court admitted in evidence the expert report on the divisibility of the field, and, on a request by the applicant, ordered an expert report on the current value of the plot in Dolni Pasarel.", "25. A hearing listed for 6 November 2002 was adjourned because the expert reports were not ready. The court asked the expert assessing the value of the plot in Dolni Pasarel to determine the value of the two fields as well.", "26. At a hearing held on 29 May 2003 the court admitted in evidence the additional expert report relating to the house, which also concluded that it was divisible, and the expert report concerning the value of the plot in Dolni Pasarel and the two fields. The applicant disputed the conclusions of the former, and requested a fresh expert report on the divisibility of the house. The court allowed her request, notwithstanding the objection of B.R.", "27. At a hearing held on 12 February 2004 counsel for the applicant stated, without further explanation, that she wished to withdraw the request for an expert report on the divisibility of the house. It seems that the withdrawal was based on the fact that the applicant had failed to pay the required fees for the report to be drawn up.", "28. The last hearing was held on 29 April 2004. The court presented to the parties a draft division proposal. The applicant objected to it, arguing, among other things, that the house was indivisible. She requested a further expert report on that point. The court refused the request, observing that the applicant had earlier been allowed to seek such a report, but had failed to pay the required deposit. Evidentiary requests at such a late stage were possible only if truly indispensable for the proper determination of the case.", "29. In a judgment of 10 May 2004 the Sofia City Court set the lower court\u2019s judgment aside. It decided, among other things, to disregard the initial expert reports on the divisibility of the house and to rely on the last one, observing that it was objective and that the three experts who had drawn it up were unanimous. It rejected the applicant\u2019s objections against that report, noting, among other things, that she had been allowed to request a further expert report but had failed to pursue that possibility. It found that the house was divisible, because it was technically possible to do so and there was a blueprint approved by the municipal administration. It further found that the division could be effected by drawing lots without great inconvenience. Accordingly, the court divided the properties into two lots, the first comprising the first storey of the house in Sofia and the plot in Dolni Pasarel, and the second comprising the second storey of the house and the two fields.", "30. On 20 July 2004 the applicant appealed on points of law. On 22 July 2004 the Sofia City Court instructed her to specify her grievances. She did so on 21 September 2004, arguing that the court had erred in finding that the house could be divided. The expert report on which it had relied had not taken into account the applicable construction rules. The court had also erred in refusing the applicant\u2019s request for a further expert report; she had failed to pay the required deposit because she had been out of the country at the time.", "31. The Supreme Court of Cassation (\u0412\u044a\u0440\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d \u0441\u044a\u0434) held a hearing on 21 February 2005, and in a final judgment of 7 April 2005 upheld the lower court\u2019s judgment. It noted that counsel for the applicant had withdrawn the request for a further expert report. The applicant could not therefore validly complain that she had been denied the opportunity to adduce evidence concerning the divisibility of the house. Her objections concerning the plan for the division had been discussed and rejected by the lower court. The court went on to observe that the experts and the municipal administration had found that the division could be effected without too much inconvenience and without infringing the applicable construction regulations. Therefore, the lower court\u2019s conclusion that the house was divisible was not contrary to the substantive law.", "32. The proceedings then resumed before the Sofia District Court. At a hearing held on 21 June 2005 the applicant and B.R. drew lots to determine which of the divided properties should go to whom. B.R. received the first storey of the house in Sofia and the plot in Dolni Pasarel, and the applicant received the second storey of the house and the two fields. The court confirmed the division, ordered the applicant to pay B.R. a small sum to equalise their respective shares, and terminated the proceedings.", "33. On 29 June 2005 the applicant appealed against the proposed division. On 4 July 2005 the Sofia District Court instructed her to specify her grievances and pay the requisite fee. The court\u2019s instructions were served on the applicant\u2019s counsel on 7 September 2005. On 14 September 2005 he requested an extension of time, citing the applicant\u2019s being abroad. On 13 October 2005 the court granted an extension until 15 October 2005.", "34. As the applicant did not comply with the court\u2019s instructions, on 25 January 2006 the court refused to forward the appeal to the higher court for examination. Despite visits to the applicant\u2019s home on 3, 8 and 17 February, 1 March, 16, 20 and 27 April, and 1 May 2006, the court\u2019s process servers were not able to find the applicant to notify her of the court\u2019s ruling. On 22 May 2006 they served notice of the ruling on the applicant\u2019s counsel. As he did not seek to appeal against the ruling, it became final on 30 May 2006.", "35. Under Article 130 of the Constitution, the Supreme Judicial Council is the principal body concerned with the administration of the judiciary (which, in Bulgaria, comprises the courts, the prosecutor\u2019s offices and the investigation services). It has the power to, inter alia, appoint, promote, demote and dismiss judges, prosecutors and investigators (Article 129 \u00a7 1 and Article 130 \u00a7 6 (1)) and impose the harshest disciplinary punishments (Article 130 \u00a7 6 (2)).", "36. A 2007 amendment to the Constitution added a new Article 132a, which envisaged the creation of an Inspectorate attached to the Supreme Judicial Council. The Inspectorate, which consists of a chief inspector and ten inspectors, is tasked with checking the work of the judiciary without infringing the independence of judges, prosecutors or investigators (Article 132a \u00a7 6). It can act either of its own motion or pursuant to reports by private individuals, legal persons or State authorities (Article 132a \u00a7 7). It has the power to refer matters to the appropriate authorities, or make suggestions or reports to them (Article 132a \u00a7 9).", "37. Section 7(1) of the 2007 Judiciary Act provides that \u201c[e]veryone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal\u201d.", "38. Sections 4060 of the Act govern the structure, powers and operations of the Inspectorate attached to the Supreme Judicial Council (see paragraph 36 above). One of the Inspectorate\u2019s tasks is to check the processing of cases and their completion within the prescribed time-limits (section 54(1)(2)). It carries out planned annual checks or unplanned checks prompted by reports (section 56(1)). After carrying out a check of the work of an individual judge, prosecutor or investigator, the Inspectorate draws up a report containing its findings and recommendations, if any (section 58(2)). That report is presented to the judge, prosecutor or investigator concerned and to his or her hierarchical superior (section 58(3)). The hierarchical superior must then, within the time set in the report, inform the chief inspector about the implementation of the recommendations (section 58(4)).", "39. At the relevant time divisionofproperty proceedings were governed by Articles 27893a of the 1952 Code of Civil Procedure. They consisted of two phases.", "40. During the first phase the court had to ascertain the number and the identity of the coowners and of the items of common property, as well as the share to which each coowner was entitled (Article 282 \u00a7 1).", "41. During the second phase the court carried out the division, which could be done either by specifying which item of property went to which coowner (Articles 287 and 289), or by auctioning an undividable item of property and distributing the proceeds among the coowners (Article 288 \u00a7 1). If one of the divided properties was a flat inhabited by a coowner who did not have another dwelling, he or she could request the flat to be allotted exclusively to him or her in return for reimbursing the other coowners their shares in it (Article 288 \u00a7 3).", "42. In property division proceedings the court could also have cognisance of certain ancillary matters, such as determination of parentage and validity of wills (Article 281 \u00a7 1), reimbursement of expenses incurred in relation to the divided property and indemnity for improvements to the property by one of the coowners (Article 286 \u00a7 1), use of the property during the proceedings and indemnity for such use (Article 282 \u00a7 2).", "43. Article 217a of the Code was added in July 1999. It provided as follows:", "\u201c1. Each party may file a complaint about delays at every stage of the proceedings, including after oral argument, when the examination of the case, the delivery of judgment or the transmitting of an appeal against judgment is unduly delayed.", "2. The complaint about delays shall be filed directly with the higher court. No copies shall be served on the other party, and no State fee shall be due. The filing of a complaint about delays shall not be limited in time.", "3. The president of the court with which the complaint has been filed shall request the case file and shall immediately examine the complaint in private. His instructions as to the steps to be carried out by the court shall be mandatory. His order shall not be subject to appeal and shall be sent immediately, together with the case file, to the court against which the complaint has been filed.", "4. Should he determine that there has been [undue delay], the president of the higher court may propose that the disciplinary panel of the Supreme Judicial Council take disciplinary action.\u201d", "44. The 2007 Code of Civil Procedure came into force on 1 March 2008, superseding the 1952 Code of Civil Procedure.", "45. Article 13 of the new Code, entitled \u201cExamination and disposal of cases within a reasonable time\u201d, provides as follows:", "\u201cThe court shall examine and decide cases within a reasonable time.\u201d", "46. The new Code contains more detailed provisions in relation to the admission of evidence. It provides that the claimant must set out his or her evidence in the statement of claim, and enclose the written evidence with it (Article 127 \u00a7 2). The defendant must do the same in his or her reply to the statement of claim (Article 131 \u00a7 3). He or she cannot do so at a later stage, unless his or her failure was due to special circumstances (Article 133). As a rule, the court should rule on the evidential requests when setting the case down for hearing (Article 140 \u00a7 1). At the first hearing, the parties may supplement their evidential requests if that has been made necessary by the other party\u2019s assertions (Article 143 \u00a7 2). The court must provide them with guidance (Article 145 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 and Article 146 \u00a7 2). After that, fresh evidence may be admitted only if the party had no means of adducing it earlier, or if it relates to newly arisen circumstances (Article 147 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2). Evidential requests in relation to facts which are irrelevant for the outcome of the case and untimely evidential requests are to be rejected (Article 159 \u00a7 1).", "47. In their evidential requests, the parties must specify the facts that they are seeking to prove and the manner in which they intend to do so (Article 156 \u00a7 1). Thus, when calling a witness, a party must say in relation to which facts he or she will be heard (Article 156 \u00a7 2). If it calls several witnesses in relation to one fact, the court may admit only some of them, and hear the rest only if the initial ones fail to establish the fact in issue (Article 159 \u00a7 2). When requesting the ordering of an expert report, a party must specify the area in which the expert(s) should possess special knowledge, as well as the subject matter and the task of the expert report (Article 156 \u00a7 4).", "48. In appeal proceedings, the parties may not rely on fresh facts or adduce evidence that they could have adduced during the firstinstance proceedings (Article 266 \u00a7 1). Again in appeal proceedings, fresh evidence may be admitted only if the party had no means of adducing it earlier (Article 266 \u00a7 2 (1)), if it relates to newly arisen circumstances (Article 266 \u00a7 2 (2)), or if it has not been admitted by the firstinstance court in breach of the rules of procedure (Article 266 \u00a7 3).", "49. Articles 25557 of the new Code, which superseded Article 217a of the 1952 Code, were inspired by Austrian law (\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0420., \u041f\u0443\u043d\u0435\u0432, \u0411., \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0432, \u0421., \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440 \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u044f \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0443\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d \u043a\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441, \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f, 2008 \u0433., \u0441\u0442\u0440. 375) and provide as follows:", "\u201c1. Where the court does not take a procedural step in due time, a party may, at any stage of the proceedings, make a request for an appropriate timelimit to be fixed for that procedural step to be taken.", "2. The request shall be filed with that court for onward transmission to the higher court. The court examining the case shall immediately forward the request to the higher court together with its opinion.\u201d", "\u201c1. If the court immediately takes all steps mentioned in the request, and notifies the party accordingly, the request shall be considered as withdrawn.", "2. If within one week of receiving the notification mentioned in the previous subparagraph the party states that it maintains its request, the request shall be forwarded to the higher court for examination.\u201d", "\u201c1. The request for fixing of a timelimit shall be examined by a judge of the higher court within one week of its receipt.", "2. If that court finds that there has been undue delay, it shall fix a timelimit for the procedural step in question to be taken. Should the court find otherwise, it shall refuse the request. No appeal shall lie against its decision.\u201d", "50. These provisions seem to apply to the administrative courts as well, by virtue of Article 144 of the 2006 Code of Administrative Procedure, which provides that all matters not specifically dealt with are governed by the Code of Civil Procedure. In practice, the Supreme Administrative Court does examine requests to fix timelimits (\u043e\u043f\u0440. \u2116 6710 \u043e\u0442 22 \u043c\u0430\u0439 2009 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 4561/2009 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0447\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d \u0441\u0432).", "51. The Government provided eight decisions given by the Supreme Court of Cassation, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Veliko Tarnovo Court of Appeal in connection with such requests. Only two of those decisions fixed time-limits in which the lower courts were instructed to take certain procedural steps.", "52. According to statistical information provided by the Government, in 2009 the regional courts received 145 requests to fix timelimits because of delays. All but ten of them were dealt with in less than three months. In 2009 the courts of appeal received 78 such requests. All of them were dealt with in less than three months (the statutory timelimit is one week \u2013 see paragraph 49 above). The Government did not provide information about the impact the examination of those requests had had on the speed of the proceedings in connection with which they had been made.", "53. Section 1 of the 1988 State Responsibility for Damage Caused to Citizens Act (which was renamed \u201cState and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act\u201d on 12 July 2006 \u2013 \u201cthe 1988 Act\u201d), as in force since July 2006, provides as follows:", "\u201cThe State and the municipalities shall be liable for damage caused to individuals and legal persons by unlawful decisions, actions or omissions by their organs and officials, committed in the course of or in connection with the performance of administrative action.\u201d", "54. Section 2(1) of the Act, as originally enacted, provided for liability of the investigating and the prosecuting authorities and the courts in six situations: unlawful detention; bringing of charges or conviction, if the proceedings were later abandoned or if the conviction was overturned; coercive medical treatment or coercive measures imposed by a court, if its decision was later quashed as being unlawful; and serving of a sentence over and above its prescribed duration. A new point, added in March 2009, provides that the State is liable for any damage the investigating and prosecuting authorities or the courts cause to individuals through the unlawful use of special surveillance means.", "55. According to some legal commentators, the remedies under Article 217a of the 1952 Code and under Articles 25557 of the 2007 Code were/are not available in respect of proceedings before the Supreme Court of Cassation, because there is no \u201chigher court\u201d (\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0432, \u0416., \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0443\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e, \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f, 2006 \u0433., \u0441\u0442\u0440. 106, \u041a\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0437\u043e\u0432, \u041b., \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e \u0441\u044a\u0434\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e, \u0422\u043e\u043c \u043f\u044a\u0440\u0432\u0438, \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f, 2009 \u0433., \u0441\u0442\u0440. 682). Other commentators maintain that the remedy under Articles 25557 of the 2007 Code, could, in view of its specificities, be applied to cases pending before the Supreme Court of Cassation because its essential purpose is not to apprise the higher court of delays by the lower court but to prompt the latter to expedite the examination of the case (\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0420., \u041f\u0443\u043d\u0435\u0432, \u0411., \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0432, \u0421., \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440 \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u044f \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0443\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d \u043a\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441, \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f, 2008 \u0433., \u0441\u0442\u0440. 379).", "56.

The Judicial Service Commission has the power to impose disciplinary penalties (other than comment and reprimand, which are imposed by the hierarchical superior) on judges, prosecutors and investigating judges. The public bodies responsible for enforcing judicial decisions and the bodies responsible for entries in the land registry may be sanctioned by the Ministry of Justice ([section] 311).", "The authorities have stated that during the period 20072009 the number of disciplinary proceedings before the Supreme Judicial Council rose steadily (13 in 2007, 28 in 2008 and 83 in 2009). By way of example, in 2009 seven judges and one head of administration were sanctioned, mainly for systematic failure to comply with the time-limits laid down by law. Among them, three judges were dismissed and three others had their salaries reduced by 10 to 25% for periods of up to a year.", "\u2013 Longterm strategies", "The Bulgarian authorities have adopted several strategies on judicial reforms. For example, a criminal policy strategy for the period 20102014 has been adopted, the principal objective being to further reduce the excessive formalism of criminal procedure. It should be noted that the amendments to the 2010 CCrP were decided on the basis of this strategy (see above).", "Further, in 2009 the government adopted a plan to eradicate the causes of violations of the Convention found by the European Court in its judgments concerning Bulgaria. That plan was drawn up by a working party which included representatives of the Ministry of Justice as well as human rights activists. Among the tangible results obtained on the basis of this plan, should be mentioned the working party set up to introduce an application for compensation in cases of excessive length of judicial proceedings (see below).

The provisions governing this remedy were maintained to a great extent in the new CCvP of 2007. Articles 255 to 257 thereof stipulate that, if a court fails to take a procedural step in time, the parties may at any time request the superior court to set a deadline for taking the procedural step in question. The request is lodged through the court seized of the case, which must send it to the superior court together with its own opinion. If the court seized of the case takes the requested steps immediately, the request is deemed to be withdrawn unless the party concerned states that it wishes to maintain the request. In cases where the request is transmitted to the superior court, it must be examined within one week by a judge of that court. If he finds that there has been unjustified delay, the superior court sets a deadline by which the procedural step must be taken. The order of the superior court is final.", "According to the data supplied by the authorities, the regional courts examined 242 applications for speeding up of civil proceedings in 2007. 110 applications were examined in 2008 and 142 in 2009. Also in 2009, the appeal courts examined 78 applications for the speeding up of proceedings.", "The European Court has accepted that the remedy provided for in Article 217a of the former CCvP is effective in principle (see Simizov against Bulgaria, No. 59523/00, \u00a7 56, 18 October 2007, Jeliazkov and others against Bulgaria, No. 9143/02, \u00a7 48, 3 April 2008, and Stefanova against Bulgaria, No. 58828/00, \u00a7 69, 11 January 2007). It has however stated that account must be taken of the circumstances of each case (Stefanova, cited above, \u00a7 69) and of the effect which such application might have on the overall length of the proceedings in question (Simizov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 54-56). In several cases the Court has found that the application in question has not or could not have prevented certain delays by reason of their specific causes, such as for example inactivity on the part of the prosecution, inability of the domestic authorities to ensure that one party to the proceedings is properly summonsed, or errors in the application of the law (Stefanova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 70 and 71, Mincheva against Bulgaria, No. 21558/03, \u00a7 105, 2 September 2010, Maria Ivanova against Bulgaria, No. 10905/04, \u00a7 35, 18 March 2010).", "Furthermore, the European Court observed that it was unclear whether this remedy was available before the Supreme Court of Cassation, in so far as there was no higher court.", "The authorities have indicated that these shortcomings will be taken into account when defining a new application for compensation in cases of excessive length of judicial proceedings (see below).", "...", "\u2013 Compensatory remedy", "The European Court has consistently pointed to the absence in Bulgarian law of a remedy enabling compensation to be obtained for excessive length of judicial proceedings (see, for example, the Mincheva against Bulgaria judgment cited above, \u00a7 107).", "In this connection the Government has indicated that, in the context of implementing a plan to eradicate the causes of the violations found by the European Court in judgments concerning Bulgaria, it has set up a working party to prepare a bill amending the law on the responsibility of the state and municipalities for prejudice caused to individuals. This bill envisages, in particular, the introduction of an application for compensation in cases of unjustified delay in the proceedings. This working party has drafted a bill providing that the state may be held responsible, in addition to the cases already settled, where unjustified delay in civil, criminal and administrative proceedings are attributable to the judicial authorities.", "As regards criminal proceedings, it should also be noted that certain forms of nonpecuniary redress exist in cases of excessive length of proceedings, such as the possibility of reducing the penalties. This form of redress has been recognised by the European Court as an effective remedy in certain circumstances (Bochev against Bulgaria judgment of 13 November 2008, \u00a7 83).\u201d", "58.
