SLOVAKIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a Slovak national born in 1966. She is unemployed and resides in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica.", "A.", "The applicant and her husband agreed to transfer the tenancy of an apartment situated at Tatransk\u00e1 Street 46 in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica to an individual. The latter orally promised to the applicant that her family could move to a smaller apartment situated at Javorn\u00edcka Street 22 in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica.", "On 27 July 1994 the applicant and her husband signed a formal agreement according to which the right to use the apartment situated at Tatransk\u00e1 street 46 would be transferred to the aforesaid individual as from 1 September 1994. Section III \u00a7 3 of the agreement stated that the applicant and her husband were liable to pay the rent until the agreement became operative, and that after the transfer their address would be Javorn\u00edcka street 22. The agreement was signed in the presence of a representative of the co-operative which owns the apartment situated at Tatransk\u00e1 street 46.", "Subsequently the applicant found out that her family could not move into the apartment situated at Javorn\u00edcka street 22 as it was occupied by another person. She therefore challenged the agreement of 27 July 1994 before the Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica District Court (Okresn\u00fd s\u00fad - \u201cthe District Court\u201d) on the ground that the individual concerned had made her sign the agreement under false pretences.", "On 14 June 1996 the District Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s action. At the hearing a representative of the co-operative concerned stated that the applicant and her husband had signed the agreement of their own free will and without any reservations. Neither this witness nor the three other witnesses heard by the court were in a position to confirm the applicant\u2019s allegation that she had been promised the right to live in the apartment situated at Javorn\u00edcka street 22. Since there was no evidence which supported the applicant\u2018s allegation, the court concluded that the applicant had failed to show that she and her husband had concluded the agreement under circumstances which could affect its validity within the meaning of Sections 37 \u00a7 1 and 39 of the Civil Code (see \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201c below).", "The applicant appealed. She alleged that the individual who had offered them the deal had acted in a fraudulent way and invoked Sections 3, 37 \u00a7 2 and 39 of the Civil Code.", "On 30 October 1996 the Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica Regional Court (Krajsk\u00fd s\u00fad - \u201cthe Regional Court\u201c) upheld the District Court\u2019s judgment of 14 June 1996. The Regional Court found that the District Court had established all relevant facts of the applicant\u2019s case with sufficient certainty, and that it had assessed them correctly from the legal point of view. In particular, the Regional Court noted that two witnesses had confirmed that the applicant and her husband had signed the agreement of their own free will. It found no evidence indicating that the agreement was void for any of the reasons set out in Sections 37 and 39 of the Civil Code.", "In the Regional Court\u2019s view, Section III \u00a7 3 of the agreement of 27 July 1994 referred to Javorn\u00edcka street 22 as the applicant\u2019s future address solely in the context of arrangements regarding the advance payments of the rent for the apartment situated at Tatransk\u00e1 street 46 until the applicant\u2019s departure from that apartment. The Regional Court held it therefore for irrelevant that the applicant could not actually move into the apartment situated at Javorn\u00edcka street 22.", "On 23 March 1998 the District Court ordered the applicant to vacate the apartment situated at Tatransk\u00e1 street 46. On 30 July 1998 the Regional Court upheld this decision. Both courts established, with reference to the reasons set out in their judgments of 14 June and 30 October 1996 respectively, that the applicant and her husband had transferred the right to use the apartment in question to another individual and concluded that they lived in it without any legal ground.", "B.
