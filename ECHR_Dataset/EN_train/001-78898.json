A new address of the defendant foundation was indicated in the header of the letter.", "23. The case was adjourned on 7 September 1998 due to the absence of the parties.

In the course of the proceedings the applicant filed a counter-claim.", "40. The applicant sought an injunction giving him the right to use the flat. The request for an injunction was dismissed by a final decision which was given by the District Court on 3 June 1999.", "41. On 15 May 2002 the District Court dismissed both parties\u2019 claims.

On 15 October 2003 the Regional Court upheld the first-instance judgment which became final on 20 January 2004.", "43. On 28 January 2005 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicant\u2019s complaint about inactivity of the District Court as regards his above request for an injunction. The Constitutional Court referred to the ordinary courts\u2019 findings in the proceedings concerning the use of the flat in issue.

On 5 August 1996 the applicant claimed distribution of his and his former wife\u2019s marital property.", "45.

The court scheduled four hearings between 20 December 1996 and 14 March 1997.

On 22 July 1998 the applicant sought the enforcement of the sum in question.", "49. On 6 August 1998 the Bratislava V District Court authorised an executions officer to enforce the sum. On 19 August 1998 the executions officer issued a notification of the execution. It was served on the applicant on 1 June 1999 and on the debtor on 26 May 1999.", "50. On 24 June 1999 and on 20 July 1999 the executions officer issued two execution orders with a view to obtaining the sum owed by the defendant through the sale of his movable property and the withdrawal of a part of his income. On 8 July 1999 the executions officer, with the assistance of the police, established an inventory of the movable property of the debtor. The movables were not taken away as their value was low and since the debtor\u2019s wife had promised to pay the sum in issue. Subsequently the executions officer unsuccessfully attempted to contact the debtor and his wife.", "51. In a statement of 12 October 2006 the executions officer explained that it had not been shown that the debtor owned any property or that he had any income. For that reason the judgment had not been executed.", "52. The execution proceedings are pending.", "53.
