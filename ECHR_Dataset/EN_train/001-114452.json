In particular, the first applicant submitted that at around 7 p.m. on 14 August 2001 somebody had rung their doorbell. When the first applicant opened the door he was knocked down, dragged into his apartment and threatened with a gun.

G. did not submit any report; (iii) D., F. and G. were not equipped \u201cproperly\u201d when leaving to check R.\u2019s complaints of threatening behaviour with a firearm. It was concluded that the events in question happened because of \u201clack of discipline and legal knowledge\u201d.

On 2 October 2003 these proceedings were again terminated for lack of evidence of a crime in the police officers\u2019 actions.", "31. On 22 December 2003 the decision of 2 October 2003 was quashed by the Chernigiv Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office and the case sent for additional investigation. It was noted, inter alia, that R. had allegedly paid 300 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH) to G. as \u201cfinancial assistance to cover petrol cost\u201d and that this information had not been checked.", "32. On 19 March 2004 the criminal proceedings were again terminated. The investigation officer of the Chernigiv City Prosecutor\u2019s Office found that the electric drill was jointly owned by the third applicant, R. and O. Since the third applicant had refused to give it back and the first applicant had threatened them with a gun, R. and O. had gone to the police station and lodged a complaint. According to O., the police officers showed the first applicant their identity documents but the latter refused to let them in, tried to grab G.\u2019s gun and started a fight. The second applicant arrived and started shouting. Following the noise, the neighbours came and the police officers asked them to call for reinforcements. All this happened on the staircase in front of the applicants\u2019 apartment. R., who, according to O., stayed in the car, confirmed O.\u2019s statements. Police officers G., D. and F. also confirmed this version of events. D. also submitted that the first applicant had fallen down the stairs in the police station. Police officers M., Sy., Gr., S. and T. stated that nobody had beaten the applicants. S. and T. testified that on 14 August 2001 on G.\u2019s orders they had visited the first applicant\u2019s apartment where he had given them a gas pistol and a drill. They also said they had seen the first applicant fall down the stairs. The applicants\u2019 neighbours stated that they did not see the beginning of the fight so they could not say who had started it. It was finally concluded that the first and third applicants had been taken to the police station because they were suspected of unlawful possession of firearms.", "33. On 30 June 2004 the Chernigiv Regional Prosecutor\u2019", "34. On 30 November 2004 the Chernigiv City Prosecutor\u2019s Office again terminated the criminal proceedings. This decision was identical to that of 19 March 2004 but contained an additional paragraph which stated a further investigation had not revealed any evidence of a crime.", "35. On 1 March 2005 the Desnyanskiy District Court (Chernigiv) quashed this decision and remitted the case for further investigation. The court found that the investigating authorities had failed to comply with the prosecutor\u2019s decision of 22 December 2003. In particular, the legal grounds for the police entering the applicants\u2019 apartment and seizing the drill and the gas gun had not been checked. Also, one of the police officers, So., should be questioned since, according to the first applicant, he had seen the first applicant being beaten up.", "36. On 19 May 2005 the investigation in the applicants\u2019 case was suspended. It was noted in particular that although the applicants\u2019 neighbours had seen the fight between the applicants and the police officers, nobody had witnessed the beginning of this fight and they could not say who had initiated it or why. It was also stated that the first applicant had fallen down the stairs in the police station.", "37. Subsequently the investigation was resumed. So. was questioned and said that he had not seen the applicants being beaten up.", "38. In the conclusion of 14 June 2005 certified by the Head of the Chernigiv Regional Police Department (\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0423\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0456\u043d\u043d\u044f \u041c\u0456\u043d\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0432\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0440\u0456\u0448\u043d\u0456\u0445 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u0432 \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0456\u0433\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0456\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0456) it was noted that police officers G., D. and F. had not been dismissed, because the dismissal order had been lost.", "39. On 14 December 2009 a decision to stay the investigation was adopted since \u201cit was impossible to identify the perpetrator\u201d. There is no evidence that any procedural actions have been taken in the applicants\u2019 case since that time.", "40. On 27 September 2005 the first applicant was interviewed by a television company. He said that he had been beaten up by police officers at the police station and called police officer A. \u201chis torturer\u201d.", "41. On 19 October 2005 A. instituted defamation proceedings against the first applicant and the television company.", "42. On 30 December 2005 the Desnyanskiy Court found against A. It held that there was enough information to suspect that the first applicant had indeed been ill-treated, but that his statements were value judgments and not established facts.", "43. On 14 March 2006 the Chernigiv Regional Court of Appeal upheld this judgment.", "44. In March 2008 the third applicant instituted proceedings in the Desnyanskyy Court against R. and Chernigiv City Police Office (\u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0456\u0433\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0456\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u0456\u0434\u0434\u0456\u043b \u0423\u041c\u0412\u0421 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u0432 \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0456\u0433\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0456\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0456) for the return of the electric drill. The drill was currently in the possession of R., who was its co-owner. On 10 November 2008 the court rejected this claim since the drill was not solely the third applicant\u2019s property but was jointly owned by a team of construction workers. The third applicant and R. had previously been members of this team. On 6 February 2009 the Court of Appeal upheld this decision. On 5 June 2009 the Supreme Court of Ukraine rejected the third applicant\u2019s request for leave to appeal on points of law as unsubstantiated.", "45.
