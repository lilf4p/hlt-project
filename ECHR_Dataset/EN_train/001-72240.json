The applicants are all Turkish nationals. They were living in Halitp\u0131nar village at the time of the alleged events giving rise to the present application. The facts of the case are in dispute between the parties and may be summarised as follows.", "10. Until October 1994 the applicants all lived in Halitp\u0131nar, a village of Ovac\u0131k district in Tunceli province, in the then state-of-emergency region of Turkey. In 1994, terrorist activity was a major concern in this area. Since the 1980s a violent conflict had been going on in the region between the security forces and sections of the Kurdish population in favour of Kurdish autonomy, in particular members of the PKK (Workers Party of Kurdistan). The inhabitants of the applicants\u2019 village were suspected of \u201caiding and abetting terrorists\u201d; and accordingly they were strictly and frequently controlled by the gendarmes stationed near the village.", "11. On 4 October 1994 security forces surrounded Halitp\u0131nar and assembled the inhabitants in the village square. Using curse words, they told the villagers that the village would be evacuated at once with no possibility of return. The applicants took what they were able to carry with them and left the village. Immediately after the evacuation, the soldiers set the houses and the crops on fire.", "12. The applicants moved temporarily into a prefabricated State disaster housing complex close to Ovac\u0131k.", "13. Following the incident, the applicants filed individual petitions with the Ovac\u0131k Public Prosecutor\u2019s office complaining about the burning down of their village by gendarmes. The applicants noted their temporary addresses as the reply address for their petitions.", "14. As the case concerned an investigation into alleged acts of the security forces, the Ovac\u0131k Public Prosecutor issued a decision of nonjurisdiction and referred the petitions to the office of the District Governor in Ovac\u0131k in accordance with the Law on the Prosecution of Civil Servants (Memurin Muhakemat\u0131 Kanunu).", "15. The District Governor sent a letter to the Ovac\u0131k Gendarmerie Headquarters and requested information about the applicants\u2019 allegations.", "16. In a letter of 1 November 1994 the Gendarmerie Commander informed the District Governor that the security forces had not burned any house during their operations in the area. Accordingly, the Ovac\u0131k Administrative Council issued a decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings against the gendarmes.", "17. On 25 October 1995 the Ovac\u0131k District Governor sent a letter to the applicants. Relying on the Ovac\u0131k Gendarmerie Commander\u2019s letter of 1 November 1994, he explained that he was unconvinced by their allegations. He further explained that pursuant to the established case-law of the Supreme Administrative Court (Dan\u0131\u015ftay), no inquiry was possible unless the identity of the accused civil servant were specified. He therefore stated that the authorities would not initiate an investigation into the alleged events.", "18. The applicants did not receive this letter. They learned about the Ovac\u0131k Public Prosecutor\u2019s decision of non-jurisdiction and the Ovac\u0131k Administrative Council\u2019s decision from their fellow villagers and acquaintances at a much later stage.", "19. In 1994 members of the PKK started a propaganda campaign for the organisation in the villages of Ovac\u0131k district. They kidnapped young men from these villages and forced them to join the organisation. The PKK militants issued threats against the villagers and harassed them. The inhabitants of the villages left their homes as a result of the pressure exerted by the PKK.", "20. The investigation carried out by the authorities revealed that the applicants\u2019 houses had not been burned by the security forces but by terrorists wearing military uniforms. In their statements to the investigating authorities, the applicants failed to indicate the identity of the perpetrators of the alleged crime.", "21. The parties submitted various documents with a view to substantiating their claims. These documents, in so far as they are relevant, can be summarised as follows.", "22. The Human Rights Foundation is a non-governmental organisation with its head office in Ankara, Turkey. Its 1993 Report stated that, from 1990 to 1993, more than 913 villages and hamlets had been evacuated. The 1993 Report maintained that village evacuations had accelerated in 1993, mostly targeting the villages whose inhabitants refused to serve as village guards.", "23. The 1994 Report of the TIHV argued that the Government\u2019s policy was to claim that the evacuations and eventual destructions were caused by PKK terror, poverty and the forces of nature. According to the same report, some 50 to 60 villages were burned down in each of the provinces subject to the emergency rule.", "24. The 1995 Report maintained that more than 400 villages had been evacuated in 1995. According to the 1996 Report, the State-of-Emergency Regional Governor once mentioned that a total of 918 villages and 1,767 hamlets had been evacuated for various reasons, although never admitting that evacuations had been carried out by security forces.", "25. The 1997 and 1998 Reports described the Government\u2019s policy of evacuating villages as a systematic \u201cinternal security operation\u201d applied throughout the 1990s.", "26. The excerpts gave a comprehensive list of burned-down and/or evacuated villages from February 1990 to January 1999. The list did not make any reference to Halitp\u0131nar as having been evacuated and destroyed.", "27. The excerpts contained several articles reproduced from a daily newspaper \u00dclkede G\u00fcndem, relating to the evacuation of villages and its detrimental effects on the displaced persons. The articles stressed that numerous villagers had filed petitions with the State authorities, complaining that their villages had been burned down by security forces.", "28. The articles also emphasized that the Government\u2019s public declarations, which appeared to allow displaced villagers to return to their villages, were unreliable. Whenever villagers had attempted to do so, they were physically denied access to their villages.", "29. This report was prepared by a Commission of Inquiry composed of ten members of parliament. According to the report, in 1993 and 1994 the inhabitants of 905 villages and 2,923 hamlets were evicted and forced to move to other regions of the country (p.13).", "30. The report included a statement by Mr Do\u011fan Hatipo\u011flu, a former governor of Diyarbak\u0131r. Mr Hatipo\u011flu explained that, during his office, occasional village evacuations by military authorities were brought to his attention. He stated that \u2013 although very rarely \u2013 he had received complaints about village burnings. According to Mr Hatipo\u011flu, it was inconceivable to assert that all the villages were vacated due to PKK coercion. He alleged that the Government had failed to take the necessary measures for a healthy resettlement of displaced persons (p.13).", "31. The report also referred to the \u201cHuman Rights Report \u2013 Turkey\u201d, prepared and submitted to the Commission of Inquiry in 1995 by Mr Yavuz \u00d6nen, the chairman of the Human Rights Foundation. This latter report dedicated a chapter to immigrants and evacuated villages. It argued that, in 1995, the practice of evacuation of villages and hamlets was widespread. Many houses in villages were either destroyed or made uninhabitable. People were forced to emigrate from the region and pressure was exerted on the inhabitants until they left their villages. In early 1995 there was practically no village or hamlet inhabited except those whose inhabitants agreed to become village guards (p.19).", "32. The report of the Commission of Inquiry also referred to the speech delivered at the Turkish Grand National Assembly by Mr Salih Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, a deputy from \u015e\u0131rnak, on 3 June 1997 on the question of evacuated villages. Mr Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m stated, inter alia, that the villages were evacuated either by the PKK, in order to intimidate those who opposed it, by the authorities since they were unable to protect the villages, or because the inhabitants of those villages refused to become village guards or were suspected of having aided the PKK (p. 20).", "33. In conclusion, it was recommended in the report that the inhabitants of the settlement units should be re-housed in the provinces, districts or central villages \u2013 rather than hamlets \u2013 close to the area where they used to live and that necessary economic measures should be taken with a view to providing employment to the inhabitants of the region, priority being given to the immigrants.", "34. This report aims at establishing the property owned by each of the applicants. Having regard to the registers of the land registry office and municipality registry office, it appears that Abbas \u00d6ztoprak did not own any property. He was not subscribed to TEDA\u015e, meaning that he did not have electricity at home. However, he receives pension from the State. It further appeared that Mr \u00d6ztoprak owned a \u201cgreen card\u201d given to very poor people for medical care and that he received TRL 75,000,000 in aid from the Ovac\u0131k District Governor\u2019s office.", "35. Mehmet \u00d6ztoprak owned 8,000 square metres of land according to the land registry records. It was estimated that he could derive TRL 128,000,000\u2019s annual income at the relevant time. Mr \u00d6ztoprak owned a \u201cgreen card\u201d given to very poor people for medical care. The Ovac\u0131k District Governor\u2019s office gave him 11 sheep, TRL 195,000,000 and food in aid for his living. Between 1994 and 2002 Mr \u00d6ztoprak lived in a house in the disaster houses complex provided by the Government. In 2002 he moved into a house which was built within the context of \u201creturn to village and rehabilitation project\u201d.", "36. \u015eahin Toprak did not own any property according to the land registry records. But he owned a 60 square metres, a house and a stable as well as land measuring 14,000 square metres according to his declaration of 9 June 1994 to the municipality registration office. It was estimated that he could derive TRL 224,000,000\u2019s annual income at the relevant time. Since 24 April 1993 he is the holder of a \u201cgreen card\u201d given to very poor people for medical care. Mr Toprak received food and TRL 125,000,000\u2019s in aid from the Ovac\u0131k District Governor\u2019s office. Furthermore, he lived in a house in the disaster houses complex provided by the Government. In 2002 he moved into a house which was built within the context of \u201creturn to village and rehabilitation project\u201d.", "37. The witness is a former resident of Halitp\u0131nar village. He is currently the mayor of Kandolar neighbourhood in Ovac\u0131k. His statements were taken in order to determine the situation of the applicants who had lodged an application with the Court. The witness stated that between 1994 and 2002 the applicants had lived in prefabricated houses in Kandolar neighbourhood of Ovac\u0131k. In 2002 they had moved into new houses built by the Government. At the relevant time nobody lived in Halitp\u0131nar. There was no electricity, school or telephone in the village.", "38. Gendarme Major Y\u00fcksel S\u00f6nmez informed the Chief Public Prosecutor that the houses belonging to Reis Toprak, Kamber \u00c7elik, Veli \u00c7elik and S\u00fcleyman Toprak in Halitp\u0131nar village and in Toprak hamlet had been burned down by terrorists wearing military uniforms. In his opinion, the terrorists aimed at pacifying the security forces and creating hostility between the latter and the people in the region.", "39. Following an investigation conducted into the allegations that State security forces had burned down houses in Halitp\u0131nar village, the inspector established that the houses had not been burned down by the security forces but by terrorists wearing military uniforms. The terrorists had further forced the villagers to complain to the authorities that their houses had been burned down by the security forces. The inspector also noted that the security forces had been conducting operations in the region with a view to maintaining the security of the people and that therefore they would not burn villages or give damage to property.", "40.
