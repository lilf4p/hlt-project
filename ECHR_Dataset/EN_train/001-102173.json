The applicants are churches of a Reformist denomination which are registered as religious communities under Croatian law and which have their seats in Zagreb (the first and second applicant churches) and Tenja (the third applicant church).", "6. The first applicant church has been present in Croatia since 1993, the second since 1989 and the third since the sixteenth century as part of the Reformed Church and since 2001 as an independent church. The applicant churches were entered in the register of religious communities in Croatia on 18 December 2003 (the first applicant church), 3 December 2003 (the second applicant church) and 14 October 2003 (the third applicant church), in accordance with the Religious Communities Act.", "7. On 21 June 2004 the applicant churches submitted a request to the Government\u2019s Commission for Relations with Religious Communities (Komisija za odnose s vjerskim zajednicama \u2013 \u201cthe Religious Communities Commission\u201d) in order to conclude an agreement with the Government of Croatia, as envisaged in section 9(1) of the Religious Communities Act (see paragraph 18 below), which would regulate their relations with the State. They explained that without such an agreement they were unable to provide religious education in public schools and nurseries, to provide pastoral care to their members in medical and social-welfare institutions, as well to those in prisons and penitentiaries, or to perform religious marriages with the effects of a civil marriage.", "8. On 23 December 2004 the Government of Croatia adopted an instruction (zaklju\u010dak \u2013 \u201cthe Instruction\u201d) setting out the criteria which religious communities had to satisfy in order to conclude such an agreement with it (see paragraph 19 below).", "9. In a letter of 12 January 2005 the Religious Communities Commission informed the applicant churches that they did not satisfy, either individually or jointly, the historical and numerical criteria set out in the above Instruction, that is to say, that they had not been present in the territory of Croatia since 6 April 1941 and that the number of their adherents did not exceed 6,000 (see paragraph 19 above). Referring to section 21 of the 2003 Health Care Act (see paragraph 21 below) and sections 14, 78(1) and 95 of the Enforcement of Prison Sentences Act (see paragraphs 23-26 below), it also remarked that members of religious communities which had not concluded the relevant agreement with the Government of Croatia had a right to receive pastoral care in medical and social-welfare institutions as well as in prisons and penitentiaries.", "10. On 10 February 2005 the applicant churches submitted another request to conclude an appropriate agreement with the Government of Croatia, this time addressing it to the Prime Minister directly.", "11. In a letter of 15 June 2005 the Religious Communities Commission replied to the applicant churches\u2019 request of 10 February 2005, informing them again that they did not satisfy, either individually or jointly, the criteria set forth in the Instruction of 23 December 2004, this time without specifying which particular criteria had not been met. It again referred to section 21 of the 2003 Health Care Act and sections 14, 78(1) and 95 of the Enforcement of Prison Sentences Act, reiterating its opinion that the members of religious communities which had not concluded appropriate agreements with the Government of Croatia had a right to receive pastoral care in medical and social-welfare institutions and in prisons and penitentiaries.", "12. The applicant churches then lodged a request for the protection of a constitutionally guaranteed right (zahtjev za za\u0161titu ustavom zajam\u010denog prava) with the Administrative Court (Upravni sud Republike Hrvatske) against the Religious Communities Commission\u2019s refusal of 15 June 2005, in accordance with section 66 of the Administrative Disputes Act (see paragraph 28 below). They argued that the refusal, even though it had been given in the form of a letter, constituted \u201can individual legal act\u201d (that is, a decision), within the meaning of section 66 of the Administrative Disputes Act, that had violated their constitutional right to equality of all religious communities before the law, as guaranteed by Article 41 of the Constitution (see paragraph 16 below).", "13. On 12 October 2006 the Administrative Court declared their action inadmissible, holding that the Religious Communities Commission\u2019s refusal did not constitute \u201can individual act\u201d for the purposes of section 66 of the Administrative Disputes Act, and thus was not susceptible to that court\u2019s review.", "14. The applicant churches then lodged a constitutional complaint, relying again, inter alia, on Article 41 of the Constitution and alleging a violation of their constitutional right to equality of all religious communities before the law. On 1 October 2006 the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) dismissed the applicant churches\u2019 constitutional complaint, finding, inter alia, that Article 41 of the Constitution was not applicable in the particular case.", "15. Meanwhile, on 30 September 2005 the applicant churches filed a petition with the Constitutional Court for an abstract review of constitutionality and legality, asking it to examine the conformity of the Instruction of 23 December 2004 with the Religious Communities Act and Article 41 of the Constitution. On 5 June 2007 the Constitutional Court declared the applicant churches\u2019 petition inadmissible, finding that the contested Instruction was not subordinate legislation susceptible to a review of constitutionality and legality.", "16. The relevant provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia (Ustav Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette nos. 56/1990, 135/1997, 8/1998 (consolidated text), 113/2000, 124/2000 (consolidated text), 28/2001 and 41/2001 (consolidated text), 55/2001 (corrigendum) and 76/2010) read as follows:", "\u201cEveryone in the Republic of Croatia shall enjoy rights and freedoms regardless of their race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other belief, national or social origin, property, birth, education, social status or other characteristics.", "All shall be equal before the law.\u201d", "\u201cRights and freedoms may be restricted only by law in order to protect the rights and freedoms of others, the legal order, public morals or health.", "Every restriction of the rights and freedoms should be proportional to the nature of the necessity for the restriction in each individual case.\u201d", "\u201cFreedom of conscience and religion and freedom to profess faith or other belief publicly shall be guaranteed.\u201d", "\u201cAll religious communities shall be equal before the law and shall be separated from the State.", "Religious communities shall be free to, in accordance with the law, perform religious services publicly, open schools, educational and other institutions, social-welfare and charitable institutions and to administer them, and in their activities enjoy the protection and assistance of the State.\u201d", "\u201cInternational agreements in force, which were concluded and ratified in accordance with the Constitution and made public, shall be part of the internal legal order of the Republic of Croatia and shall have precedence in terms of their legal effects over the [domestic] statutes. ...\u201d", "17.

Among Croatian legal scholars there is no consensus as to which rights, apart from those enumerated in section 19 of the Obligations Act, are to be considered rights of personality. It is, however, common ground that the following rights of natural persons fall into that category: the right to life, the right to physical and mental integrity (health), the right to liberty, the right to reputation and honour, the right to privacy of personal and family life, the right to secrecy of letters and personal manuscripts, the right to personal identity (in particular the rights to one\u2019s image, voice and name) and the moral rights of the author. It would appear that only these rights have so far been interpreted as rights of personality by the Croatian courts in the application of section 157 of the former 1978 Obligations Act and section 19 of the current 2006 Obligations Act.
