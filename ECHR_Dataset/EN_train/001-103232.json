Two days later the medical assistant, Ms S., wrote an explanatory statement addressed to the head of the sobering-up centre. The statement read as follows:", "\u201cOn 11 October 2001, at 10.30 p.m., [the applicant], who was in a state of alcohol intoxication, was brought to the duty unit of the sobering-up centre.

[He] refused to undress voluntarily and was forced to undress; [he] refused to go to a room to rest. Soft ties were applied to him from 10.30 to 11.30 p.m. to prevent damage to him and other individuals. During that [hour] the ties loosened up. On a number of occasions while he was in the sobering-up room he knocked and asked to be released and said that he was being detained unlawfully. On his release he did not make any complaints, [he] refused to sign [the report] insisting that on his admission [to the sobering-up centre] he had had money with him.

In addition, he brought a complaint with the Lomonosovskiy District Court of Arkhangelsk against the sobering-up centre of the Arkhangelsk Town Police Department. While not disputing that on 11 October 2001 he had been under the influence of alcohol, the applicant claimed that he had been arbitrarily detained in the sobering-up centre on the basis of an internal regulation adopted by an order of the Ministry of Interior. He further argued that he had been ill-treated at the centre as the police officers had forced him to stay in a very painful position known as \u201cthe swallow\u201d [\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430].
