The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Tallinn.", "8. The applicant served as a judge at the Harju County Court at the material time. From 2003 he was in charge of a criminal case where D., a businessman, was one of the defendants. The case involved several charges including tax evasion, money laundering, aggravated breach of public order and bribery.", "9. On 5 January 2006 the security police received D.\u2019s statement according to which his business partner N. \u2013 who had owed D.\u2019s company a substantial sum of money \u2013 had refused to pay back the loan for an extended period. Instead, N. had said that he knew the applicant well, having shared a dormitory room with him during their law studies, and that a judgment in D.\u2019s favour could be arranged as long as he did not insist on the repayment of the loan. Furthermore, N. had demanded 200,000 Estonian kroons (EEK) (approximately 12,780 euros (EUR)) as a \u201cChristmas good-will gesture\u201d and a further EEK 900,000 (EUR 57,520) for D.\u2019s acquittal.", "10. On 5 January 2006 the police initiated criminal investigation in respect of the offences of accepting and arranging a bribe.", "11. On 10 January 2006 a prosecutor authorised the covert surveillance of N. and on the following day the president of the Harju County Court authorised the interception and undercover audio recording of N.\u2019s conversations.

Within moments, N.\u2019s car was stopped by the police; he was arrested and the money was seized.", "15. Immediately thereafter, N. was interviewed as a suspect. In response to the question as to whether he had demanded money from D. for transferring it to the applicant as a bribe for a judgment in D.\u2019s favour, he replied that he had not demanded any money from D. but had just communicated to him what the applicant had demanded. According to N., the applicant had said that if D. paid him EEK 900,000, he would give a judgment in D.\u2019s favour. Under instructions from the security police, N. arranged a meeting with the applicant later the same day.", "16.

The exact amount of the bribe cannot be disclosed at the moment in the interests of the investigation. On the evening of 6 April the judge suspected of bribery accepted part of the sum [he had been demanding] from a person involved in the simulation of the offence and the security police and the State Prosecutor\u2019s Office conducting the investigation decided to arrest him shortly after accepting the money. The judge suspected of bribery did not have time to make the judgment in respect of the accused person.", "On Friday investigators carried out necessary investigative steps after which the suspect was released.", "The criminal proceedings concerning the suspicion in question were initiated some time ago. The security police and the State Prosecutor\u2019s Office conducting the preliminary investigation do not consider it possible at present to disclose other details related to the suspicion referred to.

On 5 October 2006 the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office submitted the bill of indictment to the Viru County Court. The applicant was charged under Article 294 \u00a7 2 (2) and (4) of the Penal Code (Karistusseadustik) with an aggravated offence of demanding a large bribe (in excess of EEK 300,000 (EUR 19,170)).", "27.

The offence was committed by a judge who made use of his official position and breached an important principle of a State governed by the rule of law, according to which justice is administered by an independent, impartial and honest court.

By the Viru County Court\u2019s decision of 24 October 2006 the applicant was committed for trial. The first hearing was scheduled for 23 November 2006.", "32. On 20 November 2006 Postimees published an article based on a press release from a news agency, BNS, which included the following passage:", "\u201cAccording to the [public] prosecutor, [the applicant] asked [D.] for the total sum of 1.1 million kroons, of which he received 200,000 in the course of the simulation of the offence through an intermediary, [D.\u2019s] business partner [N.]. \u2018[The applicant] wished to receive the money in instalments,\u2019 [V.] noted.\u201d", "The online version of the article on the newspaper\u2019s website also contained the following sentence:", "\u201c\u2018According to the information gathered during the investigation, the initiative of asking for the money came from the judge and there was no provocation,\u2019 [V.] affirmed ...\u201d", "33.

Although no reference was made to the sources of information in the article, the applicant submitted that the information, which involved private information and delicate personal data, had originated from prosecutor V. The article does not contain an assessment by the prosecutor of the applicant\u2019s guilt.", "35. On the same day in a news programme on Eesti Televisioon prosecutor V. was shown saying:", "\u201c[The applicant] is charged with having demanded a large bribe from an accused person in criminal proceedings of which he was in charge. In return he promised to take decisions in favour of the accused in the course of the criminal proceedings and also to acquit him.\u201d", "Apparently in reply to a journalist\u2019s question, she continued:", "\u201cIndeed, as these names have already been mentioned in the press, it can be affirmed that the person from whom he demanded the bribe was [D.].

The court dismissed the request. It examined the newspaper articles submitted by the applicant and found that they contained information received from the prosecutor. However, the court found that the articles did not indicate that the prosecutor had treated the applicant as being guilty. Furthermore, it considered that increased public interest in the case where the suspect was a judge was understandable and justified.", "37. At the hearing of 15 August 2007 the applicant again requested the removal of the prosecutor on similar grounds as on the previous occasion. The court refused to examine the request finding that it had already dismissed a similar request and no new arguments had been put forward.", "38. At the hearing of 26 October 2007 the prosecutor dropped the charges in respect of the element of demanding the bribe. She also requested that the applicant be convicted of an attempted offence.", "39. On 31 January 2008 the Viru County Court delivered a judgment by which the applicant was convicted of attempting to accept a bribe (Article 294 \u00a7 1 of the Penal Code). He was sentenced to three and a half years\u2019 imprisonment.", "40. The court noted that in 2004 N. had already made the applicant an offer concerning the bribe. On 4 April 2006 the applicant consented to accepting the bribe and took the money on 6 April 2006, being aware that it had come from D. in connection with the criminal case in which he was a defendant. The court relied on the statements of N. and D. as well as the undercover recordings and surveillance reports. It found that the charges concerning the applicant\u2019s alleged demand for a bribe of EEK 1,100,000 had not been proven. These charges had been based on the statements of N. and were only partly supported by D.\u2019s submissions who, in turn, relied on what he had heard from N. The court considered that N. had not only transferred information between the applicant and D. but had also pursued his own agenda. It considered it probable that N. had presented the applicant\u2019s readiness to accept a bribe to D. as a demand for bribe. Applying the principle that any reasonable doubt should benefit the accused, the court only considered it established that the applicant had agreed to accept, and had accepted, a bribe of EEK 200,000. Furthermore, the court classified it as an attempted offence.", "41. The applicant filed an appeal with the Viru Court of Appeal against the County Court\u2019s judgment.", "42. On 20 March 2008 the applicant requested that the Court of Appeal remove the prosecutor. The court dismissed the request. It noted, inter alia, that the newspaper articles had not influenced the court and that the County Court had in fact dismissed certain charges against the applicant.", "43. By a judgment of 28 March 2008 the Viru Court of Appeal upheld the County Court\u2019s judgment.", "44. On 9 June 2008 the Supreme Court declined to examine the applicant\u2019s appeal.", "45. In the meantime, in December 2006 the applicant lodged a claim for compensation for non-pecuniary damage against the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office with the Tallinn Administrative Court. Referring to the press releases, newspaper articles and television programmes quoted above (see paragraphs 18, 20 to 24, 30, 32, 34 and 35), he argued that the prosecutor\u2019s public statements made during the criminal proceedings had not respected his presumption of innocence and that his right to respect for his private life had been infringed. The applicant contended that the prosecutor, being an authoritative source, had given a legal assessment that the applicant had committed a crime. She had addressed matters such as the classification and degree of the offence as well as possible provocation and presented her opinion on these matters to the public as a statement of fact. The applicant was dissatisfied that in the interviews given in April 2006 the prosecutor had given the impression that the criminal proceedings had been successful and everything was clear, the evidence had been gathered and what had remained had only been technicalities. The prosecutor had persuaded the public that it had been the applicant who had demanded the bribe and had disclosed the amounts of the bribe in question. Prosecutor V. had also given a number of interviews after the commencement of the court proceedings from which it could be understood that the whole matter was an extremely simple and clear story.", "46. The Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office objected. It contended that under the Public Information Act (Avaliku teabe seadus) it was required to disclose to the media information concerning criminal proceedings in respect of which public interest could be anticipated. The applicant had not been named in the press release of 9 April 2006. Furthermore, the choice of words by prosecutor V. in various interviews had made it unequivocally clear that the applicant had been a suspect. The press release of 6 October 2006 had been based on the bill of indictment which represented the position of the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office to be proved in court. The Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office had sought to disclose a minimal amount of precise information to the public.", "47. In a written statement to the Administrative Court by the head of the public relations department of the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office it was noted that the press release of 9 April 2006 had been prompted by a telephone call from a journalist who had heard about the arrest of a judge and had sought confirmation of that information. It was considered that rumours could have caused damage to the investigation, the suspect and the judiciary as a whole. The press release had been based on facts and contained no personal references. On the following days several media channels interviewed prosecutor V. who gave no further information than was contained in the press release. It was noted that the media had also used sources other than the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office. In respect of the press release of 6 October 2006 it was noted that the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office usually gave information concerning criminal cases that had attracted public interest. In order to secure equal treatment of different media channels, press releases summarising the content of the charges were issued.", "48. On 5 December 2007 the Tallinn Administrative Court dismissed the complaint, finding that the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office had released the information in compliance with the Code of Criminal Procedure (Kriminaalmenetluse seadustik). Furthermore, it held as follows:", "\u201c7.4. In assessing the lawfulness of the actions of the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, it is necessary to clarify on which considerations they were taken. According to the submission of [the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office], [its] press officers and prosecutor [V.] acted in order to give to the media, which demonstrated extraordinarily high interest in the criminal case in question, information that was as precise and as minimal as possible.", "The court agrees with the [Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office] that there was elevated public interest in the criminal case in question. This is already demonstrated by the fact that the criminal proceedings were extensively covered by the press. [This is] also [confirmed] by journalists\u2019 numerous [requests for information] to the [Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office] ... . There is no dispute between the parties about the fact that the criminal case was extensively covered by the press and this can also be concluded on the basis of the materials of the case. As the criminal proceedings were being conducted in respect of a judge who had also been arrested as a suspect, the court considers that the elevated interest of the public in the criminal case was justified. The court considers it a matter of general knowledge that the press, in particular the part of it that qualifies as non-quality press, also tends to publish untrue information. Therefore the court agrees with the [Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office] that [its] ... communication with the media is also very important in order to avoid, or at least minimise, the spread of misinformation.", "7.5. The court has not established that the information released by the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office to the press in the course of the preliminary investigation of the criminal case ... went beyond what was objectively necessary for informing the public or that the applicant\u2019s interests were excessively interfered with.", "It appears from the materials of the case that the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office declined to release detailed information on the circumstances of the offence at the time when [the applicant] had the status of suspect. The press release of the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office of 9 April 2006 and the disclosure of information (interviews) by [the prosecutor] in charge of the criminal proceedings to the programmes Aktuaalne Kaamera of [Eesti Televisioon] and Krimi of Kanal 2 as well as the newspapers Postimees, \u00c4rip\u00e4ev and Eesti Ekspress ... fell within this period. It can be clearly understood from the press release and the public prosecutor\u2019s statements that [the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office] merely suspected the applicant of having accepted a bribe. The [applicant\u2019s] allegation that the identity of the judge in respect of whom the proceedings were being carried out was disclosed by the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office is incorrect. ... [In] the Harju County Court\u2019s press release of 10 April [2006] it is stated that \u2018the judge suspected of accepting a large bribe who was arrested by the security police in the course of the simulation of the offence is [the applicant]\u2019... . Thus, the identity of the judge suspected of the offence was already known to the public when [the prosecutor] used [the applicant\u2019s] name in communication with the media. Therefore the use of [the applicant\u2019s] name by [the prosecutor] after the Harju County Court\u2019s press release of 10 April [2006] did not aggravate [the applicant\u2019s] situation.", "Information about the classification and degree of the offence and the amounts of the bribe were disclosed by the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office only after the drawing up of the bill of indictment when [the applicant\u2019s] status had changed to an accused. Proceeding from Article 226 \u00a7 1 of [the Code of Criminal Procedure], the drawing up of the bill of indictment demonstrates the conviction of the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office that all the necessary evidence had been gathered. Publication of the press release of 6 October 2006 by the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office and disclosure of information (interviews) by [the prosecutor] in charge of the criminal proceedings to the news agency BNS, newspaper Eesti Ekspress, and the programme Avatud Toimik on [Eesti Televisioon] ... fall within this period. The press release and the subsequent imparting of information were based on the official bill of indictment. The court agrees with the [Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office] that giving more detailed information about the bill of indictment than the suspicion is legitimate since the bill of indictment represents the result of the pre-trial proceedings and indicates that the criminal proceedings are about to resume in court.", "The court does not agree with [the applicant\u2019s] position that the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office violated the principle of the presumption of innocence. The presumption of innocence is protected by Article 22 of the Constitution and Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights ... . Nevertheless, addressing criminal proceedings in the media before passing a judgment is not completely restricted by the presumption of innocence. It has been found in the case-law that covering a case in the media during the pre-trial proceedings may result in a violation of the presumption of innocence but this does not mean that nothing about the pre-trial proceedings may be published in the media (see the judgment of 15 October 1996 of the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court in case no. 3-1-1-109-96). The content of what is disclosed to the media about the criminal proceedings is decisive \u2013 if only objective information reaches the public, the court considers that the publication of such information does not interfere with the presumption of innocence. It has not been established in the present case that the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office informed the public about the criminal proceedings in a subjective manner or gave an opinion about [the applicant\u2019s] guilt. [The European Convention on Human Rights] does not prohibit informing the public about proceedings when no opinion about the guilt is given (Worm v. Austria, 29 August 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997V).", "7.6. In sum, the court considers that the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office objectively informed the public about the criminal proceedings. The information given to the press did not exceed the limits of the objective need to inform the public, nor did it excessively damage the interests of [the applicant]. As the actions of the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office were lawful there is no ground to allow the claim for damages ... .\u201d", "49. On 5 June 2008 the Tallinn Court of Appeal upheld the Administrative Court\u2019s judgment. It held, inter alia, as follows:", "\u201cThe public interest and the interest of the person concerned have to be assessed in the specific circumstances. [The applicant\u2019s] position that in the present case the statements of the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office related to an individual case in respect of which there could be no public interest cannot be sustained. In the case in question there was a suspicion that a judge had committed an offence of accepting a bribe. [The Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office] correctly notes that the initiation of criminal proceedings related to the suspected acceptance of a bribe by a judge concerns the exercise of functions by a high official. The suspicion that a high official expected to enjoy public confidence has accepted a bribe is an important event justifying elevated public interest. It also justifies the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office informing the public of such an important event.", "The Administrative Court concluded that the information disclosed about the criminal proceedings had not exceeded the limits of the objective need to inform the public and that the presumption of innocence had not been violated. The Court of Appeal agrees with that assessment. [The applicant] validly argues that the [case of Worm], referred to in the judgment, concerns the disclosure of information in respect of ongoing criminal proceedings. However, the case-law of the [European Court of Human Rights] does not prohibit disclosure of information concerning pre-trial proceedings and the Supreme Court in case no. 3-1-1-109-96 has also admitted that media coverage of a case during pre-trial proceedings may in itself result in a violation of the presumption of innocence, but this does not mean that nothing at all may be disclosed about pre-trial proceedings.", "... [The] Court of Appeal agrees with the position of the first-instance court that there is no ground to allow the claim for damages since the actions of [the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office] in disclosing the information were lawful and this was done without excessive damage to the rights of [the applicant].\u201d", "50. On 24 September 2008 the Supreme Court declined to examine the applicant\u2019s appeal.", "51.
