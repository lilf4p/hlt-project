THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Remainder inadmissible;No violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Civil proceedings;Article 6-1 - Access to court)", "JUDGES": "George Nicolaou;Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Neboj\u0161a Vu\u010dini\u0107;Nicolas Bratza;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Vincent A. De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["4. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "5. The first applicant (\u201cR.P.\u201d), the second applicant (\u201cA.P.\u201d), the third applicant (\u201cM.P.\u201d) and the fourth applicant (\u201cB.P.\u201d) were born in 1985, 1982, 1950 and 1941 respectively. All four applicants are British citizens who currently live in Nottingham, England.", "6. A.P., M.P. and B.P. are, respectively, R.P.\u2019s brother, mother and father.", "7. On 7 May 2006 R.P.\u2019s daughter (\u201cK.P.\u201d) was born prematurely at 27 weeks\u2019 gestation. The birth was unexpected as R.P. had not known that she was pregnant. R.P. was not in a relationship with K.P.\u2019s father and he played no further part in the proceedings.", "8. As a consequence of her premature birth, K.P. suffered from many serious medical conditions. She had serious chronic lung disease (broncho-pulmonary dysplasia), which rendered her oxygen-dependent, she had bleeding on both sides of her brain (bilateral intraventricular haemorrhage), she was immuno-suppressed and therefore very susceptible to infection, and she had a congenital heart defect which was repaired by surgery on 6 June 2006. Although her health improved as she developed, she continued to require skilled and labour-intensive day-to-day care. She was regarded as at high risk of cot death and initially required feeding through a nasal-gastric tube.", "9. It was observed that from K.P.\u2019s birth until 22 August 2006 R.P. was only visiting K.P. for 1-2 hours a day. She had to be prompted to visit for longer periods and it was noted that she could not complete basic care tasks without prompting and support. A multi-agency meeting took place on 22 August 2006, at which the hospital drew up a schedule of tasks which R.P. would need to demonstrate she could satisfactorily complete before K.P. could safely be discharged into her care. A \u201ccore assessment\u201d prepared at this time recorded that R.P. had previously been involved with the local authority\u2019s mental health services and was believed to have learning disabilities; that her relationship with A.P., M.P. and B.P. fluctuated, with allegations having been made of violence and aggression; that there were concerns about her relationship with K.P.\u2019s father; and that M.P. and B.P. were unsuitable to care for K.P. because of poor household conditions and concerns about family dynamics.", "10. On 30 August 2006 a social worker met with R.P., M.P. and B.P. to discuss the local authority\u2019s concerns as to the care of K.P. It was noted that R.P. had difficulty understanding and articulating the nature and extent of K.P.\u2019s health needs and refused to accept that she needed help to care properly for her. However, she did agree to participate in a Parenting Assessment Manual (\u201cPAM\u201d) Assessment, which was a tool designed to assess parents with learning disabilities. The assessment, which was completed on 1 September 2006, concluded that R.P. struggled to complete care tasks for R.P. and demonstrated little understanding of her care needs.", "11. On 8 September 2006 care proceedings were commenced in relation to K.P. At this stage the aim of the care plan was to identify how the local authority could keep K.P. alive and safe in a home environment while R.P. was given the opportunity to develop her care skills. On 15 September 2006 an interim care order was made in favour of the local authority and on 23 November 2006 K.P. was discharged from hospital into the care of foster parents.", "12. R.P. instructed a solicitor (\u201cS.C.\u201d) to represent her in the care proceedings. Both S.C. and her very experienced counsel developed serious concerns that R.P. was unable to understand the advice she was being given. Pursuant to a court order, S.C. and the local authority jointly instructed a consultant clinical psychologist (\u201cH.J.\u201d) to assess R.P. Prior to being assessed, attendance notes from both the counsel and S.C. indicate that they informed R.P. that the purpose of the assessment was to determine whether or not she had capacity to provide instruction and, if she did not, the Official Solicitor would have to be appointed to act on her behalf.", "13. In her report H.J. found that R.P. had a significant learning disability and concluded:", "\u201cBecause of the difficulties [RP] has in understanding, processing and recalling information, I believe that she will find it very difficult to understand the advice given by her solicitor. She will not be able to make informed decisions on the basis of this advice, particularly when this involved anticipating possible outcomes. It would be appropriate for the Official Solicitor to become involved.\u201d", "14. On 26 October 2006 S.C. wrote to the Official Solicitor to advise him of the contents of H.J.\u2019s report. On 31 October 2006 the Official Solicitor indicated that he would consent to act on behalf of R.P. if invited to do so. On 7 November 2006 Nottingham County Court invited the Official Solicitor to act for R.P. and he formally consented to act as her guardian ad litem on 11 December 2006. In accordance with his usual practice, a case worker (\u201cLM\u201d) wrote to S.C. to confirm that she was to be instructed by the Official Solicitor on behalf of R.P. She enclosed with the letter a further letter and leaflet to be given to R.P. The letter stated that:", "\u201cYou may already know that on 7 November 2006 the Official Solicitor was asked to act as your guardian ad litem. This means that he will instruct your solicitor for you. He can only do this if a doctor or the court has decided that you cannot do so yourself. In your case, HJ completed a report dated 23 October 2006 which shows that you have a learning disability. If your condition improves and HJ or another doctor says that you can manage on your own, the Official Solicitor will of course step down and no longer act for you.", "Your solicitor will keep in touch with you, let you know what is happening and tell the Official Solicitor how you feel about things...", "The Official Solicitor will consider the evidence of all the people involved as well as your wishes and views before he files a statement at court on your behalf. He will do his best to protect your interests but must, of course, bear in mind what is best for KP.", "If you are not happy with the way in which your case is conducted you should first discuss the matter with your solicitor or with me. If you are still not satisfied you can write to the complaints officer...\u201d", "15. The content of the leaflet given to R.P. is set out in full below:", "\u201cThe Official Solicitor", "Who he is, and what he does.", "WHO IS THE OFFICIAL SOLICITOR?", "Alistair Pitblado is the Official Solicitor to the Supreme Court. It is his job to make decisions on behalf of people who are unable to represent themselves in Civil and Family Proceedings (the client).", "WHY THE OFFICIAL SOLICITOR ACTS IN A CASE", "The Official Solicitor agrees to act either because the client is under the age of 18, or because the client\u2019s doctor does not think that they can cope with making decisions about their court case. Legal matters can be difficult to understand and very stressful and the Official Solicitor is here to protect the client\u2019s interests.", "HOW WILL THE OFFICIAL SOLICITOR HELP?", "The Official Solicitor makes decisions about the court case such as whether to bring, defend or settle a claim. We will arrange legal representation in court for the client where he considers this necessary. He will usually ask a firm of solicitors to help him with the case. The Official Solicitor can only make decisions about the questions arising in the court case. He cannot make any other decisions for the client.", "WHO CAN I SPEAK TO ABOUT THIS CASE?", "Your solicitor should be the primary contact. The Official Solicitor has assistants who help him deal with every case. These assistants are called case managers. The case manager assigned to your case will provide you with details of the solicitors they have appointed on your behalf.", "WILL THE CLIENT BE CONSULTED?", "Shortly after he agrees to act the Official Solicitor will usually instruct a firm of solicitors as his solicitors, either the solicitors already instructed by the client or new solicitors identified by the case manager. Such solicitors, or a senior solicitor within the firm, should be a member of the Law Society Children Panel or the Resolution (formerly SFLA) Family Panel. The instructed solicitor will communicate with the client and attend court hearings and will report on the outcome to the case manager.", "Fees and Charges", "In the vast majority of cases, the Official Solicitor acts in the capacity of Litigation/Next Friend and instructs outside solicitors. The Official Solicitor does not make any charge for acting in the capacity of Litigation/Next Friend. Where the legal work in a case is conducted in-house, the Official Solicitor will, where appropriate, seek to recover his costs (or in medical cases there is a practice whereby he is entitled to half his costs) using an hourly charging rate. We will write to you separately with further details if this applies in your case.", "COMPLAINTS", "If you are dissatisfied with the way your case is conducted you should first discuss the matter either with the external solicitor, or with your case manager. If you remain dissatisfied you may write to the Complaints Officer, Official Solicitor\u2019s Office, 81 Chancery Lane WC2A 1DD.\u201d", "16. On 19 December 2006 Nottingham County Court directed that H.J. be instructed to prepare a second report considering the propriety of the teaching methods envisaged by the local authority in its parenting assessment. H.J.\u2019s second report, dated 2 March 2007, noted that the teaching methods and materials would \u201cin general be appropriate\u201d and emphasised that simple language, direct instructions and repetition would be needed, along with immediate feedback.", "17. On 2 March 2007 a parenting capacity assessment was produced in respect of R.P. The report noted that R.P. had demonstrated commitment to the assessment process and an ability to retain and carry out basic tasks. However, social workers were concerned that R.P. had expressed views of a racist nature, that she sometimes seemed immature and attention-seeking, that she was overly preoccupied with her own health concerns, and that she spoke very negatively about the local authority\u2019s professionals.", "18. Reports from R.P.\u2019s contact sessions with K.P. indicated that R.P. showed some signs of improvement, demonstrating some ability to remember what she had been shown and to repeat tasks. However, even after months of regular contact and support R.P. still, on occasion, needed reminding about and prompting to perform basic tasks, especially when something unexpected happened. They also indicated that R.P. occasionally demonstrated a failure to put K.P.\u2019s needs before her own and a lack of awareness of K.P.\u2019s current and future needs. Her attitude towards social workers was also noted to be aggressive, uncooperative and occasionally violent. Consequently, there were concerns about R.P.\u2019s ability and willingness to work with local authority professionals and put K.P.\u2019s needs first. This was of particular concern in light of K.P.\u2019s need for high levels of support.", "19. In May 2007 H.J. was asked to produce a third report. The report, dated 2 June 2007, primarily concerned the risks posed by R.P. to K.P. and R.P.\u2019s ability to care for K.P. H.J. was also asked to comment on R.P.\u2019s litigation capacity. She noted:", "\u201c1.1 As I have indicated previously RP has a significant learning disability, and she will always need a high level of support in caring for KP", ". If she were not receiving this support she would pose a high level of risk to KP\u2019s well-being, which is not due to any desire on her part to hurt KP, but to her limitations, which are too extensive to allow her to parent KP successfully on her own.", "1.2 If she were receiving a high level of support this risk could be reduced. The level of support which would be needed for this to happen would be for another competent adult to be present at all times, to prompt and assist RP in her care for KP. Essentially this means that RP would need to be living with a partner or family member who could appropriately provide this level of support.", "... ... ...", "2.3 Having read all the work which has been done with RP and having carefully considered my assessment of her, it is my view that there is no further work which could be undertaken with RP which would increase her ability to care for KP in any significant way.", "... ... ...", "7.1 As I indicated earlier RP could only care for KP if she had a high level of support. I cannot perceive anything in her circumstances which suggests to me that such a support network is available, and without this no progress can be made towards rehabilitation.", "... ... ...", "8.1 RP would need 24 hour support, and within this it would be realistic to expect her to assist with KP\u2019s care but not take sole responsibility for this. This would continue to be the case throughout KP\u2019s childhood. If this could be achieved in a natural environment, such as a family, then it might be suitable as a long term prospect, as long as KP had a consistent identified care giver within that arrangement.", "... ... ...", "9.1 RP does not have the capacity to give informed consent to a placement order. She cannot really understand the proceedings except at a very basic level.\u201d", "20. On 11 July 2007 the local authority completed a further core assessment. The conclusion was that:", "\u201cThe opinion of all the agencies involved with KP\u2019s care in a position to make an informed decision regarding RP\u2019s ability to parent KP is clear. Without a very high level of continuous support and supervision, RP does not have the skills to enable her to successfully parent KP. RP has consistently demonstrated by her behaviour that she does not wish to work in partnership with the agencies who will continue to be involved in KP\u2019s care throughout her childhood. Therefore, we need to look for alternative permanent carers. Maternal grandparents have put themselves forward to be assessed and this is in the process of being conducted. However, the local authority have a number of concerns in respect of their living conditions, RP\u2019s upbringing and the influence that RP still has upon them and how this would impact upon KP if she were to be placed in their care. Although the local authority do not wish to pre-empt the outcome of the initial sessions with the maternal grandparents, there are a number of concerns regarding their interaction and relationship with RP and their own parenting skills. The local authority at this time believe it is in KP\u2019s best interest to be placed for adoption and the matter will come before the adoption panel on 19 July 2007. The local authority will urgently review this if the outcome of the maternal grandparents\u2019 assessment proves positive\u201d.", "21. The local authority filed its final care plan on 12 July 2007. That care plan recommended adoption outside the family and it issued proceedings seeking a placement order under section 21 of the Children\u2019s Act 2002. The Official Solicitor consented to act on behalf of R.P. in the placement proceedings as well as in the care proceedings. The application for a placement order was then consolidated with the care proceedings and listed for hearing before a judge.", "22. On 6 August 2007 the local authority filed a kinship assessment of M.P. and B.P. The report indicated that there had been referrals to the local authority concerning M.P.\u2019s and B.P.\u2019s care of R.P. and A.P. It further noted that M.P. and B.P. were unable to control R.P. or manage her behaviour and that they had also intermittently displayed hostility and suspicion towards the local authority. In view of these facts, the local authority concluded that it could not support the maternal grandparents as carers for K.P. On 24 August 2007 a further kinship assessment was filed in respect of A.P. The local authority considered that he was unlikely to have the capacity fully to understand or to meet K.P.\u2019s welfare needs and therefore could not support him as a carer.", "23. In a statement to the court dated 17 August 2007, the Official Solicitor indicated that R.P. was not in a position to consent or refuse her consent to the placement order and as her litigation friend he was unable to oppose the making of the care order or the placement order. However, he also indicated R.P.\u2019s opposition to the orders sought by the local authority, her belief that K.P. should be returned to her care or the care of her family, and her belief that the local authority had not given her a chance to acquire the skills necessary to care for K.P.", "24. In a pre-hearing review R.P. agreed with S.C. and counsel that she would not give oral evidence at the hearing but that her wishes would be conveyed to the court by counsel.", "25. The hearing took place on 29 August 2007. R.P. was represented throughout by experienced counsel and her views were made known to the court. At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge made a care order, dispensed with R.P.\u2019s consent to the placement order and made a placement order.", "26. R.P. applied for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal and also made an application in the County Court to revoke the placement order. The County Court proceedings were adjourned pending the outcome of the proceedings before the Court of Appeal, which took place in March 2008.", "27. The Official Solicitor was notified of the appeal proceedings. He wrote to R.P., informing her of the possibility of free legal representation through the Bar Pro Bono Unit (\u201cthe Unit\u201d). When R.P. did not pursue this, the Official Solicitor arranged for the Unit to consider her case. Specialist counsel was appointed and made available to represent R.P. at the hearing. Although R.P. declined his services, he attended the hearing in case R.P. changed her mind. She did not change her mind and instead was assisted in the proceedings by A.P. and Mr John Hemming MP, who acted as her McKenzie friends.", "28. In a statement to the Court of Appeal in advance of the hearing, the Official Solicitor set out his standard working practice. He indicated that:", "\u201cIf there is a conflict in the evidence relating to an adult party\u2019s capacity to conduct the proceedings then I will not accept appointment unless or until that conflict is resolved either by the experts arriving at a consensus, or by determination of the court. I will return to this issue below.", "... ... ...", "The solicitor, however, remains the primary point of contact for the protected party. My case worker relies on the solicitor to ensure the protected party is involved, so far as is possible, and is informed about the progression of the proceedings, and for communication of the protected party\u2019s ascertainable views, wishes and feelings with regard to the matters at issue. Whilst the solicitor may not take instructions from the protected party I regard the maintenance of personal contact between the solicitor and the protected party during the case as important, to ensure that proper information is provided and to afford the protected party the opportunity to express any concerns about issues raised, or information provided in the proceedings. I expect any concerns raised to be properly considered and communicated to my case worker. My case worker will consider the protected party\u2019s views and wishes on all relevant points but where those views and wishes run contrary to the legal advice received as to the management and progression of the case, it is unlikely that I will prefer the protected party\u2019s views over that advice, as it would not be in the protected party\u2019s interests that I do so.", "... ... ...", "I am not necessarily involved in the investigation of capacity unless specifically directed to investigate by the court (although my staff are available to offer guidance with regard to the relevant test, if so requested). The evidence as to lack of litigation capacity may therefore be in the form of a medical or psychological report or by way of a report in the form of my standard certificate. The evidence is generally from either a psychiatrist or (in the case of learning disability or acquired brain injury) from a psychologist. In a small number of cases it will be from a general practitioner. In a minority of cases it may be from another clinical specialist such as a neurologist or geriatrician. In the alternative the court may have made a determination, on the existing evidence, that the person concerned is a \u2018protected party\u2019 within the meaning of the rules.", "If the evidence on capacity to conduct the proceedings is ambiguous, or conflicting, then the Divisional Manager will request further clarification from the person who has conducted the assessment, or refer back to the court for a determination of the capacity issue.", "If during the course of the case the solicitor advises the case worker that the protected party may have recovered capacity, the standard instructions provide that the solicitor must obtain further evidence on this point.", "If there is evidence that the protected party has recovered capacity, then I will make an application to the court for my discharge. It is of course always open to the protected party at any time during my appointment to apply for my discharge, if of the view that the evidence as to capacity is open to challenge. Similarly if a person comes forward as willing to act in substitution for myself, then an application may be made to substitute for me as litigation friend. My discharge or substitution as litigation friend is for the court to decide.", "If my case worker is informed that the protected party asserts his or her own capacity to conduct the proceedings and disputes the existing evidence, then the protected party would be invited to agree to undergo further assessment - for example, through referral to his or her general practitioner or other NHS referral. If the protected party refuses to undergo further assessment or seek further evidence, I have, of course, no power to compel this.", "29. At the hearing R.P. claimed that there had been a violation of her rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention because, inter alia, she had not been informed that the Official Solicitor would be representing her until after the hearing; the involvement of the Official Solicitor was unlawful as she had the capacity to instruct her own solicitor; the clinical psychologist had failed to apply the correct test in assessing capacity, namely the test identified in the Court of Appeal decision of Masterman-Lister (Masterman-Lister v Brutton & Co (Nos 1 and 2) [2002] EWCA Civ 1889; Masterman-Lister v Jewell and another [2003] EWCA Civ 70); and finally, if she lacked capacity, a family member should have been appointed as her litigation friend.", "30. In a judgment dated 8 May 2008, the court found that R.P. was fully informed of the involvement of the Official Solicitor and the nature of his role; the clinical psychologist correctly assessed R.P.\u2019s capacity by reference to the Masterman-Lister test, and R.P.\u2019s family members would not have been suitable litigation friends as they had also put themselves forward as carers for K.P. With regard to the merits of R.P.\u2019s case, the court found that the local authority had done what it could to facilitate the return of K.P. to R.P.\u2019s care and had not simply dismissed this possibility out of hand. The available evidence indicated, however, that R.P.\u2019s significant learning disability prevented her from acquiring the necessary skills to provide K.P. with the care that she needed and this was exacerbated by her increasing unwillingness to co-operate with social workers. The court therefore concluded that the Official Solicitor was right to concede that the care and placement orders were in K.P.\u2019s best interests and the judge was right to make the orders. Accordingly, it held that there had been no violation of R.P.\u2019s rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.", "31. R.P. applied for leave to appeal to the House of Lords but leave was refused on 22 July 2008.", "32. While the Court of Appeal proceedings were ongoing, R.P. issued an application for leave to apply to revoke the contact order. The application was refused on 7 August 2008 and on 22 October 2008 she was refused leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal.", "33. On 19 August 2008 R.P. issued an application for more frequent contact with K.P. On receiving notice of the application, the Official Solicitor wrote to the court to say that the question of R.P.\u2019s capacity needed to be decided in the context of the contact application. At a hearing on 27 January 2009, an expert report was produced which indicated that R.P. had capacity in relation to the contact proceedings. However, on 15 May 2009 the application for contact orders was refused and R.P. was refused leave to appeal. In addition, a further application for leave to revoke the placement order was refused and the court ordered that in future R.P. could only apply for leave to revoke the placement order if she could put forward a change of circumstances since the date of the decision.", "34. On 23 June 2009 R.P. applied for permission to appeal the refusal to grant her leave to apply to revoke the placement order. Permission was refused on 8 October 2009. On 24 June 2009 she issued an application for permission to proceed with a claim for judicial review, pleading that the local authority was acting unlawfully and unreasonably by proceeding with plans for the adoption of K.P. whilst proceedings were pending before the European Court of Human Rights. Permission was refused on 12 August 2009. On 7 December 2009 R.P. made a further claim for judicial review in respect of the adoption plan but permission was refused on 14 January 2011.", "35. R.P. subsequently made a further application for leave to apply to discharge the placement order. On 10 February 2010 the application for leave was refused and R.P. was refused permission to appeal. In the context of those proceedings, the judge noted that \u201cthe mother has a sufficient grasp of what she wants to achieve to put forward her case with assistance so that imposing upon her a litigation friend would be quite inappropriate\u201d.", "36. On 1 March 2010 K.P. was placed with prospective adopters, who submitted an application for an adoption order in November 2010. An adoption order was granted by the County Court on 14 April 2011 and R.P.\u2019s request for leave to appeal was refused by the High Court. R.P. has subsequently lodged an application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal out of time. That application was dismissed on 15 December 2011.", "37.

He is currently appointed by the Lord Chancellor under section 90 of the Supreme Court Act 1981.", "40. The Official Solicitor generally becomes involved in litigation because he is invited to do so. It is a matter for his discretion whether he consents to act and he cannot be compelled to act. If he consents to act, he may become involved in proceedings as a \u201clitigation friend\u201d.
