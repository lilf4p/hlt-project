The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Sofia.", "6. In 1995 the applicant was appointed as an inspector at the National Security Service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In 2002 he was transferred to the Ministry\u2019s National Security Directorate (the Ministry\u2019s internal structure had been altered in 1997). At that time he had the rank of major. His duties included counterintelligence, the recruitment and managing of secret agents, the gathering and dissemination of information from secret sources, secret surveillance, etc.", "7. In November 2002 a proposal was made for the applicant\u2019s disciplinary dismissal. The proposal was prompted by an internal investigation which found indications that the applicant had engaged, aside from his duties at the Ministry, in fish farming, and that he had sought to resolve disputes with the persons employed by him by threatening them with his position. It was felt that these activities were incompatible with the duties of an officer of the National Security Directorate and tarnished the reputation of the service.", "8. The proposal was not upheld due to the lack of sufficient evidence.", "9. On 6 March 2003 the Director of the National Security Directorate sent a letter to the head of the Ministry\u2019s Psychology Institute (see paragraph 33 below). He referred in detail to the above facts and suggested that the applicant be subjected to psychological assessment on the basis of Instruction no. I37 (see paragraph 32 below).", "10. On 19 March 2003 the Director of the National Security Directorate ordered the applicant to present himself for assessment at the Ministry\u2019s Psychology Institute.", "11. The applicant underwent a psychological assessment on 16 April 2003. It consisted of a psychological test, an interview and a polygraph test.", "12. The results of the assessment were available on 9 May 2003. The psychologist who had carried it out described the results of his observations and of the polygraph test, and expressed the opinion that the applicant was mentally unfit to work at the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The document was classified and the applicant was not allowed to see it.", "13. On 5 June 2003 the Director of the National Security Directorate proposed to the Minister of Internal Affairs to dismiss the applicant from his post under section 253(1)(5) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Act 1997 and regulation 251(1)(6) of the Act\u2019s implementing regulations (see paragraphs 30 and 31 below). In his proposal he described in detail the attempt to dismiss the applicant on disciplinary grounds and the results of the psychological assessment. The applicant was allowed to have sight of the proposal the same day.", "14. In an order of 27 June 2003 the Minister of Internal Affairs dismissed the applicant by reference to the legal provisions mentioned in the proposal.", "15. The applicant was acquainted with the order on 13 August 2003 and noted his disagreement with the grounds for issuing it.", "16. On 26 August 2003 the applicant sought judicial review of the Minister\u2019s order. He argued, inter alia, that it had not been duly reasoned and that the psychological assessment on the basis of which it had been issued had not been objective.", "17. In the course of the proceedings before the Supreme Administrative Court the Ministry presented a copy of the applicant\u2019s psychological assessment. The proceedings as a whole were then classified, apparently because the case file contained a classified document.", "18. The applicant was initially represented by two lawyers. The first of them withdrew from the proceedings because he could not obtain the requisite security clearance to be able to have access to the documents in the case file. The second also withdrew because she did not have enough legal experience to be granted rights of audience before the Supreme Administrative Court. The applicant accordingly retained another counsel who had the requisite experience and security clearance.", "19. In her written pleadings counsel for the Ministry submitted, inter alia, that after the applicant had been found mentally unfit for work, under section 253(1)(5) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Act 1997 (see paragraph 30 below), the Minister had been bound to dismiss him from his post.", "20. A threemember panel of the Supreme Administrative Court heard the case on 4 October 2004. Counsel for the applicant argued, inter alia, that the psychological assessment had not been correctly carried out and that its results could not be trusted. Counsel for the Ministry argued, inter alia, that the assessment could not be subjected to judicial scrutiny.", "21. In a judgment of 11 October 2004 (\u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 50 \u043e\u0442 11 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 2004 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 \u042165/2003 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, V \u043e.), the threemember panel rejected the applicant\u2019s claim, finding that no breaches of the rules of procedure had occurred in the course of the dismissal procedure. It went on to say that it was not competent to review the results of the psychological assessment carried out by the Ministry\u2019s Psychology Institute. Under the terms of regulation 251(1)(6) of the implementing regulations of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Act 1997 (see paragraph 31 below), such assessments amounted to incontrovertible proof of unfitness for work at the Ministry, and the Ministry\u2019s Psychology Institute was the only body competent to determine that issue. The panel also found no indication that the dismissal order was not in line with the purpose of the law.", "22. The applicant appealed on points of law. He challenged, inter alia, the psychological assessment procedure and the independence of the experts who had carried it out. He also contested the threemember panel\u2019s ruling that the Ministry\u2019s Psychology Institute was the only body competent to carry out such an examination and that the court could not scrutinise the correctness of the Institute\u2019s opinion. In an additional memorial filed on 9 March 2005 he pointed out that in a judgment of 8 February 2005 (see paragraph 35 below) another panel of the Supreme Administrative Court had stated that the assessment of mental fitness for work at the Ministry should be amenable to judicial scrutiny.", "23. In a final judgment of 17 May 2005 (\u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 12 \u043e\u0442 17 \u043c\u0430\u0439 2005 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 \u04214/2005 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0447\u043b. \u0441\u0432), a fivemember panel of the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the appeal. It held, inter alia, that the psychological assessment procedure had been duly followed, and that the threemember panel had been correct to find that it could not scrutinise the assessment. Its judgment had been given before the judgment of 8 February 2005 which had partly struck down regulation 251(1)(6) of the implementing regulations of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Act 1997 (see paragraph 35 below) and had been based on the wording of that regulation in force before the judgment of 8 February 2005.", "24. As the proceedings were classified, the applicant could not obtain copies of the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s judgments. On 5 December 2005 he asked the court to issue certificates containing the judgments\u2019 operative provisions and indications as to the subject matter of the case. The president of the fivemember panel which had dealt with the case acceded to the request, and on 7 December 2005 the applicant was issued two certificates, one in relation to the threemember panel\u2019s judgment and another in relation to the fivemember panel\u2019s judgment.", "25. In the meantime, on 7 November 2005 the applicant requested the reopening of the proceedings.", "26. In a judgment of 4 April 2006 (\u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 \u042f63 \u043e\u0442 4 \u0430\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043b 2006 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 \u0421108/2005 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0447\u043b. \u0441\u0432) the Supreme Administrative Court rejected the request.", "27. On 30 August 2006 a commission appointed by the president of the Supreme Administrative Court declassified the minutes of the hearings before the threemember and fivemember panels, as well as their judgments. It did so by reference to regulation 50(3)(2) of the Regulations for the implementation of the Protection of Classified Information Act 2002, which provides that the level of classification must be changed if it has been set incorrectly.", "28. Article 120 of the Constitution of 1991 provides:", "\u201c1. The courts shall review the lawfulness of the administration\u2019s acts and decisions.", "2. Natural and juristic persons shall have the right to seek judicial review of any administrative act or decision which affects them, save as expressly specified by statute.\u201d", "29. Section 2(1) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Act 1997 (\u201cthe 1997 Act\u201d), in force until the end of April 2006, provided that the Ministry\u2019s activities were subject to \u201ccivic control [exercised] through the authorities set out in the Constitution and this Act\u201d.", "30. Section 253(1)(5) of the Act provided that civil servants employed by the Ministry were to be dismissed from their posts if they were unfit to carry out their duties. Section 253(2) provided that unfitness of work within the meaning of section 253(1)(5) was to be established in the manner laid down in the Act\u2019s implementing regulations. The dismissal order was subject to judicial review (section 258).", "31. Regulation 251(1) of the Act\u2019s implementing regulations, which came into force in September 1998 and were repealed in June 2006, specified that unfitness within the meaning of section 253(1)(5) of the Act could result from: (a) a final conviction and effective sentence of imprisonment; (b) the inability to carry out one\u2019s duties effectively, as established by an internal audit; (c) the systematic or repeated commission of disciplinary offences which were not of a level of gravity warranting disciplinary dismissal; (d) a failure to complete the initial professional qualification course; (e) a failure to submit a conflict-of-interest declaration or an incompatibility established on the basis of such a declaration; (f) mental unfitness for work at the Ministry, as established by the Ministry\u2019s Psychology Institute (regulation 251(1)(6)); and (g) a court order preventing the person concerned from holding certain types of employment as a punishment in a criminal case.", "32. On 5 March 2001 the Minister of Internal Affairs issued Instruction no. I37 on \u201cthe psychological selection and psychological aspects of the appraisal (reselection) of the civil servants (officers, sergeants and civilian staff) employed by the Ministry\u201d. The instruction was issued under, inter alia, regulation 171 of the 1997 Act\u2019s implementing regulations, which provided that the mental and physical fitness of the Ministry\u2019s staff was to be assessed periodically in a manner laid down by the Minister (this regulation was repealed in April 2003). Section 6 of the Instruction provided that those assessments were to be carried out by the Ministry\u2019s Psychology Institute (see paragraph 33 below). By virtue of section 16, the purpose of the psychological assessment of the Ministry\u2019s staff was to determine (a) their current mental condition, (b) diminished motivation, behavioural or emotional inadequacy, or general deadaption leading to low professional effectiveness, or (c) abuse of position for financial gain. In carrying out the assessment of staff suspected of abusing their posts, the Institute\u2019s experts could resort to a polygraph test (section 17(3)(a)). Such persons could be subjected to sporadic assessments with a view to protecting the Ministry from \u201cstaff members who ha[d] lost their mental or emotional stability or other professional qualities and [could] cause damage to themselves, the [Ministry] or society through actions or omissions\u201d (section 19(1)). The conclusion of the assessment could be \u201cmentally fit for the post\u201d, \u201cmentally unfit for the post\u201d or \u201cmentally unfit for work at the Ministry of Internal Affairs\u201d (section 24(3)). The results of the assessment could, inter alia, constitute grounds for dismissal under section 253(1)(5) of the 1997 Act and regulation 251(1)(6) of the Act\u2019s implementing regulations (section 26(5)). The conclusion that a person was \u201cmentally unfit for work at the Ministry of Internal Affairs\u201d was final and not subject to review (section 27(3)).", "33. The Ministry\u2019s Psychology Institute was set up by the Government in February 1998 for the purpose of carrying out initial and followup psychological examinations of the staff of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, drawing up psychological expert reports, and training the Ministry\u2019s staff (point 1 of Decree no. 25 of 2 February 1998 of the Council of Ministers). At the relevant time its structure and activities were governed by Regulations no. I263 issued by the Minister of Internal Affairs on 13 November 2001 (in May 2010 they were superseded by Regulations no. I1137). Its director was appointed and dismissed by the Minister.", "34. In its early caselaw under section 253(1)(5) of the Act and regulation 251(1)(6), the Supreme Administrative Court consistently held that the Institute\u2019s assessment of a person\u2019s mental fitness for work at the Ministry was not subject to judicial review and could not be contested through any means, and that a conclusion that a person was mentally unfit for work at the Ministry required the Minister to dismiss that person (see \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 722 \u043e\u0442 28 \u044f\u043d\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0438 2002 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 8056/2001 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0447\u043b. \u0441\u0432; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 4441 \u043e\u0442 5 \u0441\u0435\u043f\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 2002 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 10880/ 2001 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, V \u043e.; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 2819 \u043e\u0442 25 \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0442 2003 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 11276/2002 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, V \u043e.; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 11347 \u043e\u0442 8 \u0434\u0435\u043a\u0435\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 2003 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 6483/2003 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, V \u043e.; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 1745 \u043e\u0442 26 \u0444\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0438 2004 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 9591/2003 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, V \u043e.; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 4093 \u043e\u0442 5 \u043c\u0430\u0439 2004 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 375/ 2004 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, V \u043e.; and \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 5890 \u043e\u0442 22 \u044e\u043d\u0438 2004 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 1318/2004 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, V \u043e.).", "35. In 2004 several persons brought a legal challenge to regulation 251(1)(6) (see paragraph 31 above). In a judgment of 8 February 2005, which came into force on 18 February 2005 following its publication in the State Gazette (\u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 1219 \u043e\u0442 8 \u0444\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0438 2005 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 4773/2004 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0447\u043b. \u0441\u0432, \u043e\u0431\u043d., \u0414\u0412, \u0431\u0440. 16 \u043e\u0442 18 \u0444\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0438 2005 \u0433.), a fivemember panel of the Supreme Administrative Court partly upheld the challenge and decided to strike out the wording \u201cestablished by the [Ministry\u2019s] Psychology Institute\u201d. It noted, inter alia, that the Institute was directly subordinate to the Minister, and that its assessments of a person\u2019s mental fitness for work at the Ministry were not subject to any form of review. There was therefore no guarantee that in carrying out those assessments the Institute\u2019s experts would not commit errors, abuse their powers or deprive those concerned of their rights. That was important because if the Institute\u2019s experts assessed a member of staff to be mentally unfit for work at the Ministry, the Minister had no discretion and was bound to dismiss him or her. Although the member of staff concerned could seek judicial review of the Minister\u2019s order, such a challenge would be futile because the assessment, which formed the basis of the Minister\u2019s order, was not amenable to judicial scrutiny. The court acknowledged that the employment of the Ministry\u2019s staff touched upon national security. Nonetheless, it went on to hold that considerations relating to national security had to yield to a person\u2019s right under Article 120 of the Constitution (see paragraph 28 above) to judicial review of all administrative decisions affecting his or her rights. The court said that the assessment of a person\u2019s mental fitness for work at the Ministry of Internal Affairs should be amenable to \u201cthe same control for lawfulness, [namely] by several independent experts and by the court, as in the case of assessing health conditions [for the purpose of granting disability benefits]\u201d. Therefore, in as much as it provided that the Ministry\u2019s Psychology Institute was the only body authorised to assess mental fitness for work at the Ministry, regulation 251(1)(6) ran counter to section 2 of the 1997 Act (see paragraph 29 above) and the Health Act 2004. It was in addition contrary to the purpose of the law.", "36. Following the delivery of that judgment, a panel of the Supreme Administrative Court held that, as a result of the partial strikedown of regulation 251(1)(6), the Institute\u2019s assessments could, even if predating the strike-down, be subjected to judicial scrutiny in proceedings for judicial review of a dismissal order (see \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 3483 \u043e\u0442 18 \u0430\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043b 2005 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 9378/2004 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, V \u043e.).", "37. However, other panels of the court abided by the old caselaw, holding that the lawfulness of dismissals which preceded the entry into force of the judgment of 8 February 2005 was to be judged by reference to the wording of regulation 251(1)(6) before its partial strikedown because the strikedown did not have retroactive effect (see \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 30 \u043e\u0442 18 \u044e\u043b\u0438 2005 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 \u0421-27/2005 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0447\u043b. \u0441\u0432; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 3949 \u043e\u0442 12 \u0430\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043b 2006 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 9213/2005 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, VI \u043e.; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 401 \u043e\u0442 10 \u044f\u043d\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0438 2006 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 5420/2005 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, V \u043e.; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 4967 \u043e\u0442 11 \u043c\u0430\u0439 2006 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 7006/2005 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, VI \u043e.; \u2116 \u042f9 \u043e\u0442 11 \u044f\u043d\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0438 2007 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 3\u0421310/2006 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, V \u043e.; and \u2116 \u042f23 \u043e\u0442 7 \u0444\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0438 2007 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 5\u0421312/2006 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0447\u043b. \u0441\u0432).
