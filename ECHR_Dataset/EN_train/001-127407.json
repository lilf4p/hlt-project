The applicant was born in 1982 and lives in Split.", "5. On 1 August 2008 an investigating judge of the Split County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Splitu) opened a criminal investigation in respect of the applicant and seventeen other persons for conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina in the period between 10 January and 30 July 2008.", "6.

As regards the applicant, the report stated that he was a long-term drug addict who had received treatment on two occasions but with no lasting results. He had resumed taking drugs a few months before. Since being detained he had been on Heptanon therapy which helped him to overcome his withdrawal symptoms. It was recommended that he continued with that therapy.", "10. On 16 September 2008 the investigating judge heard evidence from six witnesses, police officers who conducted the police inquiry prior to the institution of the criminal proceedings.", "11. On 24 October 2008 the investigating judge heard evidence from another suspect and on 29 and 31 October 2008 from four further police officers. On 7 November 2008 he heard evidence from another two suspects.", "12. On 21 January 2009 the State Attorney\u2019s Office for the Prevention of Corruption and Organised Crime preferred charges of conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina in the period between 10 January and 30 July 2008 against the applicant and seventeen other defendants in the Split County Court.", "13. On 29 January 2009 the applicant lodged an appeal against the bill of indictment (prigovor protiv optu\u017enice). By 4 February 2011 all the other defendants had also lodged their objections.", "14. On 4 March 2009 the Supreme Court returned the bill of indictment to the State Attorney\u2019s Office asking it to submit, within three days, a request to take further investigative steps.", "15. On 10 March 2009 the State Attorney\u2019s Office asked the investigating judge to take further steps.", "16. On 13 March 2009 the investigating judge ordered a transcript of all telephone conversations between the defendants, previously tapped by the police.", "17. On 12 June 2009 an expert in telecommunications submitted his report with a transcript of those telephone conversations. The transcript comprises 568 pages.", "18. On 16 June 2009 the State Attorney\u2019s Office submitted the same indictment to the Split County Court.", "19. On 1 July 2009 the applicant reiterated his objection to the indictment. He also requested that the evidence obtained by the police tapping of his telephone be excluded from the case file. The other defendants also lodged their objections.", "20. On 8 September 2009 the Supreme Court dismissed the objections to the indictment and refused the applicant\u2019s request to exclude from the case file all evidence obtained by the police tapping of his telephone.", "21. The first hearing scheduled for 26 April 2010 in the Split County Court was adjourned because two defendants did not appear. One of them had been sent to Zagreb Prison Hospital for treatment and the other was in another medical institution. On the same day the presiding judge ordered psychiatric report in respect of two defendants. The report was submitted on 4 May 2010.", "22. A hearing before the Split County Court was held on 8 June 2010 and all the defendants stated that they would give their defence at end of the trial.", "23.

Further hearings were held on 16 and 20 September 2010 and at the latter hearing a judgment was adopted, finding the applicant guilty and sentencing him to three years\u2019 imprisonment. His detention was lifted.", "28. Some of the defendants lodged appeals against the first-instance judgment and the proceedings are currently pending before the Supreme Court.", "29. On 1 August 2008 an investigating judge of the Split County Court ordered all the suspects to be detained on the grounds under Article 102 \u00a7 1 (1), (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, namely the danger of the suspects absconding, the danger of the suspects reoffending and the gravity of the charges. The relevant part of the decision, referring to the grounds for detention, reads:", "\u201cIn view of the manner in which the criminal offence was committed, the type and quantity of the illegal substances in which the suspects were trafficking, the large number of illegal transactions and the persistence and determination involved in committing the criminal offences, as well as the fact that the suspects are mostly unemployed with no means of support and that the suspects ... and Perica Oreb have previously been convicted of the same criminal offence or of similar criminal offences, there exists a justified fear that if released they might repeat a criminal offence of the same kind ...\u201d", "30. A report drawn up on 4 August 2008 by the Split Police Department expressly notes that the applicant had voluntarily come to that Department that day and that he had then been taken to Split Prison.", "31. In his appeal of 7 August 2008 the applicant argued that the written charges against him alleged that he had had contact with only one of the other suspects, which showed that he could not have been a participant in any organised criminal activity since he did not know about the involvement of the other suspects and they were not even known to him. He supported these assertions with the argument that no illegal substances, money or equipment necessary for trafficking in the said substances on a large scale, such as packaging or scales, had been found on him, and that this showed that he personally had not been involved in such trafficking.", "32. He also claimed that he had never been convicted by a final judgment of trafficking in illegal substances, but only of the criminal offence of using illegal substances and that he was not a drug addict. Lastly, he argued that the possibility of ordering an alternative measure to detention had not been considered.", "33. On 8 August 2008 the investigating judge asked for a copy of the applicant\u2019s criminal record. The report of 12 August 2008 submitted by the Ministry of Justice indicated that the applicant had not been convicted of any criminal offence.", "34. On 22 August 2008 a three-judge panel of the Split County Court examined the appeals lodged by the defendants. It accepted that the ground under Article 102 \u00a7 1(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure no longer persisted. In other respects it dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal on the grounds that: the documents in the case file showed that the applicant had previously been convicted of similar criminal offences (without any further explanations in that respect), and that the persistent criminal activity over a long period with which the suspects were charged taken together with their economic situation justified the fear that they might repeat the same offences. The relevant part of the decision reads:", "\u201cIn view of the level of criminal activity with which the defendants are charged, namely, that they have been engaged in trafficking in illegal drugs over a long period of time, and in view of the resolve and persistence shown in committing the offence, the fact that the defendants ... Perica Oreb ... have already been convicted of criminal offences, and almost all defendants have no means of subsistence, all these things indicate that there is a danger of the defendants reoffending ...", "The manner in which the criminal offences were committed, with the defendants organising themselves into a group, and the quantity of the illegal substances whose sale might put at risk the health of a large number of persons, amount to grave circumstances ...\u201d", "35. On 3 September 2008 the investigating judge extended the applicant\u2019s detention for a further month on the grounds under Article 102 \u00a7 1 (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (the danger of reoffending and the gravity of the charges). The relevant part of the decision reads:", "\u201cIn view of the level of criminal activity with which the defendants have been charged, namely, that they have been engaged in trafficking in illegal drugs over a long period of time, and in view of the resolve to commit criminal offences and the fact that the defendants have previously been convicted of similar criminal offences, there is a danger of the defendants reoffending ...", "The offence was committed under grave circumstances as shown by the manner in which it was committed, the fact that the defendants organised a group and the quantity of the illegal substances in circulation, which, through the sale on the illegal market, could put at risk the health of a number of persons.\u201d", "36. In his appeal of 8 September 2008 the applicant argued that he had not previously been convicted of the same offence and that the ordering of his detention under Article 102 \u00a7 1 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (danger of reoffending) violated the principle of the presumption of innocence. He also reiterated that the written charges against him alleged that he had had contact with only one of the other suspects, which showed that he could not have been a participant in any organised criminal activity since he did not know about the involvement of the other suspects and did not even know who they were. He argued, in support of those assertions, that no illegal substances, money or materials necessary for trafficking in the said substances on a large scale, such as packaging or scales, had been found on him and that this showed that he had not personally been involved in such trafficking.", "37. On 11 September 2008 a three-judge panel of the Split County Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal. The relevant part of the decision reads:", "\u201c... the defendants have been charged with the criminal offence of trafficking in illegal drugs between 10 January and 30 July 2008 ... The documents in the case file show that the defendant ... Perica Oreb has already been convicted of similar criminal offences; the defendant Perica Oreb ... is unemployed, and all three defendants have no assets.", "In view of the high level of criminal activity with which they have been charged, namely that they engaged in trafficking in illegal drugs during the above-mentioned period and showed resolve and persistence in committing the offence, as well as their economic situation \u2013 all these circumstances taken together indicate a danger of the defendants reoffending ...", "Furthermore, the offence was committed under grave circumstances as shown by the manner in which it was committed, the fact that the defendants organised a group and the quantity of the illegal substances, which through their sale on the illegal market could put at risk the health of a number of persons ...\u201d", "38. On 3 October 2008 the investigating judge lifted the applicant\u2019s detention on the ground that the psychiatric report indicated that he had been a drug user and that he had been buying drugs for his own use and not in order to sell it to others. His immediate release was ordered as well. The State Attorney lodged an appeal on 7 October 2008.", "39. On 10 October 2008 a three-judge panel of the Split County Court allowed the appeal and extended the applicant\u2019s detention again on the grounds under Article 102 \u00a7 1 (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The reasoning was the same as that in the decision of 11 September 2008. It was stated, inter alia, that the documents in the case file showed that the applicant had previously been convicted of similar criminal offences (without any further explanations in that respect). The applicant was re-detained on 28 October 2008.", "40. On 21 November 2008 the investigating judge extended the detention in respect of all the defendants for a further month again on the grounds under Article 102 \u00a7 1 (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This decision was quashed by a three-judge panel of the Split County Court on 11 December 2008 on the ground that the period of further detention had to be specified for each defendant.", "41. On 10 December 2008, in another set of criminal proceedings, the Dubrovnik County Court convicted the applicant of trafficking in heroin and sentenced him to two years\u2019 imprisonment.", "42. On 15 December 2008 the investigating judge extended the applicant\u2019s detention until 28 December 2008, again on the grounds under Article 102 \u00a7 1 (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The reasoning relied on the allegations that the accused had been charged with trafficking in substantial quantities of heroin as their primary activity. On 16 December 2008 the applicant lodged an appeal. He argued that no drugs, money or tools typical for the sale of drugs had been found on him and that he had never been convicted of any drug-related crimes. He again argued that the possibility of ordering an alternative measure to detention had not been considered.", "43. On 23 December 2008 the investigating judge issued a fresh decision extending the applicant\u2019s detention until 28 December, again on the grounds under Article 102 \u00a7 1 (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He relied on the allegations that the accused had been charged with trafficking in substantial quantities of heroin as their primary activity, on the gravity of the charges and the fact that the defendants had no means of support, without giving further details in this respect.", "44. On 24 December 2008 a three-judge panel of the Split County Court declared the applicant\u2019s appeal of 16 December 2008 inadmissible because a fresh decision on detention had been adopted in the meantime.", "45. On 30 December 2008 the applicant lodged an appeal against the investigating judge\u2019s decision of 23 December 2008. He reiterated the arguments from his previous appeal of 16 December 2008 and added that before his arrest he had been employed at a hotel in Cavtat.", "46. On 14 January 2009 a three-judge panel of the Split County Court dismissed the appeal and reiterated the reasoning from its decision of 11 September 2008. It also stressed that the applicant had been convicted before and that he had no assets.", "47. On 21 January 2009 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the above decision, arguing that the following rights had been violated: his right to personal liberty; right to a fair trial; his right to equality before the law because the grounds for detention had been interpreted in an unusual fashion; and his right to an effective remedy because the examination of his appeal had been inadequate.", "48. On 23 January 2009 the Split County Court extended the applicant\u2019s detention, again on the grounds under Article 102 \u00a7 1 (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In addition to the reasoning in the previous decisions, it added that the applicant was a drug addict and stated, inter alia, that he had already been convicted of similar criminal offences, without any further explanations in that respect.", "49. On 27 January 2009 the applicant lodged an appeal. In addition to the arguments put forward in his appeal of 16 and 30 December 2008 he added that his parents had a regular income and that therefore it could not be said that he had no means of subsistence.", "50. On 16 February 2009 the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal of 27 January 2009, holding that the alleged manner in which the criminal offence had been committed amounted to particularly grave circumstances which justified detention on the ground under Article 102 \u00a7 1 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. As regards the ground under Article 102 \u00a7 1 (3) \u2013 danger of reoffending \u2013 it was deemed justified since the applicant was a drug addict and two other sets of criminal proceedings concerning drug-related offences were pending against him, one before the \u010cakovec County Court and the other before the Dubrovnik County Court.", "51. On 19 February 2009 the Constitutional Court declared the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint of 22 January 2009 against the decision of 14 January 2009 inadmissible on the ground that a fresh decision on detention had been adopted in the meantime.", "52. On 16 April 2009 the Split County Court extended the applicant\u2019s detention, again on the grounds under Article 102 \u00a7 1 (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and with the same reasoning as before, stating, inter alia, that the applicant had already been convicted of similar offences, without any further explanations in that respect.", "53. On 8 May 2009 the Supreme Court quashed the decision of 16 April 2009 on the ground that the three-judge panel which adopted it had no such power and that it was the investigating judge who should have decided whether to extend the detention.", "54. On 15 May 2009 the investigating judge extended the applicant\u2019s detention, again on the grounds under Article 102 \u00a7 1 (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The reasoning relied on the allegations that the accused had been charged with trafficking in substantial quantities of heroin as their primary activity and had no other income. In his appeal lodged the same day the applicant reiterated the arguments from his appeal of 30 December 2008. As regards his previous conviction, he argued that the Dubrovnik County Court\u2019s judgment of 10 December 2008 had not yet become final.", "55. On 28 May 2009 the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, endorsing the reasons put forward by the investigating judge.", "56. On 10 June 2009 the investigating judge again extended the applicant\u2019s detention, again on the grounds under Article 102 \u00a7 1 (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and with the same reasoning as in the decision of 15 May 2009.", "57. On 16 June 2009 the applicant lodged an appeal. He reiterated his previous arguments.", "58. On 18 June 2009 a three-judge panel of the Split County Court extended the applicant\u2019s detention, again on the grounds under Article 102 \u00a7 1 (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, reiterating the same reasoning as in the previous decisions concerning the applicant\u2019s detention. It stated, inter alia, that the documents in the case file showed that the applicant had already been convicted of similar offences, without any further explanations in that respect.", "59. On 24 June 2009 the applicant lodged an appeal reiterating his previous arguments.", "60. On 30 June 2009 a three-judge panel of the Split County Court declared the applicant\u2019s appeal of 16 June 2009 inadmissible because a fresh decision on his detention had been adopted in the meantime.", "61. On 13 July 2009 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal of 24 June 2009. As to the applicant\u2019s previous convictions, it stated:", "\u201cAll appellants, save for ... Perica Oreb ... had already been convicted of similar criminal offences ...", "... criminal proceedings are currently pending against the accused Perica Oreb before the Dubrovnik County Court in which he has been convicted, by a judgment that has not yet become final, of a criminal offence under Article 173 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code and sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment. Therefore, the fact that the accused had not been finally convicted could not alter conclusion that there is a danger of him reoffending since other criminal proceedings are pending against the accused, which is also relevant in assessing the conformity of their lifestyles with the laws.", "...\u201d", "62. On 14 September 2009 a three-judge panel of the Split County Court again extended the applicant\u2019s detention on the grounds under Article 102 \u00a7 1 (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, reiterating the same reasoning as in the previous decisions concerning the applicant\u2019s detention and stating, inter alia, that the documents in the case file showed that the applicant had already been convicted of similar offences, without any further explanations in that respect.", "63.

The applicant lodged a constitutional complaint, challenging the grounds for and the duration of his detention.", "66. On 26 November 2009 a three-judge panel of the Split County Court extended the applicant\u2019s detention, again on the grounds under Article 102 \u00a7 1 (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, reiterating the same reasoning as in the previous decisions concerning the applicant\u2019s detention and stating that the applicant\u2019s criminal record showed that he had already been convicted of similar offences.", "67.

These circumstances, contrary to the submissions of all the appellants, are relevant in assessing the conformity of their lifestyles with the laws.", "The above circumstances together with the fact that all of the appellants, save for D.R., are heroin addicts and the accused ... Perica Oreb is unemployed ... justify the fear that, if at large, they would continue to commit the same or similar criminal offences and therefore [the decision to extend] their detention on the ground under Article 102 \u00a7 1 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure is correct.", "...\u201d", "70.
