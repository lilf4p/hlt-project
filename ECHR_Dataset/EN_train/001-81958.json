On 25 November 1997 the District Court, having held one hearing for which only the applicant appeared, ordered the Institute, as her employer, to pay her the full amount claimed. The Company had not been summoned to participate in the proceedings.", "10. On 20 January 1998 the City Court quashed this judgment on the Institute's appeal in cassation and remitted the case for a fresh consideration. It found that the District Court again had insufficiently explored the contractual relationship between the parties and that it should have summoned the Company to participate in the proceedings. The court further considered that it was not necessary for it to assume first-instance jurisdiction over the case, as the matter was not complex.", "11. On 5 March 1998 the City Court returned the case-file to the District Court. The District Court summoned the Company to participate in the proceedings as a co-defendant and between April and May 1998 scheduled three hearings, two of them being adjourned on account of a co-defendant's absence.", "12.

In particular, the Presidium noted that the District Court had not given due regard to the fact that the applicable law allowed the applicant to claim trip allowance from either her employer or the ship charterer, irrespective of the fact that the freight contract vested the payment obligation in the latter.", "15. Between April and August 2001 the court held three hearings, one of them adjourned on account of the applicant's absence. On 8 August 2001 the District Court, having heard the testimonies of the parties and the ship captain, dismissed the applicant's claims. In particular, it found that the documentary evidence necessary to establish the existence and amount of the debt was not in accordance with applicable accounting rules and therefore insufficient.", "16. On 28 September 2001 the District Court found that the applicant's appeal against the judgment of 8 August 2001 did not comply with the requirements of procedural law and gave her a time-limit to rectify its shortcomings. On 11 October 2001 the District Court found that the applicant had insufficiently followed its instructions and returned the appeal to the applicant as \u201cnot lodged\u201d.
