BULGARIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Preliminary objection dismissed (non-exhaustion of domestic remedies);Violation of Art. 8;Non-pecuniary damage - award", "JUDGES": "Ganna Yudkivska;Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["7. The applicants in application no. 43449/02, Ms Pepa Vladimirova Mileva and Ms Meri Vladimirova Mileva, were born in 1934 and 1936 respectively and live in Sofia. They are sisters.", "8. The applicants in application no. 21475/04, Mr Hristo Ivanov Evtimov, Ms Lilia Kirilova Evtimova and Ms Kalina Hristova Evtimova, were born in 1939, 1943 and 1977 respectively and live or lived in Sofia. The first two were husband and wife, and the third is their daughter. As mentioned in paragraph 2 above, Mr Hristo Evtimov died in 2007.", "9. At the material time the applicants in application no. 43449/02 (\u201cthe Milevi sisters\u201d), both of whom are retired, owned a flat on the first floor of entrance \u201cB\u201d of a Ushaped block of flats in the centre of Sofia. Both of them had lived in that flat since 1963. They submitted that as a result of the events described below, they were forced to move out of the flat. On 11 March 2004 they sold it to a limited liability company for 61,000 euros. On 22 April 2004 they bought a smaller flat in another neighbourhood, and on 15 June 2004 went to live there.", "10. The applicants in application no. 21475/04 (\u201cthe Evtimovi family\u201d) own and live in a flat on the first floor of entrance \u201cC\u201d of the same block of flats. Ms Kalina Evtimova\u2019s daughter, born on 28 September 2000, also lives there.", "11. In May 2000 a company rented a flat on the ground floor of entrance \u201cB\u201d of the block, below the flat of the Milevi sisters. It started operating a computer club there, without obtaining the necessary permits.", "12. In March 2002 the club moved into a flat situated opposite the original one, again on the ground floor of entrance \u201cB\u201d. That flat was located diagonally below both the flat of the Milevi sisters and that of the Evtimovi family.", "13. According to four affidavits, the first of which was drawn up by Mr Hristo Evtimov and Ms Lilia Evtimova, and the rest by witnesses asked by the applicants to describe the situation, the club had fortysix computers and two vending machines. It was open twentyfour hours a day, seven days a week. The services it offered were chiefly computer gaming and Internet surfing. The club\u2019s clients, mostly teenagers and young adults, often gathered in front of the building, chatting loudly and shouting, drinking alcohol, and smoking cigarettes and allegedly even narcotic drugs. They would often break the door of the building and enter the passageway, where they drank and smoked. The noise and the vibrations generated by them, both while inside the club and while entering or leaving the premises, could be clearly heard and felt in the flats of the Milevi sisters and of the Evtimovi family.", "14. The Milevi sisters produced a certificate in which their general practitioner attested that from the middle of 2002 both of them started complaining of constant headaches, insomnia, irritability and anxiety, had high blood pressure, and had lost weight. In 2003 Ms Meri Mileva developed a sinus tachycardia. As a result of her increasingly frequent cardiac crises, she had to be hospitalised. According to the doctor, those health problems were due to the constant disturbance and noise caused by the club\u2019s operations, and gradually subsided after the Milevi sisters went to live elsewhere in June 2004.", "15. On 28 June 2002 the general meeting of the block\u2019s occupants resolved, by twelve votes and three abstentions, that the club\u2019s operations should be stopped, and that no commercial activities should be allowed in the building. It stated that the club\u2019s operations caused serious disturbances to all inhabitants. The club\u2019s manager, who was present at the meeting, said that he disagreed and would do everything necessary to keep the club open.", "16. Having earlier made numerous complaints by telephone, the applicants made written complaints to the police on 28 May, 13 and 20 June, and 19 and 20 November 2002. They submitted that those complaints had prompted only a cursory inspection of the club, which had produced no tangible results.", "17. On 21 February 2003 the head of the local police station told the applicants that when asked to do so, the club\u2019s manager had been able to produce all necessary permits, and that no breaches of public order had been found. The manager had been warned not to allow breaches of public order and had undertaken to inform the police of any disturbances. The head of the local station further said that the police had no power to shut down commercial premises. On 26 February 2003 the applicants protested against the passiveness of the police.", "18. On 8 November 2004 the club\u2019s manager called at the Evtimovi\u2019s flat and allegedly threatened Mr Evtimov with violence if he persisted in his efforts to have the club\u2019s operations stopped. The same day Mr Evtimov complained to the police, but apparently nothing ensued.", "19. On 27 May 2002 the applicants asked the borough mayor to order the cessation of the club\u2019s operations. The same day the municipal services wrote to the police, informing them that the club was operating without the requisite licence.", "20. On 7 June 2002 municipal inspectors visited the premises and noted that the club was operating unlawfully. On 24 June 2002 the municipality sent the file to the Sofia Regional Building Control Directorate.", "21. However, on 26 June 2002 the chief architect of the municipality approved a plan for the conversion of the flat into commercial premises. On 1 July 2002 Mr Hristo Evtimov, acting in his capacity as chairman of the condominium, contested that decision before the Sofia Regional Building Control Directorate. On 23 August 2002 the Directorate, while noting that section 38 of the 2001 Territorial Organisation Act (see paragraphs 50 and 51 below) had not been complied with, said that that did not constitute grounds for invalidating the legalisation of the conversion under section 156(2) of the Act (see paragraph 52 below) and upheld the mayor\u2019s decision.", "22. Despite the applicants\u2019 repeated complaints to the municipal authorities, they took no further action.", "23. On 28 November 2003 the chief architect of the municipality granted the club an operating permit, on the condition that its clients entered through the back door and not through the passageway used by the building\u2019s residents. On 7 July 2004 the applicants challenged that decision before the Sofia Regional Building Control Directorate, arguing that the condition imposed by the mayor was impossible to comply with, as the only access to the back door was through the passageway. They requested that the permit be set aside and that the club be closed. It does not seem that the permit was annulled.", "24. On 28 May 2002 the applicants requested the Sofia Regional Building Control Directorate to prohibit the use of the flat.", "25. In a decision of 2 July 2002 the Directorate prohibited the use of the flat. It also ordered that its electricity and water supplies be cut off. It noted that the flat had been converted into a computer club without a building permit and that the club had started operating without a use permit, in breach of section 178(1) of the 2001 Territorial Organisation Act (see paragraph 53 below). It also observed, referring to section 217(1)(3) of the Act (ibid.), that any application for judicial review of the decision would not automatically suspend its enforcement.", "26. The flat\u2019s owner appealed to the National Building Control Directorate. On 4 November 2002 the Directorate rejected the appeal as inadmissible, noting that the impugned decision was not subject to an appeal to a higher authority but only to judicial review. On 7 November 2002 the National Directorate instructed the Regional Directorate to enforce the decision.", "27. On 15 October 2002 the flat\u2019s owner sought judicial review. She asked the court to suspend enforcement as an interim measure.", "28. The same day the Sofia City Court (\u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u044a\u0434) granted her request. It noted that by law the decision was enforceable immediately, even if it had been challenged by way of judicial review. However, the courts could in their discretion suspend enforcement and it was justified in doing so because the file did not contain any indications that the conditions envisaged by section 16 of the 1979 Administrative Procedure Act, which governed the enforcement of nonfinal administrative decisions (see paragraph 70 below), were fulfilled. In addition, the court allowed the condominium and the company operating the computer club to intervene in the proceedings, and fixed a hearing on the merits of the case for 25 February 2003.", "29. On 27 February 2003 the applicants appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (\u0412\u044a\u0440\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d \u0430\u0434\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d \u0441\u044a\u0434). On 19 June 2003 it reversed the lower court\u2019s ruling, saying that the courts could suspend the enforcement of the decision only if it would engender irreparable harm or frustrate the object of the proceedings. However, the flat\u2019s owner had not shown that these prerequisites were satisfied, nor had the lower court made such a finding. It had merely referred to section 16 of the 1979 Administrative Procedure Act, which was not applicable.", "30. The applicants subsequently asked the Sofia Regional Building Control Directorate to enforce the decision. It seems that they did not receive a reply.", "31. On 10 July 2003 the Sofia City Court, acting pursuant to a fresh request by the flat\u2019s owner, again suspended the enforcement of the decision. It held that its immediate enforcement would impede the proper course of the main proceedings and result in damage for the club\u2019s owner. There was no indication that the life or health of others were at risk, that with time enforcement would grow more difficult or be blocked, or that important State interests were at stake.", "32. On an appeal by the applicants, on 8 October 2003 the Supreme Administrative Court reversed that order. It found that in principle administrative decisions should be immediately enforced only if, inter alia, that was necessary to safeguard the life or health of others, or to protect important State or public interests. However, where the law specifically provided for the immediate enforcement of certain decisions, there was a presumption that such a need existed. Therefore, it was possible to suspend the enforcement of a decision which was immediately enforceable by operation of law only if that would put at risk an opposing interest of the same intensity as the one sought to be protected, which was not the case. Any pecuniary damage sustained by the club\u2019s owner was not of such a nature, as it could be fully compensated for by the payment of money.", "33. After that the applicants made numerous requests for the decision to be enforced. However, they were informed that on 28 November 2003 the local authorities had permitted the use of the club (see paragraph 23 above), and that therefore the decision could not be enforced. The applicants complained about that situation to the prosecuting authorities, but to no avail.", "34. In the meantime, the Sofia City Court tried to hold a first hearing on the merits of the case on 25 February 2003. However, the flat\u2019s owner had not been properly summoned and the court adjourned the proceedings. It fixed the next hearing for 26 March 2004. On 11 December 2003 the applicants complained about the delay to the Supreme Administrative Court. On 5 February 2004 that court, noting that according to section 219 of the 2001 Territorial Organisation Act (see paragraph 53 in fine below), the proceedings had to follow a fasttrack procedure, instructed the Sofia City Court to bring forward the date of its hearing. The Sofia City Court accordingly rescheduled the hearing for 9 March 2004. However, as the flat\u2019s owner had again not been properly summoned, the hearing was adjourned.", "35. On 14 April 2004 the applicants made a new complaint about delays. On 17 May 2004 the Supreme Administrative Court rejected it, finding that the Sofia City Court had made all possible efforts to allow the proper progress of the proceedings and that, in view of that court\u2019s busy calendar, the listing of a hearing for 6 July 2004 did not amount to an unjustified delay.", "36. At the hearing on 6 July 2004 the Sofia City Court started to examine the merits of the case. At the next hearing, held on 21 September 2004, the flat\u2019s owner declared that she wished to withdraw her application for judicial review, and the court accordingly discontinued the proceedings.", "37. On 8 November 2004 the Sofia Regional Building Control Directorate found that the computer club was operating in breach of the condition laid down in the permit of 28 November 2003 (see paragraph 23 above), as its clients were entering through the passageway used by the building\u2019s residents and not through a separate entrance.", "38. On 16 November 2004 the flat\u2019s owner informed the authorities that the computer club had ceased its operations. On 25 November 2004 the Sofia Regional Building Control Directorate, having found after an inspection on 19 November 2004 that the vending machines and two computers had still not been taken out of the club, again prohibited its use and ordered that its electricity and water supplies be cut off.", "39. Some time after that the flat was rented by another company, which apparently used it as an office until January 2008.", "40. In the meantime, on 1 September 2003, the Milevi sisters asked the Sofia City Court to exempt them from paying court fees for a tort claim which they intended to bring against the persons operating the club. On 12 September 2003 the court\u2019s president refused to examine the request, saying that it could be made only if a claim had already been brought, or if it had been lodged concomitantly with the statement of claim. That ruling was later upheld by the Sofia Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Cassation. It seems that the Milevi sisters did not bring a claim against the persons operating the club.", "41. Having obtained a building permit on 11 May 2002, in August 2003 the owner of the flat occupied by the computer club until March 2002 (see paragraph 12 above) started transforming it into an electronic games club. The works involved pulling down internal walls, installation of highvoltage cables and changing the flat\u2019s windows.", "42. On 29 August 2003 the Milevi sisters complained about that to the Sofia Regional Building Control Directorate, saying that no assent had been sought from them under section 38 of the 2001 Territorial Organisation Act (see paragraphs 50 and 51 below). On 29 September 2003 the Directorate replied that the works were lawful as they had been carried out under a permit.", "43. The Milevi sisters then complained to the National Building Control Directorate. On 2 December 2003 it instructed the Regional Directorate to check the lawfulness of the works. Apparently nothing ensued.", "44. In the meantime, on 13 October 2003, the Milevi sisters contested the building permit before the Sofia Regional Building Control Directorate. On 26 November 2003 the Directorate rejected the challenge as being out of time. On an appeal by the Milevi sisters, on 5 April 2004 the Sofia City Court set that decision aside and instructed the Directorate to examine the challenge on the merits. The Directorate appealed against that ruling, but on 26 October 2004 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld it.", "45. In the meantime, the Milevi sisters made numerous complaints about the conversion to both the building control authorities and the police, apparently to no avail.", "46. In 2002 a company rented the flat adjacent to the flat of the Milevi sisters and started using it as an office. The Milevi sisters asserted that after that they could hear telephones ringing and conversations, loud voices, moving of furniture and banging of doors.", "47. On 18 April 2002 the applicants complained to the municipality, stating that the company had not sought their assent for using the flat as an office, in breach of section 38(3) of the 2001 Territorial Organisation Act (see paragraph 50 below). On 17 June 2002 municipal inspectors visited the building and noted that the flat was being used as an office. However, the owner was not present and the inspectors were not allowed access to the premises to make more detailed findings. They sent a summary of their findings to the Sofia Regional Building Control Directorate.", "48. After repeated complaints by the Milevi sisters, on 15 November 2002 the Directorate instructed the municipality to gather more evidence that the flat was indeed being used as commercial premises entailing regular visits by outsiders. As a result, on 30 January 2003 the inspectors made a second visit. However, they were refused access to the flat and the police, who had been called in aid, did not show up.", "49. Apparently the office continued operating undisturbed throughout that period.", "50. Section 38(3) of the 2001 Territorial Organisation Act (\u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0430) provides that a flat in a condominium may be converted into an office, entailing visits by outsiders, if it is on the ground floor and if all sanitary, hygienic, fireprotection and technical requirements have been complied with. The conversion must be approved expressly, in writing and before a notary by all immediate neighbours of the premises whose conversion is proposed. Exceptionally, a flat on a higher floor may also be converted into an office, but in that case the conversion must be approved not only by the immediate neighbours but also by the condominium\u2019s general meeting.", "51. Section 38(4) provides that a flat on the ground floor of a condominium may be converted into a shop or other commercial premises, if all sanitary, hygienic, fireprotection and technical requirements have been complied with and if a separate entrance which does not affect the passageway to the residential part of the building is made possible. The conversion must be approved by the condominium\u2019s general meeting and requires the express written assent, certified by a notary, of all immediate neighbours of the premises whose conversion is proposed.", "52. Under section 149(1) and (2)(2), a permit allowing the reconstruction of an existing building must be brought to the attention of the persons whose approval is required under section 38. They may challenge it before the Regional Building Control Directorate (section 149(3)). Under section 156(1), as worded between January 2001 and July 2003, building permits could, as a rule, be revoked only before the works had started. They could be revoked after that only if they were contrary to the zoning plan, substantially deviated from the building regulations and norms as regards distances to neighbouring buildings, or substantially deviated from the applicable safety requirements (section 156(2), as in force between January 2001 and July 2003).", "53. Under section 178(1), as in force at the material time, it was prohibited to use a building or a part of it before the issuing of a use permit. If a building or a part of it was being used without such permit, the National Building Control Directorate had to ban the use and order that the building\u2019s electricity and water supplies and heating be cut off (section 178(5), as in force at the material time). Applications for judicial review of such decisions do not have suspensive effect (section 217(1)(3)). Since such decisions cannot be appealed against before a higher administrative authority, they are immediately enforceable. However, their enforcement may be suspended by the court (section 217(2)). Under section 219, as in force at the material time, the courts had to examine applications for judicial review of such decisions in special fasttrack proceedings under Articles 126b126e of the 1952 Code of Civil Procedure.", "54. Under section 222(2)(2) (now section 222(2)(4)), the National Building Control Directorate enforces decisions prohibiting the use of buildings or parts of them. In so doing, it may use technical devices and means (section 222(3)). If it encounters resistance, it may enlist the help of the police (section 222(5)).", "55. Section 50 of the 1951 Property Act (\u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0442\u0430) provides that the owner of a piece of immovable property cannot carry out actions which impede, in more than the usual way, the use of the neighbouring properties.", "56. Under section 45(1), the owner of a flat in a condominium may be evicted by resolution of the general meeting of the condominium if he or she, among other things, systematically breaches the internal regulations of the building or the resolutions of the general meeting for the internal order of the building, or acts contrary to good morals. However, the owner may request the district court to annul the resolution (section 46(1)). The eviction may take place only if the owner has not stopped the breach despite having been warned in writing that he or she will be evicted (section 45(2)). The district court may issue a writ of execution pursuant to the resolution, once it has become final (section 46(2)). According to a 1959 decision of the former Supreme Court, that does not preclude the owner from challenging his eviction in subsequent enforcement proceedings (\u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 4028 \u043e\u0442 23 \u043d\u043e\u0435\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 1959 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0440. \u0434. \u2116 5667/1959 \u0433., \u0412\u0421, I \u0433. \u043e.). There is no reported caselaw on the application of those provisions in recent decades. In May 1957 the former Supreme Court described that procedure as a means of last resort, to be used only where the owner persisted in his breach (\u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 1260 \u043e\u0442 9 \u043c\u0430\u0439 1957 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0440. \u0434. \u2116 3231/1957 \u0433., \u0412\u0421, IV \u0433. \u043e.).", "57. Under section 109(1), an owner may request the cessation of any \u201cunjustifiable activity\u201d which hinders him in the exercise of his rights.", "58. In an interpretative decision of 6 February 1985 (\u0442\u044a\u043b\u043a. \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 31 \u043e\u0442 6 \u0444\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0438 1985 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0440. \u0434. \u2116 10/1984 \u0433., \u041e\u0421\u0413\u041a \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0421) the former Supreme Court explained that this claim (actio negatoria) provided protection against unjustified interferences \u2013 whether direct or indirect \u2013 which prevented an owner from using fully his property. It can be used to declare such interferences unlawful and enjoin the persons concerned to stop them and remove their effects (for instance, demolish a building in a neighbouring property). Unlike decisions of the building control authorities, the courts\u2019 judgments pursuant to such claims finally determine the disputes between the aggrieved owner and the perpetrator of the interference, and may be executed by force.", "59. The claim may be brought by the owner against any person, irrespective of whether or not they are owners of an adjoining property (\u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 1544 \u043e\u0442 30 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 2002 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0440. \u0434. \u2116 18899/2001 \u0433., \u0412\u041a\u0421, IV \u0433. \u043e.). It may be brought by the owner of a flat in a condominium against the owner of another flat (\u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 1818 \u043e\u0442 13 \u043d\u043e\u0435\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 2002 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0440. \u0434. \u2116 2183/2001 \u0433., \u0412\u041a\u0421, \u0406V \u0433. \u043e.).
