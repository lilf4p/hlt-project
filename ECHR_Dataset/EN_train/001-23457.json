The applicants appealed against this decision.", "On 3 June 1989 the Mayor granted the building permit.

He found that the applicants had to stop the construction works and to demolish these parts of their cottage already built and to recultivate their plot of land within seven months.", "On 27 July 1993 the applicants appealed against this decision and stressed that the construction works had already been terminated in August 1989 and that the revocation of the building permit granted on 4 June 1989 had occurred only after the construction of their cottage.", "On 18 March 1999 the Municipal Council (Gemeinderat) modified the demolition order and found that the applicants had to demolish their cottage within five months.", "On 23 April 1999 the Steiermark Regional Government dismissed the applicants further appeal (Vorstellung) and found that the applicants\u2019 cottage had been constructed contrary to the applicable law, and that the order to declare the building permit null and void had been issued only three months after the building permit was wrongly granted.", "On 10 June 1999 the applicants lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court.", "On 11 October 1999 the Constitutional Court declined to deal with the complaint for lack of prospects of success and transferred the case to the Administrative Court.", "On 30 November 1999 the Administrative Court ordered the applicants to amend their complaint.
