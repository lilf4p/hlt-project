The name \u201cTartar\u201d applies to the peoples of Turkic origin who speak a language which belongs to the Ural-Altaic language family. Four-fifths of the Tartars (about 5.5 million people) live in the Russian Federation: the majority live in the Republic of Tatarstan and the Republic of Bashkortostan, and the rest are dispersed across the Ural Mountains and in the Volga region. The Tartars are Muslims.", "10. On 12 August 1994 the Simbirsk (Ulyanovsk) Regional Organisation of the People\u2019s Democratic Party Vatan (\u201cthe Regional Organisation\u201d) was registered with the Ulyanovsk Regional Department of Justice. Vatan claims that this was a branch of its party.", "11. On 12 October 1997 the Regional Organisation made an appeal (\u201cthe appeal\u201d) to the \u201cpeoples of the Volga region, to all oppressed peoples of the empire, to the Ulyanovsk Regional and City authorities, to historians, students of local lore, archaeologists and scientists\u201d, entitled \u201cPrevention and cancellation of the forthcoming witches\u2019 Sabbath arranged by reactionary forces \u2013 \u2018the war party\u2019- the so-called \u2018350th anniversary of the founding of the town of Simbirsk\u2019 which is in fact an approximate date of the colonisation of Shekhry Sember\u201d.", "12. The appeal contained, inter alia, the following statements:", "\u201cTo the indigenous population of the Volga Region: tartars, chuvash, erzya, moksha, mari, bashkir.", "1. Never allow desecration or mockery of the memory of your ancestors; do not allow the reactionary Nazi forces to celebrate the date of colonisation of Sember. Shekhry Sember is a thousand-year-old town of your glorious ancestors. In the town centre, on Simbirskaya Hill and in the outskirts lie their graves \u2013 do not allow them to be defiled. Be prepared for the anniversary of the colonisation of Shekhry Sember. On the ancestors\u2019 Memorial Day, 31 May 1998 at 9 a.m., all come out to our sacred Sember Hill \u2013 to the ancestors\u2019 graves \u2013 between the Memorial and Lenin square. A trip to the ancestors\u2019 graves and the ruins of the Shekhry Kalman will also be on offer and everyone who wishes will have an opportunity to turn to Islam. Let us stand up for the honour and dignity of our peoples. Let us celebrate the 1350th Anniversary of Shekhry Sember in a dignified manner, inshallah. Strive for decolonisation of the peoples who are prisoners of Moscow-Shaitan Kala, the Russian empire.", "2. Who knows how much loss, humiliation, suffering, deprivation and sacrifice our peoples have endured: racial discrimination, employment discrimination, the ban on education in our native language, forced service in the occupiers\u2019 army?", "3. Strive for legitimisation of indigenous languages. Strive for the holding of fair municipal elections on the basis of national communities. Strive for education for every child in the national language from primary level to higher education. Strive for satellite channels broadcasting from Kazan, Ufa, Cheboksary, Saransk, Yoshkar-Ola, Tashkent, Bishkek, Alma-Aty, Ankara, Istanbul, Teheran, Riyadh and Mecca.", "4.

Mr Goryachev, Mr Marusin and their subordinates,", "Do not fall under the influence of pseudo-historians, the \u201cwar party\u201d from Moscow, the local liberal democratic party, pseudo-scientists and Nazis. Stop the witches\u2019 Sabbath in celebration of the 350th anniversary of the colonisation of Simbirsk. Even the colonisation date is intentionally confusing. The real colonisation date is the end of May 1666 - 1999 is a good round figure of colonisation, i.e. 333 years. Do not stir up the Russian population against the indigenous peoples of the Volga Region \u2013 you will not succeed. God be with us, inshallah.", "2. Mr Goryachev, Mr Marusin and local governors,", "Stop wasting our regional budget on the creation of monuments to an apostate and traitor of his peoples, the converted Christian Tartar Bogdan Khitrovo ..., in accordance with the directions of the \u201cwar party\u201d in Moscow.

Mr Goryachev, have the courage to apologise on behalf of all your predecessors to the peoples of the Region for the centuries of humiliation, suffering, deprivation and sacrifices, since you are their successor. Someone must put an end to it.", "5. ... There is no point in hiding, and it is common knowledge that there are only 10 million Russians, with the remaining 130 million being Russian speakers who do not remember their ancestors and historical-ethnic origin. Deprivation of historical and ethnic roots, of memory and the motherland is the sad result of the violence imposed in order to create a mono-ethnic and monolingual empire.", "We, the peoples of the Volga region, were, are, and always will be, inshallah.", "Given his 30 years of experience in the national liberation movement, his courage, his knowledge of the region and his understanding of people, the Ulyanovsk Regional Branch of Vatan empowers Iskhan Nailbek Mikey to be at the head of the national liberation fight and to form a brigade of trustworthy, courageous, consecrated and resistant people.", "Let us shorten the arms of the \u201cwar party\u201d in Moscow! Free the empire\u2019s peoples! Decolonise Russia! Bring Islamic education in the national language to all children! These are the common slogans of all peoples - prisoners of Moscow.\u201d", "13. On 19 May 1998 the Regional Organisation asked the mayor of Ulyanovsk to authorise a ceremony dedicated to the 1350th anniversary of the founding of Sember.

On 13 July 1998 the Ulyanovsk Regional Court examined the prosecutor\u2019s claim.", "17. Firstly, the court considered various statements made by the Regional Organisation in the light of their conformity with the Constitution, in particular, the appeal of 12 October 1997 and noted that the Regional Organisation:", "- referred to the State institutions responsible for the public celebration of the 350th anniversary of Simbirsk as \u201cNazis\u201d;", "- called for \u201cdecolonisation of the peoples who are prisoners of Moscow\u2013Shaitan Kala, the Russian empire\u201d;", "- referred to the Russian Federation as \u201cthe enemy of humankind\u201d;", "- referred to Russian citizens as \u201cRussian speakers who do not remember their ancestors and historical-ethnic origin\u201d;", "- urged the authorities \u201cto stop the witches\u2019 Sabbath in celebration of the 350th anniversary of the colonisation of Simbirsk\u201d and \u201cto stop wasting [the] regional budget\u201d;", "- empowered the Regional Organisation\u2019s secretary, Mr Mikeyev, \u201cto be at the head of the national liberation fight and to form a brigade of trustworthy, courageous, consecrated and resistant people\u201d.", "18. The court also found that the Regional Organisation had called for recognition of the independence of the Republic of Chechnya and for a return by the peoples of the Volga region to Islam (conference minutes of 26 May 1996), and that it had called on the Sember peoples to join the Tartar Muslims in their national liberation fight (minutes of the Regional Organisation General Meeting of 12 October 1997). A reference was also made to the Annual Report of the Regional Organisation\u2019s activities, where the court found calls to \u201cdecolonise Russia\u201d, to form military forces \u201con the basis of religious confessions\u201d and to \u201cabolish the neo-imperialistic emblem depicting crosses and passports which gave no indication of ethnic origin\u201d.", "19. The court held that all of the above statements were incompatible with the Constitution. The court stated, inter alia, the following:", "\u201c...the Ulyanovsk Regional Organisation of the People\u2019s Democratic Party Vatan openly calls for violation of the integrity of Russia, for violent alteration of the foundations of constitutional governance and for the creation of an Islamic State in the Volga Region. The Regional Organisation proclaims the idea of a national liberation fight and calls for the formation of a brigade of trustworthy, courageous and resistant people. The activities and opinions of the Regional Organisation\u2019s leaders and members are of an extreme nationalist nature, inciting people to national and religious discord and denigrating the Russian speaking population and non-adherents of Islam.\u201d", "20. Secondly, the court found that the memorial ceremony of 31 May 1998 held by the Regional Organisation in the centre of Ulyanovsk was in breach of the mayor\u2019s permit.", "21. The court concluded that the activities of the Regional Organisation did not correspond to the purposes declared in its Charter and violated Section 16 of the Federal Law on Public Associations, which prohibits the establishment and activities of public associations whose aims and actions are directed at the violent alteration of the foundations of constitutional governance, violation of the integrity of the Russian Federation and the undermining of state security, the forming of armed units and incitement to social, racial, national and religious strife.

Ipso jure, the Regional Organisation was prohibited from holding meetings, demonstrations and other public actions, taking part in elections and disposing of its bank accounts other than for the payment of expenses incurred in the course of normal activities, payment of labour contracts, damages and fines.", "23. The Regional Organisation challenged the judgment of 13 July 1998 before the Supreme Court of Russia, contending that the Ulyanovsk Regional Court had misinterpreted the meaning of the appeal, which reflected the Tartars\u2019 history and that there had been no incitement to national or religious strife or anything which might insult the dignity of Russians. The Regional Organisation insisted that the ceremony of 31 May 1998 had been held at the site of the ancient Muslim cemetery.", "24. On 3 September 1998 the Supreme Court upheld the first instance judgment. An application for supervisory review was dismissed by the same court on 13 October 1998.", "25. On 12 January 2000 the Ulyanovsk Regional Court allowed a claim by the Department of Justice of the Ulyanovsk Regional Administration to dissolve the Regional Organisation on account of its failure to bring its Charter in compliance with new legislation.
