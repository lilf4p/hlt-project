In 1981 (according to the applicant) or in 1985 (according to the applicant\u2019s neighbour) the applicant\u2019s neighbour fitted bars to his balcony in such a way that they could serve as a ladder to the applicant\u2019s apartment on the first floor, and subsequently, in 1994, he adapted part of the staircase as a cellar by constructing a wall, allegedly without the required permit.", "7. On 27 June 1994 the applicant informed the competent administrative authority about the construction works and requested that his neighbour be ordered to dismantle the bars and the wall on the staircase.", "8. On 28 February 1995, following numerous letters from the applicant seeking to accelerate the proceedings, the Otwock District Office (Urz\u0105d Rejonowy) ordered the applicant\u2019s neighbour to carry out some reconstruction works on the bars. It did not refer to the wall on the staircase.", "9. On an unspecified date the applicant appealed to the Warsaw Governor (Wojewoda).", "10. The Warsaw Governor did not give a decision within the statutory fourteen-day time-limit. Therefore, on 12 March 1995, the applicant complained to the Chief Building Inspectorate (G\u0142\u00f3wny Urz\u0105d Nadzoru Budowlanego).", "11. On 18 July 1995 the Chief Building Inspector allowed the complaint and ordered the Governor to give a decision within fourteen days.", "12.

Apparently the Supreme Administrative Court scheduled another hearing to deal with a second part of the applicant\u2019s complaint, concerning the wall constructed on his staircase.", "16. On 4 June 1997 the Supreme Administrative Court gave another judgment and ordered the Otwock District Office to give a decision in the matter of the wall constructed by the applicant\u2019s neighbour, within one month of the date of delivery of the judgment.", "17. From the day on which the Supreme Administrative Court gave its second judgment, the administrative proceedings were split into two separate sets of proceedings.", "18. On 6 November 1997 the Otwock District Office ordered that expert opinions concerning fire regulations be obtained and imposed on the applicant\u2019s neighbour an obligation to produce, within three months, a new specification for the installation of the bars on his balcony.", "19. The applicant\u2019s neighbour failed to comply with the abovementioned order and, on 10 June 1998, the Otwock District Office sent him a reminder, set an additional three-week time-limit to carry out the necessary works and informed him that failure to comply with the order within the new time-limit would result in compulsory demolition of the bars.", "20.

However, the court, finding that the decision following the applicant\u2019s appeal had just been given by the Mazowsze Regional Inspector of Construction Supervision, discontinued the proceedings and refused to impose a fine on the authority for delay.", "26. On 9 October 2002 the Mazowsze Regional Inspector of Construction Supervision quashed the Otwock District Office\u2019s decision of 16 September 1998 and discontinued the proceedings, finding that the challenged decision had been founded on a wrong legal basis.", "27. On 9 November 2002 the applicant appealed.", "28. On 25 June 2004 the Warsaw Regional Administrative Court quashed the challenged decision, which meant that the decision ordering demolition of the bars remained in force.", "29.

He failed to do so within the prescribed time-limit and consequently on 7 February 2005, the Warsaw Regional Administrative Court dismissed his appeal.", "33. On 6 January 2005 the Chief Inspector of Construction Supervision found the applicant\u2019s complaint of inactivity ill-founded and informed the applicant that the competent authority to enforce the final judgment and order demolition of the bars was the Otwock Local Inspector of Construction Supervision (Powiatowy Inspektor Nadzoru Budowlanego).", "34. On 12 July 2008 the applicant informed the Registry that the bars had been dismantled in 2005.", "35. On 29 September 1997, relying on the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s judgment of 4 June 1997, the Otwock District Office discontinued the proceedings in respect of the wall constructed on the applicant\u2019s staircase, finding that, at the relevant time, no building permit for such a wall had been necessary.", "36.
