The present applications, concerning the living conditions of Romanian citizens of Roma origin living in the village of H\u0103d\u0103reni, Mure\u015f County, follow two other applications that have been joined (nos. 41138/98 and 64320/01). The said applications were lodged with the Court on 14 April 1997 and 9 May 2000 respectively, by twenty-five Romanian nationals of Roma origin living in the above-mentioned village, as a consequence of the inter-ethnic violent events of 20 September 1993 which led to the killing of three people of Roma origin and the burning of eighteen Roma houses.", "2. The two applications mentioned above have resulted in a friendly settlement agreement (see Moldovan and Others v. Romania (no 1) (friendly settlement), 5 July 2005), concerning eighteen of the twenty-five original applicants and in a judgment on the merits concerning the remaining seven applicants (see Moldovan and Others v. Romania (no 2), 12 July 2005, ECHR 2005-VII) where the Court found a violation, inter alia, of Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention in respect of the applicants\u2019 living conditions.", "3. The applicants in the present cases, some of them also parties to the proceedings in the cases of Moldovan and Others v. Romania (no 1 and 2), cited above, are eighty-six Romanian nationals of Roma origin. They all used to live in the village of H\u0103d\u0103reni, Mures County. Since the events of September 1993 some applicants have returned to H\u0103d\u0103reni, while others have been living in various parts of the country. Mr D\u0103nu\u0163 Moldovan, Ms Florina L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f, Mr Ionel-Dafin L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f, Ms Eleonora Rosta\u015f, Mr Nicolae-Florin Moldovan and Ms Maria Moldovan are currently living in Spain; Mr Petric\u0103-Florin L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f, Mr Ovidiu-Stelian L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f and Mr Tarzan-Ferdinand Rosta\u015f are living in Switzerland; Ms Elena Moldovan, Mr Cosmin-Florin L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f and Mr Bazil Moldovan are living in France; Ms Mariana Moldovan is living in Italy; while Ms Lenuca-Petru\u0163a Moldovan is living in Germany.", "4. The name and year of birth of each applicant, the date of the lodging of each application and the blood relationships between the applicants are described in the attached table (see annex below).", "5. On 25 February 2009 the applicants, who originally either had no representation or were represented by some of the other applicants, sent powers of attorney authorising Mr Ovidiu-Lauren\u0163iu Podaru to represent them before the Court.", "6. Consequently, all applicants in all the applications are currently represented before the Court by Mr Ovidiu-Lauren\u0163iu Podaru, a lawyer practising in Cluj-Napoca. The Romanian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) are represented by their Agent, Mr R\u0103zvanHora\u0163iu Radu, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.", "7. The present cases originate in the events which took place in 1993 in the village of H\u0103d\u0103reni and which are summarised in the judgments of Moldovan and Others, (no 1 and 2), cited above. In so far as they concern the current applicants they may be summarised as follows.", "8. The applicants are mainly the children, the grandchildren, the nephews and the nieces of the twenty-five original applicants, victims of the events of 20 September 1993. Many of them were minors at the time of the events and were living with their relatives.", "9. In the aftermath of the events they were forced to live in hen-houses, stables, pigsties, windowless cellars or in cold and inappropriate conditions (sleeping on concrete and muddy floors, in crowded conditions or in outhouse kitchens without a proper roof or windows) together with their families. Those conditions lasted for several years and in some cases they have not been fully remedied to date.", "10. Many applicants consider that as a result they fell ill and developed a number of medical conditions, in particular heart conditions resulting in heart attacks, meningitis and diabetes. Some of them have now also developed mental disabilities. Although they all had access over the years to treatment provided by the national health care system, their limited financial resources and the alleged discriminatory treatment they were faced with in the hospitals and medical private practices prevented them from curing their illnesses.", "11. Only some of the applicants have been party to the domestic proceedings. They include, among others, Maria \u201cRaria\u201d Rosta\u015f (Moldovan), Tiberiu Moldovan, Bazil Moldovan, Gabriela Moldovan, Mariana Moldovan and her brothers Octavian Rosta\u015f, Petru-Doru L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f and Tarzan-Ferdinand Rosta\u015f (the last four applicants as heirs of their mother Rozalia Rosta\u015f). However, none of the said applicants appealed the judgment delivered by the first-instance court during the course of the civil proceedings brought against the third parties convicted for the destruction of their homes.", "12. The applicants, who were minors at that time and were legally represented by their parents or grandparents, were not included as parties to these proceedings. They consider, however, that the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office had an obligation under Article 45 of the Romanian Code of Civil Procedure, taken in conjunction with Article 173 of the Romanian Code of Criminal Procedure, to represent their best interests and to introduce them as parties to the proceedings.", "1) The facts of each application, partly in dispute by the parties, can be summarised as follows:", "13. The applicants declared that they had fled the village after they had witnessed the burning and destruction of Iulius Moldovan and Maria \u201cRaria\u201d Rosta\u015f\u2019 houses. They sought refuge in the forest, in the fields, in the neighbouring villages and with relatives. When they attempted to return to the village they were met by an angry mob and chased by the police, who fired on them. They declare that their houses were burned down or destroyed by the mob, together with their belongings. Consequently, they were forced to sleep outdoors for various periods of time with no food or clothing. In the aftermath of the events, they were forced to live in pigsties for years with no furniture and some of them, like Costic\u0103 Moldovan, were beaten by the police. C\u0103lina Rosta\u015f, Nadia Moldovan and Virgil-Sorin Moldovan declared that as a result of the living conditions they became physically or mentally ill. In his letter of 19 August 2008 Costic\u0103 Moldovan informed the Court that he was not party to the civil proceedings before the domestic courts. He argued that the civil proceedings depended on the outcome of the criminal proceedings, and the latter had been rejected for political reasons. Consequently, he did not have the opportunity to lodge his complaints before the domestic courts. Lenu\u0163a and Claudiu Rosta\u015f declared that only one room of their parental home had been renovated with Governmental funds. Radu-Mihai Rosta\u015f considers that he was never able to graduate from school because he was allegedly discriminated against by his colleagues.", "14. The Government submitted that Costic\u0103 and Loredana Moldovan continued to live in H\u0103d\u0103reni and that Loredana had completed the fifth grade at school. Social welfare visits conducted at Loredana\u2019s home in 2001 showed that her family was living in a two-room house with gas and electricity supply. According to a letter of 11 June 2009 from the Mure\u015f Social and Child Protection Agency (the Child Protection Agency), between 4 April 2001 and 30 April 2002 Loredana was registered as suffering from a medium degree of learning disability. Radu-Cristureanu Rosta\u015f was living with his parents in 1993 and their home was not affected by the events. With the exception of Claudiu Rosta\u015f, who lives in Petro\u015fani and has completed the fourth grade at school, Lenu\u0163a, Cosmin-Sebastian and RaduMihai Rosta\u015f live at no 77 H\u0103d\u0103reni and have completed the fifth, seventh and second grades at school, respectively. Their parents\u2019 home was rebuilt with Government funds. Both Nadia and Virgil-Sorin Moldovan have completed the third grade at school.", "15. The applicant declared that on 20 September 1993 part of her house and all her belongings were destroyed by the mob, leaving her and her children without shelter. In the aftermath of the events her children became ill because of the inhuman conditions they were forced to live in. She was party to the domestic proceedings and was awarded damages of 240,000 lei (ROL) for the partial destruction of her house by a judgment of 12 May 2003 of the Mure\u015f County Court. She did not appeal against the judgment. 16. The Government submitted that the applicant was living at no. 157 H\u0103d\u0103reni at the time of the events. The Mure\u015f County Court awarded the applicant six euros (EUR) in damages, on the ground that according to the expert report available in the file only the windows of the applicant\u2019s house had been broken as a result of the events. Moreover, according to the said judgment, the applicant declared before the domestic courts that only the windows of her house, four earrings, four icons, a lamp, an armchair and a bed had been destroyed as a result of the events. This contradicts her statement before the Court, where she declared that her house was burned down together with many of her belongings.", "17. The applicant declared that in September 1993 she was forced to abandon her home, together with her daughter, her mother, her partner and her siblings. She declares that both she and her daughter have mental health problems as a consequence of the events, and her belongings were destroyed when her mother\u2019s house was set on fire.", "18. The Government submitted that at the time of the events the applicant was living at no. 152 H\u0103d\u0103reni, where she continues to reside to date. She had always had access to adequate medical assistance provided by the general practitioner she was registered with and by the H\u0103d\u0103reni medical assistance services.", "19. The applicant declared that at the time of the events he was serving in the army. In November 1993 he returned to the village and he was threatened and hit with stones thrown by some of the villagers. They followed him to his mother\u2019s house, where they continued throwing stones, which damaged the windows and the roof of the house. Following the incident, the applicant spent the rest of his leave at his sister\u2019s house (Alexandrina Rosta\u015f \u2013 application no. 13129/04) located in another village. Because he was afraid for his and his family\u2019s safety, he would return to the village of H\u0103d\u0103reni only at night. Since 2003 the applicant has been living in Spain.", "20. The Government submitted that the applicant was not present in the village at the time of the events. At the time of the events his official residence was at no. 76 H\u0103d\u0103reni. However, he has been living in Spain since 2003.", "21. The applicant declared that at the time of the events she was visiting her relative, Menelu\u0163a Moldovan, and was alone in her relative\u2019s house together with her relative\u2019s three minor children when she was alerted by her mother, Maria Moldovan, that an angry mob had started burning Roma houses in the village. She gathered her relatives and took them all to her house in the village of Che\u0163ani. The applicant believes that both she and her family were affected by the events, in so far as the police stopped seventeen non-Roma individuals from setting fire to the applicant\u2019s home located at Che\u0163ani no. 3. Moreover, she could sell her house in Che\u0163ani village only for a very low price.", "22. The Government submitted that the applicant was living at no. 3 Che\u0163ani at the time of the events. From 2002 the applicant was registered as living in Ludu\u015f and she had never lived in H\u0103d\u0103reni.", "23. The applicants alleged that their house and belongings had been destroyed by the angry mob. In the aftermath of the events, they had had to live for days in stables with no food, electricity or heating. Later on they had sought shelter with family and friends. They declared that as a result of the stress they were subjected to they had become mentally and physically ill. They are allegedly suffering from various degrees of handicap, diabetes and other ailments they have developed as a result of the events, such as loss of hair in Florina L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f\u2019 case. Ancu\u0163a-Lucre\u0163ia, Petru\u0163a-Maria and Iuliu L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f consider that the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office failed to discharge its legal obligation to protect the interests of the minor children and to introduce them as parties to the proceedings. Rada-Didina Moldovan, Petru\u0163a-Maria L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f, Iuliu L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f and Petru-Valentin L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f declare that they were discriminated against at school and Florina L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f stated that she is currently living on a rubbish dump in Spain. In her letter of 29 July 2008 Maria-Gherghina L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f informed the Court that she was one of the original twenty-five applicants and that she was awarded EUR 13,000 as a result of the friendly settlement agreement.", "24. The Government submitted that at the time of the events the applicants were living at no. 114 H\u0103d\u0103reni. With the exception of RadaDidina Moldovan and Florina L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f, all of them continue to live at the same address. Social welfare visits conducted at the applicants\u2019 home in 2004, 2005 and 2007 showed that the house of the L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f family had electricity and gas, three rooms, a bathroom and a kitchen and the family\u2019s income consisted of Petru \u201cGruia\u201d L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f\u2019 pension and the child allowance awarded by the State for the upbringing of minor children. At the same time Ancu\u0163a-Lucre\u0163ia L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f was living in a house consisting of a room and a kitchen equipped with gas and electricity and located in the same courtyard as her parents\u2019 house, and her income consisted of an allowance for her son. Petru\u0163a-Maria L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f had completed the eighth grade at school in 1998. On 17 January 2007, 9 April 2008, and 21 and 22 January 2009 Iuliu, MariaGherghina, Petru-Valentin and Ancu\u0163a-Lucre\u0163ia L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f were diagnosed with various degrees of mental disability which they had had since 1976 and 1984. However, they had always had access to adequate medical assistance provided by the general practitioners they are registered with and by the H\u0103d\u0103reni medical assistance services.", "25. The applicants alleged that in September 1993 they witnessed the destruction of their house and belongings. They were forced to abandon their house, and sought refuge in a neighbouring village, where they remained for weeks with no food or clothes and slept in the fields. Tiberiu Moldovan declares that he was awarded ROL 1,300,000 in pecuniary damages for the destruction of his house by the Mure\u015f County Court judgment of 12 May 2003. However, he did not appeal against the judgment on the ground that he had left to work abroad and no one was at home to notify him. The judgment has not been enforced to date, although on 25 August 2003 the applicant was informed by the enforcement officer\u2019s office that the judgment had become enforceable and the applicant needed to pay the enforcement fees. They also declare that they had had to borrow money from third parties in order to restore one room of their house and repair their belongings. Moreover, they had developed health problems as a result of the events and the overcrowded living conditions. In a letter of 10 January 2010 Tiberiu Moldovan informed the Court that Petric\u0103-Cidu Moldovan had died by drowning and that he would like to continue his application.", "26. The Government submitted that Tiberiu Moldovan, \u0162i\u0163o Rosta\u015f, Petric\u0103-Cidu Moldovan, Maria-Gabi Moldovan, Dolfi Rosta\u015f and OlgaMirela Moldovan were living at no. 41 H\u0103d\u0103reni at the time of the events and they continue to live there. They had always had access to adequate medical assistance provided by the general practitioner they are registered with and by the H\u0103d\u0103reni medical assistance services. Lidia-Sonia Moldovan, Florin Rosta\u015f and Cr\u00ee\u015fmaru Moldovan were not living in H\u0103d\u0103reni at the time of the events. Between 1981 and 2005 the official legal residence of Lidia-Sonia Moldovan was no. 15 Cuiesd and starting from 2005 no. 32 Crizantemelor Street, Sighi\u015foara.

Currently Olga-Mirela Moldovan lives in the village of R\u0103useni.", "27. The applicant declared that on 20 September 1993 he was living with his grandmother, whose house was burned down. He allegedly had to live in inhuman conditions for months, was forced to sleep in a pigsty in December, was refused treatment for his illnesses by the doctor, was beaten up by the police and was discriminated against at school. Consequently, he was forced to leave Romania for Spain. He declared that he had become ill as a result of the conditions he was forced to live in for years, and had had to undergo surgery.

The applicants declared that their house and belongings had been burned down or destroyed. They all had to leave the village with no clothes or food. The police refused to help them during the events and they declared that their house had not been rebuilt to date because they did not have title to the house or the land it was built on. Consequently they were all forced to live for four years in a damp cellar. Moreover, they continue to live in overcrowded conditions in another village, sharing two rooms with eight other people. They all suffer from various physical and mental health problems because of the dampness and the cold they were exposed to for several years. The children were discriminated against at school and could not attend school any more.

They were allowed to return to the village only in April 1994, but continued to be discriminated against both at school and on the labour market. They consider that the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office had failed to discharge its legal obligation to protect the interests of the minor children and introduce them as parties to the proceedings.

She was discriminated against at school even though she had successfully completed eight grades and had enrolled in a technical college in C\u00e2mpia-Turzii. Here she continued to be subject to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. She is currently working in Spain to support her family.

The Government submitted that Simona-Cerasela L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f\u2019 husband was killed on 14 October 1993 by three other Roma citizens (Bazil-Sami, Adrian and Bazil Moldovan) with no causal link between his death and the events of 20 September 1993. The applicants were living, and still live, at no. 111 M\u0103rtine\u015fti.", "41. The applicant alleges that following the events in September 1993 he became mentally ill. He declares that he was saved from the flames which burned down his parents\u2019 house by his grandparents. His belongings were destroyed by the fire and his parental home has not been rebuilt to date. He was discriminated against at school and therefore completed only five grades. He considers that the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office failed to discharge its legal obligation to protect the interests of the minor children and introduce him as party to the proceedings. He is currently living in France.", "42. The Government submitted that the applicant was living with his grandmother at no. 1 H\u0103d\u0103reni at the time of the events. The applicant attended school in the village until 2005. He is currently enrolled in sixth grade but he abandoned school. He continues to live with his grandmother, who is also raising him. On 12 July 1996 the Commission for the Protection of Minor Children working within the Mure\u015f County Council (the Child Protection Commission) decided to entrust the applicant to his grandparents on account of his family situation (his father was in prison and his mother had abandoned him), following a social enquiry which examined the living conditions of his grandmother and assessed whether he could be entrusted to her for upbringing. From 1996 he was monitored by the relevant local authorities and offered assistance relevant to his needs. On 4 April 2001 the Medical Commission for Children with Mental Disabilities diagnosed the applicant with \u201cminor mental disability and behavioural problems\u201d and acknowledged that the applicant has a third-degree mental disability. He has always had access to adequate medical assistance provided by the general practitioner he is registered with and by the H\u0103d\u0103reni medical assistance services.

His medical file of 19 July 2007 states that the applicant\u2019s condition was present at his birth.", "43. The applicants allege that their parents\u2019 house was burned down in September 1993 and has not yet been rebuilt. Their family sought refuge at their grandparents\u2019 house, but that house was also burned down. They left the village and hid in the woods for three days with no food or clothes.

Until 29 June 2006 the applicant was granted a special allowance because she had been entrusted to her grandparents to be brought up. From that date the allowance was discontinued by the Child Protection Commission on the ground that the applicant\u2019s father had been released from prison and he was living with her and her grandparents. Starting from 1996 the applicant\u2019s situation was periodically examined by the local social services and followed up by social enquiries, reports and psychosocial investigations, which did not recommend that the applicant be enrolled in a social protection programme.

He also declared that he had been discriminated against and was unable to find a job. Consequently, he left Romania and is currently living in France on a rubbish dump.", "64. The Government submitted that the applicant was in prison for murder at the time of the events and did not own a house. Currently he lives at no. 2 H\u0103d\u0103reni.

Moreover, the roof had to be improvised out of nylon and other materials that offered extremely poor insulation. She further declared that she could not send her children to school because of their living conditions. Consequently, her children left Romania and are currently living abroad on rubbish dumps. Moreover, she was a civil party to the domestic proceedings of 12 January 2001, but failed to appeal against the said judgment.", "66. The Government submitted that the applicant was living in her parents\u2019 house at the time of the events. Currently she lives at no. 227A H\u0103d\u0103reni.

On 19 May 2009, according to the NAR, some more work needed to be done on the applicant\u2019s parents\u2019 house: repairs to all the ceilings in the house, the roof and the replacement of three or four windows.", "67. The applicants alleged that following the events of 20 September 1993 they were discriminated against at school. Their parents\u2019 home was totally destroyed. For half a year they were forced to live in a field in a hut made of clay. Afterwards they moved into a house with broken windows and a missing roof and were forced to sleep on the floor for three years. Mariana Moldovan declared that she was forced to go to Italy to work in deplorable conditions in order to be able to support her family, while Tarzan-Ferdinand Rosta\u015f left for Switzerland. By a judgment of 12 May 2003 Mure\u015f County Court awarded the applicants jointly ROL 10,000,000 in compensation for the partial destruction of their home.

Moreover, Mariana Moldovan herself has the same heart condition. The parental home has not been rebuilt to date. Tarzan-Ferdinand Rosta\u015f considered that the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office failed to discharge its legal obligation to protect the interests of the minor children and to introduce him as a party to the proceedings.", "68. The Government submitted that the applicants\u2019 house had not been affected by the events. At the time they were all living at no. 49 H\u0103d\u0103reni.

He declares that he currently lives in a single room next to a stable and has been living there for the last eighteen years. As a result, he and his children have developed a number of medical conditions and he even had to undergo surgery as a result of the stable flies which invade his room regularly.

In relation to all thirty applications, all applicants consider the statements made by the Government in respect of some of them in order to prove they were not living in the village at the time of the events partial and misleading. In particular, this is because the Government relies mainly on the information provided in the applicants\u2019 identity cards, which may not be entirely accurate, taking into consideration the lack of adequate identity and property papers available for Roma people.", "74. The applicants also contest the Government\u2019s allegations that some of their houses have not been affected by the conflict. They claim that all the houses have been affected.", "75. On 12 January 2001, following the discontinuance of the criminal investigation against the police officers involved in the incident and the criminal conviction and sentencing of twelve civilians, the Mure\u015f Regional Court delivered its judgment in the civil case. The court noted that the victims had claimed compensation for pecuniary damage resulting from the destruction of the houses and their contents (furniture and so on), as well as compensation for non-pecuniary damage. The court further noted that, during the events of 20 September 1993, eighteen houses belonging to the Roma population in H\u0103d\u0103reni had been totally or partially destroyed and three Roma had been killed, a criminal court having found twelve villagers guilty of these acts. Basing its decision on an expert report, the court awarded compensation for pecuniary damage for those houses which had not been rebuilt in the meantime, and maintenance allowances for the children of the Roma killed during the riots. On the basis of an expert report, the court awarded compensation for pecuniary damage in respect of the partial or total destruction of the houses of six Roma. The court rejected the other applicants\u2019 request for compensation for pecuniary damage in respect of the rebuilt houses, finding, on the basis of the same expert report, that their value was either the same as or higher than the original buildings. It further refused all applicants, including Bazil and Gabriela Moldovan (applications nos. 34568/07 and 48126/07), damages in respect of belongings and furniture, on the ground that they had not submitted documents to confirm the value of their assets.", "76. The court finally rejected all the applicants\u2019 claims in respect of non-pecuniary damage on the ground that they had not been substantiated, and that the crimes committed were not of a nature to produce such damage.", "77. The court ordered the villagers convicted in the criminal trial to pay the damages awarded.", "78. Relying on some procedural errors in the Mure\u015f County Court\u2019s judgment, some of the applicants, with the exception in particular of Bazil and Gabriela Moldovan (applications nos. 34568/07 and 48126/07), lodged an appeal with the Mure\u015f Court of Appeal.", "79. On 17 October 2001 the Mure\u015f Court of Appeal found that a number of procedural errors had occurred during the public hearings on the merits before the Mure\u015f County Court: the hearings had been held in the absence of the accused and their lawyers; one of the applicants had not been summoned; the public prosecutor had not been given leave to address the court and a number of expert reports ordered by the court had not been completed. The Court of Appeal quashed the judgment of 12 January 2001 and ordered a new trial of the case.", "80. In the second procedural cycle, the Mure\u015f County Court delivered its judgment in the civil case on 12 May 2003. Basing its decision on an expert report drafted in 1999 and updated in 2003, the court ordered the civilians found guilty by the criminal court in respect of the destruction of the applicants\u2019 houses to pay damages to some of the applicants for the destruction of their homes, including the following:", "(a) Maria \u201cRaria\u201d Rosta\u015f who was awarded EUR 6;", "(b) Tiberiu Moldovan who was awarded EUR 35;", "(c) Mariana Moldovan, Octavian Rosta\u015f, Petru-Doru L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f and Tarzan-Ferdinand L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f (as heirs of Rozalia Rosta\u015f) who were awarded jointly EUR 287.", "81. The courts also ordered that the amounts be revised to take account of any devaluation in the national currency:", "82. However, the court rejected all the applicants\u2019 claims in respect of non-pecuniary damage, on the ground that they were not substantiated.", "83. None of the above-mentioned applicants appealed against the Mure\u015f County Court judgment of 12 May 2003.", "84.

Following the conclusion of the domestic civil proceedings and of the proceedings before the Court in respect of the twenty-five original applicants, an enforcement file was opened with the Enforcement Officers\u2019 Office for a number of applicants, including Tiberiu Moldovan.", "86. The applicant Tiberiu Moldovan was informed by the Enforcement Officers\u2019 Office that the judgment had become enforceable and the applicant needed to pay the enforcement fees.", "87. The villagers contested the enforcement proceedings of the said judgments and asked for the temporary suspension of the enforcement proceedings until their action seeking to contest the enforcement of the domestic judgments was examined by the domestic courts.", "88. By a final President\u2019s Order of 2 September 2005 the Ludu\u015f District Court allowed the villagers action, against, inter alia, Tiberiu Moldovan, seeking the suspension of the enforcement of the judgments delivered by the domestic civil courts. The court grounded its judgment on the potential damage that might be suffered by the third parties in the event the domestic judgments were enforced without first waiting for the outcome of the contestation of the enforcement procedure. Consequently, the court temporarily suspended the enforcement proceedings while the proceedings contesting the enforcement were still pending before the domestic courts.", "89. By a final judgment of 19 January 2007 the Mure\u015f County Court allowed in part the third parties\u2019 action contesting the enforcement of the domestic judgments awarding the individuals of Roma origin civil damages following the events of 20 September 1993, on the ground that the said damages had been incorporated into the sums awarded by the European Court of Human Rights as just satisfaction or as part of the friendly settlement agreements accepted by the applicants following the Moldovan and Others judgments, cites above. The applicant Tiberiu Moldovan was not party to the proceedings, which ended on 19 January 2007, and therefore the said judgment is not applicable to him.", "90. In a letter of 15 May 2009 addressed to the Government the Enforcement Officers\u2019 Office stated that except for Petru L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f no other enforcement requests had been lodged by any of the creditors, Tiberiu Moldovan in particular, in the enforcement file no. 66 of 2003 concerning the domestic judgments. Moreover, even in Petru L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f\u2019 case he withdrew his request and was reimbursed the enforcement fee he had already paid.", "91. The Enforcement Officers\u2019 Office also stated that according to Article 399 of the Romanian Code of Civil Procedure and Article 53 of Law No. 188 of 2000 any of the creditors could have brought proceedings before domestic courts against any bailiff refusing to perform his or her duties concerning any act of enforcement. However, no such proceedings were lodged by any of the applicants.", "92. The judgment of 12 May 2003 remains unenforced to date.", "93. By decision no. 636 of 19 November 1993, the Romanian government allocated ROL 25,000,000 for the reconstruction of the houses destroyed by fire on 20 September 1993. The government decided, moreover, that this amount could also be used as financial assistance for the families affected in order to help them replace items which were strictly necessary and had been destroyed during the fire. However, only four houses were rebuilt with this money and none of the families received financial assistance.", "94. By a government decision of 30 November 1993, a commission for the coordination of the reconstruction of the houses was created. Members of this commission included the mayor of Che\u0163ani and his deputy.", "95. In a letter of 30 June 1994 addressed to the government, the Prefect of Mure\u015f indicated that an additional amount of ROL 53,000,000 was needed to rebuild the remaining ten houses.", "96.

Concerning the remaining six houses, he reported that three of them posed \u201cspecial problems\u201d: in particular, one of the houses to be rebuilt was on land near the family of the non-Rom victim (Che\u0163an Cr\u0103ciun), who refused to have Gypsy families living close by. Another problem mentioned by the mayor was the house of the late mother of two of the Roma who had died during the 1993 events. It appeared that after the events the L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f family had moved to the city of Ludu\u015f, so the mayor had proposed that a house be built for them at a place of their choice.", "98.

The money was used to build twelve kilometres of paved roads, to rehabilitate six houses, to install a heating system for the school and to partially refurbish the school and the local activities centre.", "103. Between September 2006 and December 2007 a number of awareness raising campaigns, workshops and training sessions were organised with the involvement of the local Roma community, the authorities, the media and the police force.
