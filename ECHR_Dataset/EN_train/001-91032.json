CROATIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis;Dean Spielmann;George Nicolaou;Giorgio Malinverni;Khanlar Hajiyev;Sverre Erik Jebens", "TEXT": ["The applicant, Mr Miljenko Kova\u010d, is a Croatian national who was born in 1938 and lives in Bjelovar. He was represented before the Court by Mr H. Kova\u010d, an advocate practising in Bjelovar. The Croatian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mrs \u0160. Sta\u017enik.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "The applicant was a shareholder of the Croatia banka d.d., a joint-stock company incorporated under Croatian law with its registered office in Zagreb (\u201cthe bank\u201d). The bank was entirely owned by private individuals and companies.", "On 23 February 1999 the Croatian National Bank (Hrvatska narodna banka \u2013 \u201cthe CNB\u201d) adopted a decision appointing a temporary administrator to the bank. Under section 84(2) of the Banks Act, from the date of service of such decision, all powers of the management board, the supervisory board and the shareholders\u2019 general meeting were transferred to the temporary administrator. Subsequently, on 23 August 1999 the CNB extended the temporary administrator\u2019s term of office for a further two months.", "Meanwhile, on 18 June 1999 the CNB had proposed to the Government that the process of recovery and restructuring of the bank be commenced, as provided for by the domestic legislation.", "In accordance with that proposal, on 23 September 1999 the Government adopted the Decision on Recovery and Restructuring of the Croatia banka d.d. (\u201cthe Decision\u201d). From that date, all shares held by the bank\u2019s shareholders were revoked and cancelled. Following the process of recovery, the bank was to issue new shares, all in the name of the State Agency for Securing Savings Deposits and Recovery of Banks (Dr\u017eavna agencija za osiguranja \u0161tednih uloga i sanaciju banaka).", "In 1999 and 2000 five shareholders of the bank, but not the applicant, filed four separate petitions for review of the constitutionality and legality (prijedlog za ocjenu ustavnosti i zakonitosti) of the Government\u2019s Decision of 23 September 1999. They complained that the Decision violated their constitutional rights as shareholders of the bank. They also claimed that the bank had been in good standing and that the Decision had therefore been unnecessary.", "On 30 January 2003 the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) discontinued the proceedings because the statute on which the Decision was based had in the meantime been repealed.", "On 20 November 2001 the applicant brought a civil action for unjust enrichment (or enrichment without cause) in the Bjelovar Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Bjelovaru) against the bank, seeking repayment of 37,200 Croatian kunas (HRK). He relied on section 210(3) of the Civil Obligations Act. The applicant explained that on 28 November 1997 he had bought 186 of the bank\u2019s ordinary shares for the above amount. However, on the basis of the Government\u2019s Decision of 23 September 1999 he had been deprived of those shares. He argued that the Decision had actually annulled the contract under which the bank had sold him its shares. That contract, being the cause on the basis of which he had paid HRK 37,200 to the bank, had thus ceased to exist. It followed that the bank had enriched itself without cause, or more precisely, on the basis of a cause which had subsequently ceased to exist, and had therefore been bound to return to him the sum in question.", "On 12 February 2002 the Municipal Court dismissed his action. It rejected the applicant\u2019s argument that the Government\u2019s Decision of 23 September 1999 had annulled the contract under which he had acquired the bank\u2019s shares. Consequently, the court found that the cause on the basis of which he had paid HRK 37,200 to the bank had not ceased to exist and that the bank had not been bound to return the sum demanded.", "Following an appeal by the applicant, on 27 May 2002 the Bjelovar County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Bjelovaru) quashed the first-instance judgment on account of incomplete facts and remitted the case. It also instructed the lower court to verify whether the contract under which the applicant had bought the shares could be rescinded under section 133 of the Civil Obligations Act on account of the fundamental change in circumstances, having regard to the Government\u2019s Decision of 23 September 1999.", "In the resumed proceedings, on 19 November 2002 the Bjelovar Municipal Court ruled for the applicant, finding that the bank had indeed enriched itself without cause. The court again did not accept the applicant\u2019s argument that the contract of sale on the basis of which he had bought the bank\u2019s shares had been annulled by the Government\u2019s Decision of 23 September 1999. It however held that, because of that Decision, the contract had lost one of the essential elements for the validity of every contract, namely its consideration, defined as the economic purpose of a transaction. Relying on section 52 of the Civil Obligations Act, the court further found that, owing to the absence of consideration, the contract was null and void. Accordingly, the nullity of the contract had resulted in the disappearance of the cause on the basis of which the applicant had paid the bank the sum sought and the bank had been obliged to return that sum to him.", "Following an appeal by the respondent, on 27 February 2003 the Bjelovar County Court reversed the first-instance judgment and dismissed the applicant\u2019s action. It found that the Government\u2019s Decision of 23 September 1999 had not annulled the applicant\u2019s contract with the bank relating to the purchase of the shares. Moreover, the Decision could not in any other way have affected the validity of that contract because the parties had performed, and thereby extinguished, their contractual obligations before the Decision had been adopted (the applicant by paying HRK 37,200 to the bank, and the bank by transferring 186 of its shares to him). It followed that at the relevant time (during its existence) the applicant\u2019s contractual obligation had been performed for consideration which could not subsequently have been removed by an event that took place after that obligation had already been extinguished. The contract in question had thus been valid. As that contract had been the cause on the basis of which the applicant had paid HRK 37,200 to the bank, and had been valid, it could not be argued that this cause had ceased to exist and that the bank had been bound to repay him the amount sought. The conditions for rescission of the contract on the basis of a fundamental change in circumstances had not been met either, because under section 133(3) of the Civil Obligations Act such rescission could not have been sought by a party who had already performed his or her contractual obligations.", "On 30 October 2003 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the second-instance judgment, alleging breaches of Articles 48 (1), 49 and 50 of the Constitution.", "On 16 March 2006 the Constitutional Court dismissed his constitutional complaint.", "The relevant provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia (Ustav Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette nos. 56/90, 135/97, 8/98 (consolidated text), 113/00, 124/00 (consolidated text), 28/01 and 41/01 (consolidated text), 55/01 (corrigendum)) provide as follows:", "\u201cThe right to property is guaranteed.\u201d", "\u201cThe rights acquired through the investment of capital shall not be diminished by law, or by any other legal act.\u201d", "\u201c1.
