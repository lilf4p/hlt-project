BULGARIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant, Mr Valentin Vasilev Bozhilov, is a Bulgarian national born in 1941 and living in Sofia.", "The applicant was a member of the Communist Party until February 1990. From March until August 1990 he was a member of the Socialist Party. He has not been a member of a political party since 1 September 1990. In 1995, on the proposal of a Socialist member of Parliament, the applicant was appointed Senior Advisor to the Parliamentary Foreign Policy Committee.", "On 14 March 1996 the Bulgarian Government nominated the applicant for the post of Director of the Permanent Secretariat of the Black Sea Economic Co-operation (BSEC), an intergovernmental organisation.", "On 25 October 1996 by a decision of the Meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the BSEC countries the applicant was appointed Director of the Secretariat as of 1 May 1997.

The Council of Ministers had exercised their power set out in Article 105 of the Constitution to conduct Bulgaria\u2019s foreign policy. The applicant\u2019s appeal concerned solely the withdrawal of the mandate given to him by the Council of Ministers to represent the country in the BSEC, which did not entail any administrative or civil consequences for him.", "Article 120 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution provides that a judicial appeal lies against any administrative decision except expressly excluded by law.", "The Black Sea Economic Co-operation (BSEC) is an intergovernmental organisation founded by the following participating States: Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Moldova, Romania, the Russian Federation, Turkey and Ukraine.
