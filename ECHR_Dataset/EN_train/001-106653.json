According to the Government, in the course of the proceedings fifty four witnesses and four victims were interrogated, questioned or confronted, some of them repeatedly. This took the authorities about three months in total. Seven forensic examinations were ordered and lasted for about five months in total. Nine hearings were adjourned due to the applicant\u2019s and two other co-defendants\u2019 representatives\u2019, victims\u2019 and witnesses\u2019 failure to appear. The applicant disagreed stating that his representative had not been informed of the hearings which he had not attended. One hearing was adjourned on the applicant\u2019s request. Thirty further hearings were adjourned, mainly because the defendants were not escorted to the court, due to the witnesses\u2019 or prosecutor\u2019s failure to appear or because the judge was absent.
