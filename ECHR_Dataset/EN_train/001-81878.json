THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Corneliu B\u00eersan;David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant, Mr Johannes Joseph Marie Elise Hendriks, is a Dutch national who was born in 1949 and lives in Vaals. He is represented before the Court by Mr J.W. Heemskerk, a lawyer practising in Maastricht.", "On 16 March 2004, the applicant was arrested and taken into police custody (inverzekeringstelling) on suspicion of having committed rape, attempted manslaughter and/or intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm in that he \u2013 having twisted the victim\u2019s arm behind the latter\u2019s back and constrained the victim \u2013 had forcibly inserted a wooden ladle in the victim\u2019s anus, resulting in a perforation of the colon. At the material time and for about twelve years, the victim, the applicant and the latter\u2019s wife had been engaged in a longstanding tripartite relationship.", "On 19 March 2004, after having heard the applicant, the investigating judge (rechter-commissaris) ordered the applicant\u2019s detention on remand (inbewaringstelling) for a period of ten days. The reasons stated by the investigating judge were:", "\u201cIt appears from the case-file that there are serious indications against the suspect (there is more than a mere suspicion).", "There are weighty reasons of public safety that warrant detention on remand, namely:", "detention on remand is necessary because it concerns an act which, according to the legal definition, attracts a prison sentence of twelve years or more whereas in addition this act has seriously rocked the legal order (the act is of an extraordinarily grave nature);\u201d", "On 25 March 2004, after having heard the applicant, the Maastricht Regional Court (arrondissementsrechtbank) ordered the applicant\u2019s further detention on remand (gevangenhouding) for a period of thirty days, holding:", "\u201cThe Regional Court considers that, after examination, it has appeared that the suspicion, indications and ground, which have led to the order for detention on remand (bevel tot bewaring), currently still exist.\u201d", "The applicant filed an appeal against the decision of 25 March 2004 with the \u2018s-Hertogenbosch Court of Appeal (gerechtshof). The applicant did not challenge the existence of serious indications against him but argued that, given the context in which the facts had occurred, his release would not give rise to any social unrest which would justify keeping him in pre-trial detention. In his opinion, nobody would be shocked if he was released from pre-trial detention, as little publicity had been given to the criminal investigation and his arrest. The public prosecutor argued that the release of a suspect of rape always caused upheaval in society and certainly in this case where the victim had suffered considerable harm. The applicant\u2019s appeal was dismissed on 10 June 2004 by the \u2018s-Hertogenbosch Court of Appeal (gerechtshof). It held that the argument raised by the applicant failed to appreciate that his release could get wider publicity in the suspect\u2019s surroundings, thus rocking the legal order.", "In the meantime two further prolongations \u2013 of thirty days each \u2013 of the applicant\u2019s detention on remand were ordered by the Regional Court on 22 April and 19 May 2004, respectively. Both times the Regional Court based its decision on the grounds given in its decision of 25 March 2004.", "By judgment of 14 September 2004, following hearings held on 22 June 2004 and 31 August 2004, the Maastricht Regional Court convicted the applicant of rape. On the basis of reports drawn up by a psychiatrist and a psychologist who had examined the applicant, the Regional Court found that the applicant was suffering from an Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), an alcohol addiction and an anti-social personality disorder and concluded that, at the time of the commission of the offence, the applicant was able to understand the unlawful nature of his acts but that his mental faculties were so poorly developed that he could only be held responsible for these offences to a limited degree. In this light, the Regional Court decided to sentence the applicant to twelve months\u2019 imprisonment, of which three months were suspended pending a two years\u2019 probation period, less the time spent in pre-trial detention. In addition, it imposed a special condition (bijzondere voorwaarde) within the meaning of Article 14c of the Criminal Code (Wetboek van Strafrecht) to the effect that the applicant was to comply \u2013 during the probationary period \u2013 with directives given to him by the local section of the Netherlands probation and social rehabilitation service (reclassering), also if this would entail treatment for substance abuse. It lastly ordered the applicant to pay the victim, who had joined the proceedings as an injured civil party, 3,500 euros in compensation. Although the applicant could have filed an appeal against this judgment, he did not do so.", "Article 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Wetboek van Strafvordering; \u201cCCP\u201d) defines pre-trial detention (voorlopige hechtenis) as deprivation of liberty pursuant to an order for detention on remand (inbewaringstelling), a warrant for the taking into pre-trial detention (gevangenneming) or an order for further detention on remand (gevangenhouding). The statutory rules governing pre-trial detention are set out in Articles 63 to 88 of the CCP.", "Article 67 of the CCP reads as follows:", "\u201c1.

For the application of the preceding paragraph, only the following can be considered as a serious reason of public safety:", "- 1o. if it concerns suspicion of commission of an act which, according to the law, carries a punishment of imprisonment of twelve years or more and the legal order has been seriously rocked by that act;", "- 2o. if there is a serious risk the suspect will commit an offence which, according to the law, carries a prison sentence of six years or more or whereby the security of the State or the health or safety of persons may be endangered, or give rise to a general danger to goods;", "- 3o. if it concerns suspicion of one of the offences defined in Articles 310, 311, 321, 322, 323a, 326, 326a, 416, 417bis, 420bis or 420quater of the Criminal Code, whereas less than five years have passed since the day on which, on account of one of these offences, the suspect has been irrevocably sentenced to a punishment or measure entailing deprivation of liberty, a measure entailing restriction of liberty or community service, and there is further a serious risk that the suspect will again commit one of those offences;", "- 4o. if pre-trial detention is reasonably necessary for discovering the truth otherwise than through statements of the suspect.", "3. An order for pre-trial detention shall not be issued if there are serious prospects that, in case of a conviction, no irrevocable custodial sentence or a measure entailing deprivation of liberty will be imposed on the suspect, or that he, by the enforcement of the order, would be deprived of his liberty for a longer period than the duration of the custodial sentence or measure.\u201d", "Orders for pre-trial detention are immediately enforceable (Article 73 \u00a7 1 of the CCP). Pre-trial detention in the form of an order for detention on remand of a suspect may be issued by the investigating judge for a maximum duration of ten days (Articles 63 and 64 of the CCP).", "Under Article 65 of the CCP, a subsequent prolongation of pre-trial detention may be ordered by the Regional Court in the form of an order for further detention on remand for a maximum duration of thirty days. In case the trial proceedings have not started within the thirty days\u2019 validity of an order for further detention on remand, the Regional Court can prolong it twice, each time for a maximum of thirty days (Article 66 \u00a7 of the CCP).", "Article 69 \u00a7 1 of the CCP reads:", "\u201cAn order for pre-trial detention may be lifted by the Regional Court.
