On 5 March 1940 Mr Beria, head of the USSR\u2019s NKVD, wrote to Joseph Stalin, Secretary General of the USSR Communist Party, proposing to approve the shooting of Polish prisoners of war on the grounds that they were all \u201cenemies of the Soviet authorities and full of hatred towards the Soviet system\u201d. On the same day the Politburo of the Central Committee of the USSR Communist Party took the decision to consider, \u201cusing a special procedure\u201d and employing \u201ccapital punishment \u2013 shooting\u201d in the case of Polish officers held in the prisoner-of-war camps.

In the same year, prosecutors in Kharkov and Kalinin (Tver) instituted criminal investigations in connection with the discovery of mass burials.

The prosecutor\u2019s office stated that it was not able to determine the legal basis for the repression against Polish citizens in 1940. Following a judicial appeal against the prosecutor\u2019s refusal, on 25 November 2008 the Moscow City Court upheld it at final instance as lawful and justified.", "On 14 October 2008 the Military Court of the Moscow Command rejected a further complaint against the prosecutor\u2019s decision on the discontinuation of case no. 159. It found that the complainants\u2019 relatives had not been among those identified and that \u201cthe \u2018Katy\u0144\u2019 investigation ...
