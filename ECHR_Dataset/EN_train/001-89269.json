On 12 May 2003 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of 21 May 2002. It noted that one of the persons ordered to pay compensation was not an apartment owner in the business centre at the time of the accident and that the first-instance court should have duly established the names of the owners before rendering its judgment. The Court of Cassation further noted that the applicant\u2019s petition of 17 October 2001 should have been served on all the defendants.", "24.
