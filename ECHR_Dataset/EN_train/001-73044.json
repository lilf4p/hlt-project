GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant, Mrs Barbara Zabawska, is a Polish national who was born in 1949 and lives in Pi\u0142a.", "The applicant is the mother of a child born out of wedlock in 1989. The child\u2019s father is married to another woman and lives with her and their two children in Germany near Hamburg.", "On 24 September 1991 the Pi\u0142a District Court (s\u0105d rejonowy) ordered the child\u2019s father to pay maintenance in an amount of 1,000,000 old Polish zlotys (PLZ) corresponding to approximately 65 German marks (DEM) at the exchange rate prevailing at the material time. Thereafter the applicant applied to the Lauenburg District Court (Amtsgericht) for an increase in the child maintenance. On 1 February 1993 the applicant and the child\u2019s father concluded a settlement before the District Court according to which the father agreed to pay a further monthly maintenance sum of DEM 35 in addition to the sum fixed by the Polish court. Apparently the father initially paid the total maintenance sum of DEM 100 on a regular basis.", "On 5 September 1995 the Federal Administration Office (Bundesverwaltungsamt), designated in Germany as Receiving Agency pursuant to the United Nations Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance, received a letter from the applicant dated 25 June 1995 containing a request for an increase in the monthly maintenance payments. On 24 May 1996 she reduced her initial claim to DEM 250.", "Pursuant to the Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance, the Poznan District Court, as the competent Transferring Agency on the Polish side, was informed by the Federal Administration Office of this request. On 14 December 1995, after having investigated the father\u2019s last known place of residence, the Federal Administration Office contacted the child\u2019s father and requested him to disclose his financial situation.", "On 18 January 1996 the child\u2019s father, represented by a lawyer, drew the attention of the Federal Administration Office to the settlement reached on 1 February 1993. On 29 January 1996 he submitted information concerning his ability to pay. On 30 April 1996 the Federal Administration Office informed the Poznan District Court of the state of the proceedings.", "On 24 June 1996 the applicant informed the Federal Administration Office that she was currently receiving monthly maintenance payments for her son from a relative of the child\u2019s father in an amount of 160 Polish zlotys (PLN) corresponding at the material time to DEM 85.", "At the beginning of October 1996 the competent employment office informed the Federal Administration Office that the child\u2019s father had been unemployed for a certain time and some months later that he was unemployed since the end of December 1996.", "Having received no further information on his financial situation from the child\u2019s father despite several reminders, namely of 9 July 1996, 18 July 1997 and 30 March 1998, the Federal Administration Office brought an action against him on behalf of the child before the Schwarzenbek District Court (Amtsgericht).", "On 29 May 1998 the District Court received the child\u2019s maintenance claim together with a request for legal aid. After an extension of the time-limit, observations of the child\u2019s father on the child\u2019s maintenance claim were received by the District Court in August 1998. In reply to a request of the District Court of 18 August 1998, the Federal Administrative Office set the child support, as requested by the applicant, at the amount of DEM 250 per month. On 26 January 1999 the District Court granted the applicant\u2019s son legal aid. The Poznan District Court was informed about the proceedings.", "On 7 July 1999 a hearing was held before the Schwarzenbek District Court. The child and the Federal Administration Office were represented by Youth Office of the Duchy of Lauenburg. The District Court had regard to the fact that the child\u2019s father had been again unemployed since January 1999 and, with the consent of both parties, ordered the stay of the proceedings. Following the hearing, the Federal Administration Office informed the Poznan District Court of this decision.", "On 11 November 1999 and 25 January 2000 the competent employment office informed the Federal Administration Office that the child\u2019s father was still unemployed.", "In a letter to the Federal Administration Office of 28 January 2000 the applicant stated that the child\u2019s father was the owner of a house and several cars in Poland. The Federal Administration Office forwarded this letter to the Poznan District Court and recommended an investigation into this matter by the Polish authorities, since for the time being there was no possibility under German law to obtain an increase in maintenance payments.", "By a default judgment of 13 February 2002 the Pi\u0142a District Court ordered the child\u2019s father to pay monthly maintenance in an amount of PLN 550 (approximately 125 euros). On 11 March 2002 the Poznan District Court communicated to the Federal Administration Office a letter of the applicant dated 20 February 2002 in which she had confirmed that the amount of the child allowance had been increased and paid on a regular basis and that there were no arrears.", "The Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance was adopted and opened for signature on 20 June 1956 by the United Nations Conference on Maintenance Obligations.
