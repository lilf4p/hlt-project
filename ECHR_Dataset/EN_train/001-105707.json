The applicant, who is of Serbian origin, was born in 1949 and lives in Vukovar.", "6. On 28 October 2004 the applicant submitted an application for the post of deputy county state attorney in the Vukovar County State Attorney\u2019s Office. He relied on section 22(2) of the Constitutional Act on the Rights of National Minorities and section 63(2) of the State Attorneys Act (see paragraphs 17 and 19 below).", "7. On 11 January 2005 the State Attorneys Council (Dr\u017eavnoodvjetni\u010dko vije\u0107e), after a secret ballot, unanimously adopted a decision appointing D.K.I. deputy county state attorney in the Vukovar County State Attorney\u2019s Office. It found that both candidates satisfied the statutory requirements to be appointed deputy state attorney but gave priority to D.K.I., having regard to her extensive experience of working on civil and administrative law cases. The decision contained an information notice (pouka o pravnom lijeku) to the effect that administrative dispute proceedings could be instituted against it by bringing an action in the Administrative Court (Upravni sud Republike Hrvatske) within thirty days of its service. The information notice reads as follows:", "\u201cAgainst this decision an administrative dispute may be instituted by bringing an action in the Administrative Court within thirty days of the service of the decision.\u201d", "8. On 4 February 2005 the applicant instituted administrative dispute proceedings in the Administrative Court by bringing an action under section 23 of the Administrative Disputes Act (see paragraph 26 below) against the State Attorneys Council\u2019s decision of 11 January 2005. He again relied on section 22(2) of the Constitutional Act on the Rights of National Minorities.", "9. On 16 March 2005 the Administrative Court declared the applicant\u2019s action inadmissible, finding that the contested decision did not constitute an \u201cadministrative act\u201d within the meaning of section 6(2) of the Administrative Disputes Act (see paragraph 24 below). Therefore, instead of instituting administrative dispute proceedings by bringing an action (against an administrative act), the applicant should have lodged \u201ca request for the protection of a constitutionally guaranteed right\u201d (zahtjev za za\u0161titu ustavom zajam\u010denog prava), a remedy provided in section 66 of the Administrative Disputes Act (see paragraph 34 below). The Administrative Court also held that the applicant\u2019s action could not have been, even in substance, regarded as such a request, because he had not relied on any provision of the Constitution, but only on the Constitutional Act on the Rights of National Minorities.", "10. On 18 July 2005 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) against the Administrative Court\u2019s decision. In so doing the applicant, alleging a violation of his right of access to court, relied on Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.", "11. On 13 February 2008 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint. The relevant part of that decision reads as follows:", "\u201cThe Constitutional Court finds that the complainant\u2019s rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms were not breached in the proceedings before the Administrative Court because the Administrative Court did not proceed contrary to the legal views established by the European Court of Human Rights in the application of that provision to individual cases.", "...", "The Constitutional Court notes that in its practice it has established the rule that there is a remedy before the Administrative Court (a request under section 66 of the Administrative Disputes Act) against a decision on appointment of a deputy state attorney, and that this remedy has to be used before a constitutional complaint is lodged with the Constitutional Court (decision no. U-III-4364/2005 of 19 December 2005).\u201d", "12. The relevant provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia (Ustav Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette of the Republic of Croatia nos. 56/1990, 135/1997, 8/1998 (consolidated text), 113/2000, 124/2000 (consolidated text), 28/2001 and 41/2001 (consolidated text), 55/2001 (corrigendum) and 76/2010) read as follows:", "\u201cThe right to appeal against decisions adopted in the first-instance proceedings before a court or other authorised body shall be guaranteed.", "The right of appeal may exceptionally be excluded in cases provided by law if other legal protection is ensured.\u201d", "\u201cIn the determination of his rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial court established by law.\u201d", "\u201cEvery national of the Republic of Croatia shall have the right, under equal conditions, to take part in the conduct of public affairs, and to be admitted to public service.\u201d", "13. In its decisions no. U-III-1733/2000 of 24 November 2004 (published in the Official Gazette no. 179/2004 of 17 December 2004), no. U-III-2808/2007 of 13 February 2008 (published in the Official Gazette no. 26/2008 of 29 February 2008) and no. U-III-3071/2006 (published in the Official Gazette no. 42/2009 of 6 April 2009) the Constitutional Court held that in cases where the first-instance courts had wrongly informed parties on legal remedies by indicating longer time-limits for lodging appeals against their decisions than those provided in the relevant legislation, and the parties lodged their appeals outside of the statutory time-limits but within the time-limits indicated by the first-instance courts, those appeals could not be declared inadmissible as lodged out of time. To do so would run contrary to the constitutional right to appeal guaranteed by Article 18(1) of the Constitution, and the constitutional right to a fair hearing, in its part concerning access to court, guaranteed by Article 29(1) of the Constitution (see preceding paragraph).", "14. In its judgment no. Zpa-5/2004-5 of 2 December 2004, following a request for the protection of a constitutionally guaranteed right (see paragraph 34 below) the Administrative Court quashed the decision of the National Judicial Council on appointment of a municipal court judge. It held that every candidate satisfying the statutory requirements had the right to equal participation in a competition for public office. Therefore, by appointing a candidate who did not satisfy the statutory requirements for appointment as a judge of a municipal court, the National Judicial Council violated the other candidate\u2019s constitutional right to \u201cequal access to public service\u201d guaranteed by Article 44 of the Constitution (see paragraph 12 above).", "15.

In its decision no. U-III-4364/2005 of 19 December 2005 (Official Gazette no. 6/2006 of 13 January 2006) the Constitutional Court held that a request for the protection of a constitutionally guaranteed right under section 66 of the Administrative Disputes Act (see paragraph 34 below) must be lodged against a decision of the State Attorneys Council on appointment of a deputy state attorney before a constitutional complaint under section 62 of the Constitutional Court Act.", "17. The relevant provisions of the Constitutional Act on the Rights of National Minorities (Zakon o pravima nacionalnih manjina, Official Gazette of the Republic of Croatia nos. 155/2002 and 80/2010), which entered into force on 23 December 2002, read as follows:", "\u201c(2) The representation of members of national minorities in the organs of State administration and judicial organs shall be secured in accordance with special legislation, and taking into account the proportion of members of national minorities in the total population at the level in respect of which the organ of state administration or judicial organ is established, and acquired rights.", "(4) In filling the posts referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this section, priority shall be given under the same conditions to members of national minorities.\u201d", "18. On 23 March 2006 the Administrative Court delivered its judgment in case no. Zpa-39/2005, where an aggrieved candidate, member of a national minority, lodged a request for the protection of a constitutionally guaranteed right under section 66 of the Administrative Disputes Act (see paragraph 34 below) against a decision of the National Judicial Council on appointment of a municipal court judge. He argued that the contested decision had breached his right guaranteed by Article 44 of the Constitution (see paragraph 12 above) in conjunction with section 22(4) of the Constitutional Act on the Rights of National Minorities (see paragraph 17 above). The Administrative Court dismissed his request (only) because in his application for the post of a municipal court judge he had not expressed the wish to be treated as a member of a national minority and had not relied on section 22(4) of the Constitutional Act on the Rights of National Minorities.", "19. The relevant provision of the State Attorneys Act (Zakon o dr\u017eavnom odvjetni\u0161tvu, Official Gazette of the Republic of Croatia nos. 51/2001, 16/2007, 20/2007 (corrigendum), 146/2008), as in force at the material time, provided as follows:", "\u201c(1) Deputy state attorneys shall be appointed in a manner, under the conditions and according to a procedure that guarantees they possess the expertise, independence and moral standing necessary to discharge the duty of a state attorney.", "(2) Any Croatian national who holds a law degree and has passed the bar exam may be appointed a deputy state attorney.\u201d", "\u201cA person may be appointed a deputy state attorney in a county state attorney\u2019s office if he or she has, as a holder of public office in the judiciary, exercised judicial duties, or has been an advocate, notary public or notary public\u2019s assessor, or lecturer of law courses at a law faculty for at least ten years, or has worked in another legal profession for at least twenty years after passing the bar exam.\u201d", "20. The State Attorneys Act provided that decisions of the State Attorneys Council rendered in disciplinary proceedings (section 114) and decisions on removal from the office of a state attorney (section 118(5)) could be challenged by instituting administrative disputes proceedings before the Administrative Court in the form of an action under section 23 of the Administrative Disputes Act. However, the State Attorneys Act had no provisions on remedies available against decisions of the State Attorneys Council on appointment of state attorneys.", "21. In its decision no. Us-6683/2004 of 17 November 2004 the Administrative Court held for the first time that a decision of the State Attorneys Council on appointment of a deputy state attorney was not an administrative act within the meaning of section 6(2) of the Administrative Disputes Act. It also held that such a decision could only be contested before that court by lodging a request for the protection of a constitutionally guaranteed right under section 66 of the Administrative Disputes Act (see paragraph 34 below).", "22.

Section 6(1) provides that administrative dispute proceedings may be initiated only against an administrative act.", "24. Section 6(2) provides that an administrative act, within the meaning of the Act, is an act whereby a State organ, in the exercise of public authority, decides on a right or obligation of an individual or an organisation in an administrative matter.", "25.

According to the conclusion reached at the plenary session of judges of the Administrative Court held on 26 October 1987, an action against an administrative act is to be considered a request for judicial protection within the meaning of section 66 of the Administrative Disputes Act if from the content of the action it transpires that it may concern a breach of rights or freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution. In such cases the Administrative Court could not review every breach of procedural or substantive law but only those that amount to breaches of constitutionally guaranteed rights or freedoms.", "36. According to the Administrative Court\u2019s case-law (judgment no. Zpa-5/2004-5 of 2 December 2004), the requirements for affording judicial protection under section 66 of the Administrative Disputes Act, which must be met in their totality, are: (a) the request has to concern rights or freedoms expressly guaranteed by the Constitution, (b) those rights or freedoms were allegedly breached by a final decision which does not have the characteristics of an administrative act, and (c) the legal system does not provide for another judicial avenue of redress. If the request lodged under section 66 of the Administrative Disputes Act does not concern a right or freedom guaranteed by the Constitution, it should be declared inadmissible (decision no. Zpa-4/2003 of 15 December 2004). The time-limit for lodging such a request is the same as the time-limit for bringing an action against an administrative act under section 23 of the Administrative Disputes Act (see paragraphs 26-27 above), that is, thirty days from the service of the contested decision (Zpa-9/05 of 13 April 2005).", "37.
