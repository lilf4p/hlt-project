At the same time, the applicant was declared a wanted person.", "9. On 1 August 2007, the R\u00ee\u015fcani District Court found that the applicant\u2019s arrest and detention had been unlawful since none of the legal grounds cited by the prosecution applied.

On 11 August 2008 the applicant\u2019s lawyers asked the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office to revoke the decision of 25 July 2008.
