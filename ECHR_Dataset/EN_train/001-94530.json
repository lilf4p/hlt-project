This decision concerned, among others, plot no. 6271.", "11. The applicants and the present occupier of one of the plots appealed. On 14 January 1998 the applicants\u2019 opponent withdrew its appeal. On 19 November 1997 the Minister of Agriculture discontinued the appellate proceedings in respect of the part of the decision given in the applicants\u2019 favour and dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal against the remainder of the decision.", "12.
