The applicant is the owner and publisher of the weekly magazine \u201cProfil\u201d.", "10. In its issue 25/1998 of 15 June 1998 the applicant company published an article about Mr R., at that time a member of Parliament, and his cohabitee Mrs G. The article, with the title \u201cDiary of an escape\u201d and the subtitle \u201cReport. Several myths are entwined around P. R.\u2019s trip to Brazil. The reconstruction of a banal reality\u201d, described the couple\u2019s flight from Austria in April 1998 as Mr R. was suspected of having committed the offences of aggravated fraud (Betrug) and fraudulent conversion (Untreue). After an international arrest warrant had been issued, Mr R. was arrested in Brazil on 5 June 1998. At the time of the events, great public interest in the criminal proceedings against Mr R. existed. After Mr R.\u2019s arrest, Mrs G. had given interviews on these events. The article was accompanied by a photo, which appeared on another page, showing Mrs G. standing beside Mr R.", "11. The article and its context, namely a short text accompanying photos showing the couple\u2019s hotel and a bar in Brazil, contained the following statements:", "\u201c...Thus, the Lower Austrian mutation of \u2018Bonnie and Clyde\u2019 started on the last part of their trip, a four hour bus ride... (Also brach die nieder\u00f6sterreichische Mutation von Bonnie and Clyde zur letzten Etappe, einer vierst\u00fcndigen Busfahrt...auf.)", "...The first two weeks, \u2018Bonnie and Clyde\u2019 hardly ever left the hotel... (Die ersten beiden Wochen verlassen \u2018Bonnie und Clyde\u2019 das Haus praktisch nie.)", "...\u2019Bonnie and Clyde\u2019 from Lower Austria wish to rent the Mayor\u2019s bar... (\u2018Bonnie und Clyde\u2019 aus Nieder\u00f6sterreich wollen die Bar des B\u00fcrgermeisters pachten.)", "...\u2019Bonnie and Clyde\u2019 are dreaming of a decent life as pub owners... (\u2018Bonnie und Clyde\u2019 tr\u00e4umen von einem bescheidenen Leben als Barbetreiber.)\u201d", "The article, when describing the arrest of Mr R., further stated :", "\u201cC. G., against whom no suspicion exists, stays behind. (Zur\u00fcck bleibt C.G., gegen die nichts vorliegt.)\u201d", "12. On 20 November 1998 Mrs G. brought proceedings against the applicant company claiming compensation for defamation under Section 6 of the Media Act (Mediengesetz). Further she requested supplementary measures under the Media Act, such as the publication of the judgment. She stressed that the applicant company, by publishing the article at issue, had committed the offence of defamation under the Criminal Code (\u00dcble Nachrede).", "13. She argued that the comparison with the famous criminals \u2018Bonnie and Clyde\u2019 from the thirties, whose story was the basis of a film produced in the sixties, could have given the impression that she was also involved in the offences of Mr R.", "14. On 7 April 1999 the Wiener Neustadt Regional Court (Landesgericht) dismissed Mrs G.\u2019s claim. It found that the average reader would have understood \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d as a synonym for a couple on the run and that it had been a pictorial description with a humorous and entertaining message. It considered that the average reader would have connected \u201cBonnie\u201d with a woman who follows her partner \u201cthrough thick and thin\u201d and that the characterisation as \u201cBonnie\u201d did not amount to an accusation of having participated in the offences of Mr R.", "15. On 4 November 1999 the Vienna Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht) quashed this decision and remitted the case to the Regional Court. It observed that \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d had been violent criminals and found that the established connection between Mrs G. and \u201cBonnie\u201d created an \u201cinherent statement of having participated in criminal acts\u201d even though \u201cit had been expressly stated in the article that no suspicion had existed against Mrs G.\u201d. It, therefore, concluded that the applicant company had committed the offence of defamation under Section 111 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch) by publishing the article at issue and stated that its finding had to be taken into account by the Regional Court in its new decision.", "16. On 3 February 2000 the Regional Court sentenced the applicant company to pay compensation of ATS 20,000 (1,453.46 euros) for defamation and to reimburse Ms G.\u2019s costs of the proceedings and ordered it to publish an extract of its judgment in its magazine. Following the Court of Appeal\u2019s line of argument it found, referring to the above mentioned passages of the incriminated article, that:", "\u201c... the well-known movie \u2018Bonnie and Clyde\u2019 described two ordinary people who make the American dream of liberty and wealth come true by stealing cars, robbing banks and killing people. (...) The reader primarily associates Bonnie with a criminal who had, together with her partner, robbed innumerable banks and had killed 14 persons within two years. (...) Nobody would have connected Bonnie only with a naive angel, who followed her partner devotedly but, rather, with a woman who would kill to assist the common purpose \u2018escape\u2019. (...) Beyond doubt the reader is forced to make a connection with capital crime. (...) The allegation of participating in criminal offences constitutes defamation within the meaning of Section 111 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code.\u201d", "17. On 22 March 2000 the applicant company filed an appeal and stressed, inter alia, that the incriminating passages had to be considered in connection with the article as a whole. It submitted that the article was written in an ironical style and could not have given the impression that Mrs G. had committed any criminal acts.", "18. On 9 August 2000 the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and confirmed the Regional Court\u2019s decision as a whole.", "19. On 9 February 1999 Mrs G. applied to the Wiener Neustadt Regional Court for an injunction under Section 78 of the Copyright Act (Urheberrechtsgesetz) against the applicant company. She requested that the applicant company be ordered to refrain from publishing her picture without her consent in connection with reporting on the criminal proceedings against Mr R. or, in the alternative, that the applicant company be ordered to refrain from publishing her picture without her consent in connection with referring to her and Mr R. as \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d. Furthermore, she requested an order for the publication of the judgment in the applicant company\u2019s magazine.", "20. She argued that the publication of her picture in connection with a report on the criminal proceedings against Mr R. violated her legitimate interests under Section 78 of the Copyright Act and that the comparison with the famous criminals \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d could have given the impression that she had been involved in the offences of which Mr R. was accused.", "21. The applicant company, in its observations, argued that the report at issue expressly mentioned that there were no criminal proceedings pending against Mrs G. and that the report was written in an ironical style and could not have given the impression that Mrs G. had committed any criminal acts. Moreover, she had willingly given interviews to the media and had her pictures taken by journalists. As regards the comparison of Mrs G. with \u201cBonnie\u201d, the applicant company submitted that the reader of its magazine understood \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d as a synonym for a couple on the run and not for violent criminals. Finally, it contended that the great public interest in the events justified the publication of Mrs G.\u2019s picture.", "22. On 19 February 1999 the Wiener Neustadt Regional Court granted an interim injunction (einstweilige Verf\u00fcgung). It found the measure justified as the interest in the publication of Mrs G.\u2019s picture violated her legitimate interests.", "23. On 27 April 1999 the Court of Appeal allowed the applicant company\u2019s appeal and dismissed Mrs G.\u2019s application.", "24. On 13 September 1999 the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof) partly allowed Mrs G.\u2019s extraordinary appeal on points of law and granted the interim injunction she had requested in the alternative, i.e. it ordered the applicant company to refrain from publishing Mrs G.\u2019s picture without her consent in connection with referring to her and Mr R. as \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d.", "25. The Supreme Court observed that Section 78 of the Copyright Act prohibited publishing a person\u2019s picture if the publication violated that person\u2019s legitimate interests and that the publication of her picture had to be considered together with the content of the published report. The court referred further to its case-law in which it had found that the publication of the picture of a spouse of a suspect was not of any informative value and that the concerned spouse\u2019s interest in secrecy, therefore, outweighed the interest of information. The court found, however, that in the present case Mrs G. was far more involved in the case of Mr R. than simply being Mr R.\u2019s cohabitee or girlfriend, as she had prepared the escape with him and had finally escaped with Mr R. Therefore, the applicant company\u2019s interest in publishing her picture in principle outweighed Mrs G.\u2019s legitimate interests in secrecy.", "26. The court then argued that the text of the article at issue, compared Mrs G. with the female partner of the violent criminals \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d and could give the impression to the readers of the magazine that Mrs G. as \u201cBonnie\u201d had been involved in the criminal offences of her partner. The Supreme Court, thus, concluded that, although it seemed that Mrs G. had consented to the publication of her picture in connection with the criminal proceedings against Mr R., her legitimate interests were violated by the publication of her photo in combination with a comparison with the criminal \u201cBonnie\u201d.", "27. On 2 February 2001 the Wiener Neustadt Regional Court granted a permanent injunction prohibiting the applicant company from publishing Mrs G.\u2019s picture while comparing her and Mr R. with \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d or while connecting her with the commission of criminal offences.", "28. On 3 May 2001 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant company\u2019s appeal and ordered the applicant company to pay Mrs G.\u2019s costs of the appeal proceedings.", "29. On 12 September 2001 the Supreme Court, referring to its decision of 13 September 1999, rejected the applicant company\u2019s extraordinary appeal on points on law. This decision was served on 2 October 2001.", "30. Section 6 of the Media Act provides for the strict liability of the publisher in cases of defamation; the victim can thus claim damages from him. In this context \u201cdefamation\u201d has been defined in Section 111 of the Criminal Code, as follows:", "\u201c1. As it may be perceived by a third party, anyone who accuses another of having a contemptible character or attitude, or of behaving contrary to honour or morality, and of such a nature as to make him contemptible or otherwise lower him in public esteem, shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding six months or a fine ...", "2. Anyone who commits this offence in a printed document, by broadcasting or otherwise, in such a way as to make the defamation accessible to a broad section of the public, shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding one year or a fine ...", "3. The person making the statement shall not be punished if it is proved to be true. As regards the offence defined in paragraph 1, he shall also not be liable if circumstances are established which gave him sufficient reason to assume that the statement was true.\u201d", "31. Section 78 of the Copyright Act, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:", "\u201c(1) Images of persons shall neither be exhibited publicly, nor in any way made accessible to the public, where injury would be caused to the legitimate interests of the persons concerned or, in the event that they have died without having authorised or ordered publication, those of a close relative.\u201d", "This provision has been interpreted in the Supreme Court\u2019s case-law. In particular the Supreme Court has found that in determining whether the publication of a person\u2019s picture violated his or her \u201clegitimate interests\u201d regard is to be had to the accompanying text. Where the publisher of the picture claims that there was a public interest in its publication, the courts have to carry out a weighing of the respective interests involved. As regards reporting on criminal cases, the Supreme Court has constantly held that there is no predominant public interest in the publication of the suspect\u2019s picture if it has no additional independent information value. The only effect is that the intensity of such reporting is increased by attaching the suspect\u2019s picture and, thus, making his or her appearance known to the public at large (see News Verlags GmbH & CoKG v. Austria, no. 31457/96, \u00a7 32, ECHR 2000-I, with reference to MuR 1990, p. 224; SZ 63/75, p. 373; MuR 1995, p. 64; MuR 1996, p. 33)."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
