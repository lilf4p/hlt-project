FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["7. Mr Mustafa Karakaya, a Turkish national born in 1956, has lived for many years in France, where he worked as a mechanic until 1990, when he was made redundant.", "8. Since then he has been unemployed, and in December 1991 he was registered as 80% disabled owing to the effects of illness on his joints.", "Mr Karakaya is a haemophiliac and has had numerous blood transfusions. He was infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) between 16 August and 29 October 1984, the latter date having been determined only during proceedings in the Paris Administrative Court (see paragraph 17 below). In April 1992 he was classified as having reached stage III of infection - the last but one stage - on the scale of the Atlanta Center for Disease Control.", "9. On 29 December 1989 the applicant submitted a preliminary claim for compensation to the Minister for Solidarity, Health and Social Protection, in accordance with Article R.102 of the Administrative Courts and Administrative Courts of Appeal Code (see paragraph 21 below). He sought 2,500,000 French francs (FRF), maintaining that he had been infected with HIV as a result of the Minister\u2019s negligent delay in implementing appropriate rules for the supply of blood products.", "Six hundred and forty-nine similar claims were submitted to the Minister; at that time one thousand two hundred and fifty haemophiliacs had been infected.", "10. On 30 March 1990, one month before the expiry of the statutory four-month time-limit (see paragraph 21 below), the Director-General for Health rejected the applicant\u2019s claim.", "11. On 23 May 1990 Mr Karakaya lodged an application with the Versailles Administrative Court, seeking to have the ministerial decision quashed and to be awarded compensation from the State in the amount of FRF 2,500,000 plus statutory interest. On 18 October he filed supplementary pleadings.", "The Minister filed his defence pleadings on 22 April 1991. In them he called on the court to dismiss the applicant\u2019s claim but added:", "\"However, in the event of the court\u2019s accepting the principle of negligence on the part of the State, I would ask you to appoint an expert with a view to establishing whether the damage for which the applicant seeks compensation is genuinely attributable to such negligence.\"", "12. By an order of 1 July 1991 made under Article R.82 of the Administrative Courts and Administrative Courts of Appeal Code, the case was referred to the Conseil d\u2019Etat, which assigned it to the Paris Administrative Court, the court designated to deal with all the applications lodged against the State by infected haemophiliacs.", "13. The case was set down for hearing on 8 April 1992. On 22 April the court delivered an interlocutory judgment, worded as follows:", "\"... the State is liable in respect of haemophiliacs who were infected with HIV in the course of transfusion of non-heat-treated blood products during the period of liability defined above, that is between 12 March and 1 October 1985.\"", "It also ordered the applicant to produce a statement of any indemnities he might have received in compensation for the damage set out in the application.", "The judgment was served on Mr Karakaya on 25 August 1992. On 27 August he sent the court a copy of the offers made by the Compensation Fund (see paragraph 18 below).", "14. A hearing took place on 3 February 1993. On 14 April the court delivered a second interlocutory judgment, in which it appointed an expert to determine as far as possible, inter alia, whether the applicant had received any blood derivatives during the period of the State\u2019s liability determined earlier and to give an opinion on the likelihood of there being a causal link between the administration of blood derivatives during that period and infection by HIV.", "The judgment was served on Mr Karakaya on 13 September 1993.", "15. On 24 September 1993 Mr Karakaya appealed to the Paris Administrative Court of Appeal against the two interlocutory judgments of 22 April 1992 and 14 April 1993 in order to have them set aside and to have the case decided at once by the appellate court without any expert being appointed to give an opinion.", "16. In a judgment of 31 March 1994 the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that the submissions challenging the first judgment of the court below were inadmissible and that the expert opinion called for in the lower court\u2019s second judgment was useful.", "17. On 10 December 1993 the expert filed his report at the Paris Administrative Court. It included the following passage:", "\"... I am convinced that in all probability Mr Karakaya was originally infected by HIV as a result of injections of antihaemophilic blood derivatives that were administered between 16 August 1984 and 29 October 1984.\"", "The case was set down for hearing on 16 February 1994. On 2 March the Administrative Court delivered the following judgment:", "\"The expert\u2019s report has shown that a causal link between the applicant\u2019s infection with the human immunodeficiency virus and the administration of blood derivatives during the period of the State\u2019s liability - as determined in a judgment of 22 April 1992 - between 12 March and 1 October 1985 cannot be regarded as having been established. The expert indicates that Mr Karakaya was shown to be HIV positive on a sample taken on 13 November 1984. It follows that Mr Karakaya\u2019s application for an order that the State should compensate for the damage sustained as a result of this infection must be refused;", "...\"", "The judgment was served on Mr Karakaya on 5 April 1994; he did not appeal within the two-month period allowed.", "18. On 17 April 1992 Mr Karakaya submitted a claim to the Compensation Fund set up by the Act of 31 December 1991 (see paragraph 19 below).", "On 13 May 1992 the Fund offered him as \"HIV-infection compensation\" a sum of FRF 1,234,500 payable in three instalments over a period of two years, from which FRF 100,000 paid out by the private haemophiliacs\u2019 solidarity fund was to be deducted. In addition, the applicant was to receive a sum of FRF 411,500 as soon he developed AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).", "Following acceptance of the offer by the applicant, the Fund sent him an initial instalment of FRF 378,170 on 1 June 1992.", "On 9 December 1992 the applicant requested the Fund to pay him the remainder of the HIV-infection compensation immediately; he referred it to the Paris Court of Appeal\u2019s judgments of 27 November 1992, in which the court had held that such compensation could not be paid in instalments unless the persons receiving it agreed.", "On 18 February 1993 the Fund sent him the requested sum of FRF 756,330.", "19. The Act of 31 December 1991 making miscellaneous social-welfare provisions set up special machinery for the compensation of haemophiliacs and transfusion patients who had been infected following injections of blood products. Section 47 provides:", "\"I. Victims of damage resulting from infection with the human immunodeficiency virus caused by transfusion of blood products or injection of blood derivatives carried out within the territory of the French Republic shall be compensated in the manner set out below.", "II. ...", "III.

It shall investigate the circumstances under which the victim was infected and make any necessary inquiries, which may not be resisted on grounds of professional secrecy.", "...", "V. The Fund shall be required to make an offer of compensation to any victim referred to in subsection I within a time-limit laid down by decree, which may not exceed six months from the day on which the Fund receives full proof of the damage ...", "...", "VI. The victim shall inform the Fund of any judicial proceedings pending. If legal proceedings are brought, the victim shall inform the court of his application to the Fund.", "VII. ...", "VIII. The victim shall not be entitled to take legal action against the Compensation Fund unless his claim for compensation has been dismissed, no offer has been made to him within the time-limit referred to in the first paragraph of subsection V, or he has not accepted an offer made to him. Proceedings shall be brought in the Paris Court of Appeal.", "IX. The Fund shall be subrogated, for an amount no higher than the sums paid out, to the victim\u2019s rights against the person liable for the damage and against persons required, for whatever reason, to make full or partial reparation for that damage, within the limits of those persons\u2019 liabilities. However, the Fund may institute proceedings on the basis of that subrogation only where the damage is attributable to negligence.", "The Fund may intervene in proceedings in the criminal courts, even if it does not do so until the appeal stage, where the victim or his heirs have claimed compensation as a civil party in proceedings pending against the person or persons responsible for the damage defined in subsection I. In such cases it shall be considered a full party to the proceedings and may have recourse to all the remedies available in law.", "If the acts which caused the damage have given rise to criminal proceedings, the civil court shall not be required to defer its decision until there has been a final decision by the criminal court.", "X. Unless otherwise provided, the provisions governing the implementation of this section shall be laid down in a decree issued after consultation of the Conseil d\u2019Etat.", "XI. ...", "XII. The Compensation Fund\u2019s sources of revenue shall be specified in a subsequent Act.", "XIII. ...", "XIV. ...\"", "20. In three judgments of 9 April 1993 the Judicial Assembly of the Conseil d\u2019Etat decided that the State was wholly liable in respect of persons who were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus following transfusion of non-heat-treated blood products between 22 November 1984 and 20 October 1985.", "21. At the material time the Administrative Courts and Administrative Courts of Appeal Code contained, inter alia, the following provisions:", "\"Except in cases concerning public works, proceedings may not be instituted in the Administrative Court otherwise than in the form of an appeal against a decision; such an appeal shall be lodged within two months of the notification or the publication of the contested decision.", "Where no reply is forthcoming from the relevant authority for more than four months, that silence is to be construed as a decision rejecting the complaint.", "...\"", "\"The President of the Administrative Court or of the Administrative Court of Appeal, or a judge delegated by one of them, may, where the existence of an obligation cannot seriously be contested, award an advance to a creditor who has filed an application on the merits in the court in question. He may, even of his own motion, make the payment of the advance subject to the lodging of a security.\"", "\"Immediately after the application instituting the proceedings has been registered by the registry, the president of the court or, in Paris, the president of the division to which the application has been transmitted, shall appoint a rapporteur.", "Under the authority of the president of the court or division to which he belongs, the rapporteur He may request the parties to supply any evidence or documents relevant to the resolution of the dispute, which shall be added to the file so as to be accessible to all the parties.\"", "\"Where one of the parties or the administrative department has been asked to submit observations and has not complied with the time-limit laid down pursuant to Articles R.142 and R.147 of this code, the president of the court or division shall issue a formal notice to comply.", "In the event of force majeure, a final extension of time may be granted.", "If the formal notice to comply has no effect or if the final time-limit given is not complied with, the court shall give judgment.\"", "\"Where a final notice to comply relates to an administrative department of the State, it shall be sent to the authority with competence to represent the State; in other cases it shall be sent to the party or his representative if he has appointed one.\"", "\"A member of the Administrative Court or the Administrative Court of Appeal may be assigned by the competent court or by the latter\u2019s president to carry out any investigative measures other than those provided for in sections 1 to 4 of this chapter.\"", "22.
