TURKEY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens;Guido Raimondi;Helen Keller;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque", "TEXT": ["1. The applicant, Ms Ay\u015fe \u00c7i\u011fdem Besen, is a Turkish national who was born in 1960 and lives in \u0130stanbul. She was represented before the Court by Mr \u0130. D. G\u00f6kk\u0131l\u0131\u00e7, a lawyer practising in \u0130stanbul.", "3. On 17 June 2003 the applicant\u2019s mother had an endoscopy done in the American Hospital (a private hospital in Istanbul). It was discovered that she had a cancerous tumour in her stomach. She was referred to a doctor in the same hospital in order to have the cancerous tumour removed from her stomach.", "4. On 29 July 2003 the applicant signed the first consent form (of four), which reads as follows:", "\u201cI, the undersigned, hereby give consent to the surgical treatment to be administered for stomach cancer.", "I am aware that the below mentioned procedure is being planned and I am giving my free consent and authorisation for a \u201ctotal gastrectomy\u201d.", "I have been given by my doctor understandable information on my health condition, the surgery to be carried out, the risks and benefits connected therewith, the possible complications, the alternatives and the risks of not undergoing treatment.", "I know that the result cannot be guaranteed.", "In the event that an additional or other operation is needed other than those already planned, I am giving consent to those operations as well...\u201d", "5. On 30 July 2003 she was operated on (\u201cgastrectomy\u201d, \u201cesophagojejunostomy\u201d and \u201cjejunostomy\u201d were applied).", "6. On the third day after the surgery, an \u201canastomotic leakage\u201d was detected. On 16 August 2003 another surgery was performed by another doctor from outside the hospital for fistulas. The \u201comega esophagojejunostomy\u201d was converted into a \u201cRoux-en Y\u201d type reconstruction. Following this surgery a gastrointestinal haemorrhage occurred.", "7. On 18 August 2003 another operation (\u201claparotomy\u201d) was carried out to stop the bleeding, drain the blood and fix the leakage.", "8. On 24 August 2003 when a leakage of intestinal contents started in the patient\u2019s abdominal wound, another surgery was done (\u201claparotomy\u201d and \u201cdrainage\u201d).", "9. On 11 September 2003 a \u201cpercutaneous tracheostomy\u201d was performed.", "10. On 4 October 2003 the last operation was carried out for duodenal fistula and complications associated with laparotomy.", "11. On 11 October 2003 the patient developed \u201cpneumothorax\u201d.", "12. On 11 or 12 October 2003 the applicant\u2019s mother died of cardiac arrest resulting from multiple organ dysfunction. All attempts at resuscitation failed.", "13. On 8 April 2004 the applicant and her daughter instituted compensation proceedings against the Vehbi Ko\u00e7 Foundation American Hospital and nine doctors for having caused their mother and grand mother\u2019s death by negligence. On the same day, they also lodged a complaint with the public prosecutor of \u015ei\u015fli.", "14. The public prosecutor started an investigation into the death of the applicant\u2019s mother. As far as understood from the case file, the applicant, the doctor who had performed the first surgery, some other medical staff involved in the treatment of the applicant\u2019s mother, including the doctor who had carried out the operation on 16 August 2003, gave statements. An expert opinion dated 27 September 2006 was obtained from the Forensic Medicine Institute (3rd committee). Relying on the applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s medical history and witness evidence, it was concluded in the expert opinion that the treatment administered following the diagnosis of stomach cancer had been adequate and that the anastomotic leakage, which led to the death of the applicant\u2019s mother, had been a typical complication in this kind of surgery.", "15. On 27 October 2006 the public prosecutor gave a decision of non-prosecution based on the expert opinion, witness statements and the deceased\u2019s medical records. The objection filed against this decision was also dismissed on 6 December 2006.", "16. Subsequently, the \u015ei\u015fli Civil Court of General Jurisdiction appointed three professors from the Ankara University School of Medicine for another expert opinion. In this expert report, the experts observed the following:", "\u201cIt was the leakage after the first surgery that started the chain of events that led to the applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s death; the method to be used to close a surgical wound, namely stitching or stapling, is to be chosen by the surgeon depending on the circumstances. In view of the deceased\u2019s age, manual suturing could be considered as convenient. By the same token, in a total gastrectomy, it is for the surgeon to decide on the method to be applied in gastric reconstruction, either \u201cOmega\u201d or \u201cRoux-en Y\u201d type. That the leakage was noticed on the third day after the first operation showed that the follow-up of the patient had been duly carried out. An anastomotic leak is the major post-operative complication of a total gastrectomy, the incidence of which has been reported to be between 5 and 7.5 %. In the deceased\u2019s case, the anastomotic leakage began at an early stage in the post-operative period. Although this suggests technical incompetence, there is no evidence to that effect; the treatment to be administered for an anastomotic leakage is still debated. Treatment options range from conservative management to aggressive surgery. The course of treatment followed in the deceased\u2019s case seems to be appropriate and in line with the medical practice. Unfortunately, after all these complications, the development of multiple organ dysfunction could have been expected. There is no finding which might substantiate that the hospital and/or doctors involved in the treatment were at fault.\u201d", "17. On 25 November 2007 the applicant challenged the findings of the three professors and demanded that a new expert report should be obtained.", "18. Relying on the expert reports drawn up by the Forensic Medicine Institute and the three professors appointed from the Ankara University, the witness evidence, the medical records of the deceased and the investigation file of the Public Prosecutor, the first-instance court rejected the applicant\u2019s action on 25 December 2007 on the grounds that they had been duly informed of the procedure followed and that there was no fault attributable to the hospital or doctors.", "19. On 16 September 2008 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first instance court after having held a hearing. The applicant requested rectification. The Court of Cassation dismissed the request on 17 February 2009. The final decision was served on 10 March 2009."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
