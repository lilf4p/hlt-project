A refusal to renew a time-limit was subject to appeal.", "34. Article 292 of the Code provided for a one-month period for lodging appeals against decisions of the first-instance court and a fifteen-day period for appeal against its rulings. It further provided that these periods could be renewed if the court found valid reasons for their renewal.", "35. The new Code of Civil Procedure, as well as the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Code of Administrative Justice provide similar provisions as to the renewal of the procedural time-limits.
