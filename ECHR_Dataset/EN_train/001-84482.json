I reply as follows:", "...", "The medical documentation submitted shows that, as early as 2003, you were hospitalised in [Zagreb] Prison Hospital in connection with kidney stones, pain in the back and varicose veins on your right shin. It was recommended that surgery be carried out, you were put on the waiting list of the Rebro Hospital [in Zagreb] and that the exact date of the operation was to be communicated. Owing to repeated pain in the kidney area and in order to continue the treatment, in 2005 it was established that the stones were to be broken by ultrasound. You then reported to the Lepoglava [State] Prison infirmary and received regular therapy for pain. On 17 November 2005 you were offered hospitalisation. However, it was communicated from Zagreb Prison Hospital not to send you there because you were not to be operated. On 31 March 2006 you were seen by a urologist in Vara\u017edin, who established the cause of your kidney ailment and indicated that there was no need for urgent surgery. After that arrangements for your hospitalisation in [Zagreb] Prison Hospital took place and you were hospitalised from 26 October to 17 November 2006. There you were examined and laboratory [tests] showed toxic damage to your liver and the presence of stones in your kidneys. An x-ray showed that your heart and lungs were healthy and that you had so-called nephroliths in your kidneys.", "According to [Zagreb] Prison Hospital, all treatment available there had been exhausted and in order to continue your treatment in an outside hospital it was necessary for an agreement to be reached between the prison and the hospital. There was a possibility that surgery be carried out in [Zagreb] Prison Hospital at the same time as surgery for your varicose veins, which you declined. You were returned to the prison where it was recommended that a CT [computer tomography] of lumbosacral spine be carried out, and a prescription was issued in that connection on 20 November 2006. The doctor also recommended regular checks in the prison infirmary and regular intake of prescribed therapy, and that an arrangement be made between the prison and the [Zagreb] Prison Hospital for your hospitalisation and eventual surgery for the kidney stones.", "Therefore, your complaints concerning the alleged denial of hospital treatment are unfounded because the medical documentation shows that care was taken of your [need for] ambulant and hospital treatment. Your allegations concerning the prison authorities' hatred towards you are entirely unfounded.", "...\u201d", "21.
