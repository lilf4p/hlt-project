Furthermore, the Government stressed that the criminal investigation had obtained no information to confirm the applicants\u2019 allegations that the village had been \u201csealed off\u201d by servicemen or that a special operation had been carried out there at the time. The possibility could not be excluded, in their view, that the crime had been committed by members of the illegal armed groups who had entered the village.", "65. Despite specific requests by the Court on two occasions, the Government did not submit any documents from the file in criminal case nos. 23031 and 23034, except for a copy of the list of documents contained in it. Relying on the information obtained from the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, the Government stated that the investigation was in progress and that disclosure of the documents would be in violation of Article 161 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, since the file contained information of a military nature and personal data concerning the witnesses or other participants in the criminal proceedings and could prejudice the success of the investigation.", "66.
