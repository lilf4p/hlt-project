On 27 January 2004 the Malatia-Sebastia District Court of Yerevan found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to seven years in prison. The court also fully granted the victim's civil claim for damages. The court based its judgment on, inter alia, the statements of ten witnesses examined in court, including accountant K.S. and treasurer K.M, an act prepared by the tax authority specialists, two court-ordered accounting expert opinions, the statements of accounting experts V.A. and A.M., and a handwriting expert opinion.", "15. On 10 February 2004 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal (\u0540\u0540 \u0584\u0580\u0565\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576 \u0587 \u0566\u056b\u0576\u057e\u0578\u0580\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576 \u0563\u0578\u0580\u056e\u0565\u0580\u0578\u057e \u057e\u0565\u0580\u0561\u0584\u0576\u0576\u056b\u0579 \u0564\u0561\u057f\u0561\u0580\u0561\u0576). The applicant also submitted written explanations concerning the civil claim, in which he requested the Court of Appeal to call and examine the victim's accountant S.H. as a witness. He also requested that accountant K.S. and treasurer K.M. be called for additional examination. He further asked to call three other persons, K., H. and Z. To substantiate his request to have accountants S.H. and K.S. called and examined, the applicant submitted to the court two accounting reports prepared by them which, according to him, contained exculpatory information.", "16. On 19 March 2004 the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal held its first hearing. In the courtroom the applicant was placed in a metal cage which measured about 3 sq. m. The applicant was represented by two defence counsel. At the hearing, the applicant's defence counsel filed a motion with the court, arguing that the applicant's placement in a metal cage in the presence of many people, including relatives and friends, amounted to degrading treatment and humiliated him. Furthermore, this violated the principle of equality of arms, because the applicant, being in a cage, was not able to feel equal to the other parties. The fact that the applicant was a detainee was not sufficient justification to keep him in a metal cage during the court hearings. Nor did the law on arrested and detained persons prescribe placement of a detainee in a metal cage in the courtroom. The defence counsel requested the court to release the applicant from the cage and to allow him to be seated in the seats meant for the parties, namely next to his lawyer.", "17. The prosecutor objected to this motion, claiming that the law on arrested and detained persons said nothing about a defendant being released from the metal cage. Besides, the defendant was to be seated in the seat meant for him and that could not be regarded as violating his dignity. The victim's representative also objected to this motion, claiming that the applicant was a detainee, therefore he had to be kept in a metal cage. Furthermore, there were no requisite security measures in the courtroom.", "18. The Court of Appeal decided to refuse this motion as unsubstantiated, finding that the placement of the defendant in the seat meant for him during the court hearings did not violate the rights invoked by the defence. The court further stated that its decision was based on security considerations.", "19. During the entire proceedings before the Court of Appeal the applicant was kept in the metal cage. The proceedings lasted about two months and included at least twelve public hearings. According to the applicant, the hearings lasted on average about four hours. It appears that they were attended by the applicant's children, wife, siblings and friends, and other members of the public.", "20. At the hearing of 21 May 2004 the applicant repeated his request to call witnesses, made earlier in his written explanations. The Court of Appeal refused this request on the ground that accountant K.S. and treasurer K.M. had already been examined and made detailed statements during the investigation and the proceedings in the District Court. As to the accountant S.H., the court stated that it was unnecessary to call her in this particular case. As to K., H. and Z., the court stated that their identity was unknown.", "21. On 25 May 2004 the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal upheld the applicant's sentence. The Court of Appeal only partially granted the victim's civil claim, awarding him AMD 23,063,108 and USD 119,000.", "22. On 4 June 2004 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law.", "23.

As regards the complement in terms of doctors, the situation at Nubarashen ... [Prison] can be considered satisfactory. ...", "...", "108. The CPT is particularly concerned about the low number of qualified feldshers and the total lack of qualified nurses at the four establishments. Given the size and structure of the respective inmate populations (with rapid inmate turnover at the two pre-trial facilities and noticeable proportions of older prisoners at the two colonies), the CPT recommends that the nursing staff resources (i.e. feldshers and nurses) at the four establishments be increased.", "The CPT also wishes to stress that a person competent to provide first aid, preferably with a recognised nursing qualification, should always be present on prison premises, including at night and weekends.", "109. In the CPT's view, the employment of inmates as orderlies should be seen as a last resort, and prisoners should under no circumstances be involved in the distribution of medicines. Further, such persons should not be given access to medical files, nor should they be present during medical examinations. The Committee recommends that the position of the prisoners working as orderlies at Nubarashen ... [Prison] (as well as other penal establishments in Armenia) be reviewed, in the light of these considerations.", "110. The delegation heard very few complaints about access to the doctor (or, as in Gyumri, to the feldsher). However, at the four prisons, inmates complained about the standard of treatment and care, in particular as regards the range of medication prescribed and the quality of dental care (which appeared to be limited to extractions). At each of the establishments, the transfer of inmates to the Hospital for Prisoners in Yerevan, when required by their state of health, was said to be unproblematic. ...", "...", "113. The supply of basic medication and related materials was grossly insufficient at each of the establishments. This was hardly surprising, given the very limited budget for acquiring such items. In this regard, the health-care services concerned depended to a considerable extent on donations and inmates' own resources.", "Reference has already been made to the State's duty of care vis-\u00e0-vis persons deprived of their liberty, even in periods of serious economic difficulties ... The CPT recommends that the Armenian authorities take measures without delay to ensure the supply of appropriate medicines and related materials to the prisons visited and, if necessary, to other penitentiary establishments in Armenia.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
