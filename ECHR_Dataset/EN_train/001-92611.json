The applicant was born in 1964. He is currently serving a prison sentence.", "7. On 22 March 2000 the applicant was arrested. On 24 March 2000 he was remanded in custody by the Gliwice District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) on suspicion that he had killed his mother. His pretrial detention was subsequently extended by the Katowice Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) on 19 June 2000, by the Katowice Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) on 6 September 2000, by decisions of the Gliwice Regional Court of 5 March and 13 July 2001, and by decisions of the Katowice Court of Appeal of 13 March, 29 May, 10 July and 28 August 2002.", "8. The domestic courts justified the applicant\u2019s pretrial detention in its initial phase by the existence of strong evidence against him and the likelihood that a severe penalty would be imposed, as well as by the need to secure the proper course of the proceedings. During that time, an autopsy, a number of unspecified biological tests and an inspection of the crime scene were carried out. At the later stage of the applicant\u2019s detention, the authorities referred to the severity of the sentence likely to be imposed on him. In addition, they emphasised that the investigation could not be completed for reasons beyond the prosecutor\u2019s control, namely delays in obtaining expert reports and in viewing the applicant\u2019s testimony recorded on video tape.", "9. From 17 December 2001 until 2 January 2002 the applicant was concurrently serving a sentence of sixteen days\u2019 imprisonment, imposed on an unspecified date by the Zabrze District Court in another criminal case.", "10. The applicant\u2019s minor sons and his wife were witnesses in the investigation. In May 2002 the prosecutor decided that a psychologist should be present when the younger son was to be interviewed by the prosecution. Apparently the older son was also interviewed by the prosecutor on an unspecified date. The applicant submitted that his wife and two sons were not allowed, for an unspecified period, to communicate with him in writing or to visit him in prison. The prosecution relied on Article 217 of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences (see paragraph 30 below).", "11. The applicant was indicted on 20 November 2000. In the proceedings before the first- and second-instance courts he was represented by a legal-aid lawyer.", "12. On 14 August 2002 the Gliwice Regional Court convicted the applicant of murder and sentenced him to twelve years\u2019 imprisonment.", "13. On 19 December 2002 the Katowice Court of Appeal upheld that judgment. A copy of the judgment was served on the applicant on 17 January 2003.", "14. On 21 February 2003 the Katowice Court of Appeal appointed a legalaid lawyer for the purposes of the cassation proceedings.", "15. A copy of the judgment of 19 December 2002 was served on the legal-aid lawyer on 3 March 2003.", "16. By a letter of 20 March 2003 the lawyer informed the Katowice Court of Appeal that, in her opinion, a cassation appeal in the applicant\u2019s case lacked prospects of success and that she therefore refused to prepare and lodge one with the Supreme Court. By a letter of 27 March 2003 the Katowice Court of Appeal informed the applicant of the lawyer\u2019s refusal and, further, that no other legal-aid lawyer would be appointed for the purpose of lodging a cassation appeal in his case.", "17. The court\u2019s letter was served on the applicant by the prison administration on 1 April 2003.", "18. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of detention on remand (aresztowanie tymczasowe), the grounds for its extension, release from detention and rules governing other, so-called \u201cpreventive measures\u201d (\u015brodki zapobiegawcze) are stated in the Court\u2019s judgments in the cases of Go\u0142ek v. Poland, no. 31330/02, \u00a7\u00a7 27-33, 25 April 2006 and Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, \u00a7\u00a7 22-23, 4 August 2006.", "19. Under the Law of 6 June 1997 - Code of Criminal Procedure (\u201cthe Code\u201d), which entered into force on 1 September 1998, a party to criminal proceedings can lodge a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court against any final decision of an appellate court which had terminated criminal proceedings. The cassation appeal has to be lodged and signed by an advocate, on pain of being declared inadmissible. The relevant part of Article 523 \u00a7 1 of the Code provides:", "\u201cA cassation appeal may be lodged only on the grounds referred to in Article 439 [these include a number of procedural irregularities, such as, for instance, incorrect composition of the trial court; lack of legal assistance in cases where such assistance was compulsory; breach of the rules governing jurisdiction in criminal matters; trying a person in absentia in cases where his presence was obligatory and thus depriving him of an opportunity to defend himself, etc.] or on the ground of another flagrant breach of law provided that the judicial decision in question was affected as a result of that breach. A cassation appeal shall not lie against the severity of the penalty imposed (niewsp\u00f3\u0142mierno\u015bci kary).\u201d", "20. Pursuant to Article 524 \u00a7 1 of the Code, a cassation appeal has to be lodged with the appellate court competent to carry out an initial examination of its admissibility within thirty days from the date of service of the judgment of the appellate court with its written grounds on the party or, if the party has been represented, on his or her lawyer.", "21. Under Article 83 of the Code, an accused may appoint a lawyer to represent him or her in criminal proceedings. If he or she cannot afford lawyers\u2019 fees, a request for legal aid may be made under Article 78 of the Code.", "22. A grant of legal aid expires upon a judgment of an appellate court. A new decision on legal aid has to be made if the convicted person wishes to institute further proceedings in order to lodge a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court. The relevant part of Article 84 \u00a7 3 of the Code provides:", "\u201cA defence counsel appointed under the legalaid scheme in the cassation proceedings ... shall prepare and sign a cassation appeal ... or shall inform the court, in writing, that he or she has not found any grounds for lodging a cassation appeal ... If a cassation appeal ... is lodged, the defence counsel is entitled to represent the defendant in the subsequent proceedings.\u201d", "23. In its decision of 17 June 1997 (V KX 57/97, OSNKW 1997/9010/82) the Supreme Court stated that cassation proceedings had a special character in that the judgment essentially became final after it had been upheld by the appellate court. Bearing in mind the special character of these proceedings, the court was of the view that at this stage the mere fact that the convicted person was granted legal aid was sufficient to ensure an effective exercise of his or her defence rights. It was the lawyer\u2019s task to analyse the case and establish whether there were grounds on which to lodge a cassation appeal against the judgment of the appellate court. If the lawyer was of the opinion that there were no grounds on which to do so, there was no legal basis in the Code of Criminal Procedure that would either oblige the lawyer to prepare such an appeal against his or her better judgment, or oblige the court to assign another lawyer to prepare such an appeal in the case.", "24. In its decision of 25 March 1998 the Supreme Court stated that the refusal of a legalaid lawyer to lodge a cassation appeal did not constitute a valid ground for granting retrospective leave to lodge such an appeal by another lawyer out of time (V KZ 12/98). It confirmed this ruling in a further decision of 1 December 1999. The Supreme Court observed that the court could only assign a new legal-aid lawyer to the case if it were shown that the first lawyer had been negligent in his or her task of assessing whether a cassation appeal had any prospects of success. If this were not the case, a court was not obliged to assign a new legal-aid lawyer to represent the convicted person and its refusal was not subject to appeal (III KZ 139/99).", "25. In a later decision of 1 July 1999 the Supreme Court expressed the opinion that such negligence could be proved only in disciplinary proceedings instituted against a lawyer under the provisions of the Bar Act (V KZ 33/99).", "26. In its decisions of 13 March and 17 September 2002 the Supreme Court expressed the view that when a legal-aid lawyer refused to represent a convicted person before the Supreme Court, the appellate court was not obliged to assign a new lawyer to the case (II KZ 11/02, II KZ 36/02).", "27. On 26 February 2002 the Supreme Court changed its previous position concerning the date from which the timelimit for lodging of a cassation appeal started to run (see paragraph 20 above). It examined a particular situation where a legal-aid lawyer had refused to represent a convicted person for the purposes of cassation proceedings, finding that a cassation appeal would offer no prospects of success. It held that in such a situation the appellate court was obliged to instruct the defendant that the time-limit for lodging a cassation appeal started to run only on the date on which the defendant was served with the lawyer\u2019s refusal and not on the earlier date when the judgment of the appellate court was served on the defendant himself. It stated that it was not open to doubt that a defendant faced with the legal-aid lawyer\u2019s refusal had a right to take other measures to seek legal assistance necessary for an effective lodging of a cassation appeal (III KZ 87/01). The Supreme Court reiterated its position in a decision of 6 May 2008 and in a number of similar decisions given in 2008. It observed that there had been certain discrepancies in the judicial practice as to the manner in which the time-limit in such situations was calculated, but the strand of the case-law launched by the decision given in February 2002 was both dominant and correct, and also accepted by doctrine as providing to the defendants adequate procedural guarantees of access to the Supreme Court within a reasonable time-frame (II KZ 16/08).", "28. Rules relating to means of controlling correspondence of persons involved in criminal proceedings are set out in the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences (Kodeks karny wykonawczy) (\u201cthe 1997 Code\u201d) which entered into force on 1 September 1998.", "29. Article 214 \u00a7 1 reads as follows:", "\u201cUnless exceptions are provided for in the present Chapter, a detainee shall enjoy at least the same rights as those secured to a convicted person serving a sentence of imprisonment under the ordinary regime in a closed prison. No restrictions shall be applied to him except such as are necessary to secure the proper conduct of criminal proceedings, to maintain order and security in a remand centre and to prevent demoralisation of detainees.\u201d", "30. Article 217 \u00a7 1 reads, in so far as relevant, as follows:", "\u201c(...) detainee\u2019s correspondence shall be censored by [the authority at whose disposal he remains], unless the authority decides otherwise.\u201d", "This provision further provides that a detainee is allowed to receive visitors, provided that he has obtained permission from the investigating prosecutor (at the investigative stage) or from the trial court (once the trial has begun).", "31. On 1 September 1998 the Rules of Detention on Remand (Rozporz\u0105dzenie Ministra Sprawiedliwo\u015bci w sprawie regulaminu wykonywania tymczasowego aresztowania) entered into force. Paragraph 36 of the Rules provides:", "\u201cThe detainee\u2019s correspondence ... is dispatched through the intermediary of the authority at whose disposal he remains.\u201d", "32. In 1990, the UN adopted the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers (the Basic Principles). They provide, in particular:", "\u201c13. The duties of lawyers towards their clients shall include:", "(a) Advising clients as to their legal rights and obligations, and as to the working of the legal system in so far as it is relevant to the legal rights and obligations of the clients;", "(b) Assisting clients in every appropriate way, and taking legal action to protect their interests;", "(c) Assisting clients before courts, tribunals or administrative authorities, where appropriate.", "14. Lawyers, in protecting the rights of their clients and in promoting the cause of justice, shall seek to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms recognized by national and international law and shall at all times act freely and diligently in accordance with the law and recognized standards and ethics of the legal profession.", "15. Lawyers shall always loyally respect the interests of their clients.", "33. A number of recommendations have been adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe with regard to access to justice and the provision of legal-aid services. In particular, Recommendation No. R (81) 7 on measures facilitating access to justice provides:", "\u201c4. No litigant should be prevented from being assisted by a lawyer. The compulsory recourse of a party to the services of an unnecessary plurality of lawyers for the need of a particular case is to be avoided. Where, having regard to the nature of the matter involved, it would be desirable, in order to facilitate access to justice, for an individual to put his own case before the courts, then representation by a lawyer should not be compulsory.\u201d", "\u201cRecalling that in addition to the right of access to the law and to justice provided for in Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the other provisions of the Convention and particularly Articles 2, 3 and 8 are equally applicable to the very poor, as are the other legal instruments of the Council of Europe such as the European Social Charter;", "Considering that this recommendation is intended to improve, especially with regard to the very poor, existing legal advice and legal aid systems, and therefore to complement existing machinery with regard to the other categories of people for which the systems were designed.", "Recommends that the governments of member states:", "1. Facilitate access to the law for the very poor (\u201cthe right to the protection of the law\u201d) by: ...", "b. promoting legal advice services for the very poor; ...", "3. Facilitate effective access to the courts for the very poor, especially by the following means:", "c. recognising the right to be assisted by an appropriate counsel, as far as possible of one\u2019s choice, who will receive adequate remuneration;", "e. simplifying the procedure for granting legal aid to the very poor, [...]\u201d", "\u201cThe Committee of Ministers, under the terms of Article 15.b of the Statue of the Council of Europe, [...]", "Underlining the fundamental role that lawyers and professional associations of lawyers also play in ensuring the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms; [...]", "Considering that access to justice may require persons in an economically weak position to obtain the services of lawyers,", "Recommends the governments of member States to take or reinforce, as the case may be, all measures they consider necessary with a view to the implementation of the principles contained in this Recommendation.", "1. All necessary measures should be taken to respect, protect and promote the freedom of exercise of the profession of lawyer without discrimination and without improper interference from the authorities or the public, in particular in the light of the relevant provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights.", "1. All necessary measures should be taken to ensure that all persons have effective access to legal services provided by independent lawyers,", "2. Lawyers should be encouraged to provide legal services to persons in an economically weak position.", "3. Governments of member States should, where appropriate to ensure effective access to justice, ensure that effective legal services are available to persons in an economically weak position, in particular to persons deprived of their liberty.", "4. Lawyers\u2019 duties towards their clients should not be affected by the fact that fees are paid wholly or in part from the public funds.\u201d", "36. On 6 June 2007 the Committee of Ministers adopted an Interim Resolution concerning the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in 44 cases against Poland relating to the excessive length of detention on remand (\u201cthe 2007 Resolution\u201d). Noting that the number of cases in which the European Court had found violations of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention against Poland was constantly increasing, it concluded that this revealed a structural problem. A more detailed rendition of the 2007 Resolution can be found in the Court\u2019s judgment given in the case of Kauczor v. Poland (see Kauczor v. Poland, no. 45219/06, \u00a7 34, 3 February 2009; not final).", "37. On 20 June 2007 the Council of Europe\u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights released a Memorandum to the Polish Government concerning, among other issues, the use of the detention measure in Poland, stressing that examples of cases brought to the Court where pre-trial detention had lasted between 4 to 6 years were not uncommon. The Commissioner urged the Polish authorities to review the application and functioning of pre-trial detention in Polish law. A more detailed rendition of the relevant parts of the Memorandum can be found in the above mentioned Kauczor judgment (see Kauczor v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 35)."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3", "6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
