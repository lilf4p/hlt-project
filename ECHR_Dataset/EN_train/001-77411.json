The Military Public Prosecutor noted that, despite the allegations that Arslan Y\u0131ld\u0131z could have been taken away or killed by the security forces conducting operations in the region, there was no eye-witness and that the overall evidence given by the witnesses consisted of hearsay. He therefore considered that it was impossible to hold the security forces responsible for the killing of Arslan Y\u0131ld\u0131z on the basis of hearsay evidence. In light of the evidence contained in the investigation file, the Military Public Prosecutor concluded that Arslan Y\u0131ld\u0131z had been killed by members of the terrorist organisations.

The security forces had not destroyed any property or forced the applicants to leave their village. Furthermore, the applicants had not filed any complaint with the authorities concerning the alleged destruction of their property and their forced eviction from Karao\u011flan. Thus no investigation had been carried out into these allegations which had only been submitted to the European Court.", "Currently there was no obstacle preventing villagers from returning to their homes and possessions in their villages. Persons who had left their villages as a result of terrorism had already started returning and renewing their activities in their villages.", "On 14 July 2004 the Law on Compensation for Losses resulting from Terrorism and the Fight against Terrorism was passed by the Grand National Assembly and entered into force on 27 July 2004 (\u201cCompensation Law\u201d). That Law provided for a sufficient remedy capable of redressing the Convention grievances of persons who were denied access to their possessions in their villages.", "In that connection Damage Assessment and Compensation Commissions were set up in seventy-six provinces. Persons who had suffered damage as a result of terrorism or of measures taken by the authorities to combat terrorism could lodge an application with the relevant compensation commission claiming compensation.", "The number of persons applying to these commissions had already attained approximately 187,000. A further 800 persons, whose applications were pending before the Court, had also applied to the compensation commissions. Many villagers had already been awarded compensation for the damage they had sustained.", "A description of the relevant domestic law can be found in the Court\u2019s decision of Ayd\u0131n \u0130\u00e7yer v.
