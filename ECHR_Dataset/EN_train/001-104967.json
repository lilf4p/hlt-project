The appellants had requested the Municipal Court to order the company to pay them monthly paid leave benefits. The Municipal Court and District Court in Novi Pazar had rejected their respective claims because, inter alia, they had already claimed their entitlement under the redundancy programme. The Constitutional Court found that the employees were entitled to enjoy the rights arising from both the redundancy programme and the outstanding claims from their employment, prior to its termination. Thus, the bare fact that the appellants in those cases had agreed to enjoy benefits from the redundancy programme could not be interpreted to mean that they had waived the right to the monthly paid leave benefits previously due, and the courts had to examine whether those benefits had indeed been paid or not."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
