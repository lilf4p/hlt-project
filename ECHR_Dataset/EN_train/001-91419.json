[The second, seventh, eighth applicants and Mr K.] were questioned as witnesses. Requests for certain investigative measures were sent. According to the Urus-Martan district department of the FSB, they had not apprehended [Mr Ilias] Sagayev or taken him to their premises. Similar responses were received from the Urus-Martan district military commander\u2019s office, the head of military unit no. 6779, the operational-search bureau of the Ministry of the Interior, district prosecutor\u2019s offices and the Department of the Interior of the Chechen Republic.", "On 2 November 2002 [the first applicant] ... was granted victim status.", "In the course of the investigation [the perpetrators] were not identified and the whereabouts of [Mr Ilias] Sagayev [were not established], as a result of which the investigation was repeatedly suspended on account of [the failure to identify the person] to be charged with the offence. The investigation was suspended for the last time on 6 July 2005.", "At the same time, the materials in the case file show that the investigator failed to take all the investigative measures necessary to establish the whereabouts of the abducted person and to identify the perpetrators.

Following the delivery of the judgment, on 9 September 2005 the first applicant requested the Urus-Martan District Prosecutor\u2019s Office to give him access to materials in case file no. 61121 and to allow him to make copies of relevant documents. His request was refused. The first applicant complained to the Urus-Martan Town Court against the refusal.", "72. On 23 December 2005 the Urus-Martan Town Court dismissed the complaint. The first applicant appealed.", "73. On 8 February 2006 the Supreme Court of the Chechen Republic dismissed his appeal. It noted that Article 42 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provided that a victim could only inspect records pertaining to investigative actions in which he had participated. He could inspect the entire case file once the investigation had been completed. Since the investigation in case no. 61121 was still pending, the refusal of the Urus-Martan District Prosecutor\u2019s Office to provide the applicant with access to the entire case file was lawful.", "74. On 27 September 2005 the fourth applicant filed a complaint with the Urus-Martan Town Court concerning the inaction of the investigating authorities and their failure to give her access to case file no. 61126. In her complaint she stated that Mr Yunadi Sagayev had been apprehended by servicemen who had arrived on APCs.", "75. On 28 October 2005 the Urus-Martan Town Court upheld her complaint.

It further noted that in the course of the investigation the first, second, third and fourth applicants, Ms L. S. and Ms R. B. had been questioned as witnesses. In reply to requests for information the Urus-Martan district department of the FSB had stated that they had not apprehended Mr Yunadi Sagayev or taken him to their premises.

On 18 November 2005 the Urus-Martan District Prosecutor\u2019s Office refused the request on the ground that in accordance with Article 42 of the Code of Criminal Procedure a victim could only inspect records pertaining to investigative actions in which he had participated.", "79. Despite a specific request by the Court, the Government did not submit copies of the investigation files in cases nos. 61121 and 61126 concerning the abduction of Mr Ilias Sagayev and Mr Yunadi Sagayev. They submitted ninety pages of case-file materials containing decisions to institute, suspend and resume the investigation and to grant victim status. The Government stated that the investigation was in progress and that disclosure of the documents would be in violation of Article 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, since the file contained information of a military nature and personal data concerning the witnesses or other participants in the criminal proceedings.
