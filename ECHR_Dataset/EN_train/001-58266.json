The applicant is a Slovak citizen, born in 1925 and resident in \u010cadca.", "6. In 1976 the applicant\u2019s legal capacity was restricted. In 1983 the \u010cadca District Court (Okresn\u00fd s\u00fad - \u201cthe District Court\u201d) deprived the applicant of legal capacity entirely on the ground that he suffered from an explosive and vexatious form of paranoid psychosis. The District Court noted that the applicant had been undergoing out-patient psychiatric treatment for twenty years and that his personality had been deteriorating due to an increased syndrome of dementia.", "7. On 18 February 1987 the District Court started, at the applicant\u2019s request of 2 February 1987, proceedings pursuant to Section 81 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph 41 below) with a view to determining whether the applicant\u2019s legal capacity could be restored. The applicant refused to be examined by several experts and on 23 February 1989 the District Court decided that legal capacity could not be restored to him.", "8. On 30 May 1990 the Supreme Court (Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad) quashed the judgment on the ground that the District Court had not obtained an expert opinion as required by the law. The Supreme Court pointed out that the District Court had failed to avail itself of its rights under Section 52 of the Code of Civil Procedure and that it had disregarded, inter alia, Sections 6, 127 (1) and 187 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure in conjunction with Section 10 (1) of the Civil Code. It ordered the District Court to examine the case again on the basis of a relevant expert opinion. The District Court appointed an expert on 26 June 1990.", "9. As the applicant refused to be examined as an out-patient, the expert informed the District Court that an objective assessment of the applicant\u2019s health required an in-patient examination.", "10. On 1 April 1992 the District Court ordered that the applicant should be examined in a mental hospital pursuant to Section 187 (3) of the Code of Civil Procedure and appointed a new expert.

On 30 November 1992 the Regional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal against the District Court\u2019s decision of 1 April 1992 as the applicant lacked standing to lodge it. The Regional Court held that an examination in a hospital was necessary within the meaning of Section 187 (3) of the Code of Civil Procedure as the applicant had refused to be examined by an expert.", "18. On 19 April 1993 the \u010cadca District Office informed the District Court that it agreed to legal capacity being restored to the applicant.", "19. On 3 May 1993 the District Court invited the applicant to come to the mental hospital in Su\u010dany on 12 May 1993.

On 19 August 1993 two policemen brought the applicant to the hospital in Su\u010dany under an order by the president of the District Court. After a short period the applicant started co-operating with the expert. The examination was completed and the applicant was released from the hospital on 2 September 1993.", "21. In his opinion submitted on 29 October 1993 the expert noted that the applicant, who had undergone a brain operation in 1984 and had had several heart attacks, suffered from a vexatious form of paranoid psychosis, from an organic psychosyndrome and from a heart disease. The expert concluded that legal capacity could partially be restored to the applicant and recommended a re-examination after two or three years.", "22. On 23 November 1993 the District Court, following the expert\u2019s opinion, restricted the applicant\u2019s legal capacity in that he was not entitled to act before public authorities on his own, to conclude contracts, to assume obligations in writing and to work regularly.", "23.

On 8 December 1994 the Regional Court addressed the request directly to the District Office.", "26.

In view of the time which had elapsed after the delivery of the first instance judgment, the Regional Court considered it necessary to update the expert opinion.", "30. On 5 February 1996 the District Court decided to obtain a second expert opinion on the applicant\u2019s mental health and adjourned the proceedings.", "31.

On 22 November 1996 the head of the \u010cadca District Office asked the District Court to discharge the District Office of the applicant\u2019s guardianship.

Upon the latter\u2019s proposal a court can order an examination of the person concerned in a hospital for no longer than three months if it is considered necessary for the determination of his or her state of health (Section 187 (3)).", "42. When a court examines the question whether legal capacity can be restored to a person, it is not bound by the parties\u2019 submissions. It may quash the original decision on deprivation or restriction of legal capacity. The court may also restrict a person\u2019s legal capacity to such an extent as it deems it necessary even if it was not requested in the action or, as the case may be, in the initiative upon which it started the proceedings (Collection of judicial decisions and opinions, No. R 2/1984).", "43.
