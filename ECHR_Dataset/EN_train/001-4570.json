HUNGARY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Marc Fischbach", "TEXT": ["The applicant, born in 1968, is an Iraqi national. When introducing his application, he was held at the Communal Accommodation of the Budapest Border Guards Directorate, located on the premises of the Budapest Ferihegy Airport. Before the Court he is represented by Mr. J. Somogyi, a lawyer practising in Budapest and acting on behalf the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, and by Mr. F. K\u0151szeg, the executive director of the Helsinki Committee.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "A.", "On 14 December 1998 the applicant arrived at the Budapest Ferihegy II Airport from Cairo. His Iraqi passport contained a transit visa for Hungary issued by the Hungarian Embassy in Amman, Jordan. He possessed an Amman-Cairo-Budapest return flight ticket. At the immigration control a border guard expert found that it was likely that the applicant\u2019s passport had been falsified. The applicant\u2019s entry was therefore denied and his return to Egypt was ordered. Subsequently he lodged a request for recognition as a refugee.", "On 15 December 1998 the applicant, who had meanwhile been committed to the Communal Accommodation of the Budapest Border Guards Directorate, was heard by an officer of the Border Guards Directorate in the presence of an interpreter.", "On 16 December 1998 the applicant was heard by the Office for Refugees and Migration Affairs (\u201cthe Office\u201d). In these proceedings the applicant, assisted by an interpreter, stated that in 1991 his late father, once belonging to the opposition in Iraq, had been arrested and executed in July 1992. Following the arrest of their father, the applicant\u2019s two brothers had fled from Iraq. In connection with his father\u2019s political activity, the applicant had been arrested in March 1991 and had been detained until late 1992, during which period he had regularly been subjected to interrogation by means of electric shocks. Following his release he had been under surveillance by the Iraqi security service. In 1995 he had obtained a passport with an exit visa and left Iraq for Jordan where he had spent one month being under constant surveillance by Iraqi agents. On his return to Iraq he had been detained again for about a month and interrogated by the Iraqi security service concerning his contacts with his late father\u2019s political allies in Jordan.", "On 22 December 1998 the Office dismissed the applicant\u2019s request for recognition as a refugee as unsubstantiated. The decision specified that a subsequent action to challenge the lawfulness of the administrative proceedings before the civil courts would be of no suspensive effect concerning the applicant\u2019s return to Egypt as ordered. On the same day, the Communal Accommodation was designated as the applicant\u2019s compulsory place of residence.", "On 30 December 1998 the applicant brought an action before the Budapest Regional Court to challenge the decision of 22 December 1998 concerning the dismissal of his request for asylum. These proceedings are still pending.", "Meanwhile, apparently during the night 31 December 1998 to 1 January 1999 the Hungarian authorities attempted to return the applicant to Amman via Cairo. Having been denied entry to Egypt, he was, however, returned to Hungary on 2 January 1999. On the same day a meeting between the applicant and the Iraqi consul in Budapest took place on the premises of the Border Guards Directorate.", "On 18 January 1999 the Border Guards Directorate requested the Office to form an opinion as to any reasons excluding the applicant\u2019s deportation.", "On 25 January 1999 the Office informed the Border Guards Directorate that it held that, in pursuance of S. 32 \u00a7 1 of the 1993 Aliens Act, the applicant could not be deported to Iraq or Egypt.", "B.
