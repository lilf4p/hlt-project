The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Bielsko-Bia\u0142a, Poland.", "6. On 15 March 2000 the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having committed homicide. On 16 March 2000 the \u017bywiec District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) ordered that he be detained on remand in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence in question, the serious nature of that offence, the severity of the anticipated penalty and the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation, in particular the process of obtaining evidence.", "7. During the investigation the applicant\u2019s detention was extended on several occasions. He filed numerous but unsuccessful applications for release and appealed, likewise unsuccessfully, against the decisions prolonging his detention. The applicant made repeated applications for release on personal grounds, submitting that he had to secure the care and wellbeing of his 3 year old son. He also contested the reasonableness of the charge against him, maintaining that it was solely based on evidence from his common-law wife who was his alleged accomplice.", "8. On 7 June 2000 the Bielsko-Bia\u0142a Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) prolonged his detention until 15 September 2000. On 8 September 2000 it ordered that he be kept in custody until 15 December 2000. On 6 December 2000 it extended that period until 15 March 2001. The court reiterated the grounds originally given for the applicant\u2019s detention. It also considered that the need to take further evidence from experts justified the continuation of that measure.", "9. On 1 March 2001 the applicant, together with his common-law wife, was indicted on charges of homicide, attempted homicide, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, uttering threats, theft, burglary, fraud and illegally possessing explosives and dangerous substances before the Bielsko-Bia\u0142a Regional Court. In all, 24 charges were brought against the applicant. The prosecution asked the court to hear evidence from 95 witnesses.", "10. The Regional Court continually prolonged the applicant\u2019s detention pending trial. On 7 March 2001 it extended his detention until 30 June 2001.", "11. On 7 June 2001 the trial court dismissed the applicant\u2019s request of 5 June 2001 to sever his case and assign it to a separate set of proceedings. It adjourned the hearing due to the absence of the co-defendant\u2019s counsel.", "12. Subsequently, the applicant\u2019s detention was prolonged on 25 June and 26 November 2001. The court held that the grounds originally given for his detention were still valid. It stressed the strong likelihood that the applicant had committed the offences in question.", "13. In the meantime, on 6 July 2001, the applicant had unsuccessfully challenged the composition of the court.", "14. On 18 July 2001 he requested the trial court to appoint him a new legal aid counsel.", "15.

In the meantime, the hearings listed for 15 November and 12 December 2001 were cancelled due to the illness of the judge.", "18. Subsequently, as the length of the applicant\u2019s detention reached the statutory time-limit of 2 years laid down in Article 263 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Kodeks post\u0119powania karnego), the Regional Court made 4 applications to the Katowice Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny), asking for the applicant\u2019s detention to be prolonged beyond that term. The Court of Appeal granted those applications on 13 March 2002 (extending the applicant\u2019s detention until 5 October 2002), on 2 October 2002 (extending his detention until 5 March 2003), on 26 February 2003 (prolonging that term until 31 May 2003) and on 21 May 2003 (ordering his continued detention until 31 August 2003). In all those decisions the Court of Appeal considered that the original grounds given for the applicant\u2019s detention were still valid.", "19. The applicant\u2019s numerous applications for release and his appeals against the detention decisions were to no avail.", "20. Between March and September 2002, the trial court listed 10 hearings. The applicant and his lawyer were present at all the hearings. During this period the applicant on several occasions refused to participate in the trial, on two occasions he challenged the composition of the court.

The hearing scheduled for 13 March 2003 had to be adjourned due to the applicant\u2019s absence. Further hearings were held on: 8 and 17 April, 6, 7 and 28 May, 3 and 10 June 2003. The applicant and his counsel were present at the hearings. As of April 2003 the court had heard evidence from 85 witnesses.", "24.

On 24 June 2004 the Katowice Court of Appeal upheld the firstinstance judgment.", "26. On 12 October 2004 the applicant lodged a cassation appeal.", "27.

Article 249 \u00a7 1 sets out the general grounds for imposition of the preventive measures. That provision reads:", "\u201cPreventive measures may be imposed in order to ensure the proper conduct of proceedings and, exceptionally, also in order to prevent an accused\u2019s committing another, serious offence; they may be imposed only if evidence gathered shows a significant probability that an accused has committed an offence.\u201d", "29. Article 258 lists grounds for detention on remand. It provides, in so far as relevant:", "\u201c1. Detention on remand may be imposed if:", "(1) there is a reasonable risk that an accused will abscond or go into hiding, in particular when his identity cannot be established or when he has no permanent abode [in Poland];", "(2) there is a justified fear that an accused will attempt to induce [witnesses or co-defendants] to give false testimony or to obstruct the proper course of proceedings by any other unlawful means;", "2. If an accused has been charged with a serious offence or an offence for the commission of which he may be liable to a statutory maximum sentence of at least 8 years\u2019 imprisonment, or if a court of first instance has sentenced him to at least 3 years\u2019 imprisonment, the need to continue detention to ensure the proper conduct of proceedings may be based on the likelihood that a severe penalty will be imposed.\u201d", "30. The Code sets out the margin of discretion as to the continuation of a specific preventive measure. Article 257 reads, in so far as relevant:", "\u201c1. Detention on remand shall not be imposed if another preventive measure is sufficient.\u201d", "Article 259, in its relevant part, reads:", "\u201c1. If there are no special reasons to the contrary, detention on remand shall be lifted, in particular if depriving an accused of his liberty would:", "(1) seriously jeopardise his life or health; or", "(2) entail excessively harsh consequences for the accused or his family.\u201d", "31. The 1997 Code not only sets out maximum statutory time-limits for detention on remand but also, in Article 252 \u00a7 2, lays down that the relevant court \u2013 within those time-limits \u2013 must in each detention decision determine the exact time for which detention shall continue.", "32. Article 263 sets out time-limits for detention. In the version applicable up to 20 July 2000 it provided:", "\u201c1.

The whole period of detention on remand until the date on which the first conviction at first instance is imposed may not exceed 2 years.", "4. Only the Supreme Court may, on application made by the court before which the case is pending or, at the investigation stage, on application made by the Prosecutor General, prolong detention on remand for a further fixed period exceeding the periods referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3, when it is necessary in connection with a stay of the proceedings, a prolonged psychiatric observation of the accused, a prolonged preparation of an expert report, when evidence needs to be obtained in a particularly complex case or from abroad, when the accused has deliberately prolonged the proceedings, as well as on account of other significant obstacles that could not be overcome.\u201d", "33. On 20 July 2000 paragraph 4 was amended and since then the competence to prolong detention beyond the time-limits set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 has been vested with the court of appeal within whose jurisdiction the offence in question has been committed."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
