RUSSIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 3;Violation of Art. 5-3", "JUDGES": "Anatoly Kovler;Christos Rozakis;Elisabeth Steiner;Julia Laffranque;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["5. The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Rostov-on-Don.", "6. On 12 February 2004 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant, at the material time Deputy Head of the Transport Safety Department, and he was arrested on suspicion of bribe-taking. The arrest took place in the absence of the lawyer. A search was carried out at the flat where he was staying. The applicant was released on the same day.", "7. The applicant challenged the lawfulness of the institution of the criminal proceedings against him and of his arrest. However, on 3 August 2004 and 8 February 2005 respectively the Rostov Regional Court in the final instance dismissed his claims.", "8. The applicant further challenged the lawfulness of the search carried out at his flat. On 14 February 2004 the Leninskiy District Court of Rostov-on-Don held that the search had been carried out in compliance with the domestic law. The applicant alleged that he had not been informed of the above decision until 18 May 2004. Thus, he had been prevented from lodging an ordinary appeal against it. Later, the applicant tried to initiate a supervisory review of the decision of 14 February 2004. However, on 31 May 2004 the Rostov Regional Court found that there were no grounds for quashing the decision of 14 February 2004.", "9. On 10 March 2004 the Leninskiy District Court of Rostov-on-Don remanded the applicant in custody. The decision read as follows:", "\u201c... From the material submitted by the prosecution, it follows that [the applicant] was charged with several particularly serious offences, and there are grounds to suspect him of having committed other similar crimes ... Besides, as it follows from the submitted material, during the search carried out at the applicant\u2019s flat on 12 February 2004, [the applicant\u2019s wife] went to the balcony and threw out [documents], suggesting that she was therefore trying to hide material evidence from the investigation ... This gives grounds to believe that, if not detained, [the applicant] may interfere with the proper administration of justice by destroying or hiding evidence, preventing the investigative authorities from uncovering other instances of his illegal activities, as well as putting pressure on those witnesses who had not yet been identified or questioned.", "[The applicant] did not provide any medical documents certifying that his state of health prevented him from being held in detention ...\u201d", "10. The applicant\u2019s detention interrupted the inpatient treatment he had meanwhile been undergoing for an aggravated chronic kidney condition (acute pyelonephritis).", "11. On 22 March 2004, on appeal, the Rostov Regional Court upheld the detention order of 10 March 2004, finding that it had been lawful and justified.", "12. On 7 May 2004 the Leninskiy District Court, citing the gravity of the charges against the applicant, extended his detention until 12 June 2004. On 19 May 2004, on appeal, the Rostov Regional Court upheld the above decision.", "13. On 9 June 2004 the Leninskiy District Court extended the applicant\u2019s detention until 12 August 2004. The court held as follows:", "\u201c... [The applicant] is charged with several particularly grave crimes committed by an organised group; until now, the investigating authorities have not identified all those involved in the criminal activities in respect of which [the applicant] has been charged; [the applicant] knows the persons in question. In view of the above, the court considers that, if not detained, the applicant might threaten witnesses and destroy the evidence, thereby obstructing justice ...\u201d", "14. The applicant appealed, claiming that the above decision was groundless. In particular, the applicant did not know any of the witnesses, all the relevant documents were seized by the investigating authorities, the applicant was suspended from work, his access to documents was restricted and the key to his office was confiscated. Furthermore, the applicant stated that he had no criminal record, that he had a permanent place of residence and a family, that, prior to his detention, he had been undergoing medical treatment for pyelonephritis but that the treatment had been interrupted and thus the condition had been aggravated and that others involved in the case had been given more lenient preventive measures.", "15. On 30 June 2004, on appeal, the Rostov Regional Court upheld the lawfulness of the decision of 9 June 2004 without considering the arguments put forward by the applicant.", "16. On 10 August, 8 September and 9 November 2004 the Leninskiy District Court extended the applicant\u2019s detention until 12 September, 12 November and 12 December 2004 respectively. The court again referred to the gravity of the charges against the applicant and the risk that he might put pressure on witnesses or otherwise obstruct justice.", "17. On 25 August, 20 September and 19 November 2004 respectively, the Rostov Regional Court upheld the above decisions on appeal.", "18. On 10 December 2004 the pre-trial investigation was completed and the criminal case against the applicant and four other co-defendants was referred for trial to the Rostov Regional Court. The applicant remained in detention.", "19. On 21 December 2004 the Rostov Regional Court scheduled a preliminary hearing for 29 December 2004. The issue of the applicant\u2019s detention was left unexamined.", "20. On 29 December 2004 the Rostov Regional Court adjourned the preliminary hearing until 12 January 2005. The issue of the applicant\u2019s detention was again left unexamined.", "21. On 12 January 2005 the Rostov Regional Court held the preliminary hearing, and on 13 January 2005 the court ordered that the preventive measure applied to the applicant should remain unchanged.", "22. On 1 March 2005 the applicant made an application for release, which on 2 March 2005 was dismissed by the Rostov Regional Court with reference to the absence of sufficient grounds for altering the preventive measure.", "23. On 7 June 2005 the Rostov Regional Court maintained the applicant\u2019s custodial measure and extended it until 11 September 2005. The court reasoned its decision by the fact that the criminal case against the applicant was being examined at the final stage of the judicial investigation, that the applicant was charged with several particularly serious offences and that, if released, he might abscond or otherwise obstruct the administration of justice.", "24. On 11 August 2005, on appeal, the Supreme Court of Russia upheld the lawfulness of the above extension order.", "25. Prior to the applicant\u2019s trial, some details of the applicant\u2019s criminal case were disclosed by the local media.", "26. On 8 September 2005 the Rostov Regional Court convicted the applicant of abuse of office, bribe-taking and forgery and sentenced him to eight years\u2019 imprisonment.", "27. On 22 December 2005 the Supreme Court of Russia modified the qualification of the crimes committed by the applicant and reduced the sentence to four years\u2019 imprisonment.", "28. From 15 March 2004 to 21 April 2006 the applicant had been held in remand prison IZ-61/1 of Rostov-on-Don (\u0421\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0418\u0437\u043e\u043b\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0418\u0417-61/1 \u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0431\u044b \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043e \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438).
