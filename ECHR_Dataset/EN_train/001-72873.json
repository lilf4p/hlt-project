The applicant was born in 1977 and lives in Budapest.", "5. On 26 February 2002 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant, a college student, on a charge of extortion, which had allegedly been committed the day before. On 27 February 2002 he was arrested.", "6. On 28 February 2002 the Budapest Police Department heard the applicant, explaining that criminal proceedings were being conducted against him and three other defendants on suspicion of having participated in the sequestration and beating of a certain Mr K., and of having forced him to sign a false statement of debt, conduct punishable under sections 175 and 323 of the Criminal Code.", "7. Between 27 February 2002 and 21 March 2003, the defendants were interrogated on several occasions; moreover, several confrontations took place between the defendants themselves and between them and the victim.

The police were collecting evidence from banks, telephone companies, the land registry and the register of passenger cars.", "8. Meanwhile, on 2 March 2002 the Pest Central District Court ordered the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention, referring to the danger of his absconding, in particular in view of the fact that he had not been living at his registered address for more than two years.

On 24 July 2003 the Budapest Regional Court ordered the applicant\u2019s release on bail.

In response to complaints filed by the applicant\u2019s father, the Penitentiary Supervisory Department of the Attorney General\u2019s Office specified that the applicant had been committed to the IMEI on medical grounds, since he had shown psychotic symptoms at the Budapest Penitentiary; that, after examinations, the IMEI were of the opinion that his further treatment was necessary; and that forensic experts had repeatedly examined him. On 9 December 2003 the Budapest Court of Appeal confirmed the applicant\u2019s committal to the IMEI.", "19. On 28 October and 3 December 2003, the applicant\u2019s detention was again prolonged by the Regional Court on the ground of a risk of absconding, given the seriousness of the charges against him.
