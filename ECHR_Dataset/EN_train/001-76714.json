The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Kyiv.", "6. The applicant was an editor-in-chief of the Ukrainian daily newspaper Polityka. The periodical has ceased publication.", "7. On 2 July 1997 the applicant published an article about Mr V. Durdynets, who at that time was the acting Prime Minister of Ukraine. The article was entitled \u201cDurdintsovshchina\u201d (the first article) and described the dismissal of Mr A. Stoginenko, the President of the Black Sea Shipping Company (\u0427\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e, hereinafter the \u201cBSSC\u201d), a State-owned enterprise. The applicant alleged that Mr Durdynets dismissed Mr Stoginenko because of his involvement in financing the Polityka. The relevant extracts from the article were as follows:", "\u201cWho could imagine that a former Komsomol bureaucrat, police pen-pusher and near-political schemer would occupy today one of the highest posts in the Government? The press is what the sinister Premier hates the most, as he fears public opinion. He did not forget that in March this year our newspaper accused him of plotting against Prime Minister Lazarenko. And as soon as he got the chance, he triggered the punitive mechanisms to suppress the independent media. For instance, he accused Alekzandr Stroginenko, the President of the Black Sea Shipping Company, of financing Polityka. Stroginenko\u2019s \u201cerror\u201d was that he had concluded a contract with us to issue promotional materials for the BSSC. The newspaper spent tens of thousand dollars from its own pocket, but has not yet received full payment for the published materials.", "Without waiting for the results of a ministerial inquiry, on Monday before last, the acting Prime Minister, in the absence of both the President, who was in New York, and the Prime Minister, who was hospitalised, summoned the Cabinet of Ministers and forced a decision to dismiss the president of the BSSC.\u201d", "8. On 16 July 1997 the applicant published an article entitled \u201cSave the barbed wire, citizen Durdinets\u201d (\u042d\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u044c\u0442\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0443\u044e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0443, \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d \u0414\u0443\u0440\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0446 \u2013 the second article), where he stated that Mr Durdinets had personally instructed the General Prosecutor to institute criminal proceedings against him. The relevant extracts from the article read as follows:", "\u201c...As we have learned, immediately after the release of the article [Durdintsovshchina], Durdinets summoned the General Prosecutor, Grigory Vorsinov, to his office and, showing him the newspaper, demanded that criminal proceedings for defamation be instituted against the author... Any other person, who considers himself to be defamed or insulted, would go to a court of law to make his case publicly. But Durdinets has no regard for civil rights as he attempts to use his powers as a high ranking governmental official. So it is worth mentioning here the abuse of power, as neither I nor any of our readers can summon Vorsinov to his office, the less so to demand the institution of criminal proceedings against one\u2019s opponent. The acting Prime Minister considers that he can give orders to the General Prosecutor (although the law provides for the independence of the latter), and he does so.\u201d", "9. On 5 November 1997 the applicant wrote an article under the headline \u201cThe Rogue and the General\u201d (\u201c\u0410\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442 \u0438 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u201d \u2013 the third article), which concerned the alleged relationship between General G., at that time the Chief of the Odessa Regional Police Department, and a certain Mr S., who was reported to have been involved in criminal activity. The applicant\u2019s newspaper also published several photographs in which the police chief and Mr S. were pictured together. It appears that these pictures were made during a private occasion and were subsequently published by the paper and TV media (see paragraph 15 below).", "The article stated, inter alia, that:", "\u201cAn ... inquiry revealed that ... S. was never employed by the Tax Police. The person who had blackmailed [local businessmen] was a former police officer, S., and the photographs [which he had showed to prove his authority] contained images of high officials of the Odessa Regional Police Department.", "But where did the ex-policeman ... get the photographs of G. and his deputies drinking with him and hugging him? Now he is showing these photographs to [businessmen] and thereby collects money for ... life.", "The examination of this relationship clarifies the statements of S. ... that \u2018they will stand for me ...\u2019.", "This story seems to prove the corruption in the Odessa Regional Police Department we were writing about.\u201d", "10. On 19 November 1997 the applicant published an article entitled \u201cThe Rogue and the General turn out to be relatives\u201d (\u201c\u0410\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442 \u0438 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b \u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438\u201d \u2013 the fourth article), in which he recited the interview of certain Ms K. to a local TV station to the effect that the Chief of Police and Mr S. were distant relatives:", "\u201cThe scandal surrounding the head of the Odessa Regional Police Department, General G., continues. Condemned by the press for having patronised criminals, the General stands on firm ground so far.", "When we published \u2018The Rogue and the General\u2019, we did not know that S. and Grigorenko were brothers-in-law. ... The unlawful activity of S. is blessed by the figure of General G....\u201d", "11. On 7 July 1997 the Head of the Parliamentary Committee for Law and Order tabled a written question to the General Prosecutor raising concern as to the publications defaming the acting Prime Minister Durdynets. In July 1997 the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office (hereinafter \u201cthe GPO\u201d), referring to the extracts from his articles quoted above, charged the applicant with intentional defamation in print (Article 125 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code of 1961), an unfounded accusation of committing a serious crime (Article 125 \u00a7 3) and abuse of power (Article 165).", "12. On 9 December 1999 the Pechersky District Court of Kyiv acquitted the applicant for lack of corpus delicti. However, in November 2000 the Kyiv City Court, on the prosecutor\u2019s appeal, quashed this decision and remitted the case for fresh consideration.", "13. On 7 June 2001 the Minsky District Court of Kyiv (hereinafter \u201cthe Minsky Court\u201d) found the applicant guilty as charged. In the introductory part of the judgment the court noted the personal data of the applicant and, inter alia, stated that he was \u201cpreviously unconvicted\u201d (\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0456\u0448\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0443\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0439).", "14. With respect to the first and second articles, the court indicated that the applicant, having abused his office, published intentionally false and malicious statements to the effect that Mr Durdynets had persecuted the Polityka, had unlawfully dismissed Mr Stoginenko for his financing the newspaper and had summoned the General Prosecutor to his office with a view of giving him an order to institute criminal proceedings against the applicant.", "15. As regards the third and fourth articles, the Minsky Court stated that the applicant, again abusing his office, had intentionally defamed the law enforcement agencies of Ukraine by publishing libellous and false information regarding General G., namely that Mr S. was involved in criminal activity and that Mr G. had had illegal links with this person. The court found that the statements that Mr S., aided and abetted by General G., had extorted money from local businessmen and that they were family related were false and offensive. This conclusion was made on the basis of, inter alia, testimonies of S. and a witness Z. who stated that the photographs, published by the Polityka, were taken at a private party, but somehow made their way to the paper and TV media. The police officers, who had investigated the complaints of the businessmen about the alleged extortions, also gave oral evidence, stating that the proceedings in the case were terminated on the early stage of the pre-trial investigation due to the lack of any corpus delicti.", "16. The Minsky Court concluded that the applicant, as an editor-in-chief, was directly liable for any abusive material published in the newspaper. Using his office, the applicant had intentionally published false statements aimed at defaming the police in revenge for a certain unspecified previous conviction.", "17. The applicant was convicted of abuse of power, intentional defamation in print and an unfounded accusation of committing a grave offence and sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment on probation and a two years prohibition on occupying posts involving media management.", "18. On 18 October 2001 the Kyiv City Court of Appeal upheld the applicant\u2019s conviction in substance, indicating that the fact that the imputed offences had been committed was proved by a wide range of evidence, collected by the prosecution. In particular, the court came to the conclusion that the applicant had made intentionally false and offensive statements concerning the unlawful dismissal of Mr Stoginenko and Mr Durdynets\u2019 summons of the General Prosecutor to his office, the criminal activity of S. and his liaisons with General G., thus committing offences under Articles 125 and 165 of the Criminal Code, 1961. However, the appellate instance quashed the applicant\u2019s sentence for intentional defamation in print and an unfounded accusation of committing a grave offence as these offences had been decriminalised by the new Criminal Code adopted in 2001. As regards the third offence imputed to the applicant \u2013 abuse of office \u2013 the applicant was exempted from punishment on account of expiry of the statutory limitation period.", "19. On 23 July 2002 the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Kyiv City Court of Appeal.", "20. Relevant extracts from the Constitution read as follows:", "\u201c...
