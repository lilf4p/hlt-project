On 18 June 1996 the Osijek County State Attorney\u2019s Office asked the Osijek County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Osijeku) to open an investigation.", "On the same day the Osijek County Court opened such an investigation in respect of the applicant and seven other persons on charges of genocide (Article 119 of the Criminal Code), on account of a reasonable suspicion that between August 1991 and September 1994 they had participated in the occupation of the village of Branjih Vrh and in the persecution of the ethnic Croats who at the time lived there.", "On 27 June 1996 the Osijek County Court issued an arrest warrant in respect of the suspects, including the applicant.", "On 30 December 1996 the Osijek County State Attorney\u2019s Office charged the applicant and a number of other individuals with genocide in the Osijek County Court.", "On 16 June 1997 the same court ordered them to be tried in absentia.", "In 1999 an amendment of the Code of Criminal Procedure was introduced providing that no compensation was to be granted in connection with the detention of persons against whom criminal proceedings were terminated pursuant to the General Amnesty Act of 1996.", "The applicant was arrested on 12 September 2001 and placed in pre-trial detention based on the suspicion that he had committed the war crime of genocide. He was released on 29 November 2001.", "On 13 February 2002 the Osijek County State Attorney\u2019s Office re-classified the offence with which the applicant was charged from genocide to the one of armed rebellion.", "On 16 May 2002 the Osijek County Court terminated the proceedings against the applicant, pursuant to the General Amnesty Act, in view of the re-classification of the offence.", "On 24 May 2002 the Osijek County State Attorney\u2019s Office lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court against the above decision arguing that they had re-classified the indictment in respect of only three of the accused, but not in respect of the applicant and that therefore there had been no ground for terminating the proceedings against the latter.", "On 1 September 2004 the Supreme Court quashed the first-instance decision terminating the criminal proceedings against the applicant and remitted the case to the Osijek County Court.", "On 16 December 2004 the Osijek County Court again terminated the proceedings against the applicant, pursuant to the General Amnesty Act, in view of the re-classification of the offence. No appeal was lodged against this decision and it became final.", "On 13 October 2006 the applicant brought a civil action against the State before the Beli Manastir Municipal Court, seeking damages for his detention between 12 September and 29 November 2001. He argued that the criminal proceedings in connection with which he had been detained had been instituted on charges of genocide and that the State Attorney\u2019s Office had re-classified the offence to one of armed rebellion only to prevent the applicant and other persons in the same situation from obtaining damages for their detention. He referred in this respect to the fact that under the General Amnesty Act persons against whom criminal proceedings were terminated on the basis of that Act had no right to compensation for their detention while all other persons who were detained in connection with criminal proceedings not ending in conviction had the right to compensation for their detention.", "On 2 April 2008 the Municipal Court awarded the applicant compensation finding that the applicant had been placed in detention in connection with charges of genocide and that therefore the General Amnesty Act was not applicable when it came to the question of compensation for detention.", "On appeal this judgment was reversed by the Osijek County Court on 2 October 2008. The relevant part of the decision reads:", "\u201cThe first-instance court disregarded the fact that the issue of whether detention was justified is to be assessed in respect of the final outcome of the proceedings, and not in respect of the legal basis for ordering detention, irrespective of the criminal offence with which the plaintiff had been charged at the time he was detained.", "Since the criminal proceedings against the plaintiff in respect of the criminal offence of armed rebellion committed between 17 August 1990 and 23 August 1996 were terminated on the basis of the General Amnesty Act, this court holds that the plaintiff is not entitled to compensation for any type of damages on account of unjustified detention (Article 484 (a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure).\u201d", "On 10 November 2008 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the Osijek County Court\u2019s judgment of 2 October 2008.", "He argued that the Osijek County State Attorney\u2019s Office had re-classified the offence in 2002 to one of armed rebellion only to prevent him from obtaining compensation in connection with his detention in 2001. He submitted that he had been detained at a time when he was accused of genocide and that therefore the General Amnesty Act was not applicable as regards his right to compensation in connection with his detention.", "He further complained that he had been tried twice in respect of the same offence because the criminal proceedings against him had firstly been terminated in 1997 and then again in 2004.", "On 27 October 2010 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint as regards his complains concerning his right to compensation as ill-founded. As regards the complaint about being tried twice, the Constitutional Court held that it could not examine such a complaint since it had no connection with the civil proceedings instituted by the applicant.", "The relevant part of the Criminal Code (Op\u0107i krivi\u010dni zakon Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette nos. 53/1991 and 31/1993 \u2013 integral version \u2013 in force until 31 December 1997) read:", "\u201cWhoever, with the intention of destroying a national, ethnic, racial or religious group in whole or in part, orders the killing or infliction of grave bodily injuries or serious harm to the physical or mental health of the members of such a group, the compulsory displacement of a population or the placing of such a group in conditions which would lead to its extinction in whole or in part, or who orders measures which would prevent births within such a group or the compulsory displacement of children to another group, as well as whoever, with the same intention, commits any of the foregoing acts shall be sentenced to between five and twenty years\u2019 imprisonment.\u201d", "\u201c(1) Whoever participates in an armed rebellion which is aimed at harming the constitutionally established State and social order or the security of the Republic of Croatia shall be sentenced to at least three years\u2019 imprisonment.", "(2) An organiser or leader of the armed rebellion shall be sentenced to at least five years\u2019 imprisonment.\u201d", "The relevant part of the Code of Criminal Procedure enacted on 2 June 1999 and amended on 27 October 1999 (Official Gazette nos. 58/1999 and 112/1999) reads:", "\u201cSpecial laws and decisions adopted as acts of mercy by which perpetrators of criminal offences were pardoned or granted amnesty in respect of criminal offences committed between 17 August 1990 and 23 August 1996 do not serve as a basis for the application of Articles 476 to 484 of this Act.\u201d", "Articles 476 to 484 of that Act set forth the conditions and procedures in respect of the right to compensation in connection with detention and sentences ordered in the context of criminal proceedings that ended in acquittal or unjustified conviction.", "The relevant part of the Act on Amnesty from Criminal Prosecution and Proceedings in Respect of Criminal Offences Committed during the Armed Conflicts and the War against the Republic of Croatia of 25 September 1992 (Official Gazette no. 58/1992, Zakon o oprostu od krivi\u010dnog progona i postupka za krivi\u010dna djela po\u010dinjena u oru\u017eanim sukobima i u ratu protiv Republike Hrvatske) reads:", "\u201cCriminal prosecution of perpetrators of criminal offences [committed] during the armed conflicts, the war against the Republic of Croatia or in connection with these conflicts or war, committed between 17 August 1990 and the day when this Act comes into force, shall be discontinued.
