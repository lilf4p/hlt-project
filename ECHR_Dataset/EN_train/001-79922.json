Risti\u0107, a lawyer practising in Novi Sad. The Hungarian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by Mr L. H\u00f6ltzl, Agent, Ministry of Justice and Law Enforcement.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "In September 1996 the applicants took part in a motor-bikers\u2019 meeting in Mindszent, Hungary, organised in the park of an open-air swimming pool. They slept in a tent under a tree when, due to the heavy rain, a branch broke and fell on them causing them several injuries.", "On 9 June 1998 the first applicant instituted proceedings in the H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely District Court seeking the payment of damages from the owner of the swimming pool, the Mindszent Municipality.

The court relied largely on the opinions of two experts. On 4 January 2000 the Csongr\u00e1d County Regional Court dismissed the first applicant\u2019s appeal. On 27 September 2001 the Supreme Court\u2019s review bench quashed the first and second instance decisions and remitted the first applicant\u2019s case to the District Court, holding that it had failed to examine whether the Municipality had any contractual liability.", "After several hearings held in the resumed proceedings and the joinder of the two cases on 23 May 2002, on 23 May 2003 the District Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 joint action, holding the respondent had neither contractual nor delictual liability.", "On 7 October 2003 the Regional Court finally dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal.", "On 15 April 2004 the Supreme Court rejected the applicants\u2019 petition for review as inadmissible, without examining it on the merits, observing that they had failed to specify any appropriate legal grounds for their motion, as required by section 270 of the Code of Civil Procedure. This decision was served on the applicants\u2019 representative on 23 May 2004."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
