Slovenia (dec.), no. 5711/10 etc., 27 September 2011.", "The applicant has been held in different cells. Until 21 November 2009 he was held in Block 4 in cells measuring 59.25 square metres, in which the number of inmates varied between thirteen and sixteen (3.7 to 4.5 square metres of personal space available to each inmate). During this time he was on five occasions placed in Block 1 \u2013 for about thirteen months altogether, mostly for security reasons. There, he was held in cells accommodating no more than four inmates at a time, while most of the time each inmate had more than seven square metres of personal space, and never less than 3.9. The applicant was held in the same conditions in Block 1 between 21 November 2009 and 13 February 2010. Afterwards he was placed in Block 3, where he was held in cells measuring 59.89 square metres and accommodating between thirteen and fourteen inmates (4.2 to 4.6 square metres of personal space available to each inmate).", "The applicant has completed his primary education in prison, and is continuing with secondary education, including food-preparation and catering classes.

Further to the results of the blood test which confirmed that he had this disease, received on 17 August 2006, he was referred to a specialist in order to undergo an examination. He underwent an abdominal ultrasound in December 2006. On 29 March 2010, following the applicant\u2019s notifying the prison doctor about his hepatitis C infection, he was again referred to the specialist and underwent a further abdominal ultrasound. The doctor specialised in this field found that the applicant was chronically ill with hepatitis C, and should undergo appropriate medical treatment. A liver biopsy was scheduled for October 2010, but was postponed. Between 6 and 8 December 2010, the applicant was hospitalised in General Hospital Novo Mesto in order to undergo a liver biopsy.", "According to a report dated 13 August 2010 drawn up by a prison doctor, the applicant had been treated in the prison clinic on ninety-nine occasions for various medical problems.

P, ... the patient\u2019s rights under the Patient Rights Act had not been breached [in the applicant\u2019s case]. Section 54 of the aforementioned Act states that in order to obtain health care of good quality, the patient should actively participate in his or her treatment.
