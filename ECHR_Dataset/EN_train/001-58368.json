He did the whole of his schooling in France where he obtained a professional diploma (certificat d\u2019aptitude professionnelle) as a fitter in 1982. Between 1982 and 1992 he did various jobs and attended a number of professional training courses. In 1987 he met a French national, Miss L., with whom he had a steady relationship.", "10. Between January 1984 and December 1985 the applicant performed his military service in Algeria.", "11. In July 1990 gendarmes from the Belley investigation squad were informed of the plight of an 11-year-old girl whose father had just died of Aids and whose mother, Mrs C., was also suffering from the same disease, taking drugs and keeping company with several addicts. After an investigation had been opened on a complaint against a person or persons unknown for drug-related offences, the gendarmerie discovered in the course of their inquiries in the autumn of 1990 a drug-trafficking syndicate in which more than twenty people were implicated to differing degrees. The applicant was arrested and charged in the course of that investigation. He was accused by a number of co-defendants of being a dealer in drugs. It was established in the inquiry that he had been cohabiting with Mrs C. since July. He had been supplying her with hashish and heroin and together they had engaged in illegal trade in heroin.", "12. On 10 September 1991 the Belley Criminal Court convicted the applicant of drug trafficking, sentenced him to fifteen months\u2019 imprisonment, twelve of which were suspended, and made an order excluding him from French territory for a period of ten years.", "13. The applicant appealed. On 23 January 1992 the Lyons Court of Appeal increased the term of imprisonment to three years, two suspended, and upheld the exclusion order.", "14. In its judgment, the Court the Appeal stated, inter alia:", "\u201cMohamed Baghli, who became R.C.\u2019s companion in the summer of 1990, acknowledges that he has taken hashish for many years and began taking heroin in June 1990.", "He admits that between the end of June and the end of July he made two trips a week to Lyons to obtain drugs from one A., ... who supplied him with the drugs, in particular, one gram or half a gram doses of heroin for 1,600 French Francs (FRF) or FRF 800.", "He shared the drugs with his companion ... but also sold a part ...", "Ultimately the heroin-trafficking offence of which Baghli stands accused, which the investigating judge\u2019s investigations fully establish, concerned about ten grams of heroin, some being for his own and his companion\u2019s use and some being sold on to finance further purchases after being adulterated in a way that made it particularly hazardous for the buyers\u2019 health ...\u201d", "15.

The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law through his counsel against that decision relying, inter alia, on Article 8 of the Convention.", "21. On 19 December 1995 the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal, holding:", "\u201c... after noting that Mohamed Baghli had been convicted for his part in a heroin-trafficking syndicate, the Court of Appeal said that while it was true that his family lived in France and most of its members were French nationals, he had not lost all contact with Algeria, having often spent his holidays there and done military service there in 1984 and 1985. The mere fact that he was planning to set up home with a French woman was not decisive as, at the material time, he was living with another woman whom he had involved in his drug trafficking.", "The Court of Appeal concluded from that that the exclusion order had not disproportionately interfered with the right to family life guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention ...", "It added that although Article 14 of that Convention prohibited any discrimination on grounds of national origin, paragraph 3 of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4, an additional protocol, allowed aliens to be denied access to the territory if the measure was necessary in the interests of national security or public safety, for the maintenance of ordre public, and for the prevention of crime; that paragraph applied in the instant case, which concerned trafficking in narcotics, particularly heroin ...\u201d", "22.
