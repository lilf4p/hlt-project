THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["7. At the time of the events in question, both applicants were serving in the army and were tried by district courts-martial convened pursuant to the Army Act 1955.", "8. Mr Wilkinson pleaded guilty to the armed forces\u2019 disciplinary offence of absence without leave (contrary to section 38(a) of the Army Act 1955). Although the Army Board upheld his petition against the custodial part of his sentence, the charge for which he was convicted carried a potential sentence of two years\u2019 imprisonment (see paragraph 17 below).", "9. Mr Allen pleaded guilty to two charges of possession of controlled drugs contrary to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, these being civilian criminal offences. The Army Board reduced the custodial element of his sentence to six months\u2019 imprisonment.", "10. The relevant provisions of the Army Act 1955 are set out in the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the Findlay case (Findlay v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, \u00a7\u00a7 32-51).", "11. Central to the system under the 1955 Act was the role of the \u201cconvening officer\u201d. This officer (who had to be of a specified rank and in command of a body of the regular forces or of the command within which the person to be tried was serving) assumed responsibility for every case to be tried by court-martial. He or she had the final decision on the nature and detail of the charges to be brought and the type of court-martial required, and was responsible for convening the court-martial.", "12. The convening officer would draw up a convening order, which would specify, inter alia, the date, place and time of the trial, the name of the president and the details of the other members, all of whom he could appoint. Failing the appointment of a judge advocate by the Judge Advocate General\u2019s Office, the convening officer could appoint one. He also appointed, or directed a commanding officer to appoint, the prosecuting officer.", "13. Prior to the hearing, the convening officer was responsible for sending an abstract of the evidence to the prosecuting officer and to the judge advocate, and could indicate the passages which might be inadmissible. He procured the attendance at trial of all witnesses to be called for the prosecution. When charges were withdrawn, the convening officer\u2019s consent was normally obtained, although it was not necessary in all cases, and a plea to a lesser charge could not be accepted from the accused without it. He had also to ensure that the accused had a proper opportunity to prepare his defence, legal representation if required and the opportunity to contact the defence witnesses, and was responsible for ordering the attendance at the hearing of all witnesses \u201creasonably requested\u201d by the defence.", "14. The convening officer could dissolve the court-martial either before or during the trial, when required in the interests of the administration of justice. In addition, he could comment on the proceedings of a court-martial. Those remarks would not form part of the record of the proceedings and would normally be communicated in a separate minute to the members of the court, although in an exceptional case, where a more public instruction was required in the interests of discipline, they could be made known in the orders of the command.", "15. The convening officer usually acted as confirming officer also. A court-martial\u2019s findings were not effective until confirmed by the confirming officer, who was empowered to withhold confirmation or substitute, postpone or remit in whole or in part any sentence.", "16. Since the applicants\u2019 trials, the law has been amended by the Armed Forces Act 1996 (see the above-mentioned Findlay v. the United Kingdom judgment, \u00a7\u00a7 52-57).", "17. A person convicted of absence without leave shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years (section 38(a) of the 1955 Act)."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
