He was represented before the Court by Mr M. Man\u010dev, a lawyer practising in Kavadarci, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.", "The applicant and Mr Dz.I. (\u201cthe plaintiff\u201d) are neighbours whose plots of land are adjacent. On 16 February 2008 the applicant constructed a wall, a meter long and 90 cm high, and put three concrete bricks on a passage that the plaintiff used to access his property. The plaintiff brought a civil action requesting the Negotino Court of First Instance (\u201cthe first-instance court\u201d) to establish that the applicant disturbed his possession (\u0441\u043c\u0435\u045c\u0430\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435) and to order reinstatement in previous state.", "On 10 November 2008 the first-instance court allowed the plaintiff\u2019s claim and ordered the applicant to demolish the wall and remove the bricks. The transcript of a hearing held on that date did not contain any indication that the decision or its operative provisions were delivered.", "The applicant appealed arguing inter alia that the first-instance court had not pronounced the decision publicly, as required under section 324 of the Civil Proceedings Act (see \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201d below). He further complained that that failure was incompatible with Article 6 of the Convention.", "On 5 February 2009 the Skopje Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal and confirmed the lower court\u2019s decision. As regards the applicant\u2019s arguments that the first-instance court\u2019s decision had not been pronounced publicly, the court stated that it was a procedural flaw that did not affect the validity of the decision. This decision was served on the applicant on 9 March 2009.", "Section 324 \u00a7 3 of the Civil Proceedings Act of 2005 provides that a decision is delivered immediately after the public hearing and is pronounced publicly by a single judge or presiding judge of the adjudicating panel."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
