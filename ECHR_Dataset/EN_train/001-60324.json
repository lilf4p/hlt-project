The Ombudsman held that the applicant\u2019s letters to his wife pertained to the field of his private life, and that his allegations of theft did not constitute any formal suggestions, applications or complaints for the purpose of Rule 7 \u00a7 3 (4) of the Prison Rules (see the \u2018Relevant domestic law\u2019 part below). The Ombudsman concluded that the disciplinary penalty was unlawful, and suggested that it should be lifted. The Ombudsman also found that the letter from the CBSS of 16 October 1998 had been opened. He held that the applicant\u2019s right to respect for correspondence under Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights was \u201calmost inviolable\u201d, but that the State was allowed to censor prisoners\u2019 letters in certain cases. The Ombudsman found no violation of the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his correspondence.", "14.
