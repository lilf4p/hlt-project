There had been nobody here until you arrived. You have come and stirred things up again.", "Leyla Zana: No, Sir. The situation had been extremely tense before we arrived. We have come with the District Governor and are trying to calm down the tension here. Here is the District Governor.", "Colonel Yediy\u0131ld\u0131z: No, that\u2019s not true. We saw when we were flying by helicopter that there was nobody here before. People gathered when you arrived.", "Orhan Do\u011fan: No, you can ask the District Governor if you like.

On 29 May 1992 the Public Prosecutor at the Istanbul National Security Court (\u0130stanbul Devlet G\u00fcvenlik Mahkemesi) charged the applicant, being the owner of the review, with revealing the identity of officials mandated to fight terrorism and thus rendering them terrorist targets. The charges were brought under section 6 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 (\"the 1991 Act\"; see paragraph 16 below).", "12. In the proceedings before the Istanbul National Security Court the applicant denied the charges and advanced the following arguments in his defence. The news report had been published with the aim of informing the public of the events which had occurred during the 1992 Newroz celebrations. It had been based on a joint press declaration by former deputies Leyla Zana and Orhan Do\u011fan and an English delegation, during their visit to south-east Turkey. By virtue of the fact that section 6 of the 1991 Act contained an absolute prohibition on the disclosure and dissemination of the identity of officials appointed to fight terrorism, it enabled officials to abuse their authority, violate the law and subject citizens to ill-treatment. The right to receive and impart information, including information concerning acts of officials, was fundamental in a democratic society. Section 6 of the 1991 Act contravened not only the Turkish Constitution but also Article 10 of the Convention.", "13. In a judgment of 2 September 1993 the National Security Court convicted the applicant under section 6 of the 1991 Act and sentenced him to pay a fine of 54,000,000 Turkish lira. It noted that the news report had contained an allegation to the effect that the Governor of \u015e\u0131rnak had stated to the visiting delegation that the \u015e\u0131rnak Chief of Police had given an order to open fire on the people. It had further affirmed that a gendarme commander had stated to Orhan Do\u011fan in Leyla Zana\u2019s presence \"[y]our death would give us pleasure. Your blood would not quench my thirst\". By having disclosed the identity of these officials, the publication had rendered them targets for terrorist attack.", "14. The applicant appealed, reiterating his defence before the National Security Court. He also argued that the press declaration at issue had already been reported in other newspapers and magazines and that the incriminated news report had added nothing to these.", "15. On 10 December 1993 the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal. It upheld the cogency of the National Security Court's assessment of the evidence and its reasoning for rejecting the applicant's defence.", "16. The relevant provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 read as follows:", "\u201cIt shall be an offence, punishable by a fine of from five million to ten million Turkish liras, to announce, orally or in the form of a publication, that terrorist organisations will commit an offence against a specific person, whether or not that person\u2019s ... identity is divulged, provided that it is done in such a manner that he or she may be identified, or to reveal the identity of civil servants who have participated in anti-terrorist operations or to designate any person as a target.", "It shall be an offence, punishable by a fine of from five million to ten million Turkish liras, to print or publish declarations or leaflets emanating from terrorist organisations.", "\u2026", "Where the offences contemplated in the above paragraphs are committed through the medium of periodicals within the meaning of section 3 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680), the publisher shall also be liable to a fine equal to ninety per cent of the income from the average sales for the previous month if the periodical appears more frequently than monthly, or from the sales of the previous issue if the periodical appears monthly or less frequently, or from the average sales for the previous month of the daily newspaper with the largest circulation if the offence involves printed matter other than periodicals or if the periodical has just been launched.2 However, the fine may not be less than fifty million Turkish liras.
