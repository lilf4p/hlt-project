On the same day a doctor on duty at the Vinkovci Medical Centre informed the Vukovarsko-Srijemska Police (Policijska uprava Vukovarsko-srijemska; hereinafter: the \u201cpolice\u201d) about the incident.

They also pointed out that if the medical experts had been unable to submit their report within a reasonable time, the trial court should have commissioned a new report by other experts.", "20. The Medical Faculty of the University of Zagreb informed the Vinkovci Municipal Court on 23 March 1999 that they had been unable to provide the medical report because they had not had all the relevant documents and reports concerning the medical treatment of Ivan Kudra.", "21. At a hearing on 13 May 1999 a representative of the Housing and Communal Activities Fund informed the trial court that that Fund had ceased to exist and that its successor was the Vinkovci Municipality (Grad Vinkovci).

On 14 June 2002 a medical expert of the Croatian Association for Medical Expertise, \u017d.G., submitted his report to the Osijek Commercial Court. He found that there had been flaws in the Vinkovci Medical Centre\u2019s treatment of Ivan Kudra, which had eventually resulted in Ivan\u2019s death. The relevant part of the report reads:", "\u201cIf treated properly, with the available medical equipment, the injury [sustained by Ivan Kudra] could have been treated with minimum, even barely noticeable, consequences.", "The decision to carry out an exploration of the skull under full endotracheal anaesthetic without a neurological preparation (CT), and without the appropriate instruments and a qualified brain surgeon, on a patient who was conscious, had no neurological deficit and whose life was not in imminent danger, was absolutely wrong, all the more so since it was done without the consent of his parents.\u201d", "34. On 12 July 2002 the Vinkovci General Hospital lodged an objection against the medical report, arguing that it was substantially flawed. The Vinkovci Municipal Court forwarded the objection to the Croatian Medical Expert Reports Association for reply.", "35. On 15 November 2002 the expert witness, \u017d.G., submitted an additional report to the Osijek Commercial Court, reiterating all his previous findings.", "36.

On 12 February 2003 the applicants submitted an amended civil action to the Osijek Commercial Court.", "41.

On 17 June 2003 a hearing was held before the Vinkovci Municipal Court at which the parties made further oral submissions.", "44.

On 30 September 2004 two medical experts of the Medical Faculty of the University of Zagreb, P.M. and D.S., submitted their medical report to the Vinkovci Municipal Court. They found that there had been no flaws in the medical treatment of Ivan Kudra in the Vinkovci Medical Centre and that the further health complications could not be attributed to the doctors.", "51. The applicants lodged an objection to the findings of the medical experts on 6 December 2004. They argued that the two medical expert reports, the first drafted by \u017d.G. and the second by P.M. and D.S., were contradictory and asked that the experts be confronted to clarify and adjust their findings.", "52. At a hearing on 3 February 2005 the Vinkovci Municipal Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 request and terminated the proceedings on the grounds that all the relevant facts had been sufficiently established.", "53. On 16 February 2005 the Vinkovci Municipal Court adopted a judgment dismissing the applicants\u2019 civil action. In respect of the applicants\u2019 action against the Vinkovci Municipality, the court noted:", "\u201cUnder section 207 of the Civil Obligations Act the investor and the constructor have joint liability for all damages to a third party in connection with the construction.", "...", "The person who is indicated as the investor in the construction contract has joint liability with the constructor for any damages in connection with the construction ([Supreme Court\u2019s judgment] Vs Rev-86/91 of 16 May 1991, PSP-53/112).", "In the case at issue, regard being had to the contract of 28 September 1992, section 207 of the Civil Obligations Act is inapplicable in respect of the second defendant \u2013 the Fund, now the Vinkovci Municipality \u2013 since the second defendant was neither the investor nor the constructor on the construction site at issue. It is undisputed that the second defendant transferred, for a sum of money, the construction to the first-defendant A. and that therefore A. was the constructor and the investor.", "Moreover, the said contract obliged company A. to ensure that the construction was carried out according to the relevant technical requirements necessary for this type of work. If the construction site was not properly secured (and this court, based on the evidence from the case file, considers that it was not) and if there were flaws in the organisation of the work (security) which had caused the injury of Ivan Kudra, then the sole responsibility would be on A. as the investor and the constructor.", "However, during the course of these proceedings, insolvency proceedings were opened in respect of the first defendant, company A., and this court had no competence to rule on its liability...\u201d", "54. As to the applicants\u2019 action against the Vinkovci Health Centre and the Vinkovci General Hospital, the Vinkovci Municipal Court held that the medical expert report drafted by P.M. and D.S. had revealed that all the measures taken by the doctors were appropriate and that they could not be held responsible for Ivan\u2019s death, and therefore the hospital could not be held responsible either. As to the inconsistencies between this medical report and the one drafted by the expert \u017d.G., the court noted:", "\u201cSince the defendants submitted a number of objections to the report drafted by expert \u017d.G. from Zagreb, and since that expert failed to provide a detailed reply to those objections during the proceedings before the Osijek Commercial Court, this court considered that another medical report should be commissioned from the Medical Faculty of the University of Zagreb.", "The medical experts from that institution, P.M., a specialist in brain-surgery and D.S., a specialist in forensic medicine, drafted an objective medical report, in which they sufficiently substantiated their findings concerning the medical treatment of Ivan Kudra. Therefore this court accepts their report.\u201d", "55. On 24 February 2005 the applicants lodged an appeal with the Vukovar County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Vukovaru) against the firstinstance judgment of the Vinkovci Municipal Court, arguing that it had a number of substantive and procedural flaws. They pointed out in particular that the Vinkovci Municipal Court had failed to address all the obvious inconsistencies between the two medical reports and sought an explanation.", "56. On 14 February 2006 the applicants lodged a complaint about the length of the proceedings before the Vukovar County Court, arguing that the proceedings had been excessively long.", "57. On 23 February 2006 the Vukovar County Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal and upheld the first-instance judgment in respect of the Vinkovci Health Centre and the Vinkovci General Hospital. It quashed the first-instance judgment and ordered a retrial in respect of the Vinkovci Municipality. The County Court found that the first-instance court had to establish whether company A. or the Housing and Communal Activities Fund was the owner of the construction site at the time of the accident. The County Court considered that the first-instance court had sufficiently substantiated its decision in respect of the applicants\u2019 complaint concerning the expert reports.", "58. On 10 April 2006 the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) against the part of the Vukovar County Court\u2019s judgment concerning the Vinkovci Health Centre and the Vinkovci General Hospital. They argued that the lower courts\u2019 judgments had been based on contradictory medical reports and that the lower courts had failed to address their complaints concerning those inconsistencies.", "59. On 20 June 2006 the Supreme Court dismissed the first and second applicants\u2019 appeal on points of law as ill-founded, endorsing the reasoning of the lower courts. It declared the third and fourth applicants\u2019 appeal on points of law inadmissible ratione valoris.", "60. On 11 January 2007 the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) against the judgment of the Supreme Court. The applicants contended that their individual rights and the rule of law had been violated by the lengthy and unfair proceedings before the lower courts in which two contradictory medical expert reports concerning the death of their child had not been confronted and clarified, and no explanation for that had been given by the lower courts.", "61. On 18 January 2007 a hearing was held before the Vinkovci Municipal Court in the retrial concerning the applicants\u2019 civil action against the Vinkovci Municipality.", "62. Another hearing was held on 8 March 2007. The trial court heard evidence from the parties and their oral submissions, and concluded the hearing.", "63. On the same day the Vinkovci Municipal Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 civil action against the Vinkovci Municipality on the ground that, pursuant to a contract dated 28 September 1992 between company A. and the Housing and Communal Activities Fund, ownership of the construction site had been formally transferred to company A. on 19 January 1993, before the accident had occurred. The court therefore noted:", "\u201cSince for the event at issue, in the view of this court, a third person was responsible, company A. Vinkovci, and not the defendant the Vinkovci Municipality, this court dismisses the civil action under section 177 of the Civil Obligations Act as ill-founded.\u201d", "64. On 29 March 2007 the applicants lodged an appeal with the Vukovar County Court, arguing that there had been a number of procedural and substantive flaws in the retrial before the Vinkovci Municipal Court.", "65. On 23 July 2007 the Vukovar County Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal as ill-founded and upheld the judgment of the Vinkovci Municipal Court.", "66. The applicants lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court against the judgment of the Vukovar County Court, requesting that the lower courts\u2019 judgments be quashed.", "67. On 2 April 2008 the Supreme Court dismissed the first and second applicants\u2019 appeal on points of law as ill-founded and declared the third and fourth applicants\u2019 appeal on points of law inadmissible ratione valoris.", "68. On 13 May 2008 the Vukovar County Court upheld a lengthofproceedings complaint lodged by the applicants on 14 February 2006. It found the length of the civil proceedings excessive and awarded the first and second applicants jointly 12,600 Croatian kunas (HRK) in damages.", "69. On 11 June 2008 the Vinkovci Municipal Court issued a separate decision in respect of the costs of the proceedings, ordering the applicants to pay HRK 14,134.96 to the Vinkovci Health Centre.", "70. On 19 June 2008 the applicants lodged an appeal with the Vukovar County Court against the Vinkovci Municipal Court\u2019s decision.", "71. On 26 June 2008 the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court against the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 2 April 2008. The applicants argued, inter alia, that the lower courts had minimised any responsibility of those involved in the death of their child. In their view, that had violated their human rights and breached the relevant domestic law.", "72. On 12 January 2010 the Constitutional Court dismissed the first and second applicants\u2019 constitutional complaint of 26 June 2008 as ill-founded and declared the third and fourth applicants\u2019 complaint inadmissible as it had been lodged out of time. They had had no right to lodge an appeal on points of law and thus the time for lodging a constitutional complaint had started to run from the date of the Vukovar County Court decision.", "73. On 28 October 2010 the Vukovar County Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal against the decision of the Vinkovci Municipal Court concerning the costs of the proceedings, holding that all the relevant facts regarding the costs had been correctly established.", "74. On 27 January 2010 the Constitutional Court dismissed the first and second applicants\u2019 constitutional complaint of 11 January 2007 as illfounded and declared the third and fourth applicants\u2019 complaint inadmissible as it had been lodged out of time. The court reiterated its previous arguments.", "75. On 3 December 2010 the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court against the Vukovar County Court\u2019s decision of 28 October 2010 dismissing their appeal concerning the costs of the proceedings.", "76. On 20 April 2011 the Constitutional Court declared the applicants\u2019 constitutional complaint inadmissible ratione materiae, on the grounds that the decision on the costs of the proceedings had not represented an individual act against which a constitutional complaint could be lodged.", "77. On 6 March 2012 the Vukovar County Court found that it had omitted to include the third and fourth applicants\u2019 length-of-proceedings complaint in its decision of 13 May 2008. Therefore, finding the length of the civil proceedings excessive, it awarded the third and fourth applicants jointly HRK 12,600 in damages.", "78. On an unspecified date in 2012 the applicants lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court against the above-mentioned decision, arguing that the amount awarded was insufficient, and on 4 June 2012 the Supreme Court dismissed their appeal as ill-founded.", "79.
