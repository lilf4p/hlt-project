Mrs Am\u00e9lia Alves Estima Jorge, a Portuguese national, lives at Loures in Portugal", "10. By a notarial deed dated 19 December 1978 the applicant and A.P. jointly agreed to lend to Mr and Mrs O. a total of 1,360,000 escudos (PTE), to be repaid within six months, which period was renewable as often as the parties agreed. The loan bore interest at the rate of 8% per annum if repaid during the term and 12% if repaid late. The borrowers undertook to bear the costs incurred in securing and enforcing the debt. The capital and interest and other costs were secured by a mortgage over a property in Carcavelos (jurisdiction of Cascais). On 22 December 1978 Mrs Estima Jorge advanced the borrowers the portion of the capital she had undertaken to lend, namely PTE 390,000; A.P. paid the balance (PTE 970,000) on 27 December 1978. The borrowers failed to repay either capital or interest.", "11. On 27 November 1981, as no voluntary repayment had been made, the lenders brought enforcement proceedings in the Fourth Civil Division of the Lisbon Court of First Instance (tribunal civel da comarca de Lisboa) against Mr and Mrs O. for repayment of the mortgage. Mrs Estima Jorge claimed PTE 553,800 (comprising the capital plus PTE 163,800 in interest she considered to be due for the period from 19 December 1978 to 19 June 1981); A.P. claimed PTE 1,377,400.

On 26 May 1989 she applied for an attachment over the balance of the proceeds of that sale.", "18. On 5 June 1989 the Lisbon Court of First Instance granted her application and requested the Cascais Court of First Instance to attach the balance. On 6 November 1989 the latter court was informed that the case file concerning the enforcement proceedings brought by the Carcavelos Finance Department had been sent to the Third Chamber of the Lisbon Tax Court of First Instance (tribunal tribut\u00e1rio de 1a inst\u00e2ncia).
