FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Preliminary objection rejected (non-exhaustion);Violation of Art. 6-1;Not necessary to examine Art. 13;Pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "John Freeland", "TEXT": ["7. Mr Raymond de Geouffre de la Pradelle is a French national and practises as a lawyer (avocat). He lives in Paris, where he has his chambers.", "He owns an estate of about 250 hectares in the d\u00e9partement of Corr\u00e8ze. The River Montane crosses the property, which lies within the administrative districts (communes) of Saint-Priest-de-Gimel and Gimel. In order to provide an electricity supply for the ch\u00e2teau of Saint-Priest, which was on his land, he envisaged converting a long-disused hydroelectric dam into a self-contained miniature power-station. On 9 January 1976 \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France gave its approval. On 21 January 1977 and 10 April 1979 the Council of the d\u00e9partement of Corr\u00e8ze consented in principle.", "8. On 3 April 1980 the Minister for the Environment and the Quality of Life decided to set in motion proceedings to designate the land in the Montane valley as an area of outstanding beauty and of public interest; an area of 80 hectares was affected, most of it belonging to the applicant.", "The Prefect of Corr\u00e8ze informed the applicant of this in a letter of 12 May 1980; pursuant to section 9 of the Law of 2 May 1930 on the conservation of natural monuments and places of interest (see paragraph 18 below), which prohibits for a period of twelve months any alteration of the state of a site that is in the process of being designated, he also refused the application for permission to undertake hydroelectric works.", "9. Together with the seven other property owners affected, the applicant was invited to submit any comments he might have on the designation proposal (section 5-1 of the Law of 2 May 1930 - see paragraph 18 below), and he indicated his objections in a letter of 22 May 1980 to the Prefect of Corr\u00e8ze.", "10. A public inquiry was opened by a prefectoral decision of 7 October 1980, which was notified personally to the parties concerned (Article 4 of Decree no. 69-607 of 13 June 1969 - see paragraph 19 below). Mr de Geouffre de la Pradelle sent the Prefect a statement of his objections in which he challenged the point of designating the land in the first place and suggested organising an inspection of the site by all the parties concerned.", "11. On 4 July 1983, following a favourable report by the National Places of Interest Commission, the Prime Minister, after consulting the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat, issued a decree (section 6 of the Law of 2 May 1930 -see paragraph 18 below) designating the Montane valley. On 12 July the Official Gazette (Journal officiel) published the following extract:", "\"By a decree dated 4 July 1983, the area formed by that part of the Montane valley situated within the administrative districts of Gimel and Saint-Priest-de-Gimel is designated as one of the areas of outstanding beauty in the d\u00e9partement of Corr\u00e8ze.\"", "The present decree shall be notified to the Prefect, Commissioner of the Republic for the d\u00e9partement of Corr\u00e8ze, and to the mayors of the districts concerned.", "12. On 13 September 1983 the Prefect of Corr\u00e8ze served the full text of the decree at the applicant\u2019s Paris home, together with a letter that read:", "\"...", "I have the honour to notify to you by this letter the decree of 4 July 1983 designating the area formed by the Montane valley at Gimel and St-Priest-de-Gimel, which is partly situated on your property, as a conservation area.", "I should perhaps remind you that in the conservation area you are required to comply with the obligations laid down in the amended Law of 2 May 1930 on the conservation of places of interest, and in particular in sections 11, 12 and 13, which deal with transfers, alterations and the creation by agreement of any easements which might affect a designated place of interest.", "...\"", "13. On 27 October 1983 the applicant, acting through his lawyer, applied to the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat for judicial review of the decree of 4 July 1983.", "14. As his main submission, the Minister for Town Planning, Housing and Transport argued that the application was \"apparently made out of time\"; as the designation decree did not contain any \"special directions\", the time within which any appeal had to be brought ran from its publication in the Official Gazette.", "15. In his reply the applicant began by challenging the administrative authorities\u2019 interpr\u00e9tation of Articles 6 and 7 of the decree of 13 June 1969 (see paragraph 19 below), according to which, in the absence of any special directions, the time within which any appeal had to be brought ran from the publication of the designation decision in the Official Gazette. He regarded the approach adopted by the administrative authorities as being a likely source of difficulties for members of the public. Could it reasonably be asked of people, he continued, to envisage exceptions being made to the normal rule, namely that the time allowed for appealing should begin to run from publication in the case of general regulatory decisions and from notification in the case of individual decisions? Where appeals and the procedures for bringing them were concerned, things should be simple. And if, as in the instant case, there was no good reason for making an exception, it was only right to retain a practice consistent with ordinary law.", "He added that, at all events, if the authorities\u2019 interpr\u00c9tation were to prevail, Articles 6 and 7 would have to be considered unlawful as being contrary to the principle of equality in that an owner of property covered by such a decision would be less favourably treated than other persons affected by individual measures.", "In the alternative, he complained of the incompleteness and irregularity of the publication of 12 July 1983 (see paragraph 11 above), which did not enable the persons concerned to acquaint themselves with the exact scope of the designation. In his submission, the time allowed for appealing had begun to run only when the full text of the decree was made available to the public at the Corr\u00e8ze prefecture; and the administrative authorities had not shown that the application registered on 27 October 1983 had been registered more than two months after the full text had been made available. Mr de Geouffre de la Pradelle alleged, lastly, that the impugned measure was a naked misuse of power designed to frustrate his modernisation scheme (see paragraph 7 above) and the exercise of the water rights associated with his status as a former producer of electricity.", "16. On 7 November 1986 the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat, accepting the submissions of the Government Commissioner (commissaire du gouvernement), declared the application inadmissible for the following reasons:", "\"...", "By Article 49 of the Ordinance of 31 July 1945, \u2018unless otherwise provided by legislation, an application to the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat against a decision by an authority, court or tribunal within its jurisdiction shall be admissible only within a period of two months; this period shall run from the date of publication of the disputed decision unless it has to be notified or served, in which case the period shall run from the date of notification or service\u2019.", "By the provisions of Article 6 of the decree of 13 June 1969, decisions whereby a natural monument or a place of interest is designated are published in the Official Gazette. Although, under Article 7 of the same decree, these decisions are notified to the property owners concerned where they contain special directions designed to alter the state or change the use of the site, and although the time within which any appeal to the courts must be brought runs in that case only from the notification of the designation decree or order, this latter provision applies only where it is necessary to give notice to the property owner to alter the state or change the use of the site. In other cases, however, the time in which any appeal to the courts has to be brought runs from the publication of the designation decision in the Official Gazette, even if after that publication the decision was notified to the property owner.", "It appears from the evidence that the impugned decree designating the area formed by the Montane valley in the d\u00e9partement of Corr\u00e8ze did not include any notice to the property owners to alter the state or change the use of the site. It follows that, in accordance with the provisions referred to above, the time within which any appeal to the courts against the said decree had to be brought ran from the date of its publication in the Official Gazette.", "An extract from the decree was published in the Official Gazette of 12 July 1983, together with the information that the full text could be consulted at the Corr\u00e8ze prefecture. That being so, the applicant is not justified in contending that the publication was incomplete or irregular and consequently not such as to make time begin to run for the purposes of bringing an appeal. The application for review of the impugned decree was registered only on 27 October 1983, that is to say after the expiry of the time allowed for appealing under the provisions of the decree of 13 June 1969 that have been examined above.", "In order to overcome the fact that his application was out of time, Mr de Geouffre de la Pradelle maintained that these provisions were unlawful because they gave rise to discrimination to the detriment of the property owners of designated places of interest, seeing that these property owners did not have the same time-limits for appealing against designation decisions as other recipients of individual decisions.", "But a decision to designate an area of outstanding beauty is not in the nature of an individual decision. Accordingly, the ground based on the argument that the impugned decree infringed the rules on the notification of individual acts and decisions fails.", "It follows from all the foregoing considerations that the application is out of time and therefore inadmissible.", "...\"", "17. In November and December 1986 Mr de Geouffre de la Pradelle approached the Architect\u2019s Department of the d\u00e9partement of Corr\u00e8ze to seek help with restoration of the site, which had been devastated by the exceptionally high winds of November 1982. His application was unsuccessful.", "18. In their current form the relevant provisions of the Law of 2 May 1930 provide:", "PART II - LISTING AND DESIGNATION OF NATURAL MONUMENTS AND PLACES OF INTEREST", "\"In each d\u00e9partement there shall be drawn up a list of the natural monuments and places of interest whose conservation or preservation is in the public interest from the artistic, historic, scientific, legendary or scenic point of view.", "...", "Listing shall be effected by means of an order made by the Minister for Cultural Affairs. A decree issued after consultation of the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat shall lay down the procedure for notifying the listing to the property owners or for publishing it. Publication may replace notification only in cases in which the latter is made impossible by the large number of owners of one and the same place of interest or natural monument, or if it is impossible for the authorities to ascertain the identity or address of the owner.", "On the land within the boundaries laid down in the order, listing shall entail an obligation on those affected not to undertake any works other than those relating to day-to-day agricultural use as regards rural land and to normal upkeep as regards buildings without having given the authorities four months\u2019 notice of their intention.\"", "\"Where it is proposed to designate a natural monument or place of interest belonging wholly or in part to persons other than those listed in sections 6 and 7, those affected shall be invited to submit their comments according to a procedure which shall be laid down in a decree issued after consultation of the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat.\"", "\"A natural monument or place of interest forming part of the public or private property of the State shall be designated by means of an order made by the Minister for the Arts if there is agreement with the minister within whose field of responsibility the natural monument or place of interest lies and with the Minister of Finance.", "...", "If there is no such agreement, designation shall be effected by means of a decree issued after consultation of the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat.\"", "\"A natural monument or place of interest forming part of the public or private property of a d\u00e9partement or an administrative district (commune) or belonging to a public institution shall be designated by means of an order made by the Minister for the Arts if the public authority that owns it has consented.", "Otherwise designation shall be effected, after the opinion of the National Commission on Natural Monuments and Places of Interest has been sought, by means of a decree issued after consultation of the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat.\"", "\"A natural monument or place of interest belonging to any person other than those listed in sections 6 and 7 shall be designated by means of an order made by the Minister for Cultural Affairs, after the opinion of the d\u00e9partement\u2019s Committee on Places of Interest, Views and Landscapes has been sought, if the owner consents. The order shall lay down the designation conditions.", "Failing the owner\u2019s consent, the designation shall be effected after the opinion of the National Commission has been sought, by means of a decree issued after consultation of the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat.

The decree of 13 June 1969 provides, inter alia:", "\"Listing orders shall be notified by the Prefect to the owners of natural monuments or places of interest.", "However, where the number of owners affected by the listing of one and the same place of interest or natural monument is greater than a hundred, the procedure of individual notification may be replaced by a general public announcement as provided for in Article 3.", "Recourse shall likewise be had to a public announcement where the authorities are unable to ascertain the identity or the number of the property owners.\"", "\"The public announcements provided for in Article 2 ... shall be made at the instance of the Prefect, who shall have the listing order published in two newspapers, at least one of which shall be a daily newspaper that is distributed in the administrative districts concerned.
