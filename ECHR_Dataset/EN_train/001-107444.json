The applicants complained of non-enforcement to the Human Rights Chamber or to the Constitutional Court. On 9 November 2005 and 8 March 2006 the Human Rights Commission (the legal successor of the Human Rights Chamber) found a breach of Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the cases of Mr Vu\u010danovi\u0107, Mr \u0160avija, the Pilipovi\u0107s, the Gruji\u0107s, the Brki\u0107s and Mr Avramovi\u0107. On 20 December 2005, 12 April 2006, 9 May 2006, 26 June 2007 and 13 December 2007 the Constitutional Court ruled likewise in the cases of the remaining applicants.

Around 9,000 domestic judgments ordering the Republika Srpska to pay war damages (including those under consideration in the present case) became final by 29 November 2005. After a stay of several years on such civil actions under the War Damage Act 2005, a number of new judgments have been rendered since 2010. As pursuant to section 376 \u00a7 1 of the Civil Obligations Act 1978 and settled domestic case-law, such claims became statute-barred on 19 June 1999 (that is, three years from the cessation of the state of war), the total number of new judgments should not exceed 2,800 according to information provided by the Government in the context of the leading case concerning this matter (\u010coli\u0107 and Others, cited above). The thousands of cases, which were lodged after that date and were stayed between 2005 and 2010, would eventually be rejected as statute-barred.", "Pursuant to the Domestic Debt Act 2004, only legal costs awarded by the domestic judgments in question are to be paid in cash, whereas principal debt and associated default interest are to be paid in government bonds which earn interest at an annual rate of 1.5%.

If one is unable or unwilling to wait until the maturity of bonds, he or she may sell them on the Stock Exchange (their current price is around 40% of their nominal value). With the aim of making such bonds attractive, the Republika Srpska has accepted that they may be used to pay direct taxes accrued by 31 December 2007."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
