Two hearings were adjourned in connection with the examination of the applicant\u2019s challenge to the impartiality of the presiding judge. One hearing was adjourned at the parties\u2019 request. One hearing was adjourned because the applicant\u2019s wife was abroad. Eighteen hearings were adjourned due to the absence of one of the parties.

On 12 May 2005 the Warsaw Court of Appeal dismissed the complaint.

The Warsaw Court of Appeal found that the impugned proceedings were progressing without any undue delays. It was noted that on 29 January 2004 the Warsaw Regional Court had delivered a judgment and that the case was pending on appeal. It was emphasised that any delay in the appeal proceedings was attributable to the applicant who had twice applied for an exemption from court fees on the basis of incomplete information.", "21.
