FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Remainder inadmissible;No violation of Art. 8", "JUDGES": "Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Jean-Paul Costa;Mark Villiger;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger", "TEXT": ["5. The applicant was born in 1962 and is currently in prison in Montm\u00e9dy.", "6. Following a complaint lodged on 18 February 1997 by the parents of a young girl, S., the applicant was charged with the rape and sexual assault of a minor under 15 years of age by a person in a position of authority.", "7. During the investigation he made several requests for additional investigative measures to be taken, which were refused by the investigating authorities.", "8. On 15 April 2003 an investigating judge at the Bar-le-Duc tribunal de grande instance issued an order discontinuing the proceedings in respect of the sexual assault charges, as the limitation period had expired. The judge committed the applicant for trial on a charge of rape of a minor under the age of 15 by a person in a position of authority over the victim.", "9. On 30 October 2003 the Meuse Assize Court sentenced the applicant to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment and stripped him of all his civil, civic and family rights for ten years.", "10. The applicant did not appeal against that decision but lodged an application for a retrial, producing a number of documents which he claimed placed his guilt in doubt.", "11. On 9 March 2004 Law no. 2004-204 established the national automated register of sex offenders (\u201cthe Sex Offenders Register\u201d).", "12. On 11 April 2005 the Criminal Cases Review Board rejected the applicant\u2019s application for a retrial.", "13. On 28 February 2005 the applicant applied to the Cr\u00e9teil Postsentencing Court to have his sentence suspended. On 17 June 2005 the application was refused on the grounds that, according to the expert medical reports, \u201cthe applicant\u2019s survival is not in doubt, nor is his state of health incompatible in the long term with detention. Therefore, as matters stand, he does not meet the requirements of Article 720-1-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and is not eligible for the measure in question\u201d. The court pointed out that the applicant\u2019s sentence was due to run until 27 May 2019 and that his criminal record mentioned another conviction for sexual abuse of a minor under the age of 15 by a person in authority (a sentence of six years\u2019 imprisonment and a judicial and social supervision order imposed by the Nancy Court of Appeal on 29 August 2002 for sexual assault of a minor). The court also took into consideration medical reports according to which the applicant suffered from congenital heart disease which made any physical activity impossible. The report advocated his placement under an enhanced prison regime with an individual cell, no exercise or physical activity, a salt-free diet and regular medication. The court also referred to a psychiatric expert report from November 2004 according to which the applicant\u2019s psychological development \u201cappears very limited in so far as he has failed to reflect on his own conduct. He has expressed no feelings of guilt or responsibility for the offences which he denies committing. A course of psychotherapy would help him develop more satisfactory relationships in the future with the people he comes into contact with\u201d.", "14. On 13 October 2005 the post-sentencing division of the Paris Court of Appeal upheld this judgment.", "15. On 22 November 2005 the applicant was informed by a police officer from l\u2019Ha\u00ff-les-Roses police station that his name was being entered in the Sex Offenders Register on account of his conviction by the Meuse Assize Court, in accordance with the transitional provisions of the abovementioned Law of 9 March 2004. The official notification was worded as follows:", "\u201cI, the undersigned, Mr Fabrice Gardel, hereby acknowledge that I have today been notified of my inclusion in the Sex Offenders Register on account of the [sentence] of imprisonment imposed on 30 October 2003 by the Meuse Assize Court, and that I am accordingly required, under Article 706-53-5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to:", "1. provide proof of my address: ...", "Once a year either to the authority managing the register (the Ministry of Justice) ... or to my local police or gendarmerie station ..., during the month in which my birthday falls or during the month of January if my date of birth is not known or not established. ...", "I expressly acknowledge having been informed that:", "I have been finally convicted of an offence carrying a sentence of ten years or more.

The national automated register of sex offenders (\u201cthe Sex Offenders Register\u201d \u2013 FIJAIS), which was established in 2004, is a criminal identification register similar to the national fingerprint database (FAED), the national genetic database (FNAEG) and the national criminal records (CJN), the last of which have been in existence the longest. An information paper on police registers tabled before the National Assembly on 24 March 2009 noted an upsurge in the number of such registers. The working party chaired by Mr Alain Bauer noted that there were around forty-five in 2008 compared with thirty-four in 2006, and that another dozen or so were \u201cin the pipeline\u201d.", "The Ministry of Justice is responsible for and manages the Sex Offenders Register. It is maintained by the National Criminal Records Department in Nantes, under the supervision of the judge in charge of the national criminal records.", "17.

It is aimed at preventing repeat sexual offences, making it easier to identify offenders and allowing them to be traced quickly at any time.", "A series of transitional measures lay down detailed arrangements for the placement on the register of persons who committed such offences prior to the entry into force of the above-mentioned Law. The provisions are applicable to persons who committed such offences before the date of promulgation of the Law but were the subject, after that date, of one of the decisions referred to in Article 706-53-2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 18 below). They can also be applied to persons serving a custodial sentence before the promulgation of the Law (at the request of the public prosecutor).", "18.
