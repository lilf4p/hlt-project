The applicant was born in 1936 and lives in Kumertau in the Republic of Bashkortostan.", "9. In September 1994 the applicant purchased an imported second-hand car from a third person. Subsequently, the Bashkir Customs Board (\u201cthe Customs\u201d) discovered that the car had been customs cleared by its previous owner on the basis of forged documents for which reason, on 13 May 1997, it con\ufb01scated the car pursuant to Article 280 of the Customs Code.", "10. Upon the applicant\u2019s challenge on 15 May 1997 to the Customs\u2019 decision, seeking to declare the decision to seize the car unlawful, the Sovetskiy District Court of Ufa upheld the Customs\u2019 decision on 24 June 1997. The judgment was final and not subject to appeal.", "11. On an unspecified date the applicant requested the Supreme Court to examine the case anew under a supervisory-review procedure. On 5 February 1999 the Presidium of the Supreme Court of Bashkortostan allowed the application, set aside the judgment and remitted the case for re-examination.", "12. By judgment of 19 March 1999 the Sovetskiy District Court held in the applicant\u2019s favour. It found it established that the applicant had not known that the customs clearance was improper for which reason the court quashed the Customs\u2019 decision of 13 May 1997 as unlawful. The judgment was final and not subject to appeal.", "13. Following a subsequent successful supervisory-review request submitted by the Customs, the above judgment of 19 March 1999 was quashed and the case remitted once more to the Sovetskiy District Court for consideration. By judgment of 28 April 2000 this court held in favour of the Customs and dismissed the applicant\u2019s challenge to the Customs\u2019 decision of 13 May 1997.", "14. Following yet another supervisory review the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation on 3 June 2002 quashed the above judgment of 28 April 2000 and re-instated the judgment of 19 March 1999 which granted the applicant\u2019s complaint that the Customs\u2019 decision of 13 May 1997 was unlawful.", "15. According to the applicant, since his request for recovery of the car lodged with the Customs on 24 April 1999 had been to no avail, on 3 June 1999 he unsuccessfully attempted to file a suit against the Customs before the Sovetskiy District Court of Ufa seeking, inter alia, the restitution of his car and non-pecuniary damages. He then unsuccessfully attempted to bring many actions against courts, including the Sovetskiy District Court of Ufa, and individual judges accusing them of libel, incompetence, and obstruction of justice. However, he has failed, according to information available to the Court, properly to institute proceedings with a view to obtain compensation for the relevant losses.", "16.

The applicant\u2019s appeal of 15 May 1997 against the Board\u2019s decision of 13 May 1997 was lodged under Article 239 of the then Code of Civil Procedure which introduced judicial review of executive decisions. Article 239 in force at the material time read as follows:", "Article 239. Decision of Court taken upon appeal", "A court, having established that the order of an administrative agency or official is unlawful, shall take a decision to allow the appeal.", "If the amount of the imposed fine exceeds the limit set by the legislation, the court shall reduce the amount of the fine down to the set limit. If the fine is imposed without consideration of the seriousness of the committed malefaction, personal characteristics of the guilty person and his economic situation, the court may reduce the amount of the fine.", "If acts of an administrative agency or official are lawful, the court shall take a decision to deny the appeal.", "19.

It states that any act, decision or omission by a state body or official can be challenged before a court if it encroaches on an individual\u2019s rights or freedoms or unlawfully vests an obligation or liability on an individual.
