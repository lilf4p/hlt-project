SERBIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3;David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson;Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens;Giorgio Malinverni;Guido Raimondi;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque", "TEXT": ["1. The applicant, Mr Igor Naskovi\u0107, is a Serbian national who was born in 1982 and is currently serving his sentence in the Ni\u0161 Penitentiary (kazneno-popravni zavod). He was represented before the Court by Mr M. Jovanovi\u0107, a lawyer practising in Ni\u0161.", "2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "3. On 8 April 2004 the District Court in Gnjilane, Kosovo, found the applicant guilty of murder and illegal possession of firearms, and sentenced him to 18 years\u2019 and 3 months\u2019 imprisonment.", "4. On an unspecified date thereafter this judgment became final.", "5. The applicant started serving his sentence in Kosovo, but on 9 December 2004 and upon his own request he was transferred to the Sremska Mitrovica Penitentiary, pursuant to the Agreement concluded between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (hereinafter \u201cthe Agreement\u201d; see paragraphs 44-50 below).", "6. On 13 September 2007 the applicant was transferred once again, this time to the Ni\u0161 Penitentiary.", "7. On an unspecified date the applicant filed a request to be transferred back to a prison in Kosovo based on Article 2 \u00a7 2 of the Agreement (see paragraph 44 below).", "8. On 4 August 2010 the Directorate for the Enforcement of Criminal Sanctions (hereinafter \u201cthe Directorate\u201d), as a department within the Ministry of Justice (see Article 12 \u00a7 2 at paragraph 27 below), rejected this request, noting that it had been based on family-related and health reasons. The Directorate firstly observed that the applicant had only complained about the pain in his ankles, in which respect he had been duly provided with adequate medication. Secondly, the Ni\u0161 Penitentiary had its own prison hospital and, if needed, the applicant could also be taken to other medical institutions outside of the penitentiary. Thirdly, the Ni\u0161 Penitentiary was the closest prison to Kosovo, which was where the applicant\u2019s family lived. Fourthly, the Ni\u0161 Penitentiary was best placed to secure the applicant\u2019s rehabilitation. Finally, the Agreement did not establish the applicant\u2019s \u201cright to be transferred\u201d to a prison of his choice. On the contrary, any transfer depended on the consent of the parties to the Agreement.", "9. On 5 February 2011 the applicant filed a fresh request to be transferred to Kosovo. Therein he explained that his entire family lived there and could not afford to visit him on a regular basis in Ni\u0161, nor for that matter, in view of the postal costs involved, even send him packages. The applicant further maintained that the quality of medical services provided in the Ni\u0161 Penitentiary was not adequate.", "10. On 29 March 2011 the Directorate rejected this transfer request. For the most part, it restated the reasons given on 4 August 2010, adding, inter alia, that the applicant had had regular contact with his family, albeit with some \u201ctechnical\u201d difficulties recently. Lastly, the Directorate noted that family reasons could not be decisive in the assessment of a transfer request, and recalled that the applicant had initially been transferred from Kosovo upon his own request.", "11. On 4 April 2011, not having yet received the Directorate\u2019s decision of 29 March 2011 and relying on Article 116 \u00a7 3 of the Enforcement of Criminal Sanctions Act 2005 and Article 208 \u00a7 2 of the General Administrative Proceedings Act (see paragraphs 27 and 29 below), the applicant filed an appeal with the Minister of Justice wherein, inter alia, he complained about the failure of the Directorate to consider his request of 5 February 2011.", "12. Having been served with the Directorate\u2019s decision of 29 March 2011, on 14 April 2011 the applicant filed an appeal with the Minister of Justice against it. Therein he stated that: (i) the Directorate was not competent to consider the transfer request; (ii) it should instead have properly been examined by another department within the Ministry of Justice; (iii) the Directorate had not complied with the procedures set forth in the Agreement; and (iv) the impugned reasoning was incoherent since the applicant\u2019s family lived in Kosovo, some 120 kilometres from Ni\u0161, and had had to negotiate a certain administrative procedure whenever leaving its territory.", "13. It would seem that on 18 April 2011 the applicant filed another submission with the Minister of Justice in support of his appeal of 14 April 2011.", "14. On 20 April 2011, and in view of the Directorate\u2019s ruling of 29 March 2011, the Minster of Justice rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal of 4 April 2011, deeming it moot. The appeal of 14 April 2011 is apparently still pending.", "15. On 20 September 2010 the applicant started a hunger strike, seeking his transfer to a prison in Kosovo.", "16. As of 5 October 2010 the applicant also refused to take any water.", "17. On 19 October 2010 the applicant discontinued the strike altogether.", "18. On 17 January 2011 the applicant again started a hunger strike, seeking his transfer to Kosovo.", "19. On 17 March 2011, following respiratory, kidney and orientation problems, as well as weight loss (more than fourteen kilograms in all), the applicant discontinued the hunger strike.", "20. However, on 12 April 2011, having received the Directorate\u2019s decision of 29 March 2011, the applicant decided to resume the strike, which included his refusal to take either food or water.", "21. The applicant thereafter apparently lost consciousness on several occasions, received an infusion and experienced kidney pains.", "22. On 20 April 2011 the applicant informed his lawyer that, fearing even more serious consequences, he had started taking water and would discontinue his hunger strike shortly.", "23. On 5 May 2011 the applicant\u2019s lawyer informed the court that his client had indeed discontinued the strike altogether.", "24. The applicant maintained that throughout the strikes referred to above, he had been examined by the prison doctor on a daily basis, but that when he had needed urgent medical assistance no such assistance had been provided.", "25. The applicant seems to have also been subjected to blood tests periodically, as well as to blood pressure and weight monitoring. The applicant was repeatedly warned by the prison medical staff that the strike was seriously endangering his health.", "26. Lastly, the applicant stated that it was never his intention to commit suicide, but merely to be transferred to a prison in Kosovo.", "27.
