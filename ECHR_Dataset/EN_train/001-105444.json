From March 2006 onwards he and his wife allegedly received anonymous threats. In 2007 the financial police allegedly demanded from the applicant a bribe of 50,000 United States dollars (USD) not to institute criminal proceedings against him, about which he complained to the State Security Committee.

None of those extraditions was followed by any complaints from the extradited individuals, their representatives or non-governmental organisations concerning any violations of their rights. Therefore, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General considered that there were no reasons not to trust the assurances from his Belarus counterpart.
