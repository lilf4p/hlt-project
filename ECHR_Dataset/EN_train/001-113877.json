De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["1. The applicants, Mr Krzysztof Og\u00f3rek and Mr Karol Og\u00f3rek (the applicants\u201d), are Polish nationals, who were born in 1929 and 1928 respectively and live in Tarn\u00f3w Opolski. They were represented before the Court by Mr J. Forystek, a lawyer practising in Krak\u00f3w.", "The Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz, succeeded by Ms J. Chrzanowska, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.", "2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "3. Before the Second World War the applicants\u2019 father, Pawe\u0142 Og\u00f3rek, owned a limestone plant which operated under the name \u201cLimestone Plant Og\u00f3rek and Co.\u201d (Zak\u0142ady Wapienne Og\u00f3rek i Sp\u00f3\u0142ka). The company also had a German name \u201cKalwerke Og\u00f3rek et Co.\u201d It was run by the applicants\u2019 father before and during the war, until 1945.", "In 1945 the plant consisted of two furnaces, one limestone plant, a smithy, an outhouse, office premises and 32 hectares of land, which included limestone deposits.", "4. On 14 June 1948 the plant was nationalised by virtue of the Minister of Industry and Commerce\u2019s (Minister Przemys\u0142u i Handlu) decision (\u201cthe 1948 decision\u201d) issued pursuant to section 3(1) and (5) of the Law of 3 January 1946 on the nationalisation of basic branches of the State economy (Ustawa o przej\u0119ciu na w\u0142asno\u015b\u0107 Pa\u0144stwa podstawowych ga\u0142\u0119zi gospodarki narodowej) (\u201cthe 1946 Act\u201d). The decision was published in the Cabinet\u2019s Official Gazette (Monitor Polski) no. 58 of 26 June 1948 and took effect on that date. It was issued together with an annex listing companies, including the one belonging to the applicants\u2019 father, which were subject to nationalisation and stipulated that \u201c... enterprises listed in the annex thereto shall be taken over by the State in return for compensation\u201d.", "5. On 30 December 1990 the applicants asked the Minister for Economy (Minister Gospodarki) to declare the 1948 decision null and void.", "9. On 30 July 2007 the Minister for Economy declared null and void the 1948 decision, finding that it had been issued in flagrant beach of the law since at the material time there had been no legal basis for the nationalisation of the applicants\u2019 property. In the course of the proceedings, the authorities obtained expert reports determining the enterprise\u2019s potential employment capacity on one shift vis-\u00e0-vis the technical equipment and its condition at the material time, bearing in mind war damage. It emerged from those reports that the plant had been partly destroyed and its potential production capacity had been severely limited due to the lack of electricity. This, in turn, justified the conclusion that its real employment capacity at the material time had been not more that 42 people on one shift, not from 70 to 213 as estimated for the purposes of the 1948 decision. Consequently, nationalisation of the plant had been unlawful as, pursuant to section 3(1) B of the 1946 Act, it could only be effected in respect of enterprises employing a minimum of 50 persons on one shift.", "10. On 6 August 2007, relying on the above decision, the applicants asked the Minister for Infrastructure to annul the decision validating the acceptance protocol on taking over the nationalised property (orzeczenie o zatwierdzeniu protoko\u0142u zdawczo-odbiorczego), issued by the Minister for Construction and Building Materials Industry (Minister Budownictwa i Przemys\u0142u Materia\u0142\u00f3w Budowlanych) on 29 November 1961.", "11. Since no action had been taken for some 17 months, on 21 January 2009 the applicants lodged a complaint with the Warsaw Regional Administrative Court, alleging inactivity on the part of the Minister for Infrastructure.", "12. On 23 February 2009 the Minister for Infrastructure declared the contested decision null and void, concluding that it had been issued in flagrant breach of the law because it had been based on the 1948 decision found to have been ab initio unlawful.", "13. On 11 February 2003 the applicants issued the Prime Minister a legal notice, summoning him to \u201cremove the state of infringement of a law\u201d (wezwanie do usuni\u0119cia naruszenia prawa) by enacting the Cabinet\u2019s ordinance ensuring the proper implementation of the 1946 Act within 30 days from the date of service of that notice.", "The applicants relied on section 7 of the 1946 Act, by virtue of which a Cabinet\u2019s ordinance was to be issued in order to determine the rules governing the calculation and means of payment of compensation for nationalised property (see also paragraphs 39-40 below). They stressed that, despite the fact that although by that stage 57 years had elapsed from the date of entry into force of the 1946 Act and despite the State\u2019s legal duty to implement fully its provisions, the Cabinet had not yet enacted the ordinance, thus making it impossible for the former owners to receive the promised compensation. They further maintained that the State authorities\u2019 failure to act amounted to a constitutional tort (delikt konstutucyjny) in the form of a legislative omission (zaniechanie legislacyjne) \u2013 for which both the former Prime Ministers of Poland and the current one had been responsible. Simultaneously, the applicants summoned the Prime Minister to pay them compensation in an amount of 30,000,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) for the nationalised plant, together with statutory interest from 1 July 1949 (one year after the 1948 decision had taken effect) until the date of settlement.", "14. On 26 February 2003 the Prime Minister\u2019s Chancellery, in its reply to the applicants\u2019 notice, stated, among other things, the following:", "\u201cIn connection with [your legal notice] and acting on the Prime Minister\u2019s instruction, I should inform you that there is no legal basis for the issuance of the ordinances referred to in sections 6 and 7 of the 1946 Act by the Cabinet.", "...", "The statutory authorisation (upowa\u017cnienie ustawowe) to issue ordinances referred to in section 7(4) and (6) [of the 1946 Act] sets out a range of matters for regulation. These are: the composition of the [compensation] commission, the rules for the appointment of its members, the quorum, the rules of procedure before the commission, the rules for appeals against its decisions, the assessment of circumstances relevant for compensation, the means of payment of compensation and determination of the amortisation of securities.", "It must be noted that the enactment of ordinances governing most of the above matters would be incompatible with the laws applicable at present. ... The matters regulated by [the 1946 Act] and [to be regulated] by the prospective ordinances relate to the constitutional right of property, a matter which is particularly designated for regulation in the form of a statute. It is therefore doubtful that any statutory authorisation to issue an ordinance could transfer [to the Cabinet] the entirety of the matters included in the authorisation, the more so as there are already in place and in force statutory provisions enacted after the entry into force of [the 1946 Act]. Issuing today, on the basis of this Act, ordinances under its section 7(4) and (6) could lead to the incompatibility of statutory solutions (subsequent to the Act) with ordinances.", "...", "[P]ursuant to Article 92 \u00a7 1 of the Polish Constitution, ... the enactment of an ordinance is admissible only on the basis of a detailed authorisation included in a statute and in order to implement that statute. This authorisation must be of a detailed nature in terms of the subject (must state an authority competent to issue an ordinance), the object (must state the range of matters delegated for regulation) and its content (must state the directions as to the content of an [ordinance]).... Pursuant to the Constitutional Court\u2019s case-law, the absence of directions is sufficient to consider the authorisation unconstitutional, even if the remaining requirements are met.", "...", "First of all, the matters delegated in the [relevant] authorisation should have been addressed in [the 1946 Act] itself. The matter left by the legislature for regulation by ordinances (e.g. the procedure for the appointment of members of the commission, the procedure for appeals, the amortisation of securities, questions of compensation) are of such importance for an individual and his or her constitutional rights and guarantees that they cannot be regulated by any means other than a statute. ... Moreover, the statutory authorisation in [the 1946 Act] does not contain directions.", "In sum, it should be concluded that in the light of the above arguments, it would not be legally admissible to issue the Cabinet\u2019s ordinances on the basis of section 7(4) and (6) of [the 1946 Act].\u201d", "15. On 11 March 2003 the applicants lodged a complaint under the provisions of the law of 11 May 1995 on the Supreme Administrative Court (\u201cthe 1995 Act\u201d) (ustawa o Naczelnym S\u0105dzie Administracyjnym), alleging inactivity on the part of the Prime Minister in that the Cabinet had failed to issue an ordinance enabling the full implementation of the 1946 Act. This, in their submission, was in breach of several provisions of the Constitution.", "16. On 21 May 2003 the Supreme Administrative Court rejected the complaint as being inadmissible in law. It stated that under the applicable laws its scope of jurisdiction over the State authorities\u2019 actions or inactions was limited to their duties with respect to public administration and did not encompass any control of their competence in the sphere of the issuing of normative acts.", "17. On 27 June 2003 the applicant\u2019s lodged a constitutional complaint against the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s decision of 21 May 2003. They challenged the constitutionality of section 16(1) (1)-(4) of the 1995 Act in so far as this provision denied them access to a court to seek compensation granted under the 1946 Act, in particular as it excluded the possibility of lodging a complaint about the inactivity of the Prime Minister, i.e. the legislative omission consisting in the failure to enact the relevant ordinance, as required by the 1946 Act.", "They further asked the Constitutional Court to declare unconstitutional section 7(1) (6) of the 1946 Act, in so far as it left to the Cabinet full discretion as to the date of payment and detailed procedure for compensation and thereby deprived them of access to a court in order to seek compensation for their nationalised property. Alternatively, they asked the court to declare that 7(1) (6) of the 1946 Act was an illusory provision and as such could not be considered part of the legal order and, on the basis of this declaration, to discontinue the proceedings in this part.", "They invoked, in particular, Article 2 (rule of law), Article 21 (protection of ownership), Article 45 (right of fair trial), Article 64 (right of ownership) and Article 77 (right to compensation for unlawful action of public authority) of the Constitution and Article \u00a7 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.", "18. On 8 September 2004 the Constitutional Court discontinued the proceedings. As regards the first limb of the complaint, it ruled so on account of the fact that section 16(1) (1)-(4) of the 1995 Act had lost its binding force. As regards section 7(1) (6) of the 1946 Act, it discontinued the proceedings holding that ruling on the merits of this part of the complaint was inadmissible in law. In particular, it held that it could not review the constitutionality of section 7(1) (6) of the 1946 Act since, pursuant to Article 79 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution, a constitutional complaint could only be directed against provisions on the basis of which the courts or administrative authorities gave a final decision on rights, freedoms or obligations of the complainant. The contested provision was not a legal basis for the final decision examined by the Constitutional Court. Accordingly, it was prevented from dealing with the merits of this part of the complaint.", "19. On 20 October 2004 the applicants asked the Prime Minister to ensure the enactment of an ordinance for the proper implementation of the 1946 Act by the Cabinet or, alternatively, in case of his refusal to do so, to issue an individual, appealable administrative decision refusing to see to the enactment of that ordinance.", "20. On 20 November 2004 the Prime Minister gave a decision discontinuing the proceedings, relying on section 105 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Administrative Procedure (Kodeks post\u0119powania administracyjnego) by virtue of which an administrative authority should discontinue proceedings if, for any reason, they had become devoid of purpose. In essence, the reasoning was two-fold. First, the Prime Minister found that it was inadmissible in law to regulate the public authorities\u2019 normative activity by means of administrative decisions. Such decisions could be given only in the context of the application of the law, whereas normative acts were created in the completely distinct sphere of lawmaking. Secondly, the public authorities\u2019 normative activity was their exclusive and, at the same time, sovereign competence and there were no grounds for interfering with this activity because, in his view, it would infringe the fundamental constitutional principles of the division of powers and the rule of law, as well as the competences of the constitutional authorities of Poland, namely the Cabinet.", "21. The applicants asked for the matter to be reconsidered. On 11 January 2005 the Prime Minister upheld the contested decision, reiterating that the issues raised by the applicants could not be addressed by an individual administrative decision.", "22. The applicants appealed to the Warsaw Regional Administrative Court.", "23. On 12 August 2005 the court heard, and dismissed, the appeal. It upheld the grounds given in the previous decisions, holding that an administrative decision could be issued only in an individual case concerning a specific person and his or her concrete rights or obligations but not to compel an authority to enact a normative act, which in a general and abstract way regulates the legal situation of an unqualified number of persons. It also held the following:", "\u201cIt should be stressed that the Supreme Court\u2019s case-law underlines that the Cabinet\u2019s failure to discharge its duty arising from its competence to enact an ordinance ensuring the proper implementation of a statute infringes the constitutional principles of the functioning of a democratic state ruled by law (Articles 2 and 7 of the Constitution) and, accordingly, may constitute a constitutional tort. ...", "This court is of the opinion that the proper judicial protection of the applicants\u2019 interests is secured in the provisions of the Civil Code. Article 4171 of the Code invoked in the appeal makes it possible [for them] to seek damages caused by the legislative omission of the State Treasury.\u201d", "24. The applicants lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Administrative Court (Naczelny S\u0105d Administracyjny), alleging a number of procedural shortcomings on the part of the first-instance court and the Prime Minister and a breach of Article 77 of the Constitution in that the contested decisions had prevented them from pursuing their claim for damages arising from the state authorities\u2019 unlawful acts \u2013 most notably their failure to enact the ordinance implementing fully the 1946 Act.", "On 8 November 2006 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the appeal as lacking any legal basis.", "25. On 8 September 2003 the applicants sued the State Treasury, statio fisci the Prime Minister, before the Warsaw Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) for unpaid compensation for the nationalised company. They sought PLN 30,000,000 in damages, with statutory interest from 1 July 1949 until settlement, and PLN 24,000 by way of costs and expenses. They relied on Article 77 of the Constitution and Article 417 of the Civil Code as applicable on that date (see paragraphs 41-44 below).", "26. On 8 June 2004 the court gave judgment in default and granted the applicants\u2019 claims in their entirety.", "27. Following the defendant\u2019s opposition, the case was reconsidered by the Regional Court. The defendant asked the court to quash the judgment in default and to dismiss the applicants\u2019 claims.", "28. On 9 December 2004 the applicants modified their claim for payment of statutory interest, seeking payment only from 1 September 2004 until the date of settlement.", "29. On 21 February 2005 the court summoned the Minister for the Treasury to take part in the proceedings as the second defendant.", "30. In their pleading of 2 March 2006 the applicants altered the legal basis for their claims, stating that as those claims were based on a legislative omission on the part of the authorities consisting in their failure to enact an ordinance pursuant to section 7(4) and (6) of the 1946 Act, they should be based on Article 4171 \u00a7 4 of the Civil Code, which entered into force on 1 September 2004 (see paragraphs 42-43 below).", "31. On 14 March 2006 the Regional Court quashed the judgment in default. It dismissed the applicants\u2019 claims for PLN 30,000,000 in damages and for costs and discontinued the proceedings in respect of their claim for payment of statutory interest.", "The reasoning for the judgment was in essence based on the Supreme Court\u2019s resolution of 24 November 2005 (cited below, see paragraphs 45-47 below). It read, in so far as relevant, as follows:", "\u201cThere is no dispute [between the parties] over the facts of the case ... The dispute is limited solely to [the question] whether the claims brought in this case are wellfounded in the light of the factual and legal bases relied on by the plaintiffs and to the amount of [compensation].", "...", "Considering the legal and factual basis invoked by the plaintiffs, their claims should be dismissed.", "Section 7 of the 1946 Act, on which they rely, in its original version provided that an owner of an enterprise taken over by the State would receive compensation from the State Treasury within 1 year from the date on which a notice of final determination of the amount of compensation due had been served on him. Such compensation was to be paid in securities, although in exceptional circumstances also in cash or other values, and its amount was to be determined by special commissions. ...", "Pursuant to section 7(4) and (6) the composition of the commissions, the rules for the appointment of their members, the quorum, the rules of procedure and rules for appeals against their decisions and the detailed rules for the calculation of compensation and means of its payment and depreciation of securities were to be determined by the Cabinet\u2019s ordinance.", "Despite [this] statutory authorisation, the above-mentioned ordinance (the failure to enact it, which was to be the cause of the loss sustained by the plaintiffs) has never been enacted which, in consequence, made it impossible [for the authorities] to establish the relevant commissions and to set up the procedure for the determination of the amount of compensation and its payment.", "Accordingly, this legislative omission, which has been relied on by the plaintiffs as the cause of their loss, occurred in 1946 or, at the latest in 1947, assuming that in general the absence of any time-limit for the enactment (a specific action) is tantamount to a duty to enact an act implementing the law without undue delay. This opinion is supported by [the fact] that at the material time the Cabinet issued ordinances implementing other provisions of the 1946 Act. The same point of view was expressed by the Supreme Court in a resolution of 24 November 2005 ...[;] this court shares this point of view, and the applicants, when justifying their claims, have so far done the same.", "The provisions of the civil law as applicable at the material time, preceding the entry into force of the Civil Code, did not provide for the State Treasury\u2019s liability for legislative activity [or inactivity] of its agents. This situation did not change after the entry into force of the Civil Code on 1 January 1965, providing, in its Articles 417 and 418, for the State Treasury\u2019s [tortious] liability, the scope of which did not encompass the State authorities\u2019 legislative activity.", "...", "By the same token, it cannot be assumed that the defendant\u2019s civil liability for the consequences of the so-called legislative omission is based on Article 417, which, in contrast to what the plaintiffs tried to plead, does not embody the State\u2019s legislative activity.", "This situation did not change radically on 17 October 1997, the date of entry into force of the new Constitution which, in Article 77 \u00a7 1, proclaimed the right to compensation for any harm caused by an act of a public authority in breach of the law and the possibility of its direct application. While the above-mentioned provision of the Constitution undoubtedly refers to civil liability including the State authorities\u2019 normative activity ..., this liability cannot be taken in the abstract from regulations concerning civil claims laid down in the Civil Code and specific statutes and, accordingly, cannot be an autonomous legal basis for this kind of claims.", "...", "In view of the foregoing, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims cannot be justified under Article 77 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.", "...", "Article 4171 of the Civil Code, introduced ... on 1 September 2004 and invoked by the plaintiffs could be a legal basis for their claim.", "This provision includes the defendant\u2019s civil liability for the consequences of the socalled legislative omission in case of a failure to enact a normative act, where there is a statutory duty to do so. However, pursuant to section 5 of [the relevant law amending the Civil Code], setting out the temporal scope of the operation of [Article 4171], excludes the possibility of its application to events and situations that occurred before the date of its entry into force, requiring [the courts] to apply in that regard the hitherto applicable provisions, including Article 417, which was repealed by that law.", "It should therefore be concluded that both Article 417 and Article 4171 of the Civil Code read in conjunction with Article 77 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution cannot be legal bases for granting the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.", "...\u201d", "32. The applicants appealed to the Warsaw Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny). On 5 December 2006 the appeal was dismissed.", "33. On 8 April 2009 the applicants sued the State Treasury staciones fisci the Minister for Economy and the Minister for Infrastructure before the Warsaw Regional Court, seeking damages arising from the nationalisation of the limestone plant. They sought 26,000,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) each and the costs of the proceedings. Later, they limited the claim to PLN 16,756,228.50, an amount corresponding to the damage as determined by experts appointed by the court. This sum included PLN 12,634,426.05 for damage caused by exploitation of the limestone deposits by the State and PLN 3,895,607.25 for damage caused by nationalisation of the enterprise\u2019s buildings, machines and technical equipment.", "34. On 20 June 2011 the Regional Court, relying on Article 160 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the CAP granted the applicants\u2019 claim in its entirety. It awarded each applicant PLN 8,378,114.25 (i.e. the whole amount jointly claimed) with interest from 21 June 2011 and PLN 2,228 for the costs incurred. The court held that there was no doubt that the applicants had sustained loss that should be compensated by the State. That loss consisted in the value of the plant on the date of its nationalisation, the value of the limestone deposits exploited by the State and the costs involved in the rehabilitation of the nationalised land.", "35. The State Treasury appealed against the judgment", "36. The case was heard by the Warsaw Court of Appeal on 28 February 2012. The court fully upheld the Regional Court\u2019s findings of fact and law and its assessment of evidence. It gave partial judgment. It rejected the defendant\u2019s appeal in so far as it concerned compensation for the value of the enterprise\u2019s buildings, machines and technical equipment and upheld the award in this respect, granting each applicant PLN 1,947,803.62 (i.e. a total sum of PLN 3,895,607.24). This ruling is final.", "The Court of Appeal postponed the examination of the remainder of the claim (compensation amounting to PLN 12,634,426.05 for damage caused by exploitation of the limestone deposits by the State). In that respect, it decided to obtain a fresh expert report in order to determine the value of the loss actually sustained. The expert was appointed on 12 July 2012. The proceedings are pending.", "37. Following the establishment of the communist regime in Poland nearly all branches of industry, as well as banking, insurance, transport and commercial companies were taken over by the State under the 1946 Act which, in its section 1, stated the purposes of nationalisation as follows:", "\u201c In order to ensure the planned rebuilding of the state economy, the economic sovereignty of the State and to foster the general well-being, the State shall take over ownership of enterprises on the conditions laid down in this law.\u201d", "Pursuant to section 2(1), only those industrial, mining, transport, banking, insurance and commercial enterprises that belonged to the Third Reich and the former Free City of Gda\u0144sk, their citizens (except for those of Polish or other nationality who had been persecuted by the Germans), German and Gda\u0144sk legal persons (except for those set up under public law), companies controlled by German or Gda\u0144sk citizens or administration or those owned by persons who had defected to the enemy were to be taken over by the State without payment of compensation.", "38. Section 3(1) of the 1946 Act (as amended) states that the owners of the remaining enterprises were to be compensated for their nationalised property. That provision reads, in so far as relevant, as follows:", "\u201c1. The State shall compensate [the owners] for taking over ownership of the following:", "A. Mining and industrial enterprises in the following sectors of State economy:", "1) mines and mining leases subject to mining law;", "2) oil and gas industry, including mines, refineries, gasoline production and other processing plants, gas pipes and synthetic fuel industry;", "3) companies that generate, process, transmit or distribute electricity ...;", "4) companies that generate, process, transmit or distribute gas ...;", "5) water supply companies serving more than one municipality ...;", "6) steelworks and non-ferrous metals smelting plants;", "7) armaments, aviation and explosives industry;", "8) coking plants;", "9) sugar factories and refineries;", "10) industrial distilleries, spirit refineries and vodka production plants;", "11) breweries with an annual output exceeding 15,000 hectolitres;", "12) yeast production plants;", "13) grain plants with a daily output exceeding 15 tons of grain ...;", "14) oil plants with an annual output exceeding 500 tons and all refineries of edible fats;", "15) cold stores;", "16) large and medium textile industry;", "17) printing industry and printing houses;", "...", "B.

Section 7 lays down general principles for compensation to be paid for nationalised property. It states, in so far as relevant, as follows:", "\u201c1. The owner of an enterprise whose ownership has been taken over by the State (section 3) shall receive compensation from the State Treasury within one year from the date on which a notice of final determination of the amount of compensation due has been served on him.", "2. Such compensation shall in principle be paid in securities; however, in exceptional and economically justified cases it may also be paid in cash or other values.", "3. The amount of compensation due shall be determined by special commissions. The persons concerned shall have the right to participate in proceedings before those commissions. If need be and in any case if so requested by the persons concerned, the commission shall appoint appropriate experts.", "4. The composition of the commissions, the rules for the appointment of their members, the quorum, the rules of procedure before the commissions and rules for appeals against their decisions shall be determined by an ordinance issued by the Cabinet.", "5. The following factors shall be taken into account in determining compensation:", "a) general deterioration of the value of State property;", "b) net value of the corporate property on the date of nationalisation;", "c) deterioration of the value of the enterprise cause by war losses or losses incurred by the enterprise in connection with the war, occupation in the period from 1 September 1939 to the date of nationalisation;", "d) value of expenditures made after 1 September 1939;", "e) special circumstances affecting the value of the enterprise (concession terms, licenses etc.).", "6.

However, since 5 February 1946, the date of entry into force of the 1946 Act, until the present day the Cabinet has not yet issued an ordinance on the organisation of the compensation commissions and determination of compensation referred to in section 7(4) and (6).", "41. Articles 417 et seq. of the Civil Code (Kodeks cywilny) provide for the State\u2019s liability in tort.", "In the version applicable until 1 September 2004, Article 417 \u00a7 1, which lays down a general rule, read as follows:", "\u201c1.

The relevant amendments were in essence aimed at enlarging the scope of the State Treasury\u2019s liability in tort under Article 417 of the Civil Code \u2013 including the addition of a new Article 4171 and provision being made for the State\u2019s tortious liability for failure to enact legislation, a concept known as \u201clegislative omission\u201d (zaniechanie legislacyjne).", "43. Following the 2004 Amendment, Article 4171, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:", "\u201c4. If damage has been caused by failure to enact a law [akt normatywny] where there is a statutory duty to do so, the incompatibility of the failure to enact that law shall be established by the court dealing with the claim for damages.\u201d", "However, under the transitional provisions of section 5 of the 2004 Amendment, Article 417 as applicable before 1 September 2004 applies to all events and legal situations that subsisted before that date.", "44. The concept of the State\u2019s civil liability for a constitutional tort was introduced into the Polish legal order on 17 October 1997, the date of entry into force of the 1997 Polish Constitution.", "Article 77 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution states, in so far as relevant, as follows:", "\u201cEveryone shall have the right to compensation for any harm done to him by any act of a public authority in breach of the law.\u201d", "45. In its resolution of 24 November 2005 (\u201cthe 2005 Resolution\u201d), the Supreme Court (S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy), sitting as a bench of three judges, dealt with the following legal questions submitted to it by the Warsaw Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny):", "\u201c Is the State Treasury liable for damage caused by failure to enact a law [akt normatywny] if the duty to enact that law, laid down in section 7(4) and (6) of [the 1946 Act] was not fulfilled until the date of entry into force of [the 2004 Amendment],", "and, if so,", "When this duty should have been performed and whether damages for failure to enact the above law corresponds to unreceived compensation for the enterprise nationalised by the State, determined in accordance with the principles laid down in section 7(2) and (5) of [the 1946 Act]?\u201d.", "The question arose in the context of a case brought by a certain E.K., who sought damages for the nationalisation of her family\u2019s printing house and, as one of the basis for her claim, invoked Article 4171 of the Civil Code, relying on the State\u2019s legislative omission consisting in its failure to issue the relevant ordinance.", "46. The Supreme Court\u2019s answer in the operative part of the resolution reads:", "\u201cUntil the date of entry into force of [the 2004 Amendment] the Cabinet\u2019s failure to issue an ordinance foreseen in section 7(4) and (6) of [the 1946 Act] did not constitute a basis for a claim by an owner of the nationalised enterprise for damages arising from [nationalisation].\u201d", "47. The resolution contains extensive reasoning, the main thrust of which reads as follows:", "\u201c[As regards the time-frame for the issue of the ordinance]. The determination of the beginning of that situation carries with it a certain element of arbitrariness since [the 1946 Act] does not lay down any term within which the ordinance referred to in section [7] (4) and (6) should be issued. Assuming that in general the absence of a term is tantamount to a duty to enact a law without undue delay, it can be considered that the discharge of the statutory authorisation, assuming the existence of willingness of the authorised body (the Cabinet) should have taken place in 1946 or in 1947 at the latest. This is supported by the fact that the Cabinet issued ordinances implementing other provisions (including section 2(7) of the Act, a fundamental provision for the interest of the State).", "[As regards the State\u2019s civil liability for legislative omission], ... it should be concluded that before the entry into force of the 1997 Constitution the State had not been liable under civil law for the consequences of its legislative inactivity. ...", "17 October 1997, marking the entry into force of the Constitution is the relevant date as its constitutes the beginning of the existence in the legal order of, inter alia, Article 77 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution, proclaiming the right of \u201ceveryone\u201d to compensation for any harm done to him by any act of a public authority in breach of the law ....", "Assuming that Article 77 \u00a7 1 does not contain a provision making it possible to draw from it a direct basis for a claim for damages for the legislature\u2019s inactivity, it must be said that the rules for the State\u2019s liability in the sphere of law-making should be established by means of an ordinary statute, determining in a more detailed manner than Article 77 \u00a71 premises for an effective claim. ...", "Article 4171 \u00a7 4 of the Civil Code, as introduced by [the 2004 Amendment] satisfies the requirement of detailed premises. The relevant temporal consequences have been clearly set out in its section 5, evidently indicating the prospective operation of Article 4171 \u00a7 4 of the Civil Code. A formulation laying down a non-retroactive character of the provision is telling in that it refers to \u201cevents and legal situation that subsisted before its entry into force\u201d ... In consequence, the assessment of the effects of legislative omission subsisting before 1 September 2004 was governed by [earlier provisions]. The relevant Article 417, in its version before the amendment, did not include legislative omission as it was based on a completely different premise, namely, the absence of the State\u2019s civil liability for the legislature\u2019s acts. ... \u201c", "48. On 5 December 2007 the Supreme Court, sitting as a bench of three judges, dealt with a cassation appeal (kasacja) lodged by Lubelska Fabryka Maszyn i Narz\u0119dzi Rolniczych \u201cPlon\u201d, a limited liability company which was at that time subject to a winding-up procedure. The appellant contested the judgment of the Warsaw Court of Appeal of 2 February 2007, rejecting its appeal (apelacja) against the judgment of the Warsaw Regional Court of 30 May 2006 whereby its claim for damages arising from the State\u2019s failure to issue the relevant ordinance, pursuant to section 7(2) and (5) of the 1946 Act, had been dismissed. The claim was based on Article 77 of the Constitution and Articles 417 and 4171 \u00a7 4 of the Civil Code.", "In dismissing the cassation appeal, the Supreme Court essentially reiterated the grounds stated in the 2005 Resolution (see paragraph 25 above), stressing that the impugned legislative omission occurred in 1946 or, at the latest in 1947 and since then had continued. However, Article 77 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution could not be considered a legal basis for a claim deriving from an \u201comission\u201d by public authorities since that provision clearly covered only their \u201cacts\u201d. The provision of Article 4171, enabling a plaintiff to seek damages for legislative omission, had been introduced only on 1 September 2004 by virtue of the 2004 Amendment. The terms of section 5 of the Amendment 2004 were unambiguous: Article 4171 of the Civil Code did not apply to events and situations that had subsisted before its entry into force. Consequently, its operation was excluded in respect of legislative omissions that originated in facts that had occurred earlier, even if this state of affairs continually existed until the present day.", "49. On 13 June 2011 the Constitutional Court (Trybuna\u0142 Konstytucyjny) heard a constitutional complaint lodged by a company Elektrownia w Kielcach sp\u00f3\u0142ka akcyjna, challenging the constitutionality of section 5 of the 2004 Amendment in so far as it excluded the application of Article 4171 of the Civil Code to situations that had subsisted before the entry into force of that Amendment, i.e. 1 September 2004 (see also paragraphs 20-26 above). The claimant invoked, in particular, Article 77 \u00a7 1 of (right to compensation for unlawful action of public authority) read in conjunction with Article 2 (rule of law), Article 64 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 (right of ownership) read in conjunction with Article 21 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 (protection of ownership) and Article 32 \u00a7 1 (equality before the law) and Article 45 \u00a7 1 (right of fair trial) of the Constitution.", "Before lodging the complaint, the company, which had been nationalised under the 1946 Act, unsuccessfully sought compensation for the Prime Minister\u2019s legislative inactivity in that he had failed to enact an ordinance on rules for compensation as required by the 1946 Act. On 4 April 2008 the claim was finally rejected by the Warsaw Court of Appeal on the grounds stated in the 2005 Resolution (see paragraphs 23-25 above).", "The Constitutional Court\u2019s decision (no.

Consequently, in the light of the provisions of the Constitution it is difficult to assume that non-fulfilment of the duty to enact an ordinance on compensation for nationalised property derived from [the 1946 Act] amounted to \u201c[an] act of a public authority in breach of the law\u201d linked with the State\u2019s liability for [constitutional] tort under the Constitution. Even assuming that the state of legislative omission still persists, it should at the same time be concluded that the duty is non-enforceable.

In the years 1990-2005 Parliament dealt with 11 bills on reprivatisation, restitution and compensation for property taken over by the communist authorities under nationalisation laws passed in 19441962.
