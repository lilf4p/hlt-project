The applicant was born in 1966. He is a practising lawyer and lives in Subotica, Serbia.", "6. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "7. On 19 May 2004 the Police Department in Subotica appointed the applicant to represent D.G., a suspect in a preliminary criminal investigation, during his questioning by the police. The applicant provided no legal assistance to the suspect beyond this hearing.", "8. On the same day the applicant filed a request with the police, seeking payment of his fees in accordance with the Tariff issued by the Bar Association.", "9. Having received no response, on 13 September 2004 the applicant lodged a civil claim with the Municipal Court in Subotica, requesting that his fees be covered (7,800 Serbian Dinars, \u201cRSD\u201d, approximately 105 Euros, \u201cEUR\u201d, at the time, according to the exchange rate of the National Bank of Serbia).", "10. On 21 April 2005, the Municipal Court rendered a judgment in default (presuda zbog izostanka) in favour of the applicant. It thereby ordered the Police Department to pay him a total of RSD 18,800 (approximately EUR 230 at the time), on account of his fees and litigation costs, plus statutory interest.", "11. On 15 August 2005 the District Court in Subotica quashed this judgment on appeal.", "12. On 23 January 2006 the Municipal Court declared itself as lacking jurisdiction ratione materiae to consider the applicant\u2019s claim on its merit (oglasio se stvarno nenadle\u017enim za postupanje) and ordered the applicant to pay RSD 10,500 for litigation costs (approximately EUR 120 at the time).", "13. On 29 September 2006 the District Court confirmed this decision on appeal and it thus became final.", "14. Both the Municipal Court and the District Court reasoned, inter alia, that the fees in question were related to a preliminary criminal investigation, which was a specific kind of administrative proceedings, not a formal criminal procedure, and concluded that his claim was therefore not for the civil courts to determine. The police themselves, however, had had an obligation to decide upon the applicant\u2019s request.", "15. On 13 November 2006 the applicant paid the litigation costs imposed against him.", "16. On 23 January 2008, on the grounds that he had misdirected his payment of 13 November 2006, the applicant was ordered once again to pay the litigation costs at issue plus statutory interest. By March 2009 the applicant therefore paid another RSD 18,068 (approximately EUR 190 at the time).", "17. On 31 July 2006 the Police Department in Subotica appointed the applicant to represent G.I., D.\u010c., V.\u0110., B.\u0110. and D.\u0110., all suspects in a preliminary criminal investigation, during their questioning by the police.", "18. On the same day the applicant filed a request with the police, seeking payment of his fees in accordance with the Tariff issued by the Bar Association (in total RSD 12,960, approximately EUR 155 at the time).", "19. On 6 August 2008, 24 April 2009, 19 May 2009 and 1 June 2009 the Police Department in Subotica appointed the applicant to represent S.S., B.B., A.S., and D.J., all suspects in a preliminary criminal investigation, during their questioning by the police.", "20. On 11 August 2008, 11 May 2009, 21 May 2009 respectively the applicant filed a request with the police, seeking payment of his fees in accordance with the Tariff issued by the Bar Association (in total RSD 48,000, approximately EUR 500 at the time).", "21. Article 193 \u00a7 1 provides, inter alia, that \u201ccriminal procedure costs\u201d (tro\u0161kovi krivi\u010dnog postupka) shall include all expenses incurred in connection with criminal proceedings, \u201cfrom their commencement until their conclusion\u201d.", "22. Article 193 \u00a7 6 provides that the costs incurred in the course of a preliminary criminal investigation (pretkrivi\u010dni postupak), which concern fees to be paid to a police-appointed lawyer, shall be covered by the police themselves.", "23. Article 196 provides, inter alia, that a defendant who has been convicted shall bear the costs of the criminal proceedings.", "24. Article 197 \u00a7 1 provides, inter alia, that should criminal proceedings (krivi\u010dni postupak) against a defendant be discontinued, the indictment be rejected, or the defendant be acquitted, the defence lawyer\u2019s fees shall be covered from the court\u2019s budget.", "25. Article 197 \u00a7 6 provides, inter alia, that should the criminal court reject a claim for costs made under Article 197 \u00a7 1, or fail to rule thereupon within a period of three months, the defendant and his or her lawyer shall have the right to file a separate claim before the civil courts.", "26.

Article 243 provides, inter alia, that a formal judicial investigation shall commence upon the adoption of a specific judicial decision to this effect.", "29. Costs covered by the police in connection with Article 225 of the Criminal Procedure Code cannot be considered as criminal procedure costs within the meaning of Article 193 thereof (see Komentar Zakonika o krivi\u010dnom postupku, Prof. dr Tihomir Vasiljevi\u0107 and Prof. dr Mom\u010dilo Gruba\u010d, IDP Justinijan, Belgrade, 2005, p. 338, paragraph 2).", "30.

The investigating judge held, inter alia, that the defendant against whom the charges had been dropped was not entitled to the full recovery of his lawyer\u2019s fees from the budget of the District Court in Subotica. Specifically, he noted that since a part of these fees concerned legal services rendered during a preliminary criminal investigation it was up to the police themselves to cover any such costs (the defendant\u2019s lawyer in the domestic proceedings being the applicant in the present case before the Court).", "32. Article 1 provides, inter alia, that the Civil Procedure Act shall be applied to all property-related/pecuniary matters (imovinskopravni sporovi), except those where the law specifically provides for another procedure.", "33. Article 16 provides, inter alia, that should a court establish its lack of jurisdiction ratione materiae it shall, ex officio, reject the claim in question regardless of the stage of the proceedings.", "34. Article 12 \u00a7 2 (a) provides that Municipal Courts shall have jurisdiction to rule in respect of all property-related/pecuniary claims (imovinskopravnim zahtevima) unless they fall within the competence of the Commercial Courts.", "35.

Where an appeal is not allowed, the claimant shall have the right to directly initiate an administrative dispute before the competent court of law.", "40.
