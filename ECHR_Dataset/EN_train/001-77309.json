Between May and August 1989 three hearings were held. An expert opinion was submitted to the court during that period.", "7. As the parties were subsequently invited to settle the case, between 15 November 1990 and 6 May 1991 the proceedings were stayed at their request in order to negotiate a settlement.", "8. On 29 June 1991 the Tarnobrzeg District Court delivered a judgment dismissing the applicant\u2019s action. The applicant appealed on 28 August 1991.", "9. At the appeal hearing of 28 October 1991 the Tarnobrzeg Regional Court decided to stay the proceedings pending the termination of other proceedings for the establishment of the defendant\u2019s ownership of the land. Those proceedings ended on 26 October 1998 with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision rejecting the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal as inadmissible.", "10. On 3 December 1999 the proceedings were resumed upon the applicant\u2019s request of 16 November 1999.", "11. On 23 December 1999 the Tarnobrzeg Regional Court quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case for re-examination, indicating the need to obtain an expert opinion on the exact route of the electricity line across the land.", "12. A hearing was held on 9 February 2000; the court ordered the preparation of the expert opinion and ordered the applicant to pay the expert\u2019s fee within 14 days.", "13. Between February and April 2000 the applicant repeatedly sought exemption from payment of the expert\u2019s fee.

On 31 May 2000 the Tarnobrzeg District Court decided to omit the evidence contained in the expert opinion. It examined as evidence the case files of three other sets of related proceedings and on that basis delivered a judgment dismissing the action.", "15. On 7 September 2000 the Tarnobrzeg Regional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal. The court agreed with the first-instance court that the defendant had the right of co-ownership to the plot on the date on which the proceedings were instituted and that the applicant\u2019s claim was accordingly inadmissible.", "16. Articles 417 et seq. of the Civil Code (kodeks cywilny) provide for the State\u2019s liability in tort.", "In the version applicable until 1 September 2004, Article 417 \u00a7 1, which lays down a general rule, read as follows:", "\u201c1. The State Treasury shall be liable for damage caused by a State official in the course of carrying out the duties entrusted to him.\u201d", "17. Article 418 of the Civil Code, as applicable until 18 December 2001, provided for the following exception in cases where damage resulted from the issue of a decision or order:", "\u201c1. If, in consequence of the issue of a decision or order, a State official has caused damage, the State Treasury shall be liable only if a breach of the law has been involved in the issue of the decision or order and if that breach is the subject of prosecution under the criminal law or of a disciplinary investigation, and the guilt of the person who caused the damage in question has been established by a final conviction or has been admitted by the superior of that person.", "2. The inability to establish guilt by way of a criminal conviction or in a decision given in disciplinary proceedings shall not exclude the State Treasury\u2019s liability for damage if such proceedings cannot be instituted in view of a [statutory] exception to prosecution or disciplinary action.\u201d", "18. On 1 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on amendments to the Civil Code and other statutes (Ustawa o zmianie ustawy \u2013 Kodeks cywilny oraz niekt\u00f3rych innych ustaw) (\u201cthe 2004 Amendment\u201d) entered into force. While the relevant amendments have in essence been aimed at enlarging the scope of the State Treasury\u2019s liability for tort under Article 417 of the Civil Code \u2013 including the addition of a new Article 4171 and the imposition on the State of tortuous liability for its omission to enact legislation (the so-called \u201clegislative omission\u201d; \u201czaniedbanie legislacyjne\u201d) \u2013 they are also to be seen in the context of the operation of a new statute introducing remedies for the unreasonable length of judicial proceedings.", "Following the 2004 Amendment, Article 4171, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:", "\u201c3. If damage has been caused by failure to give a ruling (orzeczenie) or decision (decyzja) where there is a statutory duty to give them, reparation for [the damage] may be sought after it has been established in the relevant proceedings that the failure to give a ruling or decision was contrary to the law, unless otherwise provided for by other specific provisions.\u201d", "19.

On 4 December 2001 the Constitutional Court (Trybuna\u0142 Konstytucyjny) dealt with two constitutional complaints in which the applicants challenged the constitutionality of Articles 417 and 418 of the Civil Code. They alleged, in particular, that those provisions were incompatible with Articles 64 and 77 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.", "21. On the same day the Constitutional Court gave judgment (no. SK 18/00) and held that Article 417 of the Civil Code was compatible with Article 77 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution in so far as it provided that the State Treasury was liable for damage caused by the unlawful action of a State official carried out in the course of performing his duties. It further held that even though Article 418 of the Civil Code was compatible with Article 64 of the Constitution, it was contrary to Article 77 \u00a7 1 since it linked the award of compensation for such damage with the personal culpability of the State official concerned, established in criminal or disciplinary proceedings.", "22. On 18 December 2001, the date on which the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment took effect, Article 418 was repealed. The Constitutional Court\u2019s opinion on the consequences of the repeal read, in so far as relevant:", "\u201cThe elimination of Article 418 of the Civil Code from the legal system ... means that the State Treasury\u2019s liability for the actions of a public authority consisting in the issue of unlawful decisions or orders will flow from the general principles of the State liability laid down in Article 417 of the Civil Code. This, however, does not rule out the application in the present legal system of other principles of State liability laid down in specific statutes and not necessarily only those listed in the Civil Code.\u201d", "23. On 17 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w post\u0119powaniu s\u0105dowym bez nieuzasadnionej zw\u0142oki) (\u201cthe 2004 Act\u201d) entered into force. It lays down various legal means designed to counteract and/or redress the undue length of judicial proceedings.", "A party to pending proceedings may ask for the acceleration of those proceedings and/or just satisfaction for their unreasonable length under Article 2 read in conjunction with Article 5(1) of the 2004 Act.", "Article 2, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:", "Article 5 provides, in so far as relevant:", "\u201c1.

Article 442 of the Civil Code sets out limitation periods in respect of various claims based on tort. That provision applies to situations covered by Article 417 of the Civil Code. Article 442, in so far as relevant, reads:", "\u201c1.

A complaint lodged under subsection 1 shall indicate the date on which the application was lodged with the Court.", "3. The relevant court shall immediately inform the Minister of Foreign Affairs of any complaints lodged under subsection 1.\u201d", "27.
