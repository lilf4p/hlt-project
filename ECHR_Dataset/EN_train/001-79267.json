The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Gdansk.", "5. On 24 May 1999 the applicant was detained on remand on suspicion of having committed numerous offences, inter alia kidnapping and aggravated robbery.", "6. The court based its detention order on a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences and on the severity of the likely penalty, which gave rise to a fear that the applicant would obstruct the proceedings.", "7. His pre-trial detention was extended by decisions of 15 July 1999, 20 October 1999, 24 January 2000, 27 June 2000, 10 November 2000, 3 January 2001, 26 March 2001, 30 April 2001, 21 November 2001, 25 April 2002, 16 July 2002, 8 July 2003, 20 January 2004, 13 July 2004, 28 July 2004, 6 August 2004, 20 August 2004, 27 August 2004, 3 September 2004, 12 October 2004, 11 January 2005, 19 July 2005 and 27 October 2005.", "8. In all the above-mentioned decisions the courts relied on the same grounds for detention as those given in the first detention order. In some the courts also referred to the complexity of the case, the need to conduct further investigations, the probability of collusion between the applicant and the co-accused and exertion of unlawful pressure on witnesses by the applicant and the fear that the applicant would go into hiding.", "9. On many occasions the applicant requested release or that a more lenient preventive measure be applied. Each time his requests were dismissed.", "10. The applicant appealed against the decisions extending his detention on several occasions. Only one of his appeals was allowed to the effect that the period of extension of his detention was reduced by two months (the Gda\u0144sk Court of Appeal decision of 17 August 2005).", "11. On 24 January 2000 the prosecution service filed with the Gda\u0144sk Regional Court a bill of indictment.

The hearing of 17 April 2001 was adjourned. As a consequence of the court\u2019s exceeding the permissible period of the length of intervals between hearings, the proceedings had to be conducted anew.", "13.

A hearing of 21 December 2001 was adjourned due to the absence of witnesses. The next hearings took place on 27 December 2001, 7 January 2002, 14 January 2002 and 21 January 2002.", "14. On 28 January 2002 the Gda\u0144sk Regional Court convicted the applicant of nine offences, acquitted him of the remaining three and sentenced him to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. The applicant and other accused appealed.", "15. On 9 April 2003 the Gda\u0144sk Court of Appeal quashed the judgment and remitted the case as it found that the judges deciding on the case had not been impartial.", "16. The hearings of 22 August 2003, 7 October 2003, 18 November 2003 and 19 December 2003 were adjourned since the applicant had so requested and since one of the accused had been absent.", "17.

On 28 December 2004 the Court of Appeal found that the length of proceedings had been excessive in the applicant\u2019s case and awarded him compensation. In its reasoned grounds the court stated that as a result of the fact that the trial court had exceeded the permissible length of time between the hearings of 26 March 2001 and 6 June 2001, the proceedings had to be conducted anew.
