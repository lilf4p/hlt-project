The proceedings are apparently still pending.", "19. The applicants complained on many occasions that the real reason behind Olga Biliak's prosecution was revenge for her refusal to cooperate with officers T. and N. from the Anti-Narcotics Police Department (\u0412\u0456\u0434\u0434\u0456\u043b \u043f\u043e \u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u044c\u0431\u0456 \u0437 \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043c \u043e\u0431\u0456\u0433\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0456\u0432), who had allegedly proposed that she sell drugs seized by the police from street dealers.", "20.

On 18 July, 11 August and 20 November 2003 Olga Biliak complained to a SIZO physician that her legs were swollen.

A paramedic (\u0444\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0434\u0448\u0435\u0440) prescribed \u201cmedical activated charcoal\u201d (\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0443\u0433\u0456\u043b\u043b\u044f).", "33. On 26 September 2003 the first applicant lodged a request with the SIZO seeking to have his daughter hospitalised.

According to the entries of December 2003 in Olga Biliak's diary, her state of health started to deteriorate seriously. On 4 December 2003 she had shaking chills and a rising temperature. On 9 December 2003 Olga Biliak wrote that she was losing weight rapidly. On 10 December 2003 she complained of nervous exhaustion, stating that she could hardly eat, being only able to keep down tiny pieces of food. She continued to lose weight very quickly. On 11 December 2003 Olga Biliak recorded that a high temperature had caused her fifth sleepless night. Constant weakness, drowsiness and a high temperature prevented her from going outside for walks. On 12 December 2003 Olga Biliak started to lose herself in time. On 13 December 2003, with her temperature constantly around 40oC, Olga Biliak was given a couple of fever-reducing pills. Her only friend in the cell prepared her tea in the morning, coffee and biscuits during the day and milk with sugar and butter in the evening. On 15 December 2003 Olga Biliak was given another pill and informed that she was to have her lungs X-rayed. Her body temperature that day was 39oC, subsequently receding to 35oC. On 17 December 2003 Olga Biliak was scheduled for an X-ray and given another fever-reducing pill.", "39. From mid-December 2003 the applicants and Olga Biliak's lawyer repeatedly requested the authorities to release her on account, inter alia, of her rapidly deteriorating state of health. On 13 January 2004 the Deputy Prosecutor of the Solomyanskyy District of Kyiv (\u0437\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0421\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c'\u044f\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0443 \u043c. \u041a\u0438\u0454\u0432\u0430) and, on 19 January 2004, the investigator dealing with her case, rejected those complaints without addressing the health issues.", "40. On 6 January 2004 Olga Biliak complained of stomach pain and was diagnosed with chronic gastritis.", "41. On 12 January 2004 Olga Biliak again complained to a physician that she had stomach pains and had vomited undigested food.", "42. On 21 January 2004 Olga Biliak was examined by a cardiologist, a psychiatrist and the Head of the Medical Board of the Prison Department (\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0456\u0434\u0434\u0456\u043b\u0443 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0456\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0414\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0434\u0435\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0443 \u0432\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u044c), and underwent an X-ray and a blood test. The X-ray revealed no abnormalities. According to the blood test, there was serious inflammation in Olga Biliak's body. She was diagnosed with acute bronchitis, chronic gastritis, anaemia, cachexia and mental disorders. Her state of health was assessed as being of \u201cmedium seriousness\u201d. She was prescribed some anti-inflammatory and light tranquilising drugs, as well as some antibiotics. Olga Biliak was asked if she was HIV-positive. She replied that she was not and refused to take a HIV test. However, that was the date when, according to the Government, the prison doctors started to suspect that she was HIV-positive.", "43. On 22 January 2004 the Governor of the SIZO applied to the Head of the District Police Department, stating that Olga Biliak's poor state of health prevented her from participating in any investigative actions and that she needed to be admitted to hospital urgently. He asked that the investigative authorities consider the possibility of her release on an undertaking not to abscond.", "44. On 28 and 30 January 2004 Olga Biliak was examined by a SIZO physician. Her state of health was again assessed as being of \u201cmedium seriousness\u201d and a recommendation was made to \u201ccontinue treatment\u201d.", "45. On 29 January 2004 the investigator of the District Police Department ordered Olga Biliak's release on health grounds. From the documents submitted by the parties, it is unclear when exactly this decision was received by the SIZO. One available copy of the decision has a stamp of the SIZO on the reverse side and a handwritten date \u2013 \u201c30.01.2004\u201d. However, another copy of the decision bears a SIZO stamp for incoming correspondence with the number 2954 and an incoming date of 2 February 2004.", "46. On 1 February 2004 at 9.15 p.m. Olga Biliak was visited by a prison doctor who gave her a painkiller and an anti-spasmodic drug. At 9.55 p.m. Olga Biliak died. The death certificate issued on the same day indicated bilateral pleurisy as the cause of death. According to the Government, Olga Biliak's death was caused by acute heart failure.", "47. The applicants provided two colour photographs of Olga Biliak's body, which show that she had been in an advanced state of exhaustion when she died.", "48. Immediately after Olga Biliak's death, the applicants lodged a criminal complaint against the SIZO staff for negligence.", "49. During the investigation into the applicants' complaint, the investigator questioned a SIZO physician, S., who had treated her, and the head of the SIZO medical unit. S. submitted that the deceased had been examined on a number of occasions; the last examination took place on 30 January 2004. According to him, at that time there were no grounds for placing Olga Biliak on the medical ward. She was found to be suffering from bronchitis, drug addiction, anaemia and cachexia. Taking into account her state of health, he had recommended her release.", "50. The head of the medical unit testified that on her arrival at the SIZO Olga Biliak had been examined and found to be suffering from drug addiction and certain psychiatric problems (such as hysteria), but in general her state of health had been considered satisfactory. The instructions of the SIZO physician were fully complied with and there had been no reason to transfer her to the SIZO medical wing.", "51. The head of the medical unit further stated that on 21 January 2004 he had examined Olga Biliak himself and found her state of health to be satisfactory. On the same day she was examined by the Head of the Medical Board of the Prison Department who diagnosed her with \u201cpossible AIDS, acute bronchitis, drug addiction and anaemia\u201d and considered that she should be released on medical grounds.", "52. The eight inmates who had shared the cell with Olga Biliak before her death claimed that during her detention she was frequently attended to by doctors and paramedics, and that her health had been satisfactory. Their written testimonies given to the Head of the SIZO are all very brief and drafted using the same style and expressions.", "53. According to the autopsy report of 25 March 2004 Olga Biliak died from HIV-related advanced purulent pneumonia. The autopsy also revealed a number of bruises on her hands, legs, left cheekbone and chin.", "54. In a decision of 30 April 2004 the investigator found that Olga Biliak's death was not caused by any violence or negligence, and decided not to institute criminal proceedings.", "55. On 8 June 2004 the Kyiv Deputy Prosecutor instituted disciplinary proceedings against the employees of the SIZO administrative office for mishandling correspondence, since they had registered the decision of 29 January 2004 and handed it to the Head of the SIZO only on 2 February 2004, although it had been received on 30 January 2004.", "56. On 14 June 2004 the Kyiv City Prosecutor's Office (\u041f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430 \u043c. \u041a\u0438\u0454\u0432\u0430) rejected the applicants' request to set aside the decision of 30 April 2004, stating that the investigation had been thorough and complete. During her detention the deceased had had appropriate medical treatment, and had received food and medication from her relatives. Until 21 January 2004 the authorities had had no information about her HIV status.", "57. On 18 June 2004, the Governor of the SIZO reprimanded the head of its registry for \u201cantedating the letter from the investigator which contained Olga Biliak's release order\u201d.", "58. The applicants challenged the decision of 30 April 2004 before the Shevchenkivskyy District Court of Kyiv (\u0428\u0435\u0432\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0434 \u043c. \u041a\u0438\u0454\u0432\u0430 \u2013 \u201cthe Shevchenkivskyy Court\u201d). On 16 December 2004 the court quashed that decision and ordered further inquiries, finding that the initial investigation had been inadequate and incomplete. It ordered an official postmortem examination of the body and sought to clarify the following issues:", "whether Olga Biliak, given her state of health, had been fit for detention in the SIZO;", "whether she had received proper medical treatment when in custody;", "whether she would have survived if she had been taken quickly to hospital;", "exactly when prison doctors had started to treat her health problems;", "the time and cause of death.", "59. Following this decision, the Shevchenkivskyy District Prosecutor's Office of Kyiv (\u041f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430 \u0428\u0435\u0432\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0443 \u043c. \u041a\u0438\u0454\u0432\u0430 \u2013 \u201cthe Shevchenkivskyy Prosecutor's Office\u201d) requested that the authorities of the SIZO carry out additional inquiries into the circumstances of the death of Olga Biliak. Having received no reply, on 21 February 2005 the Shevchenkivskyy Prosecutor's Office decided against instituting criminal proceedings on the ground that there was no indication that her death had been caused by violence or that any other parties had been involved in her death. According to the applicants, they were not informed of this decision.", "60. On 21 March 2005 the applicants inquired about the progress of proceedings in the case. In a letter of 11 April 2005 the Kyiv City Prosecutor's Office informed them that the investigations were still ongoing.", "61. In August 2005 the applicants, in the course of proceedings concerning their civil action for damages against the SIZO (see paragraphs 68-74 below), learned of the Shevchenkivskyy Prosecutor's Office's decision of 21 February 2005. On 28 September 2005 the Shevchenkivskyy Court, following an application by the applicants, quashed that decision and ordered further investigations. The court found, in particular, that none of the actions indicated in the decision of 16 December 2004 had been taken.", "62. It appears that the prosecution authorities were not informed of this decision and, on 17 January 2006, the Kyiv City Prosecutor's Office quashed the February 2005 decision of the Shevchenkivskyy Prosecutor's Office of its own motion and ordered reinvestigation.", "63. In the course of the additional investigations the Shevchenkivskyy Prosecutor's Office ordered that further medical evidence be obtained.", "64. On 17 November 2006 the Kyiv City Forensic Medical Bureau (\u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0435 \u043c\u0456\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0435 \u0431\u044e\u0440\u043e \u0441\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e-\u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0457 \u0435\u043a\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0438 \u2013 \u201cthe Bureau\u201d) issued a report in which it stated that Olga Biliak's death was caused by the hematogenously disseminated tuberculosis affecting the lungs, liver, spleen and other parts of the body, which led to purulent necrotising pneumonia. All these diseases had developed against the background of the concurrent HIV-infection. The lack of correct diagnosis had resulted in a failure to provide appropriate medical treatment; therefore, the death of Olga Biliak had been indirectly caused by the actions of the SIZO officials.", "65. On 22 December 2006 the Deputy Prosecutor of the Shevchenkivskyy District of Kyiv requested that the Bureau carry out further examinations with a view to establishing whether Olga Biliak had required urgent hospitalisation in October 2003 and in January 2004 and whether she had received adequate medical assistance during her detention in the SIZO.", "66. However, on 25 December 2006 the investigator from the Shevchenkivskyy Prosecutor's Office, taking into account the fact that the reply from the Bureau could not be received before the expiry of the statutory time-limit for reaching a decision on a criminal complaint, decided not to institute criminal proceedings into the death of Olga Biliak as the evidence in the case file did not show that her death had been caused by violence or by the negligence of the SIZO staff.", "67. On 12 July 2007 the Shevchenkivskyy Court, acting on an appeal lodged by the applicant, quashed this decision on the ground that the investigating authorities had failed to follow the instructions set out in that court's decisions of 16 December 2004 and 28 September 2005. The court ordered that further investigations into the death of Olga Biliak be carried out. The proceedings are apparently still ongoing.", "68.
