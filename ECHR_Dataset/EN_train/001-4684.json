The cars used for the bombing were stolen in Belfast, Northern Ireland on the same day.", "The Irish authorities conducted extensive inquiries but were unable to bring charges against any person. The files remain open. The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in Northern Ireland has conducted an inquiry into the theft of the vehicles and related offences which did not produce any results. However, there was no formal murder inquiry by the RUC.", "On 6 July 1993 ITV, a television station in the United Kingdom, broadcast a programme in which the adequacy of the RUC inquiry was discussed.", "On 21 February 1997 the applicant instituted proceedings in the High Court in the Republic of Ireland in order to force the Irish police to disclose information in its possession to the effect that the United Kingdom authorities had not fully co-operated with the Irish authorities in the murder inquiry. The applicant specified that this evidence would be used in the Convention proceedings.", "On 27 August 1997 the High Court considered that this was not a case where it should exercise its inherent jurisdiction to order discovery.
