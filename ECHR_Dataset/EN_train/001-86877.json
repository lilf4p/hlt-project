On 16 December 1999 the Preobrazhenskiy District Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s challenge to the extension order because, in the court\u2019s view, the applicant\u2019s \u201ccharacter\u201d justified the detention. On 17 January 2000 the Moscow City Court upheld that decision on appeal.", "11. On 30 December 1999 a deputy Prosecutor General extended the applicant\u2019s detention until 18 May 2000. On 19 April 2000 the Preobrazhenskiy District Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal against the extension order, finding that the order had been \u201clawful and justified\u201d, but without giving further grounds in support of this finding.", "12.

On 26 September 2000 the Preobrazhenskiy District Court of Moscow dismissed the applicant\u2019s challenge to the extension orders, finding that they had been justified on account of the applicant\u2019s \u201ccharacter\u201d and the absence of \u201cgross violations\u201d of the criminal-procedure laws.

On each occasion the court noted that there were no grounds to vary the preventive measure imposed on the applicant, in spite of the arguments advanced by the defence and the personal sureties offered on the applicant\u2019s behalf by a Member of Parliament and a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. It also referred to the gravity of the charges and to the applicant\u2019s \u201ccharacter\u201d.

On 28 March and 25 April 2001 the investigator\u2019s superior repeated that request. The Government produced four reports of 1, 8 and 18 June 2001.

On 1 April 2002 the District Court remitted case no. 9307 for further investigation. It found that the charges were formulated vaguely, that the applicant had not been questioned as a suspect, that his access to the file had been unlawfully restricted, and that the severing of certain charges had not been justified. These defects were to be remedied by the investigation. The court authorised the applicant\u2019s further detention.", "26.

The investigator indicated that the applicant\u2019s wife was aware \u201cof certain circumstances that [were] relevant to the matters under investigation\u201d and also had \u201can interest in the outcome [of the case]\u201d. As \u201cfamily visits [could] be used to establish contact with other members of the organised criminal group or obstruct the establishment of the truth\u201d, the wife\u2019s visit would be \u201cinopportune\u201d.", "33. On 4 January 2001 the investigator refused a visit by the applicant\u2019s seven-year-old daughter, stating that the applicant could use the visit to obstruct the investigation.", "34.

I also consider it necessary to explain that, under the Custody Act:", "(a) the investigator may approve no more than two visits per month but by law he is not obliged to do so (section 18 \u00a7 3);", "(b) pursuant to section 20 \u00a7 2, all correspondence is subject to censorship, including by the investigator who is in charge of the criminal case.", "The complaint has no prospects of success (\u0436\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0431\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0430).\u201d", "36. On 22 December 1999 the applicant complained to the Ministry of Justice and the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office that his complaint had not been posted. On 13 January 2000 the applicant\u2019s complaint to the Ministry of Justice was returned to him. No reply from the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office was received.", "37. On 9 February 2000 the investigator refused to post the applicant\u2019s letters to his wife and mother. She returned them to the director of the remand centre with the following note:", "\u201cI am returning you the letters by Mr Vlasov, the defendant in criminal case no. 144129, addressed to Mrs L. Vlasova and dated 11, 24 and 28 January 2000, and to Mrs I. Vlasova, of 11 and 25 January 2000.", "On the basis of section 20 \u00a7 2 of the Custody Act these letters may not be sent to the addressees.\u201d", "38. The applicant submitted to the Court copies of handwritten letters to his mother, dated 11, 24 and 28 January 2000.", "39. On 6 March 2000 the applicant issued forms of authority to his counsel, Mr Kuznetsov and Ms Vasilyeva. By a letter of 20 March 2000, the first deputy director of the Investigations Department of the Ministry of the Interior returned the forms to the director of the remand centre, advising him as follows:", "\u201cI would ask you to explain to Mr Vlasov, the defendant in criminal case no. 144129, that, pursuant to section 17 of the Custody Act and paragraph 12.11 of the Internal Rules for Remand Centres (approved by order no. 486 of 20 December 1995), detainees may enter into civil transactions on the basis of a form of authority certified by the head of the remand centre.", "Since the forms of authority issued by Mr Vlasov to Mr V. Kuznetsov and Ms M. Vasilyeva list actions which, under the civil legislation currently in force, are not civil transactions, there are no grounds for forwarding these forms to Mr Kuznetsov or Ms Vasilyeva.\u201d", "40. On 30 August 2000 the applicant\u2019s counsel submitted to the investigator a series of documents concerning the customs proceedings to which the applicant\u2019s company was a party. On 28 September 2000 the investigator refused to transmit these to the applicant and appended them to the case-file, indicating that the applicant would be able to read them only after the investigation had been completed.", "41.

Incoming letters were handed over to him on the day of receipt.", "42. On 29 May 2001 counsel for the applicant asked for permission to pass to his client (i) a copy of a complaint to the Supreme Court, and (ii) a book \u201cInternational instruments on human rights\u201d. The director of the remand centre made a handwritten note on the petition: \u201cI agree to accept a copy of the complaint\u201d.", "43. On 28 March and 5 September 2000 the applicant complained to the Presnenskiy District Court of Moscow about the interception of the authority forms and commercial documents. By decisions of 7 April and 9 June 2001, the District Court disallowed the applicant\u2019s complaints, finding that the law did not provide for judicial review of the investigator\u2019s decisions concerning restrictions on family visits, correspondence or exchange of documents. On 3 October 2001 the Moscow City Court confirmed on appeal that the applicant\u2019s complaints were not amenable to judicial review.", "44. On 4 and 11 September 2000 the applicant complained to the Basmannyy District Court of Moscow about the restrictions on family visits and correspondence imposed by the investigator. On 10 July 2001 the Basmannyy District Court, by a non-procedural communication, informed him that these complaints could not be examined by a court.", "45. The applicant complained to the Constitutional Court that he had not been able to obtain judicial review of restrictions on family visits, correspondence and exchange of documents.", "46. By a decision of 21 December 2001 (no. 298-O), the Constitutional Court confirmed its constant case-law to the effect that all decisions by an investigator or prosecutor which affected an interested party\u2019s constitutional rights and were not related to the merits of the criminal charge were amenable to judicial review (see paragraph 75 below). It emphasised that this approach was fully applicable to the investigator\u2019s decision concerning restrictions on family visits, correspondence or exchange of documents. The Constitutional Court held that the judicial decisions refusing examination of the applicant\u2019s complaints were to be reviewed in accordance with the established procedure.", "47. On 8 July 2004 the Presnenskiy District Court of Moscow re-examined many of the complaints lodged by the applicant in course of the criminal proceedings in 2000 and 2003, including those concerning restrictions on correspondence, exchange of documents and family visits. The District Court dismissed those complaints for the following reasons.", "48. The District Court found that the refusal to transmit customs documents from the lawyer to the applicant had been justified because the former had indicated that the documents were related to the criminal case. On that basis the documents had been included in the case file as evidence, in accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure. The applicant had been advised that he would be able to study the documents in question when examining the case file following completion of the preliminary investigation.", "49. With regard to the refusal to pass the power of attorney of 29 March 2000, the District Court held that the Internal Rules for Remand Centres (those issued both by the Ministry of the Interior and by the Ministry of Justice) prohibited detainees from authorising their representatives to carry out any actions other than civil transactions. As the scope of the applicant\u2019s power of attorney had not been confined to civil transactions, the refusal had been lawful. The District Court did not refer to a specific provision of the Internal Rules for Remand Centres.", "50. As to the restrictions on family visits, the District Court referred to the relevant provisions of the Custody Act and the Internal Rules for Remand Centres. It noted that the decision on whether or not to allow a family visit was to be taken by the investigator in the light of the The decisions made by the investigator in the applicant\u2019s case had subsequently been reviewed and approved by the Investigations Committee of the Ministry of the Interior and by the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office. Accordingly, the District Court concluded that the decisions had been lawful and justified.", "51. Finally, the District Court found that five of the applicant\u2019s letters to his relatives had been intercepted by the investigator because they either contained information on the criminal case, revealing secret information from the preliminary investigation, or expressed contempt for the law-enforcement authorities, which might foster a negative attitude among his relatives towards the law-enforcement bodies and thus obstruct the establishment of the truth in the criminal case. The District Court held that the interception of those letters had been compatible with the domestic law and with international treaties, including Article 8 of the Convention.", "52. On 27 December 2004 the Moscow City Court endorsed, in a summary fashion, the findings of the District Court.", "53. From 27 August 1999 until his release on 12 July 2002 the applicant was held in special-purpose remand centre no. IZ-99/1 (formerly no. IZ-48/4, commonly known as \u201cMatrosskaya Tishina\u201d).", "54. The applicant was held in ten different cells that measured either fourteen sq. m and had six sleeping places, or thirty-two sq. m and contained ten bunks. The design capacity of the cells was not exceeded.", "55. The window frames were bricked in with semi-transparent glass cubes. In addition, there was a layer of thick bars with so-called \u201ceyelashes\u201d, that is, slanted plates, approximately two cm apart, welded to a metal screen. This construction gave no access to natural air or light. The Government submitted that the \u201ceyelashes\u201d had been removed on 25 November 2002. The applicant indicated that between February 2000 and summer 2002 private fans had been prohibited in the cells, but that ventilation was on during the day.", "56. The lavatory pan was placed in the corner of the cell. The Government produced a photo of the pan showing that it was separated from the living area by an eighty-five-centimetre-high tiled brick partition and shower curtains above it. The applicant responded that the partition and curtains had apparently been a recent development; during the period of his detention there had been no tiles and the hanging of curtains of any kind had been prohibited. Furthermore, until 22 August 2001 the walls had been covered with so-called shuba, a sort of abrasive concrete lining, designed to prevent detainees from leaning on the walls or writing on them.", "57. Open-air exercise was permitted for one hour a day and a shower could be taken for twenty minutes once a week.", "58. The cells were constantly lit with fluorescent lighting. The applicant claimed that insufficient lighting had impaired his eyesight, which had fallen by 2.5 dioptres. On 21 June 2001 he asked to see an ophthalmologist and repeated his request no fewer than seven times between 30 July 2001 and 20 June 2002. The Government explained that no consultation had been arranged because the medical unit of the remand centre had no resident ophthalmologist and because the applicant had often been absent for court hearings. The applicant responded that the hearings had not started until 28 January 2002, that is, more than seven months after he had asked for consultation.", "59. Finally, the applicant submitted that he had been the only non-smoker in his cells and had suffered from passive smoking. The Government indicated that the separation of non-smokers from smokers had been materially impossible.", "60. In support of his submissions the applicant produced affidavits by his former cellmates, Mr I., Mr Ku. and Mr Ko.", "61. The applicant was transported from the remand centre to the courthouse and back more than 120 times. Transport was arranged by officers of the Convoy Regiment of the Moscow Police Department (\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043a \u0413\u0423\u0412\u0414 \u0433. \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u044b).", "62. The prison vans (Gaz-3307 and Gaz-3309) in which the applicant was transported had a passenger cabin which was 3.8 m long, 2.35 m wide, and 1.6 m high. The cabin was divided into two multi-occupancy cubicles, designed for twelve inmates each, and one single-occupancy cubicle. The cubicles were equipped with benches. On 7 February 2001, in response to the applicant\u2019s complaints, the officer-in-command of the Convoy Regiment ordered that he be transported in a separate van. The applicant specified that a separate van had been made available to him only thirteen times.", "63. The Government submitted that the prison-van heaters and interior lights had been powered by the van engine. The vans were naturally ventilated through the emergency hatch and additional hatches with controlled airflow. The Government asserted that the applicant had received breakfast and dinner at the remand prison and that he had been allowed to bring his own food to court. It follows from the certificate issued by the head of remand centre no. IZ-99/1 that dry rations had been given to detainees from 2003 onwards.", "64. In their post-admissibility submissions the Government enclosed two reports prepared by the officer-in-command of the Convoy Regiment on 28 March and 3 April 2006. According to these reports, the design capacity of prison vans had never been exceeded in 2001-2003 and the travel time from remand centre no. 99/1 to the Golovinskiy District Court had been in the range of two to three hours, depending on traffic.", "65. The applicant denied that the van had been heated or sufficiently ventilated. He indicated that the travel time between the remand centre and the court had been excessively long, and sometimes as long as three or four hours. During the entire journey he had been kept in the locked van without food or drink or access to a toilet.", "66. The applicant produced a detailed table which listed the time he had spent before departure in the \u201cwaiting cubicle\u201d at the remand centre, the time on the way to the courthouse and the time on the way back. The table covered the period from 25 December 2001 to 22 March 2002, in which he had been transported on twenty days. Of those twenty times, on six occasions the aggregate travel time on a given day had ranged from five to seven hours and on a further eleven occasions it had been longer than seven hours, with a maximum of 10.5 hours on 25 December 2001. The table also indicated that on four days the design capacity of the prison van had been exceeded by at least ten additional persons.", "67. Between 20 February 2001 and 17 June 2002 the applicant sent nine complaints about the \u201ctorturous\u201d conditions of transport to many officials, including the director of the remand centre, the Prosecutor General and the officer-in-command of the Convoy Regiment. According to the Government, the officer-in-command of the Convoy Regiment had acknowledged that there had been \u201csome irregularities\u201d in the transport of detainees and ordered that the applicant be transported by a separate van. A copy of that report was not made available to the Court.", "68. The Russian Constitution of 12 December 1993 establishes that a judicial decision is required before a defendant can be detained or his or her detention extended (Article 22). At the material time, a decision ordering pre-trial detention could be taken by a prosecutor or a court (Articles 11, 89 and 96 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure, the \u201cCCrP\u201d).", "69. Before 14 March 2001, pre-trial detention was authorised if the accused was charged with a criminal offence carrying a sentence of at least one year\u2019s imprisonment (Article 96 of the CCrP). The amendments of 14 March 2001 repealed the provision that permitted defendants to be remanded in custody on the sole ground of the dangerous nature of the criminal offence they had allegedly committed.", "70. After his or her arrest the suspect was placed in custody \u201cpending investigation\u201d for an initial two-month period (Article 97 of the CCrP). Further extensions could be granted by prosecutors at ascending levels of jurisdiction.", "71. Once the investigation had been completed and the defendant had received the charge sheet and finished reading the case file, the file was submitted to a trial court. From that date a defendant\u2019s detention was \u201cbefore the court\u201d (or \u201cpending trial\u201d). Until 14 March 2001 the Code of Criminal Procedure set no time-limit for detention \u201cpending trial\u201d. On 14 March 2001 a new Article 239-1 was inserted, which established that the period of detention \u201cduring trial\u201d could not normally exceed six months from the date the court received the file.", "72. The Custody Act (Federal Law on the Detention of Suspects and Defendants, no. 103-FZ of 15 July 1995) provides as follows:", "\u201cSuspects and defendants have the right:", "...", "(5) to meet with relatives and other persons listed in section 18;", "(6) to keep documents and records relating to the criminal case or to exercise of their rights and lawful interests...", "...", "(8) to maintain correspondence and to use writing utensils;", "...", "(18) to enter into civil transactions.\u201d", "\u201cUpon written consent of the official or authority in charge of the criminal case, a suspect or defendant may have up to two meetings per month with relatives and other persons, each visit to last for up to three hours...\u201d", "\u201cSuspects and defendants may correspond with relatives and other persons, without any limitation on the number of incoming and outgoing letters or telegrams...", "Correspondence by suspects and defendants is to be carried out through the administration of the remand prison and is subject to censorship.

The Internal Rules for Remand Centres of the Ministry of the Interior (order no. 486 of 20 December 1995, in force until 12 May 2000) provided as follows:", "\u201c8.1 Suspects and defendants may send and receive any number of letters or telegrams.", "8.2 Letters and telegrams are sent and received through the administration of the remand centre.
