The ensuing police investigation led to the arrest of Zihni Umay (Z.U.) on 16 February 1994. Whilst he was in police detention Z.U. confessed that he had killed B.F., E.F., M.F. and Y.K.. He stated that three other persons, including the applicant, had also been involved in the killing. On 16 February 1994 the applicant was detained on the ground of these allegations.
