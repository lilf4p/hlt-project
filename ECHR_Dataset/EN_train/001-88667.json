(born in 1982) and Islam Dombayev, came to their house. Murad asked the applicant\u2019s permission to go with them and to spend the night at T.\u2019s home. The applicant agreed because she knew the boys, who lived nearby.", "10. The second applicant submitted that her son Islam Dombayev, the first applicant\u2019s son Murad Lyanov and T. had been good friends. The second applicant\u2019s son had a guitar and they often played it in the courtyard of the applicant\u2019s house. They did not normally go out on the street after 9 p.m. because of the curfew imposed by the military.

According to the applicants, in the first few days after the three boys\u2019 disappearance it became clear from the soldiers\u2019 answers that the boys had been detained late at night on 28 June 2000 by a joint group of servicemen of the special police forces (OMON) from Pskov and special mission brigade no. 8 of Interior Ministry troops (referred to below as Obron-8) stationed in the district.

A search revealed a number of components and parts of explosive devices, notably:", "a warhead from a 152-mm shell with an opening for a detonator;", "a round for a portable anti-tank gun, also prepared as an explosive device;", "some wires.", "One of the detainees attempted to flee. The detainees had no identity documents in their possession. They were taken to Obron-8 headquarters where they were brought to the special [counter-intelligence] unit for questioning. One of the detainees resembled the description of a rebel fighter (\u201cboyevik\u201d) who had attacked roadblock no. 17 on 24 June 2000 using a flamethrower. ...

Besides personal visits, the applicants sent numerous letters to the prosecutors and other authorities, in which they stated the facts of their sons\u2019 arrest and asked for assistance and details of the investigation. The applicants submitted copies of letters they had written, all conforming to roughly the same model.", "22. The applicants received very little substantive information from official bodies about the investigation into the disappearances.

The investigation had established that the three teenagers had been detained by officers from the Pskov OMON and Obron-8 during an ambush in Sadovaya Street and that they had been taken to Obron-8 headquarters the same night.

A special request had been forwarded to the military prosecutor\u2019s office.", "25.

On 14 November 2000 the military prosecutor of military unit no. 20102 replied to the first applicant that there were no reasons to conclude that servicemen stationed in the Leninskiy district of Grozny had been involved in the detention of her son and two other men. The lists of detainees maintained by the military prosecutors, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Justice contained no reference to the three missing persons. The contingent of Obron-8 (military unit no. 3723) had returned to their home station on expiry of their period of service in Chechnya, and measures were being taken to establish their whereabouts and to question them about the circumstances of the alleged detention.", "29. On 9 December 2000 a lawyer from the NGO Memorial wrote to the Chief Military Prosecutor on the first applicant\u2019s behalf. She referred to the latest letter from the military prosecutor and asked why the requests to question the servicemen of Obron-8 had not been acted upon while they were still in Chechnya. The letter asked the Chief Military Prosecutor to intervene and to ensure that a proper investigation would be carried out.", "30. On 9 January 2001 the office of the Chief Military Prosecutor replied to Memorial, stating that the investigation was being carried out by the local prosecutor in Chechnya, to whom all requests should be forwarded. The involvement of military servicemen in the disappearance had not been established, and the military prosecutors therefore had no responsibility for the case.", "31. On 12 February 2001 the military prosecutor of military unit no. 20102 informed the second applicant that his office was in charge of investigating the criminal case concerning the abduction of her son and two others. He stated that she would be informed of any progress in the investigation.", "32. On 19 March 2001 the military prosecutor of military unit no. 20102 forwarded the first applicant\u2019s complaint to the Grozny Prosecutor\u2019s Office and asked that it be included in case file no. 14/33/0065-01, which had been forwarded to that office on 7 March 2001. The letter further stated that the investigation had established no connection between military servicemen and the abduction of the three men, and had been closed under Article 5 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure [absence of corpus delicti].", "33. At the end of 2001 and beginning of 2002 the second applicant wrote to the Russian President, the Prosecutor General, members of the State Duma, other public figures and the media. She stated the facts of her son\u2019s detention and disappearance and commented on the lack of progress in the investigation despite the fact that the names and positions of the persons who had detained the three minors were known. She listed the authorities she had previously applied to with her requests. She referred to her family\u2019s ties with the Ministry of Defence and explained that her son could have had no links with the \u201cWahhabists\u201d, or illegal armed groups. She asked them to help her establish her son\u2019s whereabouts.", "34. On 1 June 2002 the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of the Chechen Republic replied to the second applicant. The letter stated that following her request, which had been forwarded by the Security Council, criminal case no. 12113 had been re-examined. The investigation in that case had been twice suspended under Article 195 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for failure to identify the culprits. Each time these decisions had been quashed by a supervising prosecutor. In November 2000 the investigation had concluded that the kidnapping of Islam Dombayev, Murad Lyanov and [T.] had been committed by the servicemen of Obron-8, and the case had been transferred to the military prosecutors. On 6 March 2001 a military investigator had closed the proceedings on the ground that no servicemen had been involved in the kidnapping, and on 7 March 2001 the file had been transferred back to the Grozny Prosecutor\u2019s Office. The letter further stated that the submissions of Yu. G. and G., commanders of the OMON unit and of Obron-8 respectively, had contained substantial discrepancies which the investigation had failed to clarify \u201cfor a number of objective reasons\u201d. On 29 May 2002 the decision of 28 April 2001 by the investigator from the Grozny Prosecutor\u2019s Office to suspend the investigation had been quashed and the case file had been forwarded to that office for further investigation.", "35.
