On 26 September 2001 at around 2 p.m. four teenagers attending a school for children with impaired hearing, while walking in Sokolniki park towards a tram stop, saw two young men fighting. One of the youths was later found dead. It was established that his death had occurred on the aforementioned date. The schoolboys described the event to their teacher. They noted that the alleged offender had been wearing a ponytail and a leather jacket.", "11. On 14 May 2002, at 12 noon, police officers came to the applicant's flat and asked him to accompany them to the police station. The applicant complied with the request. In the police station he was searched and placed in a cell. At 2 p.m. he was interviewed as a witness. The applicant stated, inter alia, that he did not know the victim and had never heard his name. At 3 p.m. the applicant took part in an identification parade before two of the four schoolboys, Z. and M., who identified him as a person they had seen fighting on 26 September 2001. At 4 p.m. the investigator ordered the applicant's detention. According to the applicant, the detention order was not given to him for his signature. In the order it was indicated that the applicant's mother had been notified about his detention.", "12. At 6.50 p.m. the investigator started the search in the applicant's flat. The applicant's desktop PC, mobile phone, photo album, notebook, a bag with diskettes, a leather jacket, two pairs of boots and two pairs of jeans were seized in the course of the search.", "13. Between 8.40 p.m. and 9.45 p.m. the applicant was interviewed as a suspect in connection with the murder committed on 26 September 2001.", "14.

On the same date he was interviewed as the accused. He was assisted by an advocate K., appointed by the investigator.", "18. On 25 May 2002 the applicant was transferred to remand prison SIZO 77/1 in Moscow.", "19. On 21 June 2002 the advocate K. filed a complaint with the prosecutor concerning the conduct of the investigation. He alleged, inter alia, that the identification parades had been in breach of procedural requirements. In particular, the persons lined up with the applicant had been much older and the applicant had been the only one wearing a ponytail, which significantly decreased the evidential credibility of the identification. He further complained that the investigator had taken no steps to verify the applicant's alibi. In particular, Mrs R., the applicant's neighbour, who claimed to have seen him during the day on 26 September 2001, Mr Kh., the carpenter, who was performing work at the applicant's flat on that date, and Mrs K., the applicant's girlfriend's mother, had not been questioned.", "20. On 2 July 2002 the Prosecutor allowed the advocate K.'s motion to have Mrs R., Mr Kh. and Mrs K. examined as witnesses.

On 8 July 2002 the Preobrazhenskiy District Court of Moscow extended the term of the applicant's pre-trial detention until 13 September 2002 on the grounds that, being accused of a grave offence, he might abscond during the investigation and interfere with the establishment of the truth in the case.", "22. It appears that between July and September 2002 the applicant appointed as his representative advocate A. instead of advocate K., previously appointed by the investigator. Advocate A. assisted him throughout the rest of the proceedings.", "23. On 10 September 2002 the Preobrazhenskiy District Court extended the term of the applicant's pre-trial detention until 14 November 2002 on the same grounds as those indicated in its ruling of 8 July 2002.", "24.

The bill of indictment stated that, on 26 September 2001 at around 2 p.m., near the entrance to the Sokolniki park, the applicant had quarrelled with the victim for unidentified reasons. The quarrel had turned into a fight. Due to \u201csudden personal hostility\u201d the applicant had struck the victim at the nape with an unidentified blunt, hard object and had then cut his throat with an unidentified sharp object.

The applicant appealed against the ruling.", "30. On 17 February 2003 the Preobrazhenskiy District Court allowed the advocate A.'s motion to call Mrs R. as a witness at the hearing. The court refused leave for the applicant's uncle to participate in the proceedings as his representative since he was represented by a lawyer. Mr Kh. appeared at the hearing among other witnesses. However, none of them was examined because the court adjourned the hearing on the merits owing to the appeal lodged against the ruling of 4 February 2003.", "31. On 22 April 2003 the Moscow City Court quashed the ruling of 4 February 2003 and remitted the matter for a fresh examination.", "32. On 10 May 2003 the Preobrazhenskiy District Court ruled that it would hold a preliminary hearing of the case on 19 May 2003 and ordered the preventive measure applied to the applicant to remain unchanged.", "33. On 19 May 2003 the Preobrazhenskiy District Court ruled that it would hold a hearing on the merits on 12 June 2003. On the same date the applicant filed a motion for the record of his interview on 14 May 2002 and the records of the identification parades to be excluded from the body of evidence as inadmissible. The prosecutor stated that he would leave it for the court to decide. The court held as follows:", "\u201c[Mr] Popov's motion ... should be dismissed because the case has not yet been considered on the merits, the judicial investigation has not been conducted, therefore the assessment of all the evidence in the case, including the documents that [Mr] Popov seeks to have excluded, shall be made when the case is considered on the merits.\u201d", "The court scheduled the next hearing for 12 June 2003.", "34. The hearings of 12 and 18 June 2003 were adjourned. On 18 June 2003 the Preobrazhenskiy District Court extended the term of the applicant's detention until 18 September 2003 and refused leave for his uncle to participate in the proceedings as his representative on the ground that he was represented by a lawyer. The applicant appealed against the ruling.", "35. On 8 September 2003 the Preobrazhenskiy District Court held a hearing on the merits. The minutes of the hearing stated that witnesses had appeared and had been removed from the courtroom. The names of the witnesses were not specified. The applicant's counsel filed a motion to call Mrs R., the applicant's neighbour, at the hearing in order to confirm his alibi and provide information about his personality. The prosecutor objected on the grounds that the information about the applicant's personality would be obtained from his relatives. The court dismissed the motion without giving any reasons.", "36. At the hearing of 8 September 2003 the court heard evidence from three of the four schoolboys who had witnessed the events of 26 September 2001. M. confirmed that he had seen the applicant that day. Z. stated that although he had identified him at the identification parade, he could not at present remember exactly what the offender had looked like. F. submitted that he did not recognise the applicant. Their teacher, examined at the hearing, submitted that the schoolboys had good eyesight, although owing to the particularities of their mental state suffered from certain lapses of memory or forgetfulness, because of which they could not adequately recollect a situation after half a year. The court also heard evidence from the victim's parents. His father stated that he had received an anonymous call and had been told that the applicant had murdered their son. At 3.56 p.m. the judge adjourned the hearing until the next day.", "37. On 9 September 2003 the hearing continued. The record of the hearing did not contain information as to whether particular witnesses had attended. It appears that Mrs R. was present at the hearing because she placed her signature on a document dated 9 September 2003 to confirm that she had been notified of criminal responsibility for giving false evidence. The document was also signed by the trial judge. However, Mrs R. had not been examined at the hearing.", "38. At the hearing the Preobrazhenskiy District Court heard evidence from Mrs P., the applicant's mother, who submitted that on 26 September 2001 the applicant had stayed at home until the evening and had also been seen by their neighbour Mrs R. and the carpenter Mr Kh. Miss K., the applicant's girlfriend, submitted that on 26 September 2001 between 9 p.m. and 12 midnight she and the applicant had walked her dog. Mrs K., her mother, submitted that between 1.30 p.m. and 3.30 p.m. on 26 September 2001 she had spoken to the applicant on the telephone a number of times and he had been at home. The court also heard evidence from a computer expert, Mr G., and from the applicant's friend, Mr B.", "39. The applicant's counsel filed a motion to supplement the pleadings by summoning and examining Mr Kh. The court dismissed the motion on the grounds that Mr Kh. had been notified of the hearing but had failed to appear.", "40. On 10 September 2003 the Preobrazhenskiy District Court convicted the applicant of murder and sentenced him to ten years' imprisonment. The court held that on 26 September 2001 at around 2 p.m. near the entrance to Sokolniki park the applicant had quarrelled with the victim for unidentified reasons. The quarrel had turned into a fight. Due to \u201csudden personal hostility\u201d the applicant had struck the victim at the nape with an unidentified blunt, hard object and then cut his throat with an unidentified sharp object.", "41. The court found that the applicant's guilt was confirmed by the statements of M. and Z., who had identified him as the person they had seen fighting with the victim, and by a similar statement from F., who, however, noted that he was only fifty per cent sure that it was the applicant he had seen. The court noted the schoolboys' teacher's statement to the effect that they had no mental abnormalities. The court further stated that the applicant's guilt was also confirmed by Mr G., who submitted that a password and log-in identification for each user were personal and allowed the location of the user and his correspondence with other users to be determined; by Mr B., who submitted that he was aware that the applicant had used the nickname \u201cSpencer\u201d on the Internet and that he had a black leather jacket; by the victim's post-mortem; by the crime scene reports; by the inspection reports concerning the victim's computer and diskettes and a computer and diskettes belonging to a certain Mr X., it was not specified who he was; by inspection reports in respect of the applicant's personal items; by references from two Internet providers; by a reference from the Internet provider MTU-Intel, stating that on 12 September 2001 at 11.16 p.m. a user accessed the Internet from the applicant's mother's telephone.", "42. The court dismissed the applicant's motion to exclude the reports of identification parades as inadmissible evidence. Having regard to the witness statements made at the hearing and to the case file, the court found that the identification parades had been conducted in accordance with procedural rules. The court further found that no credence could be given to the submissions of Mrs P., Miss K. and Mrs K. because, being the applicant's relatives, they had sought to help him.", "43. The applicant appealed against the judgment on the grounds, inter alia, that the trial court had relied on inadmissible evidence, had dismissed his motion to call Mrs R. at the hearing and had refused to adjourn the hearing in order to call Mr Kh.", "44. On 4 November 2003 the Moscow City Court examined the applicant's appeal against the ruling of 18 June 2003 concerning the extension of his pre-trial detention. The court upheld the ruling. The applicant and his counsel were present at the hearing.", "45. On 6 November 2003 the Moscow City Court addressed the Preobrazhenskiy District Court in a letter stating that the appeal against the ruling of 18 June 2003 lodged by the applicant on 24 June 2003 had not been transmitted for examination in due course and that the case-file had been received by the Moscow City Court only on 4 November 2003. The Moscow City Court further noted that appeals against rulings concerning the application of a preventive measure should be transmitted immediately to the appeal court and failure to do so entailed a limitation of the right of access to a court.", "46. On 20 January 2004 the Moscow City Court upheld on appeal the judgment of 10 September 2003. The court, inter alia, stated:", "\u201cThe crime was committed in Moscow in the circumstances set out in the [trial] court's judgment.", "...", "The [trial] court was right to base its conclusions concerning the guilt of [the applicant] on the statements of [the witnesses]. The [appeal court] finds that such assessment ... corresponds to the body of evidence in the case: ...the computer databases, where the correspondence between the [applicant] using the nickname \u201cSpencer\u201d and the victim is recorded, and the relevant statement of [Mr B].", "...", "The argument [put forward in the applicant's appeal] that his version about his being at home on the date of the crime was not duly examined is unsubstantiated.", "...", "The lawfulness of the procedural actions taken in the present case was checked, and the court's findings were not based on any evidence [the lawfulness] of which would give rise to doubts. ... \u201d", "47. On an unspecified date the applicant challenged the constitutionality of Article 49 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the Constitutional Court. The applicant claimed that the trial court had based on that provision its refusal to allow his uncle's participation in the proceedings as his defence counsel. The trial court had thus infringed his rights enshrined in Article 45 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution, which provided that everyone was entitled to defend his or her rights by any lawful means.", "48. On 22 April 2004 the Constitutional Court dismissed the complaint as inadmissible. It held that Article 49 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure did not provide any limitations as regards participation of the accused's relatives in the proceedings. Therefore, it did not violate the applicant's rights protected by Article 45 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution. Inasmuch as the applicant's rights could have been infringed by the court's arbitrary refusal to admit his relative to participate in the proceedings, he should have had recourse to remedies available under the laws on criminal procedure.", "49.
