During the entire period of his service the applicant worked as a teacher. He gave lectures on physics and carried out scientific research. Part of that research concerned issues considered important for national defence. He also published articles and scientific dissertations.", "In 1988 the applicant completed two training courses: the first in fire prevention, the second designed for fire officers.", "On an unspecified later date he achieved the rank of captain.", "On 31 May 1994 the applicant underwent a routine medical examination. The relevant report stated that he was permanently unfit to take part in fighting fires and emergency actions but fit to serve if he continued to work as a lecturer.", "On 23 January 1995 the Superintendent of the National Fire Academy opened disciplinary proceedings against the applicant on charges of insubordination (in connection with his failure to comply with a superior\u2019s order), wilful disregard of instructions (in that he had allowed third persons to have access to research carried out in respect of the matter of crucial importance for national defence) and two other breaches of discipline.", "On 10 March 1995 the Superintendent issued an order disciplinarily discharging the applicant from the fire service \u201cwith effect from 31 March 1995\u201d. The applicant appealed to the Commandant of the National Fire Service (Komendant G\u0142\u00f3wny Pa\u0144stwowej Stra\u017cy Po\u017carnej).", "On 29 March 1995 the Commandant upheld the order. The applicant appealed to the Minister of the Interior (Minister Spraw Wewn\u0119trznych) on 6 April 1995. He requested the Minister, inter alia, to \u201cquash immediately the relevant orders\u201d and to \u201cpromote him and award a special prize as reward for his achievements\u201d.", "On 30 May 1995 the Minister upheld the decision to discharge the applicant from the fire service but amended the date on which it was to take effect, ordering that the material date be 31 May 1995.", "Subsequently, on an unspecified date, the applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (Naczelny S\u0105d Administracyjny). He contested the decision of the Commandant of the National Fire Service of 29 March 1995 and the decision of the Minister of the Interior of 30 May 1995, alleging that they were contrary to the law.", "The Supreme Administrative Court gave judgment on 13 September 1995. It dismissed the appeal for two principal reasons: firstly, because it had no jurisdiction to deal with disciplinary matters and, secondly, as it had found no legal flaw in the impugned decisions.", "In the meantime, on an unspecified date, the applicant had sued the Superintendent of the National Fire Academy in the Warsaw District Court of Labour (S\u0105d Rejonowy - Wydzia\u0142 Pracy), seeking reinstatement to the fire service. The court refused to deal with the merits of the claim because a discharge from the fire service did not fall within the labour courts\u2019 jurisdiction, such matters being resolved exclusively in administrative proceedings.", "The organisation of the National Fire Service, terms and conditions of service therein and detailed duties of firemen are laid down in the Law of 24 August 1991 on the National Fire Service (Ustawa o Pa\u0144stwowej Stra\u017cy Po\u017carnej) (as amended), hereafter referred to as \u201cthe 1991 Act\u201d.", "The National Fire Service in Poland is part of the national public service.

The Minister of the Interior not only supervises the National Fire Service but also has the power to issue ordinances or other regulations setting out the detailed organisation of fire-fighting brigades, units and their equipment (section 8 \u00a7 4 of the 1991 Act).", "Within the general structure of the State, the National Fire Service, like other emergency services, belongs to the forces for maintenance of public safety.", "Section 1 of the 1991 Act lays down the general tasks and duties of the National Fire Service.
