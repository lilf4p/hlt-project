The exact circumstances of the applicant\u2019s detention are in dispute between the parties.", "10. In respect of all the establishments in which he had been detained, the applicant alleged that he had been kept in overcrowded cells, in poor conditions of hygiene, that the food had been poor, and that he did not enjoy enough out-of-cell time and appropriate activities.", "11. He also referred to the information provided in the CPT and APADOR-CH reports and to the conditions of detention already established by the Court in its previous judgments with respect to each of the detention facilities where he was detained, alleging that he had experienced the same conditions.", "12. The material conditions in Ploie\u015fti Prison throughout the periods when he was detained there between 24 January 2002 and 14 November 2008, were described by the applicant as follows.", "13. The cells were overcrowded and he often had to share an 80 cm wide bed with another inmate. He shared cells equipped with 15 to 24 beds with 20 to 45 detainees: in cell no. 15 (formerly no. 9) there were 24 beds for 42 inmates; in cell no. 31 (formerly no. 22) there were 30 beds for 54 inmates; in cell no. 24 (formerly no. 15) there were 24 beds for 38 inmates; and in cell no. 22 (formerly no. 13) there were 21 beds for 37 inmates.", "The above information makes it possible to calculate the personal space available to each detainee and is consistent with the information submitted by the Government and the National Prison Administration (\u201cNPA\u201d) and with the CPT reports on the surface of cells and the occupancy rate. For instance, in May 2005 there were 774 detainees in Ploie\u015fti Prison, whereas the legal capacity of the prison was 566 places. In terms of the minimum space of 4 square metres per person recommended by the CPT, the prison should have housed no more than 220 inmates. The applicant referred to the CPT\u2019s findings that the main problem of Ploie\u015fti Prison was overcrowding, with no more than 2 square metres of personal space per detainee.", "14. There were only bunk beds, and the top bed was 2 metres high. There were no tables in the cells and there was no dining room, so detainees had their meals and other activities (writing, playing chess, and so on) in bed. Cells had only one window, which was 180 cm wide and 120 cm high.", "15. Cells were infested with insects, and the bed linen was unclean and lice-infested.", "16. There were only one or two sinks to a cell, providing cold water only.", "17. Access to communal showers with hot water was allowed only once a week.", "18. The applicant alleged a lack of activities outside the cell during his stay in Ploie\u015fti Prison. He referred also to the CPT findings that the lack of daily activities in that prison was another major problem.", "19. The applicant alleged that the cells in M\u0103rgineni Prison were overcrowded too, so he had to share a bed with another inmate. In the cell he occupied, no. 56, there were 36 beds for 68 inmates.", "The sinks in the cell did not have hot water and there were 2 toilets for all 68 prisoners.", "20. The material conditions in Rahova Prison and its Hospital throughout his detention there between 2005 and December 2008, were described by the applicant as follows.", "21. There was overcrowding in Rahova Prison and detainees had some 2.77 square metres per person.", "22. There were no chairs in the cell, and the metal bunk beds were designed so that detainees were not able to sit up straight on the lower bed.", "23. Lavatories in the cells had deteriorated ceilings and walls and hot water was available only once a week for one hour.", "24. Moreover, during an unspecified period in the summer of 2005 the water was cut off between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. and between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m., a situation due, according to a statement made by the head of logistics at Rahova Prison, to a general water shortage.", "25. As a result of these conditions, the applicant was unable to maintain a proper standard of corporal hygiene.", "26. The material conditions which the applicant experienced during his periods of detention in Jilava Prison and its hospital from 2003 until his release in 2011 were described by the applicant as follows.", "27. Overcrowding was general and severe throughout the prison and the personal space per detainee was extremely limited: cells with a surface of 13 square metres were accommodating 8 prisoners, and cells with a surface of 20 to 25 square metres housed 35 to 40 prisoners. There were several rows of bunk beds. The applicant often had to share a bed with another inmate; in cell no. 215, for instance, there were 30 beds for 45 inmates, and in cell no. 206 there were 21 beds for 30 inmates.", "28. The above information makes it possible to calculate the personal space available to each detainee and is consistent with the information submitted by the Government and the National Prison Administration (\u201cNPA\u201d) on the surface of cells and the occupancy rate. Between 2007 and 2010 the personal space available to detainees, according to the monthly information recorded in the official registers, varied from 1.21 square metres in April 2007 to 2.43 square metres in March 2008 and 2.34 square metres from February to May 2010. During all these years, only in February 2008 did the applicant have personal space exceeding 4 square metres, that is, 4.55 square metres, to be precise.", "29. The sanitary facilities were poor, the toilets had no water supply and the sinks in the cells had no hot water.", "30. Cells were often dirty and the bed linen was old, worn and often unclean.", "31. Sanitary conditions were very poor, there were cockroaches, rats, lice and bedbugs in the prison; the applicant was even bitten by a rat in August 2009, for which he was given a vaccination.", "32. There were hardly any out-of-cell activities.", "33. The Government submitted more than 2,000 pages with general information on the legal framework and conditions of detention in prisons in Romania, and part of the applicant\u2019s administrative file in detention.", "34. With regard to overcrowding, they submitted that the overcrowding problem had been solved in 2004, save in Ploie\u015fti Prison, where it had been solved only in 2006. The Government provided information submitted by the NPA concerning the number of beds available in each prison and the number of detainees accommodated each year. It shows that in the prisons of Jilava, Rahova and M\u0103rgineni, the number of beds has exceeded the number of prisoners since 2004. In Ploie\u015fti Prison the number of beds has exceeded the number of detainees since 2006.", "35. The Government submitted nonetheless that it was not always possible to determine the precise cells where the applicant had been detained, as prison records were regularly destroyed after a certain time.", "36. Detainees were responsible for cleaning the cells and were accordingly provided with the necessary cleaning products. The other parts of the prisons were cleaned twice a day or whenever necessary, specialised companies were in charge of disinfesting the premises every four months or whenever necessary and the bed sheets were changed once a week.", "37. It was the legal right of detainees to be provided with the necessary products for their personal hygiene.", "38. Between 2006 and 2009 substantial investments were made to modernise the prisons. In each prison there was a committee in charge of supervising the condition of the buildings and cells and ordering repairs whenever necessary. These committees functioned or function according to orders nos. 10306/1997, 82957/1998 and 434/2006 of the General Directorate of Prisons (GDP) within the Ministry of Justice, and order no. 328/2010 of the Director General of the Prisons Directorate.", "39. As a result of the entry into force of Law no. 275/2006, the domestic legislation concerning detention facilities now complied with CPT recommendations on lighting, heating, ventilation, sanitary installations and furniture in prisons.", "40. In all prisons the quality of drinking water was checked regularly, as required by Law no. 458/2002, Government Decision no. 974/2004 and Order no. 3149/2003 of the GDP\u2019s Director General. Cut-offs were purely accidental or limited in time. As for the food, the quantity and quality were set according to the categories of detainees, as prescribed by Order no. 2713/C/2001 of the Minister of Justice.", "For an ordinary, male, non-working detainee, the standard was set by \u201cNorm no. 17\u201d at 2,855 calories per day, from a diet consisting of starch, pork meat, vegetables of the Apiaceae family, biscuits, tinned vegetables, margarine, oil, marmalade, 20 grams of salted cheese, onion and garlic, sugar and various spices. Other kinds of meat, fresh vegetables and dairy products, as well as eggs and fruit, dried or fresh, were reserved for particular categories of detainees, such as pregnant women and their babies and sick detainees during their stay in a hospital.", "41. Before the adoption of Law no. 275/2006, prisoners were entitled to at least one shower per week and they could have their bed sheets changed once every fortnight.", "Law no. 275/2006 improved this situation, providing for detainees to have a shower at least twice a week and, since all prisons now had a laundry service, bed sheets were changed weekly.", "42. All prisons had a central heating system and cells were heated in winter with warmers. The Minister of Justice\u2019s Order no. 2874/C/1999 laid down clear rules regulating the heating of prisons according to their geographical location. In summer, according to an order of the GDP\u2019s Director General, cell doors had to be kept open and sustained efforts were made to allow detainees to spend as much time outside the cell as possible.", "43. The Government made specific submissions in respect of the following detention facilities in which the applicant was detained:", "44. The Government had no information concerning the dimensions of the cells, the number of beds and the available space.", "45. There was no refectory room in Ploie\u015fti Prison, so prisoners had their meals in their cells, where tables were part of the furniture.", "46. Air circulation was possible through the cell windows.", "47. Each cell had two sinks with cold water. Before 2006, prisoners were allowed to shower once a week. After the entry into force of Law no. 275/2006, they were entitled to two showers a week.", "48. As to outside activities, before 2006 the applicant was entitled to a daily one-hour walk. Law no. 275/2006 increased the duration of the daily walk, and the new norm depended on the detention regime (open, semi-open and closed).", "Moreover, the applicant had taken part in many out-of-cell activities which, before Law no. 275/2006 entered into force, were available every day to detainees in each cell. After 2006, only prisoners with an open or semi-open regime were entitled to daily activities.", "49. As regards the severe overcrowding in Ploie\u015fti Prison, the Director of National Prison Administration had taken effective measures in January 2006 to diminish the number of prisoners admitted to prison.", "50.

Large-capacity dormitories inevitably imply a lack of privacy for prisoners in their everyday lives... All these problems are exacerbated when the numbers held go beyond a reasonable occupancy level; further, in such a situation the excessive burden on communal facilities such as washbasins or lavatories and the insufficient ventilation for so many persons will often lead to deplorable conditions.", "30. The CPT frequently encounters devices, such as metal shutters, slats, or plates fitted to cell windows, which deprive prisoners of access to natural light and prevent fresh air from entering the accommodation. They are a particularly common feature of establishments holding pre-trial prisoners. The CPT fully accepts that specific security measures designed to prevent the risk of collusion and/or criminal activities may well be required in respect of certain prisoners... [E]ven when such measures are required, they should never involve depriving the prisoners concerned of natural light and fresh air.

Overcrowding of prisons and lack of reasonable hygiene facilities at the national level were constantly highlighted by the CPT, which also concluded that in the light of the deplorable material conditions of detention in some of the cells of the establishments visited, the conditions of detention could be qualified as inhuman and degrading.", "127. In the report published on 11 December 2008 (CPT/Inf (2008) 41) following a visit from 8 to 19 June 2006 to a number of detention facilities, including the prisons of Bucharest-Jilava, Bac\u0103u, Craiova and Ploie\u015fti, the CPT found that severe overcrowding and lack of reasonable hygiene facilities remained a constant problem, not only in the establishments visited but at national level, and that this had remained the case since its first visit to Romania in 1999.", "Moreover, the CPT found in respect of the prisons visited, in particular the prisons of Bac\u0103u and Ploie\u015fti, a lack of access to natural light, bad air ventilation, particularly dirty mattresses, lack of activities outside the cells, bad quality food and poor hygiene in the kitchens, and widespread non\u00adobservance of the daily one-hour walk. The conditions in Bucharest\u00adJilava Prison, in particular the section for dangerous detainees, were qualified as appalling by the CPT, which noted that the prison administration itself had acknowledged that material conditions of detention throughout the prison were extremely poor. The CPT declared itself particularly concerned about the constant lack of beds and the fact that in all the prisons visited the personal space per detainee was no more than 1.5 square metres and sometimes even as little as 0.6 square metres. While welcoming the changes introduced in domestic legislation providing for personal space of 4 square metres for each prisoner, the CPT recommended, inter alia, that necessary measures be taken to ensure compliance with this requirement. The CPT found the detainees\u2019 access to medical treatment to be insufficient, including with respect to dental care: lack of adequate staff, long waiting periods for consultation, inadequate consultation procedures. The CPT formulated a number of recommendations, including increased use of the possibility to grant, in due time, a stay of execution for health reasons.", "128. In a report following his visit to Romania in October 2002 the Commissioner for Human Rights made the following comments on the situation in prisons:", "\u201c11. However, the prison service is facing serious problems, in particular the dilapidation of many of the prisons and, above all, chronic overcrowding. [...] Thus the overall occupancy level for prisons is 137% and there is a manifest shortage of beds. My visit to Codlea prison, which has an occupancy level of 197% and where 25 prisoners are regularly held in cells designed for 15, clearly illustrated the situation. I was all the more concerned to learn that some prisons had even higher occupancy levels, rising to 353%.", "12. Being aware of the problem, the authorities keep the highest rates of overcrowding for open prisons, where the prisoners work during the day and are therefore not continually faced with the acute lack of space. However, this solution cannot be other than very temporary. The fact that several prisoners received pardons during my visit demonstrates that changes in prison policy are both possible and expected. Given that, for economic reasons, there are no plans to build new prisons at the moment I would urge the authorities to develop a system of alternative penalties, effective management of release on parole and a judicial policy requiring moderation in the use of detention. I welcome the efforts of the Ministry of Justice in this direction and invite it to complete these reforms as soon as possible [...].\u201d", "129. In his follow-up report on Romania (2002-2005) on the assessment of the progress made in implementing his earlier recommendations, published on 29 March 2006, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights made the following comments on the situation in prisons:", "\u201c11. In spite of the efforts made to improve prisons, recent studies carried out by the Romanian authorities show that the situation remains difficult. In 2004, out of 44 prisons, 8 had very good conditions, 15 had good conditions, 15 had satisfactory conditions and 6 had particularly difficult conditions, including Jilava prison, near Bucharest, which was visited by the members of the Office of the Commissioner.", "12. Prison over-population continues to be a persistent problem in Romania, although the number of prisoners has fallen from more than 47,000 in 2002 to around 39,000 at the end of 2004. On average, the rate of overpopulation has fallen significantly and is now at an acceptable level of 101%. However, certain prisons still have an intolerable overpopulation [In particular the Bac\u0103u prison, which had a rate of overpopulation of 288% on 31 December 2004]. From a general point of view, living conditions in prison have improved but still require further improvement, owing in particular to the lack of resources allocated to them.", "13. As well as the lack of means, there is a manifest lack of prison staff. Romania has on average one warder for seven prisoners, and even one for seventeen prisoners in certain prisons, whereas the average in Europe is closer to one warder for four prisoners. That shortage means that warders on duty have to increase their working time and are reduced to a purely supervisory role, and it may have negative consequences on their actions or interventions. Lastly, the lack of staff represents a significant obstacle to the normalisation of prison life and exacerbates the shortage of equipment and the problems associated with overpopulation, and severely limits work towards reintegration.", "14. Nonetheless, a significant process of modernisation has been initiated. Among the objectives of the Strategy for the reform of the judicial system 2004-2007, mention should be made of the intention to build new prisons and to modernise nine centres. Over the period 2001-2005, 6,332 new places were created.", "15. In this process for the improvement of living conditions in prisons, mention may be made of the modernisation of the young offenders\u2019 centre in Gaesti and the creation of the centres in Ocna and Buzias, the construction at Rahova prison of a hospital specialising in surgery, and the provision of hot and cold water and installation of central heating in all prisons. Also noteworthy, finally, is the transparency of the Ministry of Justice, which publishes detailed statistics on the prison situation on its internet site.", "16. As regards alternatives to detention, the new Criminal Code, adopted in June 2004 introduced the possibility of an open or semi-open prison regime for petty offences. It also provides for options other than imprisonment for young offenders and offers wider possibilities for the application of penalties.", "17. The Commissioner\u2019s team visited Jilava and Rahova prisons, both near Bucharest. These two prisons to a large extent reflect the situation in prisons in Romania at the time of the visit.", "18. At the time of the visit, Rahova prison had 1,915 prisoners, including 80 minors, for 2,200 places. The different wings of Rahova prison have recently been renovated and provide reasonable living conditions. However, a problem of overcrowding affected the women\u2019s section, where up to 16 women were being held in cells with only 10 beds. There are two reasons for this overcrowding. First, women\u2019s prison sections are rare in the Bucharest area and prisoners wish to or must remain in Rahova (in order to be near their families, or because the proceedings are still pending, etc.); and, second, the women\u2019s wing was reduced by one half in order to build the new prison hospital.", "19. Rahova prison hospital admits and treats prisoners from the whole country. It has a very modern operating facility and the latest generation of medical equipment. As the Director of the Prison Administration states, the construction of this facility required a significant but essential financial effort, as prison medicine was incomplete and inappropriate. Prisoners are now able to receive proper care, sometimes in better conditions than in some civil hospitals.", "20. By comparison with the positive example found in Rahova, Jilava prison appeared, at the time of the visit, to be in an alarming situation. Essentially a transit prison and a preventive detention prison, it had 2,500 prisoners for 1,400 places, and was one of the most overcrowded prisons in Romania. Conditions were deplorable from any point of view, as the Director of Romanian Prisons acknowledged. All the installations were obsolete, the windows incapable of keeping out the cold and the furniture from another era. Over-population meant that in some cases 27 prisoners had to live in cells designed for 6 or 8 prisoners.", "Conclusions", "21. The Commissioner emphasises the efforts made and the investments carried out to improve prison conditions and welcomes the adoption of new alternative measures. There is a clear intention to increase available prison places in order to reduce prison overpopulation. The programme of bringing prisons into line with the standards of the Council of Europe must be continued. However, significant difficulties remain and an urgent solution must be envisaged for the most obsolete and the most overcrowded prisons, such as Jilava prison.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
