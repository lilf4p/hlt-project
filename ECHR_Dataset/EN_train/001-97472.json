The Ukrainian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "The applicant's family and Mr. B. shared a communal apartment. In March 1998 the Korosten Local Executive Council granted Mr B.'s request to privatise his part of the apartment (\u201cthe disputed property\u201d). Subsequently, Mr B. gave the disputed property as a donation to Mrs T. and Mrs Ta.", "On 3 November 1998 the applicant and his wife instituted proceedings against Mr B., Mrs T. and Mrs Ta., and the Korosten Local Executive Council in the Korosten Court challenging the privatisation and seeking to have the donation contract declared null and void. In particular, the applicant alleged that Mr B., being a Russian national, had no right to privatise the disputed property.", "Since Mr B. was residing in Russia, on 19 May 1999 the court asked the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Ukraine (the Embassy) to provide it with the information about Mr B.'s nationality. On 24 May 1999 the Head of the Consular Department of the Embassy replied that the requested information had been confidential. He further indicated that the Ukrainian authorities could lodge a request with the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation, as prescribed by Article 5 of the CIS Convention on Legal Assistance and Legal Relations in Civil, Family and Criminal Matters 1993 (\u201cthe Minsk Convention\u201d).", "On 16 September 1999 the applicant sought a ruling to request the Russian authorities to state whether Mr B. had been a Russian national on the date of the privatisation. He also requested suspension of the proceedings until the Korosten Court received a reply. On 11 November 1999 the court granted the applicant's petition.", "In December 1999 the request was transmitted to the Russian authorities. The Korosten Court requested that Mr B. be questioned, the applicant's claim be served on him and that he be summoned to the Korosten Court. The Korosten Court also asked for copies of the documents concerning Mr B.'s nationality on the date of the privatisation.", "In the period from 3 November 1998 to 15 December 1999 the Korosten Court scheduled some ten hearings. They were scheduled at intervals ranging from several days and two or three months.", "On 5 June 2000 Mrs T. and Mrs Ta. lodged a counterclaim, seeking a ruling to oblige the applicant's family not to hinder them in their use of the apartment. They also claimed compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage.", "On 16 February 2001 the Deputy Head of the Zhytomir Regional Department of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine informed the Korosten Court that the reply from the Russian authorities had been received. Since the request was not executed in a due manner, it was sent back to the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation.", "On 21 March 2001 the applicant lodged an additional claim. He requested the Korosten Court to rule that he had the right to use the disputed property.", "On 12 February 2002 the Deputy Head of the Zhytomir Regional Department of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine informed the Korosten Court that the request in respect of serving the documents and questioning Mr B. had not been performed by the Russian authorities, since Mr B. had failed to appear before them.", "On 14 March 2002 the court scheduled a hearing. It was adjourned as the parties failed to appear.", "On 3 April 2002 the Korosten Court dismissed the applicant's petition that a new request be sent to the Russian authorities. The applicant unsuccessfully challenged the judge sitting in his case.", "On 23 April 2002 the court held a hearing in the case.", "On 6 August 2002 Mr B. authorised Mr T. to represent him in the proceedings before the Korosten Court.", "On 21 August 2002 the court partly allowed the claims lodged by Mrs T. and Mrs Ta. and rejected the applicant's claims. In particular, the court found that on the date of the privatisation Mr B. had had Ukrainian nationality. The court found no proof in support of the applicant's allegations. The applicant appealed against the judgment contesting, in particular, the first-instance court's finding that Mr B. had been a Ukrainian national at the time.", "According to the Government's observations, in October 2002 the court of appeal, following the applicant's request, asked the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation to provide it with the information about Mr B.'s nationality. The reply containing information about Mr B.'s nationality reached the court of appeal on 19 June 2003. Neither the applicant nor the Government informed this Court of the content of that reply.", "On 4 December 2002 the court of appeal dismissed the applicant's appeal as unsubstantiated and upheld the judgment given by the first-instance court.", "In January 2003 the applicant lodged an appeal in cassation with the first-instance court, which transferred it for consideration to the Supreme Court.", "On 31 October 2003 the Supreme Court remitted the appeal in cassation to the first-instance court, for certain shortcomings to be rectified by the applicant.", "In a ruling of 3 December 2003 the Korosten Court stated that the applicant could re-lodge his appeal in cassation after these shortcomings had been rectified, but before 20 December 2003.", "On 19 December 2003 the applicant re-lodged his appeal in cassation.", "On 26 February 2004 the Supreme Court upheld the decisions of the lower courts.", "The Convention on Legal Assistance and Legal Relations in Civil, Family and Criminal Matters (signed in Minsk on 22 January) provides as follows:", "\u201c1.
