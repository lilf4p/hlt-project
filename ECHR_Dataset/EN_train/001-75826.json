LATVIA", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Preliminary objection rejected (victim);Violation of Art. 8;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention and domestic proceedings", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["11. The applicant is a Russian national who was born in Russia in 1948 and lives in Riga (Latvia).", "12. In 1970, at the age of twenty-two, the applicant settled in Latvian territory for work-related reasons. Between 1973 and 1980, the year of her divorce, she was married to a man resident in Latvia. In 1973 she gave birth to a son, Jevge\u0146ijs \u0160evanovs, who has lived with her until the present day.", "In 1981, having lost the Soviet passport issued to her in 1978, the applicant obtained a new passport. In 1989 she found the lost passport, but did not return it to the relevant authorities.", "13. In August 1991 Latvia regained full independence. In December 1991 the Soviet Union, the State of which the applicant had hitherto been a national, broke up. The applicant therefore became stateless. In August 1992 her name was entered in the register of residents (Iedz\u012bvot\u0101ju re\u0123istrs) as a permanent resident. Her son was subsequently granted the status of \u201cpermanently resident non-citizen\u201d of Latvia.", "14. In 1994 a Latvian bridgebuilding firm offered the applicant a job as a crane operator in Dagestan and Ingushetia, regions of the Caucasus bordering on Chechnya and belonging to the Russian Federation. In view of the difficulties caused by tighter supervision in these regions by the Russian authorities on account of the troubles in Chechnya, the firm advised her to obtain Russian nationality and a formal registration of residence in Russia before signing the employment contract. In May 1994 the applicant consulted a broker who put a false stamp in her first Soviet passport, the one which had been found but not disclosed to the authorities, stating that the registration of her residence in Latvia had been cancelled (pieraksts, or dz\u012bvesvietas re\u0123istr\u0101cija in Latvian).", "15. In June 1994 the applicant was registered as being resident in Shumanovo in the Kursk region of Russia, at her brother\u2019s address. In August 1994 she obtained Russian nationality. In 1995 and 1996 she travelled to Russia, working there for two periods of 100 and 120 days respectively.", "16. In March 1998 the applicant applied to the Interior Ministry\u2019s Nationality and Migration Directorate (Iek\u0161lietu ministrijas Pilson\u012bbas un migr\u0101cijas lietu p\u0101rvalde \u2013 \u201cthe Directorate\u201d) for a passport based on the status of \u201cpermanently resident non-citizen\u201d. In accordance with the regulations in force, she submitted alongside the application the second Soviet passport issued to her in 1981. On examining the file, the Directorate discovered that she had registered a second residence in Russia and had completed certain formalities on the basis of the old passport which had been mislaid and found again. Accordingly, by decision of 9 April 1998, the Directorate removed the applicant\u2019s name from the register of residents. On the same day the head of the Directorate issued an order for the applicant\u2019s deportation (izbrauk\u0161anas r\u012bkojums), requesting her to leave Latvia for Russia by 19 June 1998. The deportation order was accompanied by a prohibition on re-entering Latvia for five years. It was served on the applicant on 11 June 1998.", "17. After appealing unsuccessfully against the deportation order to the head of the Directorate, the applicant lodged an application with the Riga City Central District Court seeking to have the order set aside. In her memorial she submitted that, as the false stamp in her passport had been put there without her knowledge and she had therefore been unaware of it, she should not have to bear the consequences. In addition, since the registration of her residence in Russia had been merely temporary, it could not affect her existing registration in Latvia. She further argued that there were no legislative or regulatory provisions in force prohibiting her from having addresses in two different countries. Accordingly, the applicant requested the court to set aside the order for her deportation and to instruct the Directorate to issue her with a permanent residence permit.", "18. In a judgment delivered on 3 December 1998 following adversarial proceedings, the court rejected the request, finding that the deportation order had been lawful and well founded. As to the applicant\u2019s request that she be issued with a residence permit, the court declared that part of the application inadmissible on the ground that she had not applied for a permit to the relevant authorities, nor had she lodged an administrative appeal before applying to the courts, as required by section 34 of the Aliens and Stateless Persons (Entry and Residence) Act (\u201cthe Aliens Act\u201d).", "19. On 13 July 1999 the Russian authorities cancelled the applicant\u2019s residence registration in Russia, at her request.", "20. The applicant lodged an appeal with the Riga Regional Court against the judgment of 3 December 1998. In a judgment delivered on 29 September 1999 following adversarial proceedings, the Regional Court dismissed the appeal on the ground that, as the applicant had been illegally resident in Latvia since her return from Russia, her deportation was in accordance with section 38 of the Aliens Act. The Regional Court also upheld the District Court\u2019s findings as to the inadmissibility of the request for a residence permit.", "21. In a judgment of 28 December 1999 the Senate of the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal by the applicant on points of law, finding that the interference complained of had been lawful and proportionate. In particular, the Senate observed that, in the instant case, the applicant\u2019s right to have two addresses or places of residence in two different countries had not been in dispute; the order for her deportation had been based solely on the fact that she had been resident in Latvia without a residence permit.", "22. With the delivery of the Senate\u2019s judgment the order for the applicant\u2019s deportation became enforceable.", "23. In two letters sent on 21 January and 3 February 2000, the applicant and her son requested the head of the Directorate to rescind the deportation order and to issue the applicant with a permanent residence permit. In support of their request, they argued that they did not have family ties in any country other than Latvia and that the expulsion of the applicant from Latvian territory, where they had lived together for twenty-six years, would constitute a serious infringement of their right to respect for their family life. They made explicit reference in that regard to Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and to similar provisions of the Latvian Constitution.", "24. By letters dated 28 January and 15 February 2000 respectively, the head of the Directorate refused this request and reminded the applicant that she was required to leave Latvia immediately or be forcibly expelled.", "25. After attempting without success to challenge this refusal by means of an administrative appeal to the Interior Minister, Mrs Shevanova and her son lodged a fresh application with the Riga City Central District Court to have the deportation order set aside. By order of 3 March 2000 the court declared the application inadmissible. On 24 May 2000 the Riga Regional Court upheld the order. An appeal on points of law by the applicant and her son was dismissed by an order of the Senate of the Supreme Court dated 29 November 2000.", "26. On 12 February 2001 the applicant was arrested by the immigration police (Imigr\u0101cijas policija) and placed in a detention centre for illegal immigrants. On 21 February 2001 officials of the Directorate served a forcible expulsion decision on her (l\u0113mums par piespiedu izraid\u012b\u0161anu no valsts).", "27. On 26 February 2001 the applicant was admitted to hospital with acute hypertension. Consequently, on 28 February 2001, the head of the Directorate stayed execution of the forcible expulsion decision and requested the immigration police to formally order the applicant\u2019s release from the detention centre. The deportation order of 9 April 1998 was also suspended at the same time.", "28. As execution of the forcible expulsion decision had been stayed indefinitely, the applicant continued to reside illegally in Latvia.", "29. On 7 January 2005 the head of the Directorate wrote a letter to the Government\u2019s Agent in the following terms:", "\u201c... [T]he ... Directorate ... has received your letter concerning the application lodged by Nina Shevanova with the European Court of Human Rights ... and requesting [us] to consider the possibility of issuing her with a permanent residence permit ... under section 24(2) of the Immigration Act. The reason you cite for your request is the existence of a real risk that a violation of Article 8 of the Convention might be found in this case. However, if Nina Shevanova were to be granted a sufficiently secure legal status in Latvia, the Latvian Government would be justified in requesting the European Court to dismiss the application.", "...", "I would like first of all to draw your attention to the fact that section 24(3) of the Immigration Act does not apply to the circumstances of the Shevanova case. The Directorate has therefore explored other possible solutions.", "...", "Regard being had ... to the relevant circumstances of the Shevanova case, and in particular the fact that Mrs Shevanova has lived and worked within Latvian territory for a long time \u2013 a fact which undoubtedly testifies to the existence of sufficiently strong private and social ties ... \u2013 the Directorate is prepared, once it has obtained the necessary documentation from Mrs Shevanova ..., to address an opinion to the Minister of the Interior proposing that she be issued with a temporary residence permit valid for five years, in accordance with section 23(3) of the Immigration Act...", "...", "Under the terms of Council [of the European Union] Directive 2003/109/EC concerning the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents, Member States are required to grant long-term resident status to third-country nationals who have resided legally and continuously within their territory for five years immediately prior to submission of the relevant application. Accordingly, on expiry of the period of validity of her temporary residence permit, Nina Shevanova would be entitled to apply for and obtain the status of permanent resident and to be issued with an EC residence permit. Remedying Mrs Shevanova\u2019s situation in this way would be sufficient to put an end to any possible violation of her rights under Article 8 of the Convention.", "With this aim in mind, the Directorate has already drawn up a letter inviting Mrs Shevanova to submit to it the documents required in order to apply for a residence permit. This letter will be sent to her in the next few days. It should be pointed out that, in accordance with section 61 of Regulation no. 213 ... on residence permits, [the person concerned] in such cases must submit a letter from a legal entity attesting to the necessity ... of his or her remaining in the Republic of Latvia. The Directorate notes in that connection that Mrs Shevanova will in all likelihood be unable to produce such a document. In any event, a positive ... outcome to the case can be achieved only if Mrs Shevanova herself displays an interest in such a solution.", "Should Mrs Shevanova herself fail to take steps towards implementing the solution proposed by the Latvian Government, [it should be borne in mind that] the European Court of Human Rights has already acknowledged that, where applicants knowingly decline to take the appropriate measures suggested by the authorities ..., they cannot claim to be victims of a violation of their right to respect for their private and family life... The reference to Article 8 of the Convention ..., made in Mrs Shevanova\u2019s request, would therefore be without foundation.\u201d", "30. By Decree no. 75 of 2 February 2005, the Cabinet of Ministers instructed the Minister of the Interior to issue the applicant with a permanent residence permit \u201conce the documents required to make such an application have been received\u201d (Article 1 of the decree).", "31. By letter of 24 February 2005 the Directorate explained to the applicant how she could regularise her stay by obtaining a permanent residence permit, and invited her to submit the documents required for that purpose under the relevant regulations. It is clear from the case file, however, that the applicant has to date not taken the steps indicated by the Directorate.", "32. Latvian legislation on nationality and immigration distinguishes several categories of persons, each with a specific status.", "(a) Latvian citizens (Latvijas Republikas pilso\u0146i), whose legal status is governed by the Citizenship Act (Pilson\u012bbas likums);", "(b) \u201cpermanently resident non-citizens\u201d (nepilso\u0146i) \u2013 that is, citizens of the former USSR who lost their Soviet citizenship following the break-up of the USSR in 1991, but have not subsequently obtained any other nationality \u2013 who are governed by the NonCitizens Act (see paragraph 33 below);", "(c) asylum-seekers and refugees, whose status is governed by the Asylum Act of 7 March 2002 (Patv\u0113ruma likums);", "(d) \u201cstateless persons\u201d (bezvalstnieki) in the narrow and specific sense of the term. Prior to 2 March 2004 their status was governed by the Status of Stateless Persons Act, read in conjunction with the Aliens Act (see paragraph 34 below) and, after 1 May 2003, with the Immigration Act (see paragraph 36 below).
