At the time he enquired about widows\u2019 benefits but was not issued with the relevant form. His claim for widows\u2019 benefits was then made on 23 August 2002 and was rejected in September 2002 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows\u2019 benefits because he was not a woman. On 23 April 2003 the decision was upheld by an appeal tribunal. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under United Kingdom law.", "The applicant was not in receipt of child benefit at the time of his claim.", "The domestic law relevant to this application is set out in Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, \u00a7\u00a7 1426, ECHR 2002-IV and Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, no. 42949/98, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41, 25 July 2007."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
