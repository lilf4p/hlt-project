UKRAINE", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Preliminary objection rejected (non-exhaustion of domestic remedies);Violation of Art. 6-2;Remainder inadmissible;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["5. The applicant was born in 1949 and resides in the village of Liski, Volyn region, Ukraine.", "6. In 1993-1994 the applicant worked as a director of a caf\u00e9 in the town of Volodymyr-Volynskyy, Volyn region, Ukraine.", "7. On 14 February 1995 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant for plundering State property (Article 84 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code).", "8. On 6 June 1995 the applicant was charged with plundering State property in particularly large quantities (Article 86 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code). The same day she was arrested.", "9. On 9 June 1995 the applicant was released on bail subject to an undertaking not to abscond (\u043f\u0456\u0434\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0457\u0437\u0434).", "10. On 26 December 1997 the criminal case was terminated for want of proof of a crime.", "11. On 13 July 1999 the Prosecutor of Volodymyr-Volynskyy District quashed the decision of 26 December 1997 and sent the case for further investigation.", "12. By a decision of 5 October 1999, the criminal proceedings against the applicant were terminated partly for want of proof of a crime and partly on the ground that the further prosecution in her case was time-barred. The investigator did not find it proven that the applicant had been involved in plundering, but considered that her actions could be classified as negligence, which was an offence under Article 167 of the Criminal Code in the wording which was in force at the relevant time (see paragraph 27). However, given that the statutory time-limit for prosecuting the applicant for negligence had passed, the criminal case in respect of that charge had to be discontinued as time-barred.", "13. On 22 October 1999 the applicant complained to the Prosecutor of Volodymyr-Volynskyy District about the decision of 5 October 1999. This complaint was rejected. The applicant appealed to the court.", "14. On 22 December 1999 the Volodymyr-Volynskyy District Court allowed the applicant\u2019s appeal and quashed the decision of 5 October 1999. The court noted that a criminal case could be terminated on non-exonerative grounds, like a time-bar on further prosecution, only with the consent of the prosecuted person. As the applicant had never agreed to the termination of the case on this ground the investigation should be continued.", "15. On 29 February 2000, the investigator terminated the criminal proceedings against the applicant on the same grounds as previously.", "16. On 3 November 2000, the same court, upon the applicant\u2019s appeal, quashed this decision and remitted the case for a fresh consideration.", "17. On 4 December 2000 the criminal case against the applicant was terminated for want of proof of a crime. At the same time, in his decree terminating the criminal proceedings against the applicant, the investigator mentioned that the courts had quashed the previous decisions on termination of the criminal case on non-exonerative grounds, because the applicant had not agreed. In the investigator\u2019s opinion the applicant\u2019s consent was not necessary, because even though her conduct could be qualified as a crime of negligence, no criminal proceedings could be instituted, as prosecution was time-barred and she could not be considered as an accused in this respect. The investigator, therefore, decided that:", "\u201cIn the actions of Ms Mariya Mykhaylivna Grabchuk there are corpus delicti (\u0454 \u0441\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434 \u0437\u043b\u043e\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0443), provided for in Article 167 of the CCU [the Criminal Code of Ukraine], that is negligence, of which she herself confessed to be guilty. Nevertheless, taking into account that from the moment when she had committed that crime (\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0454\u043d\u043d\u044f \u043d\u0435\u044e \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0437\u043b\u043e\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0443) the time-limits had expired... the institution of a criminal case under Article 167 of the CCU should be rejected for being time-barred...\u201d", "18. The applicant challenged the decision of 4 December 2000, requesting that her guilt be proved in judicial proceedings in accordance with Article 62 of the Constitution. She further submitted that closing the criminal case against her on non-exonerative grounds deprived her of a possibility to receive compensation for the unlawful actions taken against her.", "19. On 26 April 2001 the Volodymyr-Volynskyy Local Court rejected the applicant\u2019s complaint about the decision of 4 December 2000. In its decision the court stated in particular:", "\u201cAs it appears from the materials of the criminal case against M.M. Grabchuk and the decision of the head of the investigating unit of the Volodymyr-Volynsky Department of Interior of 4 December 2000, the actions of M.M. Grabchuk disclose signs of the corpus delicti (\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0443 \u0437\u043b\u043e\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0443) provided for in Article 167 of the CCU [the Criminal Code of Ukraine] and she had acknowledged her guilt of having committed this offence.", "According to Article 167 of the CCU, in the wording of 1993-1994, ... this crime was punishable by imprisonment for a period of up to two years.", "Under Article 48 \u00a7 I (2) of the CCU, a person cannot be charged with an offence if three years have elapsed from the date when a criminal offence punishable under the law by imprisonment for a period of up to two years was committed.", "Under Article 6 \u00a7 I (3) [of the Code of Criminal Procedure] no criminal proceedings could be initiated and any proceedings which had been started should be terminated as time-barred.", "Therefore, in the above circumstances, no criminal case charging M.M. Grabchuk with an offence under Article 167 of the CCU could be instituted because prosecution against her was time-barred.\u201d", "This decision was not subject to appeal.", "20. On an unspecified date the applicant lodged a claim with the Volodymyr-Volynskyy Town Court, seeking compensation for damage caused by the allegedly unlawful criminal proceedings against her.", "21. On 30 June 1999 the court found in part for the applicant and awarded her UAH 70,000 in compensation. The decision was not appealed against and became final.", "22. By letter of 5 August 1999 the Volyn Regional Department of the State Treasury, responsible for the enforcement of the decision, requested the Regional Prosecutor to lodge a supervisory review appeal on the ground that the State Budget for 1999 did not foresee expenditure of this kind. Following this request, the Prosecutor sought supervisory review, arguing that the actions of the police were lawful and that the amount awarded to the applicant was too high, in particular given the difficult economic situation in the country.", "23. On 20 September 1999 upon a supervisory review appeal of the prosecutor, the Presidium of the Volyn Regional Court quashed the decision of the Volodymyr-Volynskyy Town Court of 30 June 1999 and remitted the case for a fresh consideration.", "24. On 6 July 2001 the Volodymyr-Volynskyy Local Court rejected the applicant\u2019s claim for compensation because the criminal proceedings against her had been terminated on a non-exonerative ground, namely that prosecution was time-barred. The court noted that it appeared from the decisions of 5 October 1999, 29 February and 4 December 2000 terminating the criminal case against the applicant, that her conduct disclosed signs of the corpus delicti provided for in Article 167 of the CCU (negligence), namely the inappropriate performance of professional duties by an official due to a negligent attitude, which had caused significant loss to the State\u2019s interests. The record of her interrogation of 6 June 1995 showed that the applicant acknowledged her guilt of negligence. The court further stated that, given that the criminal case was terminated on a non-exonerative ground, the applicant lost the right to compensation under the Law \u201con the procedure for compensation of damage caused to the citizen by the unlawful actions of bodies of inquiry, pre-trial investigation, prosecutors and courts\u201d.", "25.
