THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant, Mr Arjen Mathijs Koman, is a Netherlands national who was born in 1966 and lives in The Hague. He is represented before the Court by Mr J.A.W. Knoester, a lawyer practising in The Hague.", "The Government are represented by their Agent, Mrs J. Schukking of the Netherlands Ministry for Foreign Affairs.", "On 24 October 1999 the applicant entered a snackbar at Gouda Central Station wearing a balaclava and forced the staff at knife-point to hand him money from the till. He was stopped by railway police as he tried to leave the station. It was later reported that his breath smelt of drink.", "The applicant was arrested and detained for questioning (ophouden voor verhoor) at 3.59 p.m.", "At 4.30 p.m. the applicant was seen by an assistant public prosecutor (hulpofficier van justitie), a senior police officer competent to give certain orders in criminal cases. At 7 p.m. the applicant was seen by a doctor. Both found that the applicant was not in a fit state to be questioned. It appeared that he was much the worse for drink and drugs.", "The six-hour time-limit within which the applicant should have been either released or ordered taken into police custody (inverzekeringstelling) ended at 9.59 p.m.", "The applicant was brought before an assistant public prosecutor the following morning, 25 October 1999, at 9.45 a.m. He was questioned by police officers at 10.02 a.m. and 10.51 a.m. At 11.50 a.m. the applicant was again brought before the assistant public prosecutor, who ordered him to be placed in police custody at noon.", "On 27 October 1999, the applicant, assisted by counsel, was heard by an investigating judge (rechter-commissaris). He asked to be released immediately. This the investigating judge refused to do. She found the police custody to be unlawful as a matter of domestic law but ordered that the applicant be taken into detention on remand. The official record drawn up by the investigating judge contains her decision, which is in the following terms:", "\u201cThe suspect [verdachte; i.e. the applicant] was arrested on 24 October at 3.59 p.m., but was unresponsive (niet aanspreekbaar). He was then locked in a cell to sober up and brought before the assistant public prosecutor on 25 October 1999 at 9.45 a.m.", "The suspect was questioned at 10.02 a.m. and 10.51 a.m., after which he was again brought before the assistant public prosecutor at 11.50 a.m. and taken into police custody at 12 noon, that is, 20 hours after his arrest. Since it appears that the applicant was responsive (aanspreekbaar) by 9.45 a.m., he ought not to have been taken into police custody only at 12 noon. In view of the seriousness of the crime of which the suspect is suspected and the serious indications (ernstige bezwaren) that have arisen in his regard, the request for immediate release must be refused, the applicant having been taken into detention on remand without preliminaries (nu de verdachte rauwelijks in bewaring is gesteld).\u201d", "The applicant was tried by the Regional Court (arrondissementsrechtbank) of The Hague on 2 February 2000. The judgment notes that he was taken into police custody on 25 October 1999.", "On 16 February 1999 the Regional Court gave judgment finding the applicant guilty of extortion (Article 317 of the Criminal Code \u2013 Wetboek van Strafrecht). It sentenced him to twenty-four months\u2019 imprisonment, six months of which was suspended on condition that he undergo treatment for his addiction problems, as an in-patient if need be, under appropriate supervision. Its reasoning included the following:", "\u201cThe suspect\u2019s counsel has stated at the hearing that the order for the applicant to be taken into police custody was given too late, i.e. after the expiry of the time-limit prescribed by law. Counsel has invoked Article 359a \u00a7 1 a of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Wetboek van Strafvordering) and argued that in the event of a conviction this procedural violation (vormverzuim) should lead to a reduction of sentence. On this point, the Regional Court holds, considering also the seriousness of the crime committed by the suspect, that the procedural violation mentioned is not of such a nature that it should lead to a reduction of sentence. In so holding the Court of Appeal has had regard to the fact that it is not apparent that the said violation caused the suspect any substantial prejudice.\u201d", "The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal (gerechtshof) of The Hague.", "A hearing was held on 13 September 2000, at which the applicant stated that he had drunk a bottle of port wine and taken cocaine on 24 October 1999. The applicant\u2019s counsel again argued that the applicant\u2019s sentence should be reduced in view of the unlawfulness of the order placing him in police custody.", "The Court of Appeal gave judgment on 27 September confirming the applicant\u2019s conviction. Echoing the reasoning of the Regional Court, it rejected the plea for a reduction of sentence in the following terms:", "\u201cThe suspect\u2019s counsel has stated at the appeal hearing that the order for the applicant to be taken into police custody was given too late, i.e. after the end of the time-limit prescribed by law.
