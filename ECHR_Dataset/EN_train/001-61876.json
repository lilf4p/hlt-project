On 9 December 1994 a newspaper in the town of Parvomay, \u201cParvomay dnes\u201d, published an article on the problems of the liquidation of State cooperative farms and the restitution of the agricultural land in the region. The article contained offensive allegations against the applicant who was a former chairman of the local commission in charge of the liquidation of the cooperative farms. The title of the article, quoting the applicant, read \u201cDo not hassle me, I have a yellow card\u201d (\u201e\u041d\u0435 \u043c\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435, \u0430\u0437 \u0441\u044a\u043c \u0441 \u0436\u044a\u043b\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430\u201c). The latter expression means that the person in question is registered as mentally ill. The article\u2019s author commented on the poor results of the commission\u2019s audit, stating that they could be expected since its chairman was a \u201cperson of unsound mind\u201d (\u201e\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0435\u043c \u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u201c).

In February 1995 the applicant lodged with the Parvomay District Prosecutor\u2019s Office a request for the opening of proceedings for criminal libel against the newspaper\u2019s editor. On 6 March 1995 the competent prosecutor opened a preliminary inquiry with a view to the opening of criminal proceedings against the editor.", "12. On 2 March 1995 the applicant filed a civil action against the newspaper\u2019s editor and publisher, alleging that the article had defamed him. He claimed nonpecuniary damages for injury to his reputation.", "13. The Parvomay District Court held its first hearing in the case on 13 April 1995. Counsel for the defendants requested the court to stay the proceedings, presenting a certificate from the Prosecutor\u2019s Office to the effect that a preliminary inquiry had been opened. The court stayed the proceedings in accordance with Article 182 \u00a7 1 (d) of the Code of Civil Procedure (\u201cCCP\u201d), pending the outcome of the preliminary inquiry.", "14. The applicant lodged an interlocutory appeal, arguing, inter alia, that the pending preliminary inquiry could not serve as grounds for the staying of the civil proceedings, the only such grounds being pending criminal proceedings.", "15. On 13 July 1995 the Plovdiv Regional Court upheld the lower court\u2019s ruling, holding that the facts alleged in the civil action constituted \u201ccriminal elements\u201d within the meaning of Article 182 \u00a7 1 (d) of the CCP. The only bodies competent to decide whether a criminal offence had or had not been committed were the prosecutor and the criminal courts. The eventual ruling of the criminal court would be res judicata for the civil court, as provided by Article 222 of the CCP. Therefore, the proceedings had been properly stayed.", "16. On 5 September 1995 the Parvomay District Prosecutor\u2019s Office opened criminal proceedings against the journalist who had written the article against the applicant.", "17. While the civil proceedings were stayed the Parvomay District Court sent numerous letters to the District Prosecutor\u2019s Office and to the District Investigation Service, inquiring about the status of the criminal proceedings.

Meanwhile, on 23 March 1998 the applicant\u2019s lawyer requested the Parvomay District Prosecutor\u2019s Office to do the necessary for the speedy conclusion of the criminal proceedings. On 4 May 1998 he filed a complaint with the Plovdiv Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office, alleging that the criminal proceedings had lasted unreasonably long, thus precluding the resumption of the civil proceedings. In a letter of 12 May 1998 the Parvomay District Prosecutor\u2019s Office informed the applicant that the investigation would be completed within thirty days. On 21 May 1998 the Plovdiv Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office instructed the Parvomay District Prosecutor\u2019s Office to finalise the investigation within fourteen days.", "19.

On 1 March 2001 the Parvomay District Prosecutor\u2019s Office sent the case file to the Parvomay District Court, which thereupon resumed the stayed civil proceedings.", "22. A hearing listed for 3 May 2001 was adjourned because the defendants had not been properly summoned.", "23. The next hearing was scheduled for 5 July 2001. The court noted that the defendants had again not been properly summoned and adjourned the case. As the summons sent to one of the defendants, the cooperative which had published the newspaper containing the allegedly defamatory article, was returned with a note that that cooperative had apparently been liquidated two years before that, the court instructed the applicant to produce a certificate of the cooperative\u2019s current status. [Note: Certificates of current status are issued by the register of companies kept at the regional courts.]", "24. On 21 August 2001 the Parvomay District Court discontinued the proceedings, holding that the applicant had failed to comply with its instructions. The applicant appealed and on 8 January 2002 the Plovdiv Regional Court quashed the discontinuation and remitted the case to the Parvomay District Court.", "25. On 21 January 2002 the Parvomay District Court again requested the applicant to provide a certificate of current status of the defendant cooperative.", "26.
