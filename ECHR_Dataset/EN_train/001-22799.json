In addition, it awarded the applicant costs and expenditures incurred in these proceedings amounting to 89,620 denars.", "On 14 December 1998 the \u0160tip Appellate Court (\u0410\u043f\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d \u0441\u0443\u0434 \u0428\u0442\u0438\u043f) partially accepted the appeal lodged by the defendant State, finding that the lower court erred in the application of the law. It reversed the judgment of the first-instance court and substantially reduced the amount of compensation awarded to the applicant, by holding that the applicant was to receive compensation only for non-pecuniary damage suffered on account of his deprivation of liberty during the 30-day detention on remand, of an amount of 100,000 denars, coupled with statutory default interest which was to be computed from the date of delivery of the first-instance judgment. It also reduced the procedural costs awarded to the applicant to 38,500 denars.", "On 15 March 2000 the Supreme Court (\u0412\u0440\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d \u0441\u0443\u0434 \u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430) refused to entertain the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law and refrained from examining the merits of the applicant\u2019s case on the basis of Article 368 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure (\u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043f\u043a\u0430), which provides that such an extraordinary judicial remedy may be used only in disputes whose value, as set out in the impugned part of the final judicial decision, exceeds a certain value prescribed by law. The court found that the value of the applicant\u2019s dispute as set out in the impugned Appellate Court\u2019s decision was lower than that set by law, which according to the new procedural rule amounted to 1,000,000 denars.
