The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Sombor, Serbia.", "7. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "8. On 24 February 2005 the applicant bought a store together with a plot of land from the P Company (plot A).", "9. As the owner of the above real estate, as well as of plots B and C, the P Company was burdened with a landed servitude (li\u010dni realni teret) in favour of third persons, requiring their life-long maintenance (do\u017eivotno izdr\u017eavanje).", "10. On the basis of the above contract, however, the servitude in question, being tied, inter alia, to plot A, was partly transferred to the applicant as its new owner.", "11. On 30 March 2005 the applicant and the P Company concluded a court-certified amendment to the contract of 24 February 2005. The P Company thereby accepted to reimburse the applicant for any payments made in connection with the said servitude. This entitlement was itself constituted as a separate landed servitude (easement, stvarni realni teret) tied to plots B and C and established in favour of the applicant as the current owner of plot A, as well as any future owners thereof.", "12. On 30 March 2005 the applicant filed a request with the Municipal Cadastre Office (Slu\u017eba za katastar nepokretnosti) in Sombor, seeking registration of his easement.", "13.

The expert, retained by the applicant, further noted that the rights of the third persons in question remained unaffected, thus implying that their consent was not needed.", "16. On 29 May 2006 the legal branch of the Department of Geodesy (Republi\u010dki geodetski zavod - sector za pravne poslove) confirmed the impugned decision of the Municipal Cadastre Office.

It also noted that no judicial review by means of an administrative dispute was possible.", "17.
