The applicant was born in 1977 and lives in Krymsk, Krasnodar Region.", "8. According to the applicant, from 24 March 2005 he served a sentence in Lgov correctional colony OX-30/3, Kursk Region (\u0443\u0447\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u041e\u0425-30/3). On his arrival at the colony, he was called to see the head of the colony, B., who invited him to become a member of a so-called \u201c\u0441\u0435\u043a\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0434\u043a\u0430\u201d (literally, an \u201corder section\u201d, an informal category of prisoners who cooperated with the prison administration) and to conclude a written agreement on cooperation with the colony\u2019s officials. The applicant refused. As a result of his refusal he was beaten by D., the deputy head of the correctional colony, K., a colony official, and R., head of the security unit. The beating was continued by other colony officials, who stripped him naked and beat him with rubber truncheons. The applicant was then placed for ten days in a disciplinary cell, where the beating continued. On a number of occasions he was beaten in the presence of an official from the Kursk Prosecutor\u2019s Office. The applicant complained about the events to the Lgov Prosecutor\u2019s Office.", "9. On 10 July 2005 the institution of criminal proceedings was refused on the ground that \u201cspecial equipment\u201d had been used against the applicant in accordance with the law.", "10. The applicant claimed to have been systematically beaten for writing complaints against the head of the correctional colony and the colony\u2019s administration to various authorities, and that he had then been forced to eat the complaints he had written. In particular, on 23 May 2005 he was beaten with rubber truncheons and thrown to the ground, and an Alsatian dog was set on him. The dog mostly bit his hands, which he was using to cover his face. According to the applicant, the colony\u2019s doctor noted the bite marks. He alleged that he still had scars on his hands. The head of the correctional colony then threatened the applicant that if he wrote more complaints he would have to spend the night in a cell with the dog.", "11. During the night of 26-27 June 2005 the applicant, together with two other inmates, M. and G., was taken to the office of prison official K., who asked him to report on the situation in the correctional colony. The applicant responded that he was not in control of the situation. As a result of this reply he was beaten and escorted to a cell where, it appeared, other inmates had cut their veins and stomachs. As a protest against the actions of the colony\u2019s administration, the applicant also cut the veins on his right arm and, having found an electrode in premises where repair work was being carried out, thrust it in his right side in an attempt to reach the lungs. According to the applicant, after he had inflicted these penetrating wounds on 27 June 2005, he was questioned for the entire day and it was not until the evening that a physician pulled the electrode from his side; however, the glass cap remained in his stomach. The surgeon examined the applicant later and noted that a foreign body was still in his stomach, but did not remove it.", "12. On the following day the applicant and other inmates submitted to the Prosecutor of the Kursk Region applications for the institution of criminal proceedings against B., the head of the correctional colony, colony officials D. and R. and others, on account of numerous instances of ill-treatment of prisoners. Criminal proceedings in case file no. 1519 were instituted against two prison officials, D. and R., on account of the alleged beating of inmate Sh. However, no criminal proceedings were instituted into the applicant\u2019s allegations as set out in his complaint to the Prosecutor of the Kursk Region, and he was not granted the status of a victim in the criminal proceedings.", "13.

On 23 March 2005, in the course of a routine search, the applicant was found to have forbidden items, namely three metal dowels and two razor blades. During the search and seizure of the items the applicant resisted the colony\u2019s officials. In particular, he pushed them, grabbed their clothes and insulted some of them. One of the officials warned him that special equipment could be used against him if he continued behaving in such a way. Since the applicant refused to submit, two of the officials used a rubber truncheon against him. After the incident the applicant was examined by a doctor who found abrasions on his back and soft body tissues.", "15. On the same day the deputy prosecutor of the Kursk Region was informed of the incident and a report on the use of the special equipment was drafted. The report stated that the rubber truncheon had been used for three seconds against soft body tissues. Later that day the deputy prosecutor of the Kursk Region personally met the applicant, who told him that he had no complaints against the administration of the correctional colony OX-30/3 and that the application of the special equipment had been justified.", "16. On 1 April 2005 the deputy prosecutor of the Kursk Region again met the applicant, this time in relation to the injuries he had self-inflicted on 16 March 2005 while held in a remand prison (SIZO) in Kursk, prior to his transfer to correctional colony OX-30/3.

He also stated that he had no complaints against the administration of the remand prison.", "17.

Following an inspection, on 10 July 2005 the prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings into the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment. He also found that special measures were lawfully applied against the applicant on 23 March 2005. An appeal against that decision lay with a higher prosecutor or a court.", "20. The Government submitted that the applicant had not applied for medical aid in connection with the alleged ill-treatment on 23 May 2005. The authorities became aware of these allegations only after the application had been communicated by the Court.", "21. On an unspecified date the applicant sent a complaint to the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of the Kursk Region. The complaint was received by the Prosecutor\u2019s Office on 4 July 2005. The applicant alleged that since his arrival at correctional colony OX-30/3 he had been regularly beaten by colony officials. He sought to institute criminal proceedings against them.", "22.

In the course of the initial and additional inspections the officials who were alleged to have beaten the applicant were questioned by the Prosecutor\u2019s Office. In particular, the head of the colony, B., in his statements on 13 July and 3 September 2005 submitted that the inmates, including the applicant, had not been beaten or subjected to degrading treatment and that he had never ordered the use of physical force against them. He regarded the inmates\u2019 complaints as slanderous and aimed at destabilising the situation in the colony. Similar submissions were made by D. on 13 July and 5 September 2002, by R. on 13 July 2005 and by Z. on 2 September 2005.", "25. On 5 September 2005 the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of the Seymskiy District of Kursk again refused to institute criminal proceedings. According to the findings of the inspection, the officials of colony OX-30/3 had not abused their official authority and did not use physical force against the applicant. The use of a rubber truncheon against him on 23 March 2005 had been justified since he had resisted the officials who had conducted the routine search. An appeal against the decision lay with a higher prosecutor or a court.", "26. During the night of 26-27 June 2005 the applicant self-inflicted a subcutaneous slash wound to his right forearm and subcutaneous slash wounds to the front abdominal wall and inserted a foreign body into the soft tissue of the front abdominal wall.

On 19 August 2005, following an inspection, criminal investigation no. 1519 was discontinued in the part related to the complaints lodged by the applicant and two other inmates, M. and G. In the course of the inspection the Prosecutor\u2019s Office examined the relevant medical reports and questioned several officials of the colony, who submitted that no physical force had been applied to the applicant on 26-27 June 2005. The Prosecutor\u2019s Office of the Kursk Region found that the applicant\u2019s injuries had been self-inflicted and his allegations of ill-treatment were unsubstantiated. An appeal against the decision lay with a higher prosecutor or a court.", "29. The applicant submitted that on either 29 or 30 June 2005 he had been escorted to Lgov remand prison IZ-46/2 (\u0443\u0447\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0418\u0417-46/2 \u041b\u044c\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0430) under the guise of transportation to the medical unit.

According to the applicant, he was not provided with adequate medical assistance in remand prison IZ-46/2. Officials from the Prosecutor\u2019s Office showed him entries in his medical file stating that he had been examined by a doctor; however, this was not true.
