Abide Acar, Mehmet Salim's daughter, had seen her father sitting in the back of a \u201cgrey-coloured\u201d car passing through the village while she and a neighbour were washing clothes in a stream. Another villager had allegedly seen Mehmet Salim being taken to the riverbank, where five other people had been waiting in another car.

This police officer rang Meliha Dal three days later and told her that he had seen Mehmet Salim at the Bismil gendarmerie command and that he could take him some clothes and cigarettes.

In her petition H\u00fcsna Acar further stated that her family had already made enquiries with the gendarmerie and the police, who had told them that they knew nothing about it. H\u00fcsna Acar requested the public prosecutor to issue the necessary instructions in order to find her son as soon as possible.", "87. On 19 October 1994 H\u00fcsna Acar filed a second petition with the Bismil public prosecutor, in which she requested an investigation into the disappearance of her son. She asked the public prosecutor in particular to verify whether her son had been apprehended and was being held by the security forces.", "88.

Having interrogated him, Captain \u0130zzet had concluded that Mehmet Salim was innocent and that Harun Aca's information had been incorrect. However, as Captain \u0130zzet feared sanctions for having detained Mehmet Salim incommunicado and for too long, for having denied him the necessary medical care and for having failed to respect his defence rights, he had kept Mehmet Salim in detention. Considering that his brother risked being killed by Captain \u0130zzet in order to conceal the matter, the applicant requested the Ministry of Human Rights to intervene as a matter of urgency.", "92. In an undated petition, H\u00fcsna Acar requested the Investigation Commission for Human Rights of the Turkish Grand National Assembly to examine the case of her son Salih Acar, claiming that he had been taken into detention by Captain \u0130zzet of the Ambar gendarmerie on 6 July 1994 and that nothing had been heard from him since.

She further claimed that, on the day her son had been abducted, two other persons \u2013 whose names she did not mention \u2013 had been abducted in the same car, that one of them had been released and that her son had initially been taken to Bismil, then to C\u0131nar and subsequently to Diyarbak\u0131r.", "95. On 5 August 1996 H\u00fcsna Acar requested the Ministry of the Interior to take the necessary steps to find out whether her son Mehmet Salim Acar, who had been abducted in 1994 in a white taxi by two persons whose identities she did not know, was dead or alive.", "96. On 23 August 1996 H\u00fcsna Acar and Halise Acar filed a criminal complaint of abduction and disappearance with the Bismil public prosecutor. They claimed that, three days before his disappearance, Mehmet Salim Acar had quarrelled with Mehmet A\u00e7an, who was also living in Ambar, about a pump. Mehmet A\u00e7an had told Mehmet Salim that he would definitely \u201cdisappear\u201d within three days at the most. Three days later, Mehmet Salim was taken away by Captain \u0130zzettin, Mehmet A\u00e7an and Harun A\u00e7an.

Meliha Dal further stated that the petitions filed by Halise and H\u00fcsna Acar with the Bismil public prosecutor and the Ministry of the Interior had not led to any results and that the Bismil Governor and the Bismil gendarmerie authorities had not even contacted Halise and/or H\u00fcsna Acar to discuss the matter. Meliha Dal requested the Governor to question Captain \u0130zzettin and the brothers Mehmet and Harun A\u00e7an, as she believed that her brother might have been killed by them.", "98. On 10 December 1996 the applicant sent a letter to the president of the Diyarbak\u0131r Provincial Administrative Council claiming, inter alia, that his brother Mehmet Salim Acar had been taken into detention by Captain \u0130zzet Cural and Sergeant Ahmet Korkmaz on the basis of incorrect information provided by Harun Aca (see paragraph 142 below).", "On the same day, the applicant sent a similar letter to the President of Turkey, requesting him to investigate what had happened to his brother.", "99.

Considering that \u015eakir G\u00fcn was thus aware of her son's whereabouts and involved in his abduction, H\u00fcsna Acar requested the Ministry of the Interior to intervene and investigate the matter.", "On the same date H\u00fcsna Acar sent an identical petition to the President of Turkey.", "100. The submitted copy of the custody records of the Bismil gendarmerie for the period between 8 July and 13 November 1994 does not contain an entry in the name of Mehmet Salih Acar or Mehmet Salim Acar.", "101. On 29 August 1994, in an instruction written by hand at the bottom of the petition filed on that day by H\u00fcsna Acar (see paragraph 86 above), the Bismil public prosecutor ordered the taking of a detailed statement from H\u00fcsna Acar and the making of enquiries with the gendarmerie and the security forces. On 31 August 1994 he instructed the Bismil gendarmerie to ensure that H\u00fcsna Acar came to his office to make a statement.", "102. On 2 September 1994 H\u00fcsna Acar made a statement to the Bismil public prosecutor.

When we went to sit under a tree to have lunch, \u0130lhan Ezer, who was working in the field, joined us. There was a twenty-metre distance between my father and me. At this point, a grey-coloured taxi with no number plates came and stopped near my father. The persons in the car spoke with my father. I saw them take the identity cards of my father and of the person called \u0130lhan and then return \u0130lhan's identity card, and I saw my father get into the taxi. This taxi immediately headed towards the village of Ambar. Later, I went home and informed my mother. As I was far away, I was unable to recognise these people, but I heard that they were speaking Turkish. These people were wearing hats and glasses. That is all I know and what I have witnessed.\u201d", "105. \u0130lhan Ezer, who was also heard by the Bismil public prosecutor on 2 September 1994, declared:", "\u201cOn the day of the incident, while Mehmet Salih Acar and I were having lunch in the field below the village of Ambar, a Renault TX-model grey taxi without number plates approached us. The persons in the car asked us to hand over our identity cards. When we refused, they forced us by saying that they were the police and that we were therefore obliged to hand over our identity cards. The persons who asked for our cards had a western accent. Both of them were about 25 or 26 years old. One of them was wearing glasses. They did not give back Mehmet Salih's identity card. They said: 'Mehmet Salih will show us someone's field and then we will send him back.' That is all I know and what I have witnessed in relation to the incident.\u201d", "106. On 13 September 1994 the Bismil public prosecutor informed the Bismil gendarmerie command that, about ten days before 29 August 1994, Mehmet Salih Acar had been abducted by two unknown persons \u2013 aged 25 or 26, speaking with a western Anatolian accent and one of them wearing glasses \u2013 who had come in a gunmetal Renault TX-model taxi without licence plates.

On 15 March 1995 the Bismil public prosecutor instructed the Bismil gendarmerie command to conduct a thorough investigation into the alleged abduction of Mehmet Salih Acar and, if this had in fact taken place, to tell him who was responsible and whether it had been politically motivated. He sent a reminder of this instruction to the Bismil gendarmerie command on 17 May 1995.", "110. By a letter of 22 June 1995, the Bismil gendarmerie district commander Captain \u0130zzet Cural informed the Bismil public prosecutor that the investigation requested on 25 January 1995 had been completed. Captain Cural appended to his letter a record dated 20 June 1995, signed by the gendarmerie officers \u0130lhan Y\u00fccel, Ismail \u00d6zden and Ahmet Uyar of the Bismil central gendarmerie command, stating that it had not been possible to locate or identify the persons who had abducted Mehmet Salih Acar.", "111. On 14 August 1995, acting on the petition filed on 27 July 1995 by the applicant (see paragraph 90 above), the Ministry of Justice requested the Bismil public prosecutor, as a matter of urgency, to provide information about Mehmet Salim Acar, who had allegedly been taken into detention at the Bismil gendarmerie command in August 1994 and who had not been allowed to see his relatives since, and about the legal steps taken in his case.", "112.

Sergeant Y\u00fccel appended to his letter an undated report, signed by the gendarmerie officers Mustafa Candal and \u00d6zay Yalbul, and the Ambar muhtar, Mehmet \u0130hsan Tuncay, stating that Harun Acar had left no address when he was released from Diyarbak\u0131r E-type Prison but that he could be found by asking the Derik or Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 gendarmerie command. This information was transmitted to the Bismil public prosecutor on 10 October 1995.", "116. On 12 October 1995 the Ministry of Justice requested the Bismil public prosecutor to provide information about the steps taken in the investigation into the disappearance of Mehmet Salih Acar, which formed the subject matter of a complaint filed by the applicant with the European Commission of Human Rights, in which he alleged that his brother had been taken into custody in Bismil on 20 August 1994 and that he was being tortured. The Bismil public prosecutor was asked in particular to inform the Ministry if an investigation into the matter had been opened and, if so, whether it had been opened automatically or in response to a request in respect of Mehmet Salih Acar.", "117. On 16 October 1995 the Bismil public prosecutor sent a reminder to the Bismil gendarmerie command of his instruction of 18 September 1995. On the same day he instructed the Bismil gendarmerie command to ensure that Halise Acar and all gendarmes who had served at the Bismil gendarmerie command at the material time and who were named \u201cAhmet\u201d reported to his office in order to make statements.

On the same day the Bismil public prosecutor informed the Ministry of Justice that an investigation into the disappearance of Mehmet Salih Acar had been opened, in which statements had been taken from the complainants Halise and H\u00fcsna Acar and from the witnesses \u0130hsan Acar and \u0130lhan Ezer, and that steps had been taken to obtain a statement from Captain \u0130zzettin, NCO Ahmet and Harun A\u00e7a, and an additional statement from Halise Acar. He further informed the Ministry that, as it was possible that Mehmet Salih Acar had been kidnapped, letters had been written to the central police and gendarmerie authorities requesting that Mehmet Salih Acar be found.", "119. On 20 October 1995 the Bismil public prosecutor requested the public prosecutors in Derik and Maz\u0131da\u011f\u0131 to summon and take a statement from Harun A\u00e7a in relation to the disappearance of Mehmet Salih Acar.", "120.

In a statement of the same day to the Bismil public prosecutor, Ahmet Uyar declared, in his capacity as a person suspected of an offence, that he had no information about the incident and that he had not witnessed it. He had taken up his duties at the Bismil district gendarmerie eight days before the incident took place. The person who had served before him was Sergeant Ahmet Korkmaz, who had been killed by the PKK. Ahmet Babayi\u011fit had also served before him, but had had a road accident and was currently on sick leave. Ahmet Uyar denied having been involved in the incident and stated that he did not know the person mentioned by the public prosecutor.", "122.

On 23 November 1995 Harun Aca made a statement at the Bismil gendarmerie central command, in which he declared that he had left Ambar in 1988. He had later joined the PKK until he had surrendered himself voluntarily on 4 April 1994 to the Derik gendarmerie district command. Owing to his participation in military anti-terrorist operations as a guide, it was impossible for him to return to Ambar. He had only done so on very rare occasions and for reasons of security had then always stayed on the premises of the Bismil gendarmerie district command. His parents, his spouse and family lived in Ambar. They did not have a hostile relationship with the other families living there, but owing to his personal position his family had become a PKK target. He confirmed that Mehmet Salim Acar and his family also lived in Ambar, but he had not seen them since 1988 and no longer had any contact with them. For security reasons, he would only enter and leave Ambar during the day and in secret, and was particularly careful not to be seen by anyone. He denied having given any information about Mehmet Salih Acar to gendarmerie captain \u0130zzet Cural or to NCO Ahmet, as he had had no mission to Bismil and did not know what was going on there. The PKK had incurred many losses in the provinces of Mardin and \u015e\u0131rnak on the basis of information provided by him and he was convinced that the PKK had organised the abduction as a result of those losses. He further denied having apprehended anyone with the assistance of gendarmes serving in the Bismil district. In any event, he had no such powers. His function was limited to giving information to the security forces, which he could not provide in respect of the Bismil district or even the Diyarbak\u0131r province as he did not have any.", "125. Also on 23 November 1995 Harun Aca, in his capacity as a person suspected of an offence, made a similar statement to the Bismil public prosecutor. In addition, Harun Aca declared that he had a document proving that he had participated in an operation conducted in the Kelmehmet mountains near Mardin between 19 July and 6 September 1994, and submitted, inter alia, a letter of commendation from the command of the Mardin gendarmerie commando battalion at K\u0131z\u0131ltepe certifying that he had participated in an operation conducted between 19 July and 20 August 1994 in the \u015e\u0131rnak and Mount Cudi area. He again denied that he had provided any information to Captain \u0130zzet or NCO Ahmet and maintained that he knew nothing about the disappearance of Mehmet Salim Acar, whom he had not seen since 1988.", "126. On 30 November 1995 the Bismil public prosecutor requested the Ankara Chief Public Prosecutor to summon and take a statement from Captain \u0130zzet Cural in relation to the applicant's claim that his brother Mehmet Salih Acar had been abducted in August 1994 by Captain \u0130zzettin and NCO Ahmet of the Bismil gendarmerie on the basis of information provided by Harun A\u00e7a.", "127. On 19 December 1995 the Bismil public prosecutor requested the Bismil gendarmerie command to provide him with the current address of Sergeant Ahmet Babayi\u011fit for the purposes of obtaining a statement from him.

On 27 December 1995 Captain \u0130zzet Cural, in his capacity as a person suspected of an offence, made a statement to the Ankara public prosecutor Osman A\u015frafo\u011flu in which he declared that, in response to a report that Mehmet Salih Acar had been abducted, an investigation by the gendarmerie had been carried out which had not resulted in finding the abducted person or in identifying the perpetrators. He further stated that he did not know where Mehmet Salih Acar currently was.", "129. On 8 January 1996 the Bismil public prosecutor took a further statement from Halise Acar, who maintained the account contained in her previous statement and complaint. She added that, three days before his disappearance, her husband had had a quarrel with Mehmet A\u00e7a about a water pump. Mehmet A\u00e7a was the brother of Harun A\u00e7a, a former PKK member who had later joined the security forces, for whom he was still working. That is why she believed that her husband had been taken away by the security forces acting on instructions given by Harun A\u00e7a.", "130. On 9 January 1996 the Bismil public prosecutor requested the Ankara Chief Public Prosecutor to summon and take a statement from Ahmet Babayi\u011fit in relation to the applicant's claim that his brother Mehmet Salih Acar had been abducted in August 1994 by Captain \u0130zzettin and NCO Ahmet of the Bismil gendarmerie on the basis of information provided by Harun A\u00e7a.", "131.

Captain Odaba\u015f further informed the Bismil public prosecutor that the expert gendarmerie sergeant Ahmet Uyar had been ordered to report to the public prosecutor's office as he was present, that the expert sergeant Ahmet Babayi\u011fit was currently on sick leave and that Ahmet Korkmaz had been killed on 31 October 1994 in an armed clash in Bismil.", "132. On 5 February 1996, at the request of the Bismil public prosecutor, Ahmet Babayi\u011fit made a statement at Dikmen police station to the police constable Mehmet Cabbar. He declared that he knew nothing about the alleged abduction of Mehmet Salih Acar by Captain \u0130zzettin and NCO Ahmet of the Bismil gendarmerie apparently acting on instructions given by Harun A\u00e7a. He did not remember any incident of that nature. He further stated that he did not at present remember the persons named Captain \u0130zzettin and NCO Ahmet.", "133. In a certified document, dated 25 February 1996 and signed by the Mardin gendarmerie commando battalion commander Major Hur\u015fit \u0130mren, it is stated that Harun A\u00e7a, who had been serving as a village guard under the orders of the Derik gendarmerie district command since 27 May 1994, had participated in operations carried out from 19 July to 6 September 1994 by the Mardin gendarmerie commando battalion command in the \u015e\u0131rnak province and the Kelmehmet mountains.", "134. In the Bismil public prosecutor's decision of non-jurisdiction of 17 June 1996, the stated offence is abuse of authority. Mehmet Salih Acar is mentioned as the victim of this offence, H\u00fcsna and Halise Acar and the applicant as the complainants, and the gendarmes \u0130zzet Cural and Ahmet Babayi\u011fit and the village guard Harun A\u00e7a as the accused. Since, at the material time, \u0130zzet Cural and Ahmet Babayi\u011fit were serving at the Bismil gendarmerie and Harun A\u00e7a was working with the gendarmerie, the Bismil public prosecutor held that he was not competent to deal with the matter and that, pursuant to section 15(3) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713 of 12 April 1991), the case was to be determined by the Diyarbak\u0131r Provincial Administrative Council.", "135. On 26 June 1996 the Diyarbak\u0131r Provincial Administrative Council transmitted the decision of non-jurisdiction of 17 June 1996 and the relevant case file on the preliminary investigation carried out by the Bismil public prosecutor to the Diyarbak\u0131r provincial gendarmerie command, requesting it to examine the facts on which this decision was based, to conduct \u2013 if necessary \u2013 an investigation and to communicate the results thereof.", "136. On 24 September 1996, in connection with the applicant's petition of 27 July 1995 (see paragraphs 90 and 111 above), Captain \u0130rfan Odaba\u015f took a statement from Harun A\u00e7a who declared that between 19 July and 6 September 1994 he had participated in the security forces' operations in the provinces of \u015e\u0131rnak and Mardin. He denied the accusation against him, stating that he had nothing to do with the matter and that he had no information about it. He added that, since he had taken up his duties with the gendarmerie, he had only been able to go on leave when given permission to do so and that his leave record could be checked at his duty station.", "137. On 9 December 1996, in connection with the applicant's petition of 27 July 1995, \u0130rfan Odaba\u015f took statements from \u0130lhan Ezer, \u0130hsan Acar, H\u00fcsna Acar and Halise Acar.", "138. \u0130lhan Ezer made the following statement:", "\u201cOn the day of the incident I was eating lunch in the field below Ambar with Mehmet Salih Acar, who has been abducted. A grey Renault TX-model car without licence plates with two people in it drove towards us. They asked for our identity cards. After looking at them, they returned my card, but did not return that of my friend Mehmet Salih Acar. They told us to get into the car. I said that I definitely would not get into a car belonging to people I did not know. Mehmet Salih Acar got into the car without making any objection. The men said: 'Mehmet Salih will show us a field. We will bring him back', and they drove off towards Ambar. I then asked Mehmet Salih's son whether he knew the men. He said 'No', so I told him to go to the village and tell the people that strangers had taken his father away. The child went to the village. I know Captain \u0130zzet and NCO Ahmet very well. If I saw them in the village, I would recognise them. The men who came were definitely not them. If they had been, I would have recognised them. I had not seen the men who abducted Mehmet Salih Acar before and did not recognise them. One was about 25 to 26 years old and the other 18 to 20. Both were wearing hats and the older one was wearing glasses and had a moustache.\u201d", "139. \u0130hsan Acar's statement to \u0130rfan Odaba\u015f reads:", "\u201cOn the day of the incident I was working with my father in the field we leased. Our neighbour \u0130lhan Gezer was working alongside us on his own land. We had gone under a tree in our field to eat our lunch, but there was a distance of about ten metres between my father and myself. Then a grey Renault without licence plates with two people in it came towards us. It stopped by my father. \u0130lhan Gezer also came over. They began to talk to the two of them. I was watching because I was further away. They asked my father and Uncle \u0130lhan for their identity cards. They then returned \u0130lhan Gezer's card. The conversation between them was in Turkish. Then, they took my father towards Ambar. There was no argument or struggle when they took him away. The men who came had a Kalashnikov rifle. They wore hats and the older one had a moustache. Then \u0130lhan Gezer asked me if I knew them. After answering that I did not know them, I ran to inform the village. Since that day we have not heard anything from my father.\u201d", "140. H\u00fcsna Acar made the following statement:", "\u201cMehmet Salim Acar is my son. He has been missing since the date of the incident. I have no direct knowledge of the disappearance of my son Mehmet Salim Acar. I only know what my grandson \u0130hsan Acar told me when we came to the village on the day of the incident. I do not know anything more than this. I do not know who abducted my son Mehmet Salim Acar or for what reason. I do not think that the gendarmerie took my son. The only thing that I want from my State is for my son to be found dead or alive and to be handed over to me. Apart from this, I have no complaint against Captain \u0130zzet or Expert Sergeant Ahmet. I do not know these people and I have no feelings of animosity towards them. Because my son is not a terrorist, we had not had any dealings with the gendarmerie until then. I want those who abducted my son to be found and punished. Apart from that, I do not wish to complain about anyone.\u201d", "141. Halise Acar made the following statement to \u0130rfan Odaba\u015f:", "\u201cMehmet Salim Acar, who has gone missing, is my husband. On the day of the incident he had gone to work in the field with my son \u0130hsan Acar.

I did not see the abduction of my husband Mehmet Salim Acar myself. I do not know who took my husband or why. We have been unable to get any news from him. All I want from the State is that they find my husband dead or alive and hand him over to me. I am making a formal complaint against those who abducted my husband. But I have no complaint against Captain \u0130zzet or Expert Sergeant Ahmet as I do not believe that they abducted my husband. At the moment I am living with my mother-in-law and her daughter at [address].

On 10 December 1996 the applicant wrote a letter to the President of the Diyarbak\u0131r Provincial Administrative Council, claiming that his brother Mehmet Salim Acar had been taken into detention by Captain \u0130zzet Cural and Sergeant Ahmet Korkmaz on the basis of incorrect information provided by Harun Aca. The applicant further stated that an officer of the anti-terrorism branch of the Diyarbak\u0131r police had investigated the case in July 1995 and that the Bismil gendarmerie had admitted that his brother was being held by them. However, Captain \u0130zzet Cural had later told this police officer that the person who was detained was not Mehmet Salim Acar but someone called Mahmut Acar, from Nusaybin. The applicant also described a telephone conversation he had had on 22 September 1995 with Captain \u0130rfan Odaba\u015f, who had replaced Captain \u0130zzet as commander of the Bismil gendarmerie and who had asked the applicant whether a ransom had been demanded. The applicant had told Captain Odaba\u015f that no such demand had been made, but that he would be willing to pay a ransom. On 27 September 1995 the applicant's family had been contacted by someone demanding a ransom in exchange for his brother's release. On 5 October 1996 another person \u2013 identified by the applicant as Nam\u0131k Keser, from Diyarbak\u0131r \u2013 contacted the family and said that Mehmet Salim Acar was being held by the Diyarbak\u0131r gendarmerie and would be released if the applicant agreed to work as an informer for the authorities, which the applicant refused to do.", "143. On 25 December 1996 \u0130rfan Odaba\u015f took a statement from Ahmet Babayi\u011fit, who declared that he had not seen the abduction of Mehmet Salim Acar and that he knew nothing about it.", "144. On 1 January 1997 \u0130rfan Odaba\u015f took a statement from Captain \u0130zzet Cural, who declared:", "\u201cWe received a report that Mehmet Salim Acar from Ambar, which lies within our command's jurisdiction, had been abducted by unidentified persons. I was at the unit centre when the report was received. I immediately gave the necessary information to the authorities concerned. We started to conduct the necessary searches at the entrances to and the exits from Bismil and Ambar, but we could not find the men in question. I do not know who abducted Mehmet Salim Acar or for what purpose. In spite of all our searches, we were unable to find the perpetrators or the victim. As a result of our search and investigation in and around the village, we established that he had been abducted by two persons, but we were unable to establish their identities. We definitely did not apprehend or detain this man, as alleged. It has still not been possible to obtain any information about the abduction of Mehmet Salim Acar.\u201d", "145. \u0130rfan Odaba\u015f submitted the report on his investigation to the Diyarbak\u0131r Provincial Administrative Council on 15 January 1997. The report names Tahsin Acar as the complainant, \u0130zzet Cural, Ahmet Babayi\u011fit and Harun Aca as the persons accused of the offence of abuse of authority, and \u0130lhan Ezer, Halise Acar, \u0130hsan Acar and H\u00fcsna Acar as witnesses. The report contains, inter alia, a summary of the statements taken from the accused and the witnesses, and Captain Odaba\u015f's advisory opinion that the applicant's claims remained unsubstantiated and found no support in the statements obtained, which indicated that the accused had not been involved. He therefore concluded that there was no need to open a judicial or administrative inquiry and that a decision not to prosecute would be appropriate.", "146. In its unanimous decision of 23 January 1997, in which H\u00fcsna Acar is named as the complainant, and Captain \u0130zzet Cural, NCO Ahmet Babayi\u011fit and Harun Aca as defendants, the Diyarbak\u0131r Provincial Administrative Council found that the accusation of abuse of authority allegedly committed by former Bismil gendarmerie district commander Captain \u0130zzet Cural, NCO Ahmet Babayi\u011fit and temporary village guard Harun Aca by having abducted Mehmet Salih Acar in August 1994 was not supported by evidence against the defendants that could be regarded as sufficient for instituting proceedings against them. It therefore decided to reject the request to take proceedings, in accordance with section 5 of the Law on the prosecution of civil servants and Article 164 of the Turkish Code of Criminal Procedure.", "147. In its unanimous decision of 14 January 2000, following ex officio appeal proceedings, the Second Division of the Supreme Administrative Court held that the evidence available was insufficient to send the defendants for trial and thus upheld the decision of 23 January 1997 by the Diyarbak\u0131r Provincial Administrative Council.", "148. On 24 August 1995 Minister Algan Hacalo\u011flu informed the applicant that his petition of 26 July 1995 (see paragraph 89 above) had been transmitted to the Diyarbak\u0131r Provincial Governor.", "149.

Tahsin Acar is my paternal uncle. Mehmet Salim Acar is my father. Last summer we were irrigating the cotton field. I, my father and \u0130lhan Ezer from the village of \u00dc\u00e7tepe decided to take a break for lunch in the shade of a tree. A car approached us. It was a dark grey or grey Renault car without licence plates. It stopped near to us. Two men got out of the car. One was short and wearing a hat. The other one was young, tall and wearing a hat and glasses. They asked my father and \u0130lhan from \u00dc\u00e7tepe to show their identity cards. They refused, saying: 'We will not show you our identity cards because we do not know who you are.' The two men replied that they were from the police. So my father and \u0130lhan showed them their identity cards. The two men looked at the cards and gave \u0130lhan his card back. They did not give my father his card back. They spoke to us in Turkish. They said to my father: 'Get into the car with us, you will show us a field.' They made my father get into the car by force. They told me: 'We will bring your father back in half an hour.' They left and did not come back. I ran home to warn my mother and I told her what had happened. My mother left in order to tell the muhtar about what had happened. ... I had never seen those men before. I have never seen them in the area. They do not resemble any person living in my village. Moreover, they never got out of the taxi. It was my father and \u0130lhan who approached the car in order to talk to them. They were not military or gendarmes. They both had moustaches. They had weapons under the seats of the car. Afterwards, we went to the Bismil tribunal and made statements. A search for my father was begun, but, to date, it has not led to any news from him.\u201d", "151. \u0130lhan Ezer declared:", "\u201cI live in the village of \u00dc\u00e7tepe. I do not share any property with Mehmet Salim Acar, but we have a cotton field in the village of Ambar. We planted cotton in the same place as him. I do not know his brother Tahsin Acar. I only heard his name in connection with the letter in question. This is what I can tell you about the events. In August last year I was irrigating the cotton we had planted. I went in the shade of a tree to have lunch. I noticed a dark grey-coloured taxi coming from the direction of Ambar. The vehicle had no licence plates. It stopped near to us. I was with Mehmet Salim Acar and his son. We were asked to show our identity cards. We refused, as we did not know these two men. A discussion took place between us and the two men, but we still did not show our identity cards. They said they were policemen. So we asked them to show us their police identity papers. They did not do so. They took our identity cards and told us that they would give them back. They looked at them and asked us to get into the car. We did not get into the car. They forced us, but I continued to refuse to get in. I noticed that at that moment Mehmet Salim Acar kept silent, he did not speak. They returned my identity card to me and the card of Mehmet Salim Acar. Subsequently, Mehmet got into the car. They told me: 'Your friend will accompany us to a field and then he will come back.' He left and did not return. I had never seen those two men before. They were dressed in civilian clothes. I did not know them. They were both wearing hats. I had never seen them before in the area. ... The two men were not officers of the Bismil gendarmerie district command. As I have already pointed out, I had never seen them before. Nor had Mehmet Salim Acar; he did not behave as if he knew them.\u201d", "152. Halise Acar stated that on the day in question her husband Mehmet Salim Acar and their son \u0130hsan had left in the morning to work in a field close to the neighbouring village of Sar\u0131toprak. Around noon, her son had come running home, telling her that his father had been taken away in a car without licence plates. He also told her that there had been two men in the car. Halise Acar further stated that this Renault taxi had already been seen several times in the village. Her daughter had told her that she had seen her father in that car on the Dicle river bank and that she had thought that he was going somewhere. Halise Acar lastly stated that her family had alerted all the administrative authorities and the Bismil gendarmerie that her husband had disappeared, that they had made statements about the matter to the Bismil public prosecutor and that her husband had been searched for but without any results to date.", "153. H\u00fcsna Acar declared that she was the mother of Mehmet Salim Acar, that she was living with his family and that, in August 1994, her son had left in the morning to irrigate the cotton field. Her grandson, who had accompanied Mehmet Salim, had come running home around noon, saying that a car had stopped close to his father, that he had been told that they were going to look at a field and that they would return, that he had waited for an hour and that nobody had come back. H\u00fcsna Acar further stated that nothing had been heard from her son since, that the Bismil gendarmerie had been informed and that the Bismil public prosecutor had summoned and questioned her and her relatives.", "154. On 3 October 1995 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, acting on the Commission's decision of 4 September 1995 (see paragraph 4 above), requested the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of the Interior to gather and transmit information about the case of Mehmet Acar who, according to his brother Tahsin Acar, had been forcibly taken away by plain-clothes police officers and placed in detention. The respective ministries were requested to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs whether Mehmet Acar had been taken into detention, whether any proceedings had been taken against him and, if not, whether there were indications that he had been abducted by or joined the PKK.", "155. By a letter of 22 November 1995, the Diyarbak\u0131r Provincial Governor, Mehmet Do\u011fan Hat\u0131po\u011flu, informed the Ministry of the Interior that an investigation into the facts alleged by the applicant had been carried out. The conclusions of this investigation were that Mehmet Selim Acar had not been apprehended by Captain \u0130zzet Cural and NCO Ahmet Korkmaz (deceased in the meantime) or by Hasan Acar. No mention of a taking into custody of Mehmet Selim Acar had been found in the custody records of the Bismil gendarmerie district command. The victim had been abducted by two unknown persons claiming to be policemen in a dark grey-coloured taxi without licence plates. The subsequent investigation of these leads had not led to any results. The matter had been raised before the judicial authorities and the Bismil public prosecutor had conducted the necessary investigations. The two eyewitnesses to the incident, \u0130hsan Acar (Mehmet Selim Acar's son) and \u0130lhan Ezer had made statements in which they had declared that they did not know the identities of the persons who had abducted Mehmet Selim Acar, that they knew gendarmerie captain \u0130zzet Cural as well as the other officers of the gendarmerie, and that the two men who had abducted Mehmet Selim Acar were certainly not gendarmes. The Governor finally stated that Tahsin Acar's other allegations concerning the detention of his brother at the Bismil gendarmerie command thus remained wholly unfounded.", "156. In a letter dated \u201cNovember 1995\u201d, the Diyarbak\u0131r gendarmerie regional commander, referring to a letter of the General Gendarmerie Command of 7 November 1995 and a letter of the provincial gendarmerie command of 24 November 1995, informed the applicant \u2013 in reply to a complaint filed by H\u00fcsna Acar and/or the applicant to the General Gendarmerie Command (see paragraph 92 above) \u2013 that, according to the results of an investigation that had been carried out, Mehmet Selim Acar had not been apprehended by gendarmes but had been abducted in a car without licence plates by two unknown persons claiming to be plain-clothes policemen.", "157. Appended to this letter were statements taken from \u0130hsan Acar and \u0130lhan Ezer, who had seen the incident, including a certified statement made by \u0130lhan Ezer on 25 October 1995 to the Bismil notary public. This statement reads:", "\u201cWhile we were working in the cotton field situated within the boundaries of the village of Ambar in the district of Bismil, province of Diyarbak\u0131r, we took shelter in the shade of a tree in order to take a rest. A taxi arrived from the direction of Ambar. It was a Renault TX-model car without licence plates. Mehmet Salim Acar, his son \u0130hsan Acar and I were sitting in the shade. We were asked to show our identity cards. We refused. The men then announced that they were policemen and took our identity cards. After looking at them, they gave them back. They asked us to get into the car. \u0130hsan Acar and I were not willing to get into the car. Mehmet Salih Acar got into the car without objecting. They told us: 'Your friend is going to accompany us to a field and he will return later.' We have not had any news from our friend since then. I had never seen the men who arrived in the car before, I do not know them. It is being said that they were gendarmerie captain \u0130zzet Cural and NCO Ahmet, of the central gendarmerie. I know these two men personally; they are not the ones who abducted my friend.\u201d", "158. On 18 December 1995, in reply to the petition filed by H\u00fcsna Acar and/or the applicant (see paragraph 92 above), the President of the Investigation Commission for Human Rights of the Turkish Grand National Assembly informed the applicant that the petition registered under no. 4467/2872 had been examined. The Governor of Diyarbak\u0131r had conducted an investigation into the matter, in the course of which statements had been taken from \u0130lhan Ezer and \u0130hsan Acar, who had both stated that gendarmerie captain \u0130zzet G\u00fcrlo and NCO Ahmet Korkmaz had not taken Mehmet Salim Acar away but that he had been abducted by two unknown men claiming to be police officers, who had made him get into a car without licence plates. The applicant was further informed that an investigation had been opened by the Bismil public prosecutor and was still ongoing.", "159. In a letter of 14 May 1996 sent by fax, apparently on the basis of the applicant's reply of 20 March 1996 to the observations submitted by the Government to the Commission (see paragraph 4 above), the Ministry of Justice requested the Bismil public prosecutor to examine the various allegations set out in this reply of 20 March 1996.", "160. On the same day the Bismil public prosecutor informed the Ministry of Justice that the investigation into the incident referred to by the applicant had been registered under no. 1994/445 in the preliminary investigation register at the Bismil public prosecutor's office. He further informed the Ministry that, in the course of this investigation, statements had been taken from the complainants Halise and H\u00fcsna Acar, from the witnesses \u0130hsan Acar and \u0130lhan Ezer, and from the accused, Sergeant Ahmet Uyar, former Bismil gendarmerie commander \u0130zzet Cural and Harun A\u00e7a, and that a request for judicial assistance had been sent to the Ankara Chief Public Prosecutor for the purposes of obtaining a statement from Ahmet Babayi\u011fit. The Bismil public prosecutor lastly stated that, upon receipt of Ahmet Babayi\u011fit's statement, he would issue a decision.", "161. On 21 August 1996 the Ministry of the Interior transmitted H\u00fcsna Acar's petition of 5 August 1996 (see paragraph 95 above) to the Diyarbak\u0131r police headquarters, requesting the latter to investigate the allegations set out in the petition, to institute the required proceedings and to communicate the results of the investigation to the Ministry of the Interior and to H\u00fcsna Acar.", "162. On 29 August 1996, referring to an order of 21 August 1996, the Diyarbak\u0131r police headquarters informed the Bismil District Governor that H\u00fcsna Acar's daughter Meliha Dal was living in Diyarbak\u0131r and transmitted a statement that had been taken from her on 29 August 1996 in connection with the petition filed with the Ministry of the Interior on 5 August 1996 by H\u00fcsna Acar.", "163. In her statement Meliha Dal declared that she had lived in Diyarbak\u0131r for seven years. She stated that Mehmet A\u00e7an, who \u2013 like her older brother Mehmet Salim Acar \u2013 was living in Ambar, had had a quarrel with her brother in the caf\u00e9 about a water pump in the course of which Mehmet A\u00e7an had threatened her brother with \u201cdisappearance\u201d within three days. Three days later the Bismil gendarmerie station commander, Captain \u0130zzettin, and another person had come to the village in a car without licence plates and asked for Mehmet Salim Acar. He was told that Mehmet Salim was in the cotton field. Captain \u0130zzettin had then gone to the cotton field, where her brother was with his son \u0130hsan Acar and a man called \u0130lhan. Captain \u0130zzettin asked Mehmet Salim Acar to show him the way to a place, made Mehmet Salim get into the car and left. Nothing had been heard from Mehmet Salim since. According to Meliha Dal, Captain \u0130zzettin had handed Mehmet Salim Acar over to the brothers Mehmet and Harun A\u00e7an in return for money. Her mother H\u00fcsna and her sister-in-law Halise knew this but, as Captain \u0130zzettin was involved and as he was a State official, they could not tell the truth as they were frightened of being killed as well. Meliha Dal had heard from them what she was now stating.", "164. By a letter of 25 December 1996, sent in reply to H\u00fcsna Acar's petition of 11 December 1996 (see paragraph 99 above), the Office of the President of Turkey informed H\u00fcsna Acar that an instruction had been issued to the Batman Provincial Governor to investigate her claim and to inform the Office of the President of the result of the investigation. Her petition was transmitted to the Batman Provincial Governor on 27 December 1996.", "On 2 January 1997 the Office of the Prime Minister wrote a letter with a similar content to H\u00fcsna Acar in respect of another petition she had sent on 11 December 1996.", "165. On 17 January 1997 the office of the Governor of Diyarbak\u0131r informed Meliha Dal, in reply to her petition of 25 November 1996 (see paragraph 97 above), that an investigation had been conducted. According to the findings of this investigation, Mehmet Selim Acar had been abducted from his field in July 1994 by two unknown armed persons. The gendarmerie district command had been informed about the matter and had carried out an investigation. According to statements obtained from witnesses, the two perpetrators were unknown in the region. The witnesses further specified that they personally knew Captain \u0130zzet Cural, NCO Ahmet Korkmaz and Harun Aca and that these three men were definitely not among the perpetrators. When the Bismil gendarmerie command had been informed of the abduction, it was Captain \u0130zzet Cural himself who had given the necessary instructions, and the investigation conducted by the Bismil public prosecutor was currently ongoing.", "166. On 16 February 2000 Meliha Dal informed the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor that she had seen her brother Mehmet Salih Acar on an NTV news broadcast on 3 February 2000. Her brother's name and surname had been mentioned in this broadcast. It was reported that her brother and two others had been apprehended in Diyarbak\u0131r and taken into detention in Mu\u015f. She requested the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor to investigate the matter and to inform her whether her brother was alive or dead. She sent an identical petition to the Governor of Diyarbak\u0131r on 18 February 2000.", "167. On 24 March 2000 the applicant submitted a petition to the President of Turkey in relation to the disappearance of his brother Mehmet Salim Acar. In this petition, the applicant stated that, in the NTV news broadcast on 3 February 2000 around 11 p.m., it had been reported that three persons had been apprehended and taken into detention in Mu\u015f and that one of them was called Mehmet Salih Acar. His family had then applied to the Bismil police, the Bismil public prosecutor, the Governor of Diyarbak\u0131r, the public prosecutor at the Diyarbak\u0131r National Security Court, the Diyarbak\u0131r anti-terrorism police authorities and the Diyarbak\u0131r provincial gendarmerie authorities. They were told by the anti-terrorism branch that Mehmet Salim Acar did not wish to see them and they were not given any information about his whereabouts or his condition. The applicant requested the President to intervene in order to find out what had happened to his brother.", "168. In a written statement dated 27 March 2000, Meliha Dal declared that she had gone to the Bismil public prosecutor to enquire about her brother Mehmet Salim Acar. She was told that three men by the name of Mehmet Salim Acar had been apprehended but that their particulars (parents' names, date and place of birth) did not match those of her brother. When she left the public prosecutor's office, the latter's clerk, Mehdi, told her that her brother was alive, that he was in the hands of the State and that he had been sent into exile. He further told her that they had scared her brother by threatening to destroy his family and that this was why he was concealing himself from them.", "169. By a letter of 18 April 2000, Meliha Dal informed the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor that two men had been sent to her house and that she had made statements about having seen her brother on television and having heard his name on television during a news broadcast in which it was reported that three men had been apprehended in Mu\u015f. The public prosecutor had, on her behalf, written and sent a petition to Mu\u015f. The public prosecutor had said at the end of their meeting that, as far as he understood, her brother was in the hands of the authorities in Mu\u015f.", "170. By a letter of 19 April 2000, the applicant's representative informed the European Court of Human Rights that Meliha Dal, H\u00fcsna Acar and Halise Acar had been watching the news on NTV on 3 February 2000 around 11 p.m. when the newsreader announced that four men had been apprehended in Diyarbak\u0131r, one of whom was named as Mehmet Selim Acar. Pictures of the apprehended men had been shown and they had recognised Mehmet Selim Acar as one of them. The women had continued to watch television all night and they had seen him again the following day at 8 a.m. The applicant's representative further informed the Court that, on 4 February 2000, the three women had gone to the Bismil public prosecutor to report their sighting on television of Mehmet Selim Acar and that, on 16 February 2000, Meliha Dal had filed a petition about the matter with the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor and, on 18 February 2000, with the Governor of Diyabakir. The family had further attempted to obtain a video recording of the NTV news broadcast of 3 February 2000, but without success. Referring to the applicant's petition of 24 March 2000 to the President of Turkey, the applicant's representative finally informed the Court that, so far, no information had been obtained from the authorities contacted by the applicant about the whereabouts of Mehmet Selim Acar.", "171. Appended to this letter were, inter alia, Meliha Dal's petitions of 16 and 18 February 2000 (see paragraph 166 above), a statement dated 23 March 2000 in which Meliha Dal had declared that she had seen her missing brother on television on 3 February 2000, the applicant's petition of 24 March 2000 (see paragraph 167 above), Meliha Dal's statement of 27 March 2000 (see paragraph 168 above), an undated statement by Meliha Dal in which she declared that she had seen her brother Mehmet Salim Acar on a television news broadcast on 1 February 2000 around 11 p.m. and 2 February 2000 around 8 a.m., an undated statement by Halise Acar stating that she had seen her husband Mehmet Salih Acar on television one day, and an undated statement by H\u00fcsna Acar stating that, quite a long while after his disappearance, she had seen her son Mehmet Salih Acar on television.", "172. On 28 April 2000, having taken note of the letter of 19 April 2000 and the appended documents, the Court requested the Government to submit a copy of the NTV news broadcasts referred to by the applicant's representative, to confirm that Mehmet Salim Acar had in fact been shown and named during these broadcasts, to inform the Court of the circumstances of Mehmet Salim Acar's arrest, and to confirm whether he was currently being detained and, if so, to indicate in which detention facility.", "173. By a letter of 22 May 2000, in response to the Court's request of 28 April 2000, the Diyarbak\u0131r Chief Public Prosecutor informed the Ministry of Justice that a person named Mehmet Selim Acar (son of S\u00fcleyman and Pevruze, born in 1965 in Sivrice) had been detained on 9 December 1996 and was currently serving a prison sentence in Gaziantep, and that a person named Salih Acar (son of Musa and Besnadan, born in 1979 in Batman) had been detained on 19 April 2000 and was currently being held in pre-trial detention in Batman.", "174. On 30 May 2000, in response to the complaint filed by Meliha Dal, the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor decided not to open an investigation. This decision reads:", "\u201cThe complainant stated in her petition that her brother had disappeared six years ago and that nothing had been heard from him since, that she recognised one of the men shown on a news programme in February about persons apprehended during operations conducted against the terrorist organisation Hizbullah, that this man's name was the same as her brother's, and that she wished to be given the opportunity to watch a video recording [of the news broadcast] so that she could identify her brother.", "It has been stated in the Mu\u015f Chief Public Prosecutor's decision of non-jurisdiction dated 2 May 2000 that the person detained in the province of Mu\u015f \u2013 a man called Mehmet Salih Acar, born in 1964 and the son of Yahya and Ay\u015fe \u2013 is not the complainant's brother, and it appears from the above decision of non-jurisdiction and from the register of births that the person detained in Mu\u015f, who was put on trial by the Chief Public Prosecutor of the Van National Security Court, is not the complainant's brother.", "It is therefore concluded, in accordance with Article 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and subject to the right of appeal, that there is no basis for pursuing the matter ...\u201d", "175. On 6 July 2000 the Government informed the Court that the person apprehended and named in the NTV news broadcast was not the applicant's brother and that there were several persons in detention with similar names to the applicant's brother. According to the Government, it was in all probability a case of a confusion of names.", "176. On 13 July 2000 the Court reminded the Government of its still outstanding request of 28 April 2000 to be given the video recording of the NTV news broadcast referred to by the applicant's representative.", "177. In a statement dated 28 September 2000, submitted to the Court on 4 October 2000, Meliha Dal declared that she had seen her brother Mehmet Salim Acar in an NTV news broadcast on 2 February 2000 at 8 p.m. and 3 February 2000 at 8 a.m.", "178. On 18 October 2000 the Court requested the applicant's representative also to submit a video recording of the news broadcast referred to by the applicant's relatives.", "179. By a letter of 24 January 2001, the NTV administration informed the applicant's representative that it could not grant his request. The required footage could only be made available upon a request made by the applicant himself. On the same day the applicant sent by fax a request to the NTV administration to be provided with a video recording of the NTV news programmes broadcast on 2 February 2000 at 11 p.m. and 3 February 2000 at 8 a.m.", "180. In the meantime, on 17 January 2001, the Government had submitted to the Court a video recording containing the NTV news broadcasts of 3 February 2000 at 11 a.m. and 11 p.m.", "181. On 16 February 2001 the applicant sent a reminder of his request of 24 January 2001 to the NTV administration, explaining that the video recording submitted by the Government to the Court did not contain the relevant news broadcasts.", "182. On 20 February 2001 the applicant informed the Court that the video recording submitted by the Government did not contain the relevant news broadcasts, namely, those of 2 February 2000 at 11 p.m. and 3 February 2000 at 8 a.m.", "183.

By a letter of 2 May 2001, in reply to a request made by the Government in April 2001, a lawyer employed by NTV informed the Government that their request to be provided with a copy of the NTV news programmes broadcast on 2 February 2000 at 11 p.m. and 3 February 2000 at 8 a.m. could not be met as it concerned broadcasts of more than one year ago. It was pointed out that, under section 28 of Law no. 3984 and Article 23 of the Regulation on Procedures concerning Radio and Television Programmes, broadcasting organisations were obliged to keep copies of each broadcast programme for one year. The Government informed the Court of this outcome on 13 June 2001.", "186. Since approximately 1985, serious disturbances have raged in south-east Turkey between the security forces and the members of the PKK, a proscribed terrorist organisation under Turkish law. This confrontation has, according to the Government, claimed the lives of thousands of civilians and members of the security forces.", "187. Two principal decrees relating to the south-eastern provinces of Turkey have been issued under the Law on the state of emergency (Law no. 2935 of 25 October 1983) and were in force at the material time. The first, Decree no. 285 (of 10 July 1987), established a regional governorship of the state of emergency in ten of the eleven provinces of south-east Turkey. Under Article 4 (b) and (d) of the decree, all private and public security forces and the gendarmerie Public Peace Command are at the disposal of the regional governor.", "188. The second, Decree no. 430 (of 16 December 1990), reinforced the powers of the regional governor, for example to order transfers out of the region of public officials and employees, including judges and prosecutors, and provided in Article 8:", "\u201cNo criminal, financial or legal responsibility may be claimed against the state of emergency regional governor or a provincial governor within a state of emergency region in respect of their decisions or acts connected with the exercise of the powers entrusted to them by this Decree, and no application shall be made to any judicial authority to this end. This is without prejudice to the rights of individuals to claim indemnity from the State for damage suffered by them without justification.\u201d", "189. Article 125 of the Turkish Constitution provides as follows:", "\u201cAll acts and decisions of the administration are subject to judicial review ...", "The administration shall be liable to indemnify any damage caused by its own acts and measures.\u201d", "190. This provision is not subject to any restrictions even in a state of emergency or war. The latter requirement of the provision does not necessarily require proof of the existence of any fault on the part of the administration, whose liability is of an absolute, objective nature, based on the theory of \u201csocial risk\u201d. Thus, the administration may indemnify people who have suffered damage from acts committed by unknown or terrorist authors when the State may be said to have failed in its duty to maintain public order and safety, or in its duty to safeguard individual life and property.", "191. The Turkish Criminal Code makes it a criminal offence:", "\u2013 to deprive an individual unlawfully of his or her liberty (Article 179 generally, Article 181 in respect of civil servants);", "\u2013 to issue threats (Article 191);", "\u2013 to subject an individual to torture or ill-treatment (Articles 243 and 245);", "\u2013 to commit unintentional homicide (Articles 452 and 459), intentional homicide (Article 448) or murder (Article 450).", "192. For all these offences, complaints may be lodged, under Articles 151 and 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, with the public prosecutor or the local administrative authorities. The public prosecutor and the police have a duty to investigate crimes reported to them, the former deciding whether a prosecution should be initiated, in accordance with Article 148 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. A complainant may appeal against the decision of the public prosecutor not to institute criminal proceedings.", "193. If the alleged perpetrator of a crime was a State official or a civil servant at the material time, permission to prosecute must be obtained from local administrative councils (the executive committee of the provincial assembly). An appeal lies against a local council decision to the Supreme Administrative Court; a refusal to prosecute gives rise to an automatic appeal of this kind. If the suspect is a member of the armed forces, he comes under the jurisdiction of the military courts and is tried in accordance with the provisions of Article 152 of the Military Criminal Code.", "194. Any illegal act by a civil servant, be it a criminal offence or a tort, which causes pecuniary or non-pecuniary damage may be the subject of a claim for compensation in the ordinary civil courts. Under Article 41 of the Code of Obligations, an injured person may file a claim for compensation against an alleged perpetrator who has caused damage in an unlawful manner whether wilfully, negligently or imprudently. Pecuniary loss may be compensated by the civil courts under Article 46 of the Code of Obligations and awards may be made for non-pecuniary damage under Article 47.", "195. Proceedings against the administration may be brought before the administrative courts, whose proceedings are in writing.", "196. In the case of alleged terrorist offences, the public prosecutor is deprived of jurisdiction in favour of a separate system of national security prosecutors and courts established throughout Turkey.", "197. The public prosecutor is also deprived of jurisdiction with regard to offences alleged against members of the security forces in the state of emergency region. Decree no. 285, Article 4 \u00a7 1, provides that all security forces under the command of the regional governor (see paragraph 187 above) shall be subject, in respect of acts performed in the course of their duties, to the Law of 1914 on the prosecution of civil servants.
