The applicant was born on 30 April 1980 and lives in Belgium.", "6. On 29 September 1995 a certain Mr \u00d6zcan Atik was arrested on suspicion of membership of the PKK. The following day the applicant was arrested in Istanbul upon information allegedly given to the police by Mr Atik. According to that information, the applicant was a member of the PKK. Following his arrest the applicant was placed in police custody.", "7. The applicant was questioned by police officers on 5 October 1995. In a written statement prepared by the police and signed by him, the applicant was quoted as having stated that he was a member of the PKK and that he had had a number of meetings with several of its members, including \u00d6zcan Atik. One day \u00d6zcan Atik had told the applicant that he had asked a certain Menderes Ko\u00e7ak to provide financial assistance to the PKK but that Mr Ko\u00e7ak had refused. \u00d6zcan Atik had then asked the applicant to help him set fire to a vehicle owned by Mr Ko\u00e7ak. This they had done one evening with the help of two other persons. The applicant also added that had he not been arrested, he would have taken part in further activities on behalf of the PKK.", "8. On 7 October 1995 Mr Ko\u00e7ak identified Mr Atik and another person as the persons who had asked him to give money to the PKK. He did not know whether it had been the same two persons who had subsequently set fire to his vehicle and shop.", "9. On 9 October 1995 police officers took the applicant and three other persons, including Mr Atik, to the street where Mr Ko\u00e7ak\u2019s vehicle had been set on fire.", "10. On 12 October 1995 the applicant and 21 other persons who had been arrested as part of the same police operation were taken to the Istanbul branch of the Forensic Medicine Institute, where they were examined by a doctor. According to the medical report drawn up the same day, the applicant\u2019s body did not bear any signs of ill-treatment.", "11. The same day the applicant was taken to the Istanbul State Security Court, where he was questioned by a prosecutor and then by a judge who ordered his detention in prison pending the introduction of criminal proceedings against him. In the statement drawn up by the prosecutor the applicant was quoted as having stated that he was a sympathiser but not a member of the PKK. He had set fire to the vehicle together with three other persons. In the statement drawn up by the judge, however, the applicant was quoted as having stated that he had set fire to the vehicle on his own.", "12. When questioned by the police, and subsequently by the prosecutor and the judge, the applicant was not represented by a lawyer.", "13. On 27 November 1995 the prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed an indictment with that court, charging the applicant and fifteen other persons with the offence of carrying out activities for the purpose of bringing about the secession of part of the national territory. According to Article 125 of the Criminal Code in force at the time, the punishment stipulated for this offence was the death penalty (see Relevant Domestic Law and Practice below).", "14. A preparatory hearing was held on 18 December 1995 by the Istanbul State Security Court (hereinafter \u201cthe trial court\u201d). One of the three judges on the bench was an army officer.", "15. At the first hearing, held on 27 February 1996, the applicant was present but not represented by a lawyer.", "16. During the second hearing, held on 1 March 1996, the applicant was still not represented by a lawyer but was questioned by the trial court. The applicant told the trial court that his childhood friend \u00d6zcan Atik had told him one day that he had been selling newspapers and that one of his customers had refused to pay. Mr Atik had then suggested \u201cteaching that customer a lesson\u201d. One night the applicant and Mr Atik had arrived outside a big building. Mr Atik had poured some petrol on the street outside the building from a jerry can and set fire to it. The applicant himself had not set fire to any vehicle and he did not know Menderes Ko\u00e7ak.", "17. The applicant also told the trial court that, while detained in police custody, he had been given electric shocks, sprayed with pressurised water and beaten with a truncheon; the soles of his feet had also been beaten. He had then signed the statements implicating him in the offences with which he was subsequently charged. As regards the statements taken from him by the prosecutor and the judge on 12 October 1995, the applicant stated that the prosecutor and the judge had only asked him his date of birth; he had not made any statements before them. The applicant also denied that the police had taken him to the place where he had allegedly set fire to a vehicle (see paragraph 9 above). The applicant\u2019s request for release was rejected by the trial court the same day.", "18. During the third hearing held on 18 April 1996, a lawyer representing some of the applicant\u2019s co-accused informed the trial court that she would also be representing the applicant. During the same hearing Menderes Ko\u00e7ak also gave evidence as a witness and stated that \u00d6zcan Atik had never asked him to give money to the PKK. A vehicle owned by him had been set on fire but he did not think \u00d6zcan Atik had done it.", "19. The applicant was subjected to a limited visiting regime in the prison and did not have the opportunity to have open visits with his family.", "20. The applicant did not attend four of the subsequent six hearings held at two-monthly intervals. Requests for his release made by his lawyer were all rejected by the trial court. The lawyer argued that there was no evidence against the applicant other than that obtained under ill-treatment.", "21. In the course of the 10th hearing, which was held on 29 May 1997 in the applicant\u2019s absence but with the attendance of his lawyer, the prosecutor asked the trial court to try the applicant for the offences of membership of an illegal organisation and causing damage to property, and not for the offence with which he was charged in the indictment (see paragraph 13 above). The trial court rejected the request for the applicant\u2019s release.", "22. The applicant\u2019s lawyer did not attend the 11th hearing held on 17 July 1997. During the 12th hearing, on 26 August 1997, the lawyer argued that, on account of the testimony given to the trial court by Mr Ko\u00e7ak on 18 April 1996 (see paragraph 18 above), there was no evidence showing that the applicant had committed the offences with which he was charged.", "23. The lawyer did not attend the 13th hearing, held on 2 October 1997, because she had other business before a Labour Court. The applicant made his own defence submissions and repeated his allegations of ill-treatment in police custody. He also asked to be released. This request was rejected by the trial court.", "24. On 17 October 1997 the trial court found the applicant guilty of membership of an illegal organisation and of setting fire to a motor vehicle, and sentenced him to nine years, eight months and ten days\u2019 imprisonment. The trial court considered that the statements given by the applicant in police custody and the statements given by his co-accused showed that the applicant was a member of the illegal organisation and that he had set fire to the vehicle.", "25. The applicant appealed. On 12 March 1998 the Court of Cassation quashed the applicant\u2019s conviction. The case was remitted to the trial court for a retrial.", "26. On 11 September 1998 the trial court held a preparatory hearing in the retrial. One of the three judges on the bench was a military officer.", "27. Eight hearings were held between 27 October 1998 and 30 December 1999. The applicant\u2019s lawyer attended only one of these hearings, that on 18 March 1999, whereas the applicant attended two hearings. During the 5th hearing, held on 15 July 1999, the military judge was replaced by a civilian judge in accordance with the legislation which had entered into force in the meantime (cf. \u00d6calan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, \u00a7\u00a7 2-54, ECHR 2005IV).", "28. On 18 November 1999 a police chief informed the trial court that, contrary to the allegations, no vehicle belonging to Menderes Ko\u00e7ak had been set on fire.", "29. A 9th hearing was held on 21 March 2000. The applicant was present but his lawyer was not. During the hearing Menderes Ko\u00e7ak gave evidence before the trial court and stated that his vehicle had not been burned. No one had asked him to give money to the PKK. When asked by the trial court to explain the inconsistencies between the statement he had made to the police on 7 October 1995 (see paragraph 8 above) and his testimony, Mr Ko\u00e7ak stated that he had not told any such things to the police; he had had to sign whatever was written in the statement drafted by the police officers.", "30. During the same hearing the applicant reiterated that he did not know Mr Ko\u00e7ak and had not set fire to any vehicle. He pointed out that he had been arrested at the age of 15 with no evidence against him, and asked to be released. This request was rejected by the trial court.", "31. The applicant but not his lawyer attended the 10th hearing, held on 23 May 2000.", "32. In the course of the 11th hearing, held on 25 July 2000 in the absence of the applicant\u2019s lawyer, the trial court was presented with a letter drafted by the applicant\u2019s cell-mates. The letter states that \u201c[the applicant] has serious psychiatric problems. His treatment is being overseen by a psychiatric hospital in Istanbul. He is unable to live without the assistance of others and his health is deteriorating. As such, he is unable to attend the hearings and he refused to attend today\u2019s hearing. We felt the need to send you this letter because we have found out that his lawyer has not been attending the hearings\u201d.", "33. According to a medical report prepared by the prison doctor on 24 July 2000 which was appended to the cell-mates\u2019 letter, the applicant had been taken to a psychiatric hospital on 2 June 2000 and returned to the prison on 11 July 2000.", "34. The applicant\u2019s mother also attended this hearing and informed the trial court of the applicant\u2019s serious psychiatric problems. She asked for the applicant to be released from the prison. During the same hearing the prosecutor asked the trial court to acquit the applicant of the charge of arson (Article 516 \u00a7 7 of the Criminal Code) but to convict him of the offence of membership of an illegal organisation (Article 168 of the Criminal Code).", "35. Nevertheless, the trial court ordered the applicant\u2019s continued detention in prison and referred him to a psychiatric hospital with a view to establishing whether he had the necessary criminal capacity (doli capax) at the time of the alleged commission of the offence.", "36. On 7 August 2000 the prison doctor reported on the problems which the applicant had been suffering in prison. According to this report, the applicant had attempted suicide in June 1999 by taking an overdose. In August 1999 he had set himself on fire and suffered extensive and serious burns. He had spent three months in hospital where he was treated for his injuries. During that time in hospital he had also received medication for depression. Following his return to the prison his treatment for the burns had continued for five months. His body still bore burn marks.", "37. On 2 June 2000 the applicant\u2019s psychological health had deteriorated and he was taken to hospital, where he stayed for a month and a half. His health had deteriorated even further following his return from the hospital and he was now refusing to speak to anyone.", "38. The prison doctor concluded in his report that the situation in the prison was not compatible with the applicant\u2019s treatment. The applicant needed to spend a considerable time in a specialised hospital.", "39. During the 12th hearing, held on 10 October 2000, Ms M\u00fckrime Avc\u0131, one of the applicant\u2019s legal representatives named above (see paragraph 2), submitted a power of attorney to the trial court and informed that court that she was taking over the applicant\u2019s representation. Ms Avc\u0131 argued in her written observations submitted to the trial court the same day that the applicant had only been 15 years old at the time of his arrest. Turkey was a Party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Article 40 \u00a7 3 of that Convention recommended that the States Parties establish procedures and institutions specifically for children charged with criminal offences. Indeed, juvenile courts existed in Turkey. However, the applicant had been charged with an offence falling within the jurisdiction of State Security Courts and, as such, the domestic law prevented him from being tried by a juvenile court. Had the applicant been tried before a juvenile court, he would not have been kept in police custody for 12 days, a lawyer would have been appointed to represent him and his case would have been concluded within a short time.", "40. The lawyer added that the ill-treatment to which the applicant had been subjected in police custody, coupled with his long detention in prison, had been too much to bear for a child of his age. He had attempted to take his own life on two occasions. He was still suffering from serious psychiatric problems and he found it difficult to attend the hearings. The lawyer asked for the applicant to be released so that he could receive medical treatment.", "41. The lawyer also informed the trial court that the applicant had not been taken to the hospital despite the court order of 25 July 2000 (see paragraph 35 above). The same day the trial court ordered the applicant\u2019s release from prison on bail.", "42. The applicant attended the 14th hearing, held on 13 March 2001 and informed the trial court that, although he had gone to the hospital for a medical examination, the hospital authorities had refused to examine him as he had no official letter of referral. The trial court issued a new order of referral.", "43. The applicant was examined at a psychiatric hospital on 25 April 2001. According to the report pertaining to that examination, other than the two instances referred to above (see paragraph 36), the applicant had made another attempt to kill himself, by slashing his wrists, in September 1998. The extensive burn marks on his arms and body were still visible. His psychological complaints had started during his detention in prison and had worsened in the course of the time he spent there. Between 2 June 2000 and 11 July 2000 he had been treated in hospital for \u201cmajor depression\u201d. His psychological problems were now in remission. It was concluded in the report that the applicant had not been suffering psychological problems at the time of the commission of the offence and that his current mental state did not affect his criminal responsibility.", "44. In its 16th hearing, held on 22 May 2001, the trial court acquitted the applicant of the arson charge but found him guilty of membership of an illegal organisation and sentenced him to eight years and four months\u2019 imprisonment. The trial court stated that the statements made by the applicant in police custody, and then before the prosecutor and the judge at the end of his police custody, had been decisive in reaching the conclusion that he was a member of the illegal organisation. In those statements the applicant had described the \u201cvarious activities\u201d in which he had been involved. The trial court also concluded that the applicant had been involved in the printing and distribution of illegal leaflets.", "45. The applicant appealed. On 13 March 2002 the prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his written observations to that court and asked for the applicant\u2019s conviction to be upheld. These observations were not communicated to the applicant or to his lawyer.", "46. In her detailed appeal submissions the applicant\u2019s lawyer pointed out that the only evidence put forward by the prosecution in support of the allegation that her client was a member of the illegal organisation had been the allegation concerning the burning of a vehicle. As established by the trial court, however, no such incident had occurred and the owner of the vehicle had made no such complaint. There was no place in the Turkish legal system for abstract concepts such as \u201cvarious activities\u201d (see paragraph 44 above). For any activity to be relied on in evidence, it should have been set out clearly and supported with adequate evidence. Furthermore, the trial court\u2019s judgment was silent as to why and how it was concluded that the applicant had been involved in the printing and distribution of the illegal organisation\u2019s leaflets. The lawyer also reiterated her arguments concerning the applicant\u2019s age and her references to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (see paragraph 39 above).", "47. On 20 May 2002 the Court of Cassation upheld the applicant\u2019s conviction.", "48. According to the information provided to the Court by the applicant\u2019s lawyer, in 2002 the applicant left Turkey for Belgium, where he was subsequently granted refugee status.", "49. Article 125 of the Criminal Code as it stood at the material time provided that:", "\u201cAnyone committing an act designed to subject the State or a part of the State to the domination of a foreign State, to diminish its independence or to impair its unity, or which is designed to remove from the administration of the State a part of the territory under its control shall be liable to the death penalty.\u201d", "\u201cAny person who, with the intention of committing the offences defined in sections 125, 131, 146, 147, 149 or 156, forms an armed gang or organisation or takes leadership ... or command of such a gang or organisation or assumes some special responsibility within it shall be sentenced to not less than fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment.", "The other members of the gang or organisation shall be sentenced to not less than five and not more than fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment.\u201d", "51. Article 516 of the Criminal Code provided:", "\u201cAny person who destroys, demolishes, spoils or damages property owned by another person shall, upon the complaint of the aggrieved person, be sentenced to not less than one and not more than three years\u2019 imprisonment...\u201d", "According to paragraph 7 of this Article, if the offence in question was carried out using inflammable or explosive material and if the property in question was a motor vehicle, the sentence to be imposed varied between three and seven years.", "52. At the material time Article 30 of Law no. 3842 of 18 November 1992, amending the legislation on criminal procedure, provided that, with regard to offences within the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts, any arrested person had to be brought before a judge within forty-eight hours at the latest, or, in the case of offences committed by more than one person, within fifteen days.", "53. Article 138 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as it stood at the material time stipulated that, from the time of their arrest, persons under the age of 18 should be given the assistance of an officially assigned legal representative without having to ask for it. According to Article 31 of the above-mentioned Law no. 3842, however, Article 138 was not applicable to persons accused of offences within the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts.", "54. According to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Law on the Establishment, Duties and Procedures of Juvenile Courts (Law No. 2253 of 21 November 1979; repealed and replaced by Law No. 5395 of 15 July 2005 on the Protection of the Child), only juvenile courts had the power to try persons under the age of 15. According to the last paragraph of that Article, however, even children under the age of 15 charged with offences falling within the jurisdiction of State Security Courts were to be tried before those courts rather than before juvenile courts.", "55. Article 37 of Law No. 2253 also stipulated that minors could only be detained on remand in prisons specially designed for them. In places where no such prisons existed, minors were to be kept in a part of a normal prison separate from where adults were detained. For the purposes of this Law the term \u201cminor\u201d means persons who were under 15 years of age at the time when the offence was committed.", "56. Article 107 (b) of the Regulations on Prison Administration and Execution of Sentences (dated 5 July 1967) stipulated that detainees under the age of 18 were to be kept separately from other detainees. Under Article 106 of the same Regulations, detainees had the possibility to \u201cinform prison governors, prosecutors and the Ministry of Justice of their complaints and requests\u201d.", "57. Pursuant to the Law on the Protection of the Child, which on 15 July 2005 replaced the above-mentioned Law on the Establishment, Duties and Procedures of Juvenile Courts, persons under the age of 18 can only be tried before juvenile courts. However, if the prosecuting authorities allege that the offence with which the juvenile is charged was committed jointly with adults, the juvenile may be tried before the ordinary criminal courts together with those adults.", "58. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989 (hereafter, \u201cthe UN Convention\u201d), adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 20 November 1989, has binding force under international law on the Contracting States, including all of the member States of the Council of Europe.", "Article 1 of the UN Convention states:", "\u201cFor the purposes of the present Convention, a child means every human being below the age of eighteen years unless, under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier.\u201d", "Article 3(i) states:", "\u201cIn all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.\u201d", "Article 37(a) and (b) provides:", "\u201cStates Parties shall ensure that:", "(a) No child shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without the possibility of release shall be imposed for offences committed by persons below eighteen years of age.", "(b) No child shall be deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily. The arrest, detention or imprisonment of a child shall be in conformity with the law and shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time", "(c) Every child deprived of liberty shall be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the human person, and in a manner which takes into account the needs of persons of his or her age. In particular, every child deprived of liberty shall be separated from adults unless it is considered in the child\u2019s best interest not to do so and shall have the right to maintain contact with his or her family through correspondence and visits, save in exceptional circumstances;", "(d) Every child deprived of his or her liberty shall have the right to prompt access to legal and other appropriate assistance, as well as the right to challenge the legality of the deprivation of his or her liberty before a court or other competent, independent and impartial authority, and to a prompt decision on any such action.\u201d", "Article 40 provides as relevant:", "\u201c1. States Parties recognise the right of every child alleged as, accused of, or recognised as having infringed the penal law to be treated in a manner consistent with the promotion of the child\u2019s sense of dignity and worth, which reinforces the child\u2019s respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of others and which takes into account the child\u2019s age and the desirability of promoting the reintegration and the child\u2019s assuming a constructive role in society.", "2. To this end ... the States Parties shall, in particular, ensure that:", "...", "(b) Every child alleged as or accused of having infringed the penal law has at least the following guarantees:", "...", "(ii) To be informed promptly and directly of the charges against him or her, and, if appropriate, through his or her parents or legal guardians, and to have legal or other appropriate assistance in the preparation and presentation of his or her defence;", "(iii) To have the matter determined without delay by a competent, independent and impartial authority or judicial body in a fair hearing according to law, in the presence of legal or other appropriate assistance and, unless it is considered not to be in the best interest of the child, in particular, taking into account his or her age or situation, his or her parents or legal guardians;", "(iv) Not to be compelled to give testimony or to confess guilt; to examine or have examined adverse witnesses and to obtain the participation and examination of witnesses on his or her behalf under conditions of equality;", "...", "(vii.) To have his or her privacy fully respected at all stages of the proceedings.", "...\u201d", "59. The relevant part of the Concluding Observations of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child: Turkey (09/07/2001(CRC/C/15/Add.152.)) provides as follows:", "\u201c65. ... The fact that detention is not used as a measure of last resort and that cases have been reported of children being held incommunicado for long periods is noted with deep concern. The Committee is also concerned that there are only a small number of juvenile courts and none of them are based in the eastern part of the country. Concern is also expressed at the long periods of pre-trial detention and the poor conditions of imprisonment and at the fact that insufficient education, rehabilitation and reintegration programmes are provided during the detention period.", "66. The Committee recommends that the State party continue reviewing the law and practices regarding the juvenile justice system in order to bring it into full compliance with the Convention, in particular articles 37, 40 and 39, as well as with other relevant international standards in this area, such as the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (the Beijing Rules) and the United Nations Guidelines for the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency (the Riyadh Guidelines), with a view to raising the minimum legal age for criminal responsibility, extending the protection guaranteed by the Juvenile Law Court to all children up to the age of 18 and enforcing this law effectively by establishing juvenile courts in every province. In particular, it reminds the State party that juvenile offenders should be dealt with without delay, in order to avoid periods of incommunicado detention, and that pre-trial detention should be used only as a measure of last resort, should be as short as possible and should be no longer than the period prescribed by law. Alternative measures to pre-trial detention should be used whenever possible.\u201d", "60. The recommendation of the Committee of Ministers to Member States of the Council of Europe on social reactions to juvenile delinquency (no. R (87)20), adopted on 17 September 1987 at the 410th meeting of the Ministers\u2019 Deputies, insofar as relevant, reads as follows:", "\u201cRecommends the governments of member states to review, if necessary, their legislation and practice with a view: ...", "7. to exclude the remand in custody of minors, apart from exceptional cases of very serious offences committed by older minors; in these cases, restricting the length of remand in custody and keeping minors apart from adults; arranging for decisions of this type to be, in principle, ordered after consultation with a welfare department on alternative proposals ...\u201d", "61. Article 17 of the European Social Charter 1961 regulates the right of mothers and children to social and economic protection. In that context, the European Committee of Social Rights noted in its Conclusions XVII-2 (2005, Turkey) that the length of pre-trial detention of young offenders was long and the conditions of imprisonment poor.", "62. In the report pertaining to its visits carried out in Turkey between 5 and 17 October 1997, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cthe CPT\u201d) expressed its serious misgivings \u201cas regards the policy of having juveniles (i.e. 11 to 18 year olds) who are remanded in custody placed in adult prisons\u201d (CPT/Inf(99) 2 EN, publication date: 23 February 1999).", "63. In its report prepared in respect of its visits conducted in Turkey between 16 and 29 March 2004 (CPT/Inf (2005) 18), the CPT stated the following:", "\u201c[i]n the reports on its visits in 1997 and September 2001, the CPT has made clear its serious misgivings concerning the policy of having juveniles who are remanded in custody placed in prisons for adults. A combination of mediocre material conditions and an impoverished regime has all too often created an overall environment which is totally unsuitable for this category of inmate. The facts found in the course of the March 2004 visit have only strengthened those misgivings. Here again, the laudable provisions of the Ministry of Justice circular of 3 November 1997 (\u201cthe physical conditions of the prison sections allocated to juvenile offenders shall be revised and improved to conform with child psychology and enable practising educative programmes, aptitude intensive games and sports activities\u201d) have apparently had little practical impact.\u201d", "64. According to UNICEF, the juvenile justice system is still in its infancy in Turkey in 2008. Judges were learning about child-sensitive detention centres, alternative dispute resolution and due process for children in conflict with the law."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "5", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3", "5-4", "6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
