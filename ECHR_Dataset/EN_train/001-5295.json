He is represented by Mr Hofmann, a lawyer practising in Aachen.", "On 6 June 1985 the applicant was issued with a penal order (Strafbefehl) by the Aachen District Court (Amtsgericht) for having entered the territory of Germany illegally, i.e. without a visa. The applicant was fined 20 day rates in the amount of 5 DM each.", "Upon the applicant\u2019s objection (Einspruch), trial proceedings were instituted before the District Court. In these and the following proceedings, the applicant was represented by his defence counsel, Mr Hofmann. At a hearing before the District Court on 17 January 1986, the applicant's counsel declared that asylum proceedings were pending. The court decided to adjourn the case sine die.", "On 13 February 1987, in the resumed proceedings, the District Court convicted the applicant of having illegally entered the Federal Republic of Germany. The applicant was sentenced to a fine of 20-day rates in the amount of 5 DM each.", "On 13 November 1987 the Cologne Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht), upon the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law (Revision), quashed the judgment of 13 February 1987 and sent the case back for a new trial.", "On 16 November 1992 the District Court acquitted the applicant, who had in the meantime been recognised as a refugee, and imposed the costs of the proceedings on the Treasury.
