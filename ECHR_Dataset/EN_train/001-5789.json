Their non-enforcement gives the interested employees an actionable claim against the State.", "Several former employees of the American forces (about 150 out of 320) have brought civil actions before the ordinary courts seeking the readjustment of their salaries on the basis of decision no. 39/1989. The courts found in their favour (see, for example, decision no. 201/1989 of the First Instance Civil Court of Heraklion, upheld by decision no. 72/1993 of the Crete Court of Appeal).
