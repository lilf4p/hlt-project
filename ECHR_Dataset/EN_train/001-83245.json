The Property Restitution and Compensation Act (Ligji p\u00ebr kthimin dhe kompensimin e pron\u00ebs) has undergone several amendments during the past fourteen years.

Upon ownership being determined they were entitled either to the restitution of the original immovable property or to an award of compensation either in kind (up to a maximum of 10,000 sq. m) or in value if any of the following conditions was met: the alleged property (1) was pasture, meadow, forestry land, or agricultural or non-agricultural land; (2) was not subject to Law no. 7501 of 19 July 1991; (3) was currently State-owned; or (4) had been designated as suitable for construction and was situated within the boundaries of a city.", "Section 16 of the Act provided for the following forms of compensation in respect of property which could not be returned: (a) State bonds, equivalent to the compensation owed, with a first option over shares in State enterprises being privatised by the Government or in other activities carried on through the granting of loans; (b) an equivalent plot of land or a building site near to an urban area, in accordance with the general urban-development regulations; and (c) an equivalent plot of land in a tourist zone, in accordance with the general urban-development regulations.", "The Council of Ministers had power to define detailed rules for determining how such compensation should be provided and the applicable time-limits.", "38. The 1993 Act also instituted the Commission on the Restitution of Properties and Compensation (Komisioni i Kthimit dhe Kompensimit t\u00eb Pronave) as the competent administrative body to deal with former owners\u2019 claims to restitution and compensation. However, it did not provide a time-limit within which a decision could be appealed against, so preventing it from even becoming binding.", "39. The Property Act 2004, which repealed the previous version, provided for two forms of restitution of immovable property, namely the return, under certain circumstances, of the original property and compensation in the event of the authorities being unable to return the original property. Restitution was not limited in size. The Act provided for five forms of compensation: (a) property of the same kind; (b) property of any other kind; (c) shares in State-owned companies; (d) the value of a State-owned property in the course of privatisation, and (e) a sum of money corresponding to the value attributed to the property at the time of the decision (section 11). The Act instituted the State Committee on Property Restitution and Compensation (Komiteti Shteteror per Kthimin dhe Kompensimin e Pronave), composed of five members elected by Parliament. Its role was to decide on the lawfulness of district committees\u2019 decisions on restitution and compensation claims (sections 15 and 17). The Council of Ministers was to establish the rules and the criteria to be applied (sections 13).", "40. Section 19 provided for the enforcement of decisions awarding compensation within the first six months of each financial year. Following its entry into force, anyone entitled to claim restitution or compensation was required to lodge an application with the District Committee by 31 December 2007. The Act granted the Committee a discretion to decide which form of compensation should be granted, but applicants could express their preference in writing. An appeal lay against the District Committee\u2019s decision to the State Committee (section 20) and to the district courts within thirty days of the date of issue of the Committee\u2019s decision.", "41. On 28 April 2005 Parliament enacted legislation setting out the method by which immovable property would be valued for compensation purposes. Its implementation was left to the State Committee on Property Restitution and Compensation, which was to issue the site plans allowing the properties to be valued.", "42. In order to comply with the committee\u2019s awards of pecuniary compensation, section 23 of the 2004 Act provided for the establishment of a ten-year Property Compensation Fund, whose aim was to provide financial support for such awards. The 2004 Act was examined by both the Constitutional and the Supreme Courts.", "On 24 March 2005 the Supreme Court (Joint Colleges) concluded that the Property Act of 2004 had no retroactive effect and that its provisions could therefore not have any impact on property rights recognised by administrative or court decisions dating from before its entry into force.", "43. On 17 July 2006 the Property Act 2004 was amended by the Property Act 2006, which entered into force on 17 August 2006. It provided, inter alia, for the establishment of the Agency for the Restitution of Properties and Compensation, a new body competent to decide restitution and compensation claims (section 15). The new law repealed sections 11 (2), 19 and 20 of the 2004 Act which, inter alia, laid down the procedure for the enforcement of compensation awards.", "44.
