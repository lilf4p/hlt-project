Fyfe", "Between the ages of seven and thirteen (1967-1973), the applicant was subjected to repeated and systematic rape and sexual abuse by her step-father, who lived with the applicant, her mother and brother. The applicant was too frightened to report the matter, but eventually her brother, who was also abused by their step-father, informed the police on 5 December 1996. The step-father was convicted in Aberdeen High Court in March 1997 of rape and lewd and libidinous practices.

On 11 April 1997 the CICA wrote to the applicant explaining that her application had been refused under paragraph 7(b) of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 1996, which expressly excludes the payment of compensation where the criminal injury was received before 1 October 1979 and the victim and assailant were living together at the time as members of the same family.", "The applicant lodged a review against this decision which was refused by the CICA on 16 September 1997.
