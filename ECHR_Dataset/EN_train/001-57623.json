SWITZERLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 10;Not necessary to examine Art. 13", "JUDGES": "C. Russo;N. Valticos", "TEXT": ["10. Groppera Radio AG, a limited company incorporated under Swiss law, has its registered office at Zug (Canton of Zug) and produces radio programmes.", "Mr J\u00fcrg Marquard, Mr Hans-Elias Fr\u00f6hlich and Mr Marcel Caluzzi are all Swiss nationals. Mr Marquard is a publisher and lives at Zug; he runs Groppera Radio AG and is its statutory representative and sole shareholder. Mr Fr\u00f6hlich, who is a journalist and an employee of Groppera Radio AG, lives at Thalwil (Canton of Z\u00fcrich). Mr Caluzzi is likewise employed by the company as a journalist and lives at Cernobbio in Italy but also has a home in Lucerne.", "11. In 1979 an Italian private limited company, Belton s.r.l., built a radio station on the Pizzo Groppera - a 2,948 m peak in Italy, near Campodolcino, six kilometres from the Swiss border - for Groppera Radio\u2019s predecessor, Radio 24 AG (see paragraphs 14-15 below). The station used a 50 kW transmitter and a directional aerial with a gain of about 100 kW, such that the apparent power radiated was of the order of 5,000 kW. Using this transmitter, the most powerful in Europe, the station broadcast to Switzerland over a distance of 200 km to the north-west and thus reached nearly a third of the country\u2019s population, mainly in the Z\u00fcrich area.", "12. From 13 November 1979 to 30 September 1983 the Pizzo Groppera station was managed by Belton s.r.l. but operated by its owner, Radio 24 AG, a company that Mr Roger Schawinski had set up in order to evade the State broadcasting monopoly in Switzerland. The programmes, which were broadcast on VHF and were wholly financed by Swiss advertisers, were intended for listeners between the ages of 15 and 40.", "13. On 7 June 1982 the Federal Council adopted an Ordinance on local radio trials, thereby ending the monopoly of the Swiss Radio Broadcasting Company. Nearly three hundred applications were made for trials of this kind, including one by Radio 24 AG, which wanted to serve the Z\u00fcrich area.", "14. On 20 June 1983 the Federal Council issued thirty-six licences. One of these went to Radio 24 AG, but it was issued on condition that the broadcasts from the Pizzo Groppera should cease after 30 September 1983.", "Mr Schawinski agreed to this but sold the station on the Pizzo Groppera to Mr Marquard.", "15. From 1 October 1983 Groppera Radio AG used the Pizzo Groppera station to broadcast, under the name of Sound Radio, a slightly altered schedule to the Z\u00fcrich area, on the frequency that had been used by Radio 24. These programmes could be received not only by the owners of car radios and other personal sets but also by cable-network companies, which retransmitted them. They consisted of light music, information bulletins, commercials and programmes in which the programme-makers and listeners communicated directly or indirectly with each other by telephone or over the air. Like Radio 24, Sound Radio broadcast only in the Z\u00fcrich dialect.", "16. Swiss local radio stations began broadcasting from 1 November 1983 and attracted a large number of listeners. They came into competition with Sound Radio, mainly because they could finance themselves through advertising, subject to certain conditions. An opinion poll carried out in the Z\u00fcrich area and published on 1 December 1983 showed that Radio 24 reached 60% of listeners and Sound Radio 12%.", "17. On 17 August 1983 the Federal Council issued an Ordinance relating to the Act governing correspondence by telegraph and telephone (\"the 1983 Ordinance\") to replace another of 10 December 1973. It came into force on 1 January 1984 and contained general provisions applicable to the licensing scheme.", "It created a third category of licence for receiving installations - community-antenna installations - which was additional to categories 1 (private receiving) and 2 (public receiving). By Article 78 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Ordinance,", "\"A community-antenna licence shall entitle the holder to:", "(a) operate the local distribution network defined in the licence and rebroadcast by this means radio and television programmes from transmitters which comply with the provisions of the International Telecommunication Convention of 25 October 1973 and the international Radio Regulations and with those of the international conventions and agreements concluded within the International Telecommunication Union;", "...\"", "18. From 1 January 1984 most of the Swiss cable companies ceased to retransmit the programmes put out by Sound Radio.", "Some of them, however, including the community-antenna co-operative of Maur and the surrounding district (Genossenschaft Gemeinschaftsantennenanlage Maur und Umgebung - \"the co-operative\"), continued to broadcast them.", "19. On 21 March 1984 the Z\u00fcrich area telecommunications office of the national Post and Telecommunications Authority (PTT) informed the co-operative that Groppera Radio AG\u2019s broadcasts, since they did not comply with the international rules in force, were unlawful, so that under Article 78 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 of the 1983 Ordinance retransmission was not covered by the community-antenna licence. It added that the co-operative would be committing an offence if it continued to retransmit them, and it required the co-operative to cancel within thirty days all the technical arrangements made for receiving and broadcasting the programmes in question.", "20. On 31 July 1984 this order was confirmed by the national head office of the PTT.", "21. The co-operative and two of its subscribers challenged this decision by bringing an administrative-law appeal in the Federal Court.", "22. On 30 August 1984 the Pizzo Groppera transmitter was damaged by lightning. It ceased broadcasting and has never resumed since, although the applicants claimed that the damage was quickly repaired. Later, in an interview published in the Tages-Anzeiger Magazin on 13 December 1986, Mr Marquard acknowledged that he had made an error of business judgment in acquiring the radio station.", "23. Groppera Radio AG joined the appeal by filing pleadings on 18 September 1984. It claimed that it too was a victim of the provisions of the 1983 Ordinance concerning community-antenna licences, as the restrictions they imposed considerably reduced the number of its listeners, thereby cutting its revenue and jeopardising its financial survival.", "24. On 12 November 1984 the Federal Court informed the parties that it had learned that the Pizzo Groppera transmitter had been destroyed and would apparently not be repaired. As there was no interest in pursuing the proceedings, the court proposed striking out the appeals without taking a decision on the merits (\"die Beschwerde ohne Sachentscheid abzuschreiben\").", "The applicants refused to consent to this.", "25. The Federal Court gave judgment on 14 June 1985, after deliberating in public on the same day.", "It ruled that the appeals were admissible inasmuch as they were directed not against the ban on retransmission itself but against the sanctions imposed by the PTT for disregarding the ban.", "It went on to dismiss the appeals for the following reasons (translated from German):", "\"3. The Court can normally only hear an administrative appeal if the appellant has a live (present or future) interest in taking proceedings. If the interest in taking proceedings has ceased to exist, the case becomes purely academic and must not continue unless special circumstances require a decision on the merits, for example where it would otherwise not be possible to give a binding ruling on matters of principle in time ...", "(a) the Maur community-antenna co-operative and its subscribers have only a contingent interest in taking proceedings, depending on whether Sound Radio is going to resume broadcasting; so long as there are no broadcasts, there is nothing to feed into the cable network. If it is highly unlikely that the broadcasts will be resumed, there is no need to examine the merits of the appeal.", "Groppera Radio AG claimed to have made all the arrangements necessary for restarting its broadcasts in the event of the present appeal\u2019s being held to have a suspensive effect (or of its succeeding). That statement, however, was unsupported by any evidence, although the burden of proof is on the appellant in this regard and Groppera\u2019s submission is open to serious doubt. The company claimed to have ceased its broadcasts - independently of the consequences of the station\u2019s having been struck by lightning - because of the PTT\u2019s ban on retransmission. Other reasons may have weighed more heavily, however. With the arrival of experimental local radio stations and a third frequency for Radio DRS [Direktion Radio und Fernsehen der deutschen und r\u00e4toromanischen Schweiz], the transmitter on the Pizzo Groppera had to face serious competition, including that from Radio 24; the transmitter\u2019s survival is accordingly no doubt in jeopardy irrespective of the ban on retransmission. That being so, Groppera Radio AG\u2019s gratuitous statement that it was ready to resume its activities is not sufficient to prove that the Maur community-antenna co-operative and its subscribers have a live interest in taking proceedings. It follows that there is no need to examine the merits of their appeal.", "The Court does not need to determine the question whether there might be a live interest if the transmitter resumed or had already resumed its broadcasts, which are incompatible with international telecommunications law - subject to any contrary decision by the Italian courts and, possibly, by an international court of arbitration.", "(b) For the same reasons there is no need to consider the merits of the appeal brought by Groppera Radio AG.", "The company cannot plausibly maintain that if its appeal succeeded, it would resume its activities - which have been made impossible, short of new investment, by a storm that occurred after the appeal was brought - and would, furthermore, have the financial means to do so.", "Moreover, this case is a wholly exceptional one. Transmitters which broadcast in contravention of national or international law cannot usually survive for long. Matters are different as regards the Pizzo Groppera transmitter only because proceedings are still pending in Italy and because hitherto none of the means of settling disputes provided for in Article 50 of the International Telecommunication Convention ... has been used. It is unlikely that a second case of this kind will arise, if only because of the doubtful profitability of such transmitters. There is therefore insufficient justification for determining, with an eye to the future, the issues raised by the case, some of which are extremely sensitive.", "In any case, even if it were to be held that Groppera Radio AG had a possible interest in taking proceedings, its claim to retransmit again, through the co-operative\u2019s cable network, its probably unlawful ... broadcasts, after resuming them, would not deserve the law\u2019s protection.\"", "Lastly, the court made an order for costs against Groppera Radio AG since its appeal could not succeed as the company had breached the law by attempting to circumvent a ban on retransmission that had been imposed by the PTT and that, moreover, did not concern it directly.", "26. From 13 November 1979 onwards Radio 24 (Sound Radio\u2019s predecessor) broadcast to Switzerland from the Pizzo Groppera (see paragraph 12 above). On several occasions it changed its frequency in order to prevent interference with other radio stations.", "On 21 December 1979, following complaints from the German and Swiss telecommunications authorities, the Italian Ministry of Post and Telecommunications prohibited Belton s.r.l. (the manager of the station - see paragraph 12 above) from continuing its operations and threatened to put its transmitter out of action. The transmitter closed down on 22 January 1980, was functioning again three days later and then ceased broadcasting on 29 January.", "27. Belton s.r.l. brought proceedings in the Lombardy Regional Administrative Court, which on 11 March 1980 refused an application for a provisional broadcasting licence.", "28. On 19 March 1980 the Chiavenna magistrate declared that the closing down of the transmitter was unlawful, and broadcasting resumed on 23 March.", "29. On 3 October 1980 the PTT again demanded that the broadcasts should cease. On 11 October a second application (no. 2442/82) was made to the Lombardy Regional Administrative Court, but on 18 November that court refused a stay of execution. On 25 November the Pizzo Groppera transmitter closed down for the third time.", "On 13 January 1981 the Consiglio di Stato granted an application for a stay of execution pending the proceedings in the Administrative Court, and Radio 24 began broadcasting again on 16 January.", "30. In a judgment (no. 1515/81) of 1 October, which was filed at the registry on 4 December 1981, the Administrative Court held that Radio 24 was carrying on its activities in Italy unlawfully. The Pizzo Groppera station could not be considered as a local radio station under Italian law, since it had a broadcasting radius of more than 20 km and broadcast only to listeners living across the border. The court added that under Law no. 103 of 14 April 1975 (\"new provisions concerning radio and television broadcasting\"), the State had a monopoly of radio broadcasts intended for foreign countries. Lastly, the court upheld the closure order, which was executed on 21 January 1982.", "31. On 4 May 1982, following an appeal by Belton s.r.l., the Consiglio di Stato adopted three decisions, the first of which was filed at the registry the next day and the other two on 26 October:", "(i) an order (no. 124/82) staying execution of the judgment of 1 October 1981, so that Radio 24 was able to resume broadcasting on 9 May;", "(ii) a judgment (no. 508/82) allowing the appeal in part and reserving a decision as to the rest; and", "(iii) an order (no. 509/82) referring the case to the Constitutional Court - as sections 1, 2 and 45 of the 1975 Law appeared to raise a constitutional issue - and staying the proceedings.", "32. The Constitutional Court gave its decision on 6 May 1987 in a judgment (no. 153/1987) which was filed at the registry on 13 May. It declared section 2(1) of the impugned Law to be unconstitutional as it did not make any provision for the possibility of broadcasting programmes abroad under licences issued to private companies by the State authorities.", "33. The International Telecommunication Convention, which was concluded in the International Telecommunication Union on 25 October 1973 and revised on 6 November 1982, has been ratified by all the Council of Europe\u2019s member States. In Switzerland it has been published in full in the Official Collection of Federal Statutes (1976, p. 994, and 1985, p. 1093), and in the Compendium of Federal Law (0.784.16).", "Article 33, entitled \"Rational Use of the Radio Frequency Spectrum\", provides:", "\"Members shall endeavour to limit the number of frequencies and the spectrum space used to the minimum essential to provide in a satisfactory manner the necessary services. To that end they shall endeavour to apply the latest technical advances as soon as possible.\"", "Article 35 \u00a7 1 reads:", "\"All stations, whatever their purpose, must be established and operated in such a manner as not to cause harmful interference to the radio services or communications of other Members or of recognised private operating agencies, or of other duly authorised operating agencies which carry on radio service, and which operate in accordance with the provisions of the Radio Regulations.\"", "34. The Convention is supplemented and clarified by three sets of administrative rules: the Radio Regulations, the Telegraph Regulations and the Telephone Regulations. Only the first of these is relevant in the instant case.", "35. The Radio Regulations date from 21 December 1959 and were likewise amended in 1982 and also on other occasions. They run to over a thousand pages and - except for numbers 422 and 725 - have not been published in the Official Collection of Federal Statutes. The latter contains the following reference to them:", "\"The administrative regulations relating to the International Telecommunication Convention of 25 October 1973 are not being published in the Official Collection of Federal Statutes. They may be consulted at the Head Office of the PTT, Library and Documentation, Viktoriastrasse 21, 3030 Berne, or may be obtained from the ITU, International Telecommunication Union, Place des Nations, 1202 Geneva.\"", "Apart from number 584 (see paragraph 36 below), the provisions of the Radio Regulations relevant to the present case are the following:", "\"No transmitting station may be established or operated by a private person or by any enterprise without a licence issued in an appropriate form and in conformity with the provisions of these Regulations by the Government of the country to which the station in question is subject ...\"", "\"In principle, except in the frequency band 3900-4000 kHz, broadcasting stations using frequencies below 5060 kHz or above 41 MHz shall not employ power exceeding that necessary to maintain economically an effective national service of good quality within the frontiers of the country concerned.\"", "36. By number 584 of the Radio Regulations,", "\"Broadcasting stations in the band 100-108 MHz in Region 1 shall be established and operated in accordance with an agreement and associated plan for the band 87.5-108 MHz to be drawn up by a regional broadcasting conference (see Resolution 510). Prior to the date of entry into force of this agreement, broadcasting stations may be introduced subject to agreement between administrations concerned, on the understanding that such an operation shall in no case prejudice the establishment of the plan.\"", "37. The work of the conference contemplated in this provision resulted in the adoption in 1971 of a regional convention better known under the name of the Darmstadt plan. This instrument, which was superseded in 1984 by the \"Geneva plan\", governed the use of the 100-108 MHz frequency band and laid down a procedure for considering new applications for frequency allocations; it also indicated the position and characteristics of the transmitters concerned.", "38. Unlike Switzerland, Italy has not acceded to the plan. Nor have the two countries concluded an individual agreement as required before a transmitter can broadcast from one national territory to another.", "39. The Swiss Government never jammed the broadcasts from the Pizzo Groppera in order to stop them. They did, however, make approaches to the Italian authorities and to the International Telecommunication Union.", "40. Two delegations, one Swiss and one Italian, met in Berne on 29 and 30 November 1979 to study the \"problem of external transmitters situated on Italian territory and broadcasting programmes to Switzerland\". The minutes of the meeting mentioned the following points:", "\"1. The Italian delegation confirmed that on 22 November 1979 the \u2018Ministero delle Poste e delle Telecomunicazioni\u2019 sent a warning to the Belton company (Signor Fedele Tiranti) in Como, and receipt of the document was acknowledged on 23 November. The document stated that the transmitter had to confine the scope of its activities to Italian territory. Those in charge of the station had seven days in which to comply with this order, failing which their transmitter would be put out of action (disattivazione). The Swiss delegation expected immediate action. In accordance with the agreements concluded in Rome on 22 and 23 October 1979, the Italian delegation assured the Swiss delegation that the Italian Post and Telecommunications Authority would pursue the course of action already embarked on with the despatch of the warning (diffida), in order to halt the broadcasts to Switzerland. The Swiss delegation stated nonetheless that if nothing was done by 20 December 1979 and if the broadcasts still continued, the case would have to be submitted to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).", "2. As regards the external transmitters which were disrupting broadcasting in Switzerland, some measure of agreement was reached. The Italian side had already taken measures to implement the rules in force. One transmitter had even temporarily ceased functioning. Future arrangements would be examined on a case-by-case basis by the representatives of the two authorities, i.e. Mr Blaser for Switzerland and Mr Cito for Italy.", "3. The Swiss delegation insisted on measures being taken, in accordance with the international agreements, against other transmitters sited in Italy which broadcast programmes intended mainly for Switzerland. The Italian delegation, which was willing to settle the problem in accordance with its international commitments, said that it could not for the time being participate in any official co-ordination procedure, mainly because there was currently no legal basis for it.", "4. The Swiss delegation confirmed its position vis-\u00e0-vis the international agreements and stressed the need for them to be applied unrestrictedly by the co-signatory countries.", "5. Given the importance of the issues in question, the two delegations decided to continue their negotiations early in 1980.\"", "41. In a letter of 20 January 1987 the Radio Rights Division (Head Office of the PTT) submitted a request for assistance to the chairman of the International Frequency Registration Board (International Telecommunication Union).", "It indicated inter alia:", "\"In Italy, especially in the Po valley, there are a large number of private radio and television broadcasting stations transmitting on frequencies which have not been co-ordinated with the Swiss Post and Telecommunications Authority. This state of affairs contravenes Articles 2 and 4 of the regional broadcasting agreements (Stockholm 1961, Geneva 1984) and numbers 1214 and 1215 of the Radio Regulations, international agreements to which the Swiss and Italian authorities are parties.", "Some of these stations broadcast programmes and advertising designed for listeners in neighbouring Swiss towns and employ power exceeding that necessary to maintain economically an effective national service of good quality within the frontiers of the country concerned, contrary to number 2666 of the Radio Regulations. Furthermore, these private stations interfere with the proper functioning of Swiss radio services. To give a better picture of the situation, we are enclosing copies of the reports of harmful interference that we have sent to the Italian authorities (since 1984), pursuant to Article 22, Appendix 23 of the Radio Regulations. You will also find a summary table of Italian private radio stations which, through their presence on the airwaves, are preventing the implementation of our frequency allocations.", "For more than six years now, the various representations made by the Swiss PTT to the Italian authorities with a view to a co-ordination of effort have unfortunately produced no significant result. It is for this reason that before, if need be, taking the steps provided for in Article 50, number 189, of the International Telecommunication Convention (Nairobi, 1982), the Swiss authorities request the Board to take, as soon as possible, all necessary measures to remedy this situation.\"", "42. On 8 July 1988 the chairman of the International Frequency Registration Board sent the Head Office of the Swiss PTT a copy of a letter sent the same day to the Italian Ministry of Post and Telecommunications informing it that frequency allocations were being used in breach of the Radio Regulations and regional agreements.", "The most recent of the Board\u2019s representations to the Italian authorities was made in a telefaxed message on 29 November 1988, which read:", "\"1. The Board has yet to receive any information about the solution of the cases of harmful interference reported by the Swiss authorities. Similar cases of harmful interference have recently been reported by the authorities of two other States.", "2. On behalf of the International Frequency Registration Board I wish to express serious concern at the apparent lack of progress in eliminating the harmful interference caused to radio and television broadcasting stations in Switzerland and at the fact that a chaotic situation seems to have developed in the region which, to say the least, renders the existing international treaties nugatory.", "3. In your letter of 8 August 1988 you informed the Board that an agreement had been reached with the Swiss authorities, but no practical measure seems to have been taken. Your Department has not yet replied to the Board\u2019s letters of 3 April 1987, 21 August 1987 and 25 October 1988 and has not submitted any comments - as it was required to do under RR [Radio Regulations] 1444 - on the Board\u2019s investigation pursuant to RR 1438 and RR 1442 into the harmful interference caused to the Swiss authorities\u2019 radio and television broadcasting stations which was reported to you in the Board\u2019s letter of 8 July 1988.", "...", "6. The Board wishes to draw your Department\u2019s attention to the extremely serious situation currently prevailing.", "In particular:", "(I) The Board has concluded that the Italian authorities have failed to comply with the obligations which they freely undertook to fulfil in the International Telecommunication Convention, the Radio Regulations and the regional agreements.", "(II) More than a hundred Italian stations are currently causing persistent harmful interference to officially authorised stations in three neighbouring countries.", "(III) No means has been found of reducing this major interference, which continues to increase.", "(IV) There has been no specific reply to the Board\u2019s letters.", "7. In view of this situation, which has existed for several years now and has recently become alarmingly serious, the Board is bound to consider taking further measures with a view to overcoming the serious consequences for the authorities of France, Switzerland and Yugoslavia of the Italian authorities\u2019 failure to fulfil their obligations.", "8.
