The facts surrounding the disappearance of the applicant's husband are disputed between the parties.", "10. The applicant's husband, Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu, had been arrested and tried on several occasions in the past for political offences. Plain-clothes policemen used to keep him under surveillance.", "11. On 29 March 1996, Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu travelled by bus from Istanbul to Edirne, a city near the border with Greece, to visit relatives. During its journey to Edirne, the bus was stopped by a car and a person from this car got on the bus. Before its arrival in Edirne the same car stopped the bus once again and the person who had got on the bus earlier returned to the car. This car followed Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu until he arrived at his relatives' house in Edirne.", "12. On 1 April 1996 Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu left Edirne for Istanbul. He did not arrive home and has been missing since. When entering her home on the fifth day after her husband's disappearance, the applicant noticed that the front door was open and that her television had been turned on. In her opinion, the persons who entered her home had done so with her husband's key.", "13. The applicant filed petitions with several administrative and judicial bodies inquiring about her husband's whereabouts. On 25 April 1996, she applied to the prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court and, on 26 April 1996, to the Forensic Medicine Institute and, via the Istanbul Human Rights Association, to the President, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice and the Human Rights Commission of the Turkish Parliament. On 2 May 1996 the applicant applied to the General Security Directorate in Ankara. On 3 May 1996 she applied to the Governor's office in Istanbul, the Fatih Public Prosecutor and the National Intelligence Agency. On 6 May 1996 she further applied to the Governor's office in Edirne.", "14. On 23 September 1996 the applicant applied to the K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck\u00e7ekmece public prosecutor. She complained that she was being followed by persons, whom she believed to be plain-clothes police officers. She further complained of receiving anonymous phone calls at her home by someone who swore at her and who threatened to kill her.", "15. In her letters of 10 September 1997, the applicant informed the public prosecutor and the Governor in Edirne about an important statement made by a prisoner, Kas\u0131m A\u00e7\u0131k, to some other prisoners in which he gave detailed information about the killing of Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu.", "16. The applicant claims that Kas\u0131m A\u00e7\u0131k was a State agent who had infiltrated the MLKP (\u201cMarksist Leninist Kom\u00fcnist Parti\u201d \u2013 a prohibited left-wing organisation) in order to gather information about their activities. Prior to that, he had participated in counter-guerrilla activities and had been involved in the killing of a number of persons. He was strangled to death in prison on 18 May 1997. According to the applicant, Kas\u0131m A\u00e7\u0131k gave this statement when he was questioned after having been arrested and detained in the Gebze prison on suspicion of being a MLKP member, an offence for which he was later tried before the Istanbul State Security Court.", "17. According to this statement, which was taped and later transcribed, Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu was questioned in \u00c7ad\u0131rkent by a gang, whose members included police officers, soldiers and itiraf\u00e7\u0131lar. He was subsequently killed by Murat Demir and Murat \u0130pek and his body was thrown into the river Meri\u00e7, which forms part of the border between Turkey and Greece. In her letter, the applicant further stated that Kas\u0131m A\u00e7\u0131k had drawn a sketch of the place where Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu had been killed and that he had given a detailed description of the clothes Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu had been wearing, in particular his shoes, wallet and wrist-watch. These details were confirmed by the applicant to be accurate. The applicant finally stated that it had to be deemed certain that Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu had been killed. She requested the authorities to investigate this new evidence and to show her photographs and other documentary materials concerning unidentified corpses found in the area.", "18. The applicant claims that she did not receive any reaction from the administrative and judicial bodies she petitioned other than one invitation for her and her husband's mother to give a statement and one invitation for Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu's brother to identify a corpse found in the area where Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu had disappeared. In this respect, the applicant pointed out that, although she and her relatives had already applied to the domestic authorities in April 1996 after Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu's disappearance, the documents submitted by the Government are dated May 1998.", "19. Following the receipt of the petition of 15 April 1996, the Edirne public prosecutor instigated an investigation. He contacted the Edirne Security Directorate in order to find out whether Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu had been taken into police custody. On 2 May 1996 he was informed that this was not the case. As the search for Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu in Edirne was unsuccessful, his photograph was transmitted to all Security Directorates in Turkey.", "20. Further investigations were opened by the Bursa public prosecutor, the Edirne public prosecutor and the Direction of Criminal Affairs of the Ministry of Justice, following a request of 2 May 1996 by seventeen persons detained in Bursa to elucidate the fate of Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu.", "21. On 24 May 1996, in reply to a request thereto, the Edirne gendarmerie command informed the public prosecutor that their custody records were being verified and that they had started identity checks in their region. On 10 June 1996, the gendarmerie authorities informed the public prosecutor that their efforts remained unsuccessful.", "22. On 9 August 1996 the Edirne public prosecutor informed the Istanbul public prosecutor about the investigation and requested information as to whether Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu had been taken into police custody in Istanbul. On 14 October 1996 the Istanbul Security Directorate informed the Edirne public prosecutor that Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu had not been taken into detention by the Istanbul security authorities.", "23. Following the receipt of the applicant's petition of 10 September 1997 for a supplementary investigation on the basis of the statement given by Kas\u0131m A\u00e7\u0131k, the Edirne public prosecutor informed the public prosecutors of respectively Enez, Meri\u00e7, \u0130psala and Uzunk\u00f6pr\u00fc of the investigation and requested information about unidentified bodies found in the area. Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu's relatives were invited to identity one body from photographs. According to them, the body found was not that of Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu.", "24. An investigation was conducted concerning the statements given by Kas\u0131m A\u00e7\u0131k. In this connection, it was revealed that he had been killed in the Gebze prison by his co-activists in the TDP (T\u00fcrkiye Devrim Partisi \u2013 a prohibited left-wing organisation). According to a press release issued by the TDP, Kas\u0131m A\u00e7\u0131k had acted as a spy and had betrayed the organisation's confidential strategy. According to this press release, Kas\u0131m A\u00e7\u0131k had been tried under the rules of the TDP and had been sentenced to death. The statement referred to by the applicant had been taken by TDP members in the context of this \u201ctrial\u201d. According to the Government, Kas\u0131m A\u00e7\u0131k was not a State agent and had no associations with the State and affiliated agencies.", "25. In fact, it was established in the criminal proceedings brought against the suspected perpetrators of the killing of Kas\u0131m A\u00e7\u0131k that he had been killed accidentally by another prisoner, Ayhan G\u00fcne\u015f, following a fight provoked by Kas\u0131m A\u00e7\u0131k.", "26. It appeared from Kas\u0131m A\u00e7\u0131k's statement that the gang which killed the applicant's husband had also kidnapped and killed persons in the Silvan and Lice districts of Diyarbak\u0131r. Therefore, an investigation was carried out in the places named by Kas\u0131m A\u00e7\u0131k. In the course of this investigation, the prosecution authorities summoned several village mayors (muhtar) in the region of Lice and took their statements.", "27. On 15 April 1996 Zeyneti T\u00fcrko\u011flu, the mother of Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu, filed a petition with the Edirne public prosecutor in which she stated that her son had come from Istanbul to visit her, that he had left her house on 1 April 1996 and that since then he was missing. She asked the public prosecutor to search for him.", "28. On 25 April 1996 the applicant filed a petition with the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court. She stated that, on the basis of a statement given by a detainee in Siirt, she suspected that her husband had been arrested and possibly taken to Siirt. However, the authorities in Siirt informed her that her husband was not detained there. She requested the prosecutor to search for her husband.", "29. On 26 April 1996 the applicant informed the Istanbul Institute for Forensic Medicine that her husband had disappeared on 1 April 1996. She further stated that, in the past, her husband had been arrested many times for political reasons and that he had been followed by the police before he disappeared. She asked the Institute for Forensic Medicine to obtain her husband's fingerprints from the Security Directorate, to compare them with the fingerprints of all unidentified bodies found and to provide her with information that might be helpful.", "30. On the same day the Turkish Human Rights Association addressed a letter to the President of the Republic of Turkey on behalf of the applicant, informing him of the disappearance of Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu and stated that the applicant had applied to various authorities. The President was requested to order a search for Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu. On the same day, the Turkish Human Rights Association sent similar letters to the Prime Minister, the Minister of the Interior and the Parliamentary Commission for Human Rights.", "31. By letter of 2 May 1996, the applicant informed the Ankara Security Directorate of the disappearance of her husband and stated that she had applied to various authorities. As her husband had been apprehended, detained and tried for political offences on various occasions in the past, she deemed it plausible that he had been again apprehended and detained. She also contacted the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor and State Security Court as well as the anti-terror branch of the Siirt security directorate. Her husband might have been taken there since, in a statement taken previously in Siirt, a person had implicated her husband. As the Siirt authorities had informed her that her husband's name was not mentioned in their records she had also applied to the public prosecutor's office at the Istanbul State Security Court, which informed her that her husband's name was not included in their records either. She finally stated that all of her inquiries indicated that her husband, who had no previous health or family problems, was in the hands of the MIT (Milli \u0130stihbarat Te\u015fkilat\u0131; National Intelligence Agency) or the JITEM (Jandarma \u0130stihbarat ve Ter\u00f6rle M\u00fccadele; Gendarmerie Intelligence and Anti-Terror Branch), or even counterguerrillas. She stated that, in the absence of any other possibility, \u201cit was normal to conclude that a person with a political identity, opposing the State's official policy, could be in the hands of such organisations. They are responsible for many extra-judicial killings and this is acknowledged by the State authorities from time to time. Also, the fact that someone has entered my house secretly by opening the door with a key and the fact that I have been followed makes my conclusion stronger\u201d. She asked the Ankara Security Directorate to search for her husband.", "32. On 3 May 1996 the applicant sent a similar letter to the National Intelligence Service, asking whether this service held any information about her husband's disappearance.", "33. On 3 May 1996 the applicant further sent a letter to the Istanbul Governor, informing the Governor that her husband had disappeared since 1 April 1996, that in the past her husband had been arrested many times for political reasons and, prior to his disappearance, her husband had been followed by the police. She further informed the Governor that she had applied to the public prosecutor, Governor and Security Directorate in Edirne, various Edirne police stations, the hospitals and morgues in Edirne. She further stated that she had applied to the Istanbul Security Directorate, the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court, prisons and the Forensic Institute. She also mentioned having applied to the Human Rights Association, Amnesty International, Helsinki Watch and other non-governmental organisations, the Prime Minister, the Ministry of the Interior and the National Security Directorate in Ankara. She asked the Governor to investigate the matter. On 6 May 1996, the applicant sent a similar letter to the Edirne Governor.", "34. On 3 May 1996 the applicant filed a further petition with the Fatih public prosecutor, requesting an investigation into her husband's disappearance. She gave a description of her husband and asked the prosecutor to compare her husband's fingerprints with those of the unidentified bodies that had been or might be found within the prosecutor's jurisdiction. She stated that her husband had been arrested in the past and that the authorities should have his fingerprints on record.", "35. On 23 September 1996 the applicant filed a petition with the K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck\u00e7ekmece public prosecutor, in which she stated that she had been harassed and threatened by some persons whom she believed to be State agents. The applicant requested the prosecutor to identify these persons and to prosecute them.", "36. On 10 September 1997 the applicant's lawyer filed a petition on behalf of the applicant with the Edirne public prosecutor, informing him that Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu was still missing and that the applicant's petitions to various authorities and institutions had not given rise to any results. In the petition, it is further stated that it had appeared from a confession made by a counterguerrilla, Kas\u0131m A\u00e7\u0131k, that Talat Turko\u011flu was questioned in \u00c7ad\u0131rkent near Edirne by a gang consisting of police officers, soldiers and itiraf\u00e7\u0131lar (defected members of an illegal organisation who provide the authorities with information about that organisation) and led by Mahmut Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, alias Ye\u015fil. According to this statement, Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu had been tortured and subsequently killed by Murat Demir and Murat \u0130pek, who later threw his body in the river Meri\u00e7. A transcript of the tape-recording of this statement given by Kas\u0131m A\u00e7\u0131k as well as a sketch map, signed by Kas\u0131m A\u00e7\u0131k, of the place where Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu had been killed were joined to the petition. The public prosecutor was requested to take these elements into consideration in his investigation and to provide information about the unidentified bodies found in or around the river Meri\u00e7. The public prosecutor was further informed that Murat Demir and Murat \u0130pek were currently being held in the Metris prison in Istanbul.", "37. On the same day, the applicant's lawyer sent a similar letter to the Edirne Governor. On 10 September 1997 the applicant's lawyer also requested the Edirne Institute of Forensic Medicine to compare the fingerprints of Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu with those of all unidentified bodies and to provide any information that might be helpful.", "38. On 15 April 1996 the Edirne public prosecutor requested the Edirne Security Directorate to take a statement from Zeyneti T\u00fcrko\u011flu, to search for Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu and to distribute his photograph to all police stations in Turkey.", "39. On 19 April 1996 the applicant gave a statement at the Ay\u015fekad\u0131n police station in Edirne about her husband's disappearance. She declared that her husband had a business in Istanbul selling building materials, that he had no debts and that in any event debts would not prevent him from coming home, that he had no family problems and that she feared for his life. She requested the police to conduct a search for him.", "40. On the same day, Zeyneti T\u00fcrko\u011flu gave a statement at the Ay\u015fekad\u0131n police station in Edirne. She declared that her son had left her home on 1 April 1996 in order to return to Istanbul and that he had since disappeared. She confirmed that on 15 April 1996 she had filed a petition with the Edirne public prosecutor. The family unsuccessfully searched for her son and she feared for his life. She described Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu, who was born in 1951, as being 180 cm. tall, weighing about 78 kilogrammes, having a dark complexion and a scar on his right cheek. She requested the police to conduct a search for him.", "41. On 2 May 1996 the Ay\u015fekad\u0131n police station in Edirne transmitted the statements taken on 19 April 1996 from the applicant and Zeyneti T\u00fcrko\u011flu to the Edirne Security Directorate, informing the latter that police officers of the Ay\u015fekad\u0131n station had searched for Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu at certain addresses and that his photograph had been distributed to all police stations in Turkey.

On 24 May 1996 the Edirne Provincial gendarmerie headquarters informed the Edirne public prosecutor that Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu was not detained by them, that they had searched for him and that they had set up road check points. Their search remained unsuccessful, but they would continue to search for him.", "44. On 30 May 1996 the Edirne Security Directorate informed the Edirne public prosecutor that Talat T\u00fcrko\u011flu had been arrested in 1980 in Ankara for membership of the prohibited TKP/B party (T\u00fcrkiye Kom\u00fcnist Partisi Birlik).
