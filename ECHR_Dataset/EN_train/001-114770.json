LITHUANIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Positive obligations) (Procedural aspect)", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3;Helen Keller;Ineta Ziemele;Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque", "TEXT": ["5. The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in \u0160iauliai.", "6. In 1996 the Kaunas Regional Court convicted the applicant of soliciting for prostitution and the murder of a prostitute, committed in a particularly cruel way by a group of persons. The applicant was sentenced to fourteen years\u2019 imprisonment. This was his first conviction. Eight of his accomplices were also sentenced to between eight and fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment.", "7. When the applicant arrived in Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Prison to serve his sentence in May 1996, he was placed in Wing 4, Section 1 of the prison (IV b\u016brys, 1 brigada). Subsequently, he was moved to Wings 8, 7, 13 and again to Wing 7. He spent roughly a year in each of those parts of the prison.", "8. On 22 November 2001 the applicant was moved to Wing 2, Section 2 of the prison. He did not sustain any injuries while residing there, nor did he complain to the doctors about health issues that could have shown any traces of prison violence.", "9. R.J., who was born in 1979, arrived in Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Prison on 25 August 2000. He was placed in Wing 2, Section 2 of the prison. Notwithstanding R.J.\u2019s three convictions for crimes ranging from theft (in 1995) and attempted murder (in 2000) to hooliganism (in 2001), he was considered as serving an imprisonment penalty for the first time, given that following his first conviction the court had suspended the imposed sentence and the sentences for the second and third convictions had been combined.", "10. The five character reports drawn up by Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Prison administration in 1997-2002 describe the applicant as tactful with other inmates and respectful to the guards; he was also said to have had \u201ccertain authority\u201d with other prisoners. The authorities noted that the applicant had breached the prison\u2019s internal rules fourteen times (for keeping his hands in his pockets in the presence of guards, being intoxicated, and staying at prison quarters he was not assigned to). Nonetheless, he had also been commended thirteen times for positive behaviour and good work in prison.", "As it appears from the documents submitted by the parties, in 2002 R.J. had been assessed twice by the prison administration. He was described as having authority among other inmates and tactful with them, capable of easily adapting in prison.", "11. On 2 October 2002 at about 11 p.m., a fight broke out between the applicant and R.J. As a consequence, the applicant suffered severe head injuries; his skull was fractured. The next day he underwent an operation in a public hospital. He was later placed in the prison hospital in a coma.", "According to a doctor\u2019s report, R.J. sustained an injury to his forehead and had blood on his face. His leg was broken and he had bruises on his arms.", "12. On 4 October 2002 the prison governor started a pre-trial investigation into the incident.", "13. On 12 May 2003 the Kai\u0161iadorys District Court convicted R.J. of having caused the applicant severe bodily injury (sunkus k\u016bno su\u017ealojimas). The court established that on 2 October 2002, at around 10.50 p.m., R.J. had hit the applicant no less than five times over the head and other parts of the body while in their living quarters at the prison. R.J. confessed to the crime. Two guards who testified before the court stated that once they had learned of the fight, which happened at around 11 p.m., after the evening check-up, they had run to the applicant\u2019s cell and found him lying on the floor with his head covered in blood. The guards also stated that R.J. had smelled of alcohol.", "14. The transcript of the trial hearing states that R.J. testified that \u201cthe quarrel between me and the applicant had been spontaneous\u201d, and \u201cthe fight had been short\u201d. He also stated that he had punched and kicked the applicant\u2019s body and head, and that as a result the applicant had fallen down and hit his head on an aquarium. Another inmate, \u017d.L., had attempted to separate them. \u201cAfterwards the guards had run in and it had all been over\u201d. In answer to a question by a prosecutor, R.J. stated that \u201che had had no prior conflicts with the applicant\u201d. He added that \u201ceverything had happened very fast; until the guards had run into the cell, the applicant had only managed to reach the bed and lie down\u201d.", "\u017d.L. testified that the conflict had taken place after the evening check-up. He said \u201cI tried to separate R.J. and the applicant ... the conflict happened very fast\u201d.", "15. The medical report stated that R.J. had not been intoxicated when blood samples had been taken from him \u201con 3 October 2002\u201d. The court therefore decided to remove from the charges against him the accusation that he had been intoxicated when the crime was committed.", "The doctor\u2019s report reads that R.J. was tested for alcohol at 11.40 a.m. on 3 October 2002. The test showed 0,00% of alcohol in his blood.", "16. When imposing the sentence, the court took into consideration R.J.\u2019s young age and the fact that he had confessed to the crime. R.J. was sentenced to two years and six months\u2019 imprisonment, with confiscation of all his property. The court added that term of imprisonment to his prior conviction, and R.J. was ordered to spend in total ten years and two months in prison. Upon a civil claim by a prosecutor, R.J. was also ordered to reimburse the costs which the State had paid for the applicant\u2019s hospitalisation and treatment, which amounted to 9,021 Lithuanian litai (LTL). At that time the applicant had not submitted a civil claim for non-pecuniary damages from R.J.", "17. By a ruling of 3 September 2003, the Kaunas Regional Court dismissed R.J.\u2019s appeal. The court found that there were no grounds for lowering the sentence imposed on R.J. The crime was particularly grave, with very serious consequences.", "18. In May 2003 a doctors\u2019 commission declared the applicant Category I disabled (most severe condition of disability) and unfit to work.", "19. On 3 June 2003 the Vilnius City Second District Court released the applicant from the remainder of his sentence. The court noted that after the incident of 2 October 2002, the applicant had become totally disabled. He could walk only by leaning on furniture and with the help of others and was unable to adequately assess his surroundings. Moreover, he had already served two thirds of his sentence.", "20. After the incident, the applicant was treated in numerous hospitals and rehabilitation centres. According to a report from \u0160iauliai municipality of 28 November 2006, the applicant could not speak clearly, had poor balance, and had trouble shaving, washing himself and climbing stairs. He required constant care from his family.", "21. On 16 April 2007 the applicant, who believed that he was eligible for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages on account of his injury while in prison, lodged a civil claim against the State. He argued that the prison authorities were under an obligation to maintain order in the correctional facility and should have protected and defended him from the injury that nearly cost him his life. He submitted that there was a direct causal link between his injury and the prison authorities\u2019 alleged failure to act and guarantee safe conditions in which to serve a sentence.", "R.J. was a third interested party in those proceedings, given that the outcome of the litigation for damages directly affected his pecuniary situation.", "22. When the case was examined before the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court, the applicant\u2019s lawyer also argued that the administration of Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Prison had failed to observe prison rules stipulating that certain prisoners should be kept separately. In that context, the lawyer referred to a letter of 19 December 1994 in which the prosecutor said that R.J. had to be kept in isolation. The lawyer also argued that R.J., who had three convictions in total, was a more hardened criminal than the applicant, so the two should have been held separately. He also submitted that although, after the incident, R.J. had smelled of alcohol, blood samples had not been taken from him until twelve hours later. In the past the applicant had also been punished for consuming alcohol while in prison. The lawyer argued that the guards on duty had not kept the prisoners under constant observation, as they were obliged to do under the prison regulations. He also maintained that the administration\u2019s decision to move an inmate from one section of the prison to another had to be justified, which had not happened in the applicant\u2019s case. Lastly, the lawyer argued that his client had not started the proceedings for damages earlier because of his state of health.", "23. R.J. testified before the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court that he had been serving his sentence in the same section of Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Prison since 28 September 2000. In his view, \u201cit was the State that should bear responsibility for the injuries the applicant had sustained\u201d. He also argued that his relations with the applicant had always been tense, that \u201cthe applicant did not fit in [in Wing 2, Section 2]\u201d, \u201cthe applicant was a \u2018simple\u2019 person and the other inmates in that section were \u2018offenders\u2019\u201d and \u201cthe fight between the two of them would have occurred sooner or later\u201d. In his opinion, \u201cthe prison administration could have foreseen the tension between him and the applicant if it had wanted\u201d. R.J. did not answer the judge\u2019s question about the reasons for the fight. Nor did he reply to her question whether he had been under the influence of alcohol at the time of the fight. He nevertheless submitted that prisoners could obtain as much alcohol in the prison \u201cas they wanted\u201d. The guards caught them with alcohol very rarely and, as far as R.J.\u2019s recalled, the applicant had been sober at the time of the fight. R.J. also said that after the evening check-up, the guards carried out the first night-time check at around 11-12 p.m., and the second at a later time.", "24. The Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Prison administration and the Department of Prisons, the defendants in the case, asked the court to dismiss the civil claim, arguing that the fight had been spontaneous and the conflict could not have been foreseen. They submitted that the applicant had never informed the prison administration that he had been in danger. Accordingly, the State was not liable for the incident that had caused the applicant\u2019s incapacity.", "The prison authorities also pointed out that the inmates should have been in bed by 10 p.m., and that at night the guards checked the sleeping quarters twice.", "25. On 21 February 2008 the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s civil claim. It noted, firstly, that the applicant had missed a statutory three-year deadline for lodging a claim for damages. Nevertheless, the court proceeded with the examination of whether the complaint was founded.", "26. As to the merits of the complaint, the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court held that there was no evidence, either written or factual, of the applicant having ever approached the authorities claiming that he was unsafe in Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Prison, even though such a right was guaranteed by Article 50 of the Code of Correctional Works (see Relevant Domestic Law and Practice below). The court also emphasised that the prison administration had properly executed its duties as concerns the placement of inmates. Both the applicant and R.J. had been serving a prison sentence for the first time, so they could be held in the same wing and section. As to the suggestion by the applicant\u2019s lawyer that the applicant had been moved from one part to another of the prison without a valid reason, the court held that \u201cthe applicant could have challenged those actions [but had failed to do so]\u201d. Moreover, the applicant himself had not been an exemplary prisoner and had been punished a number of times for breaching internal rules (ranging from alcohol consumption to leaving his living quarters). The court found weighty the prison administration\u2019s argument that the applicant had never approached them claiming, either verbally or in writing, that he was unsafe in prison in general or that he had had any conflicts with a particular inmate. Consequently, there were no grounds for finding the prison administration liable for not preventing the incident. According to the case-file, the fight was spontaneous and took place after the evening check-up, when all the inmates, including the applicant and R.J., should have been sleeping or at least in bed. Overall, there was no legal basis for granting the applicant\u2019s civil claims.", "27. The applicant appealed, invoking Article 3 of the Convention and reiterating his earlier arguments that the State had not protected him from serious injury in prison, as a consequence of which his health had been permanently damaged. He also submitted that the prison administration had failed to ensure that prisoners could not obtain alcohol, arguing that alcohol made prisoners unpredictable and aggressive.", "The Department of Prisons asked that the civil claim be dismissed as unfounded. They pointed out that there was no objective evidence that R.J. had been under the influence of alcohol during the incident. That fact had not been established in the criminal proceedings.", "28. On 24 November 2008 the Supreme Administrative Court examined the applicant\u2019s appeal but dismissed it on the merits. There was no evidence in the case file that any action or inaction on the part of staff at Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Prison had contributed to the incident between the applicant and R.J. During the criminal proceedings, it had been established that it was R.J. who had injured the applicant, and R.J. had been convicted accordingly. Therefore, as it had not been possible to establish any illegal acts or failure to act on the part of the prison staff, the State could not be held responsible for the non-pecuniary damage the applicant had sustained.", "29. The Code of Correctional Works (Pataisos darb\u0173 kodeksas), as in force at the relevant time, reads as follows:", "\u201cThe purpose of accommodating convicts separately or in isolation in correctional institutions is:", "to separate convicts who, due to the nature of their crimes or their character, might negatively influence other inmates;", "to facilitate the social rehabilitation of convicts;", "to help ensure the supervision and safety of convicts;", "to help safeguard the requirements of security and administration of the correctional institutions ...", "The following categories of convict should be isolated from each other within the same correctional institutions, or if possible placed in different institutions: convicts sentenced to imprisonment for the first time; those convicted for intentional and negligent crimes, ... very dangerous recidivists; those convicted for serious crimes ...", "If a convict, serving his sentence at a correctional prison, addresses the administration in writing with a request to be isolated from other inmates for important reasons, the director of the prison has a right to transfer the convict to a cell and to hold him in isolation or with other inmates transferred to the cell for the same reasons.

The medical personnel shall make an entry in a special journal and inform the [prison administration].\u201d", "31. On 22 August 2000 the Minister of Justice issued an Instruction for the Security and Supervision of Detention Facilities, which sets out the measures prison authorities must take to ensure continuous supervision of prisoners, isolation where necessary and the implementation of regime requirements. Supervision is also aimed at preventing possible breaches of discipline and crimes. For that purpose, the guards watch and count the prisoners, and search the prisoners and premises. The guards supervise the prisoners and premises from their posts located throughout the prison and while moving around the prison. They must ensure that the prisoners obey the daily schedule and that they remain in the sectors allocated to them. The prisoners are counted three times a day. In order to find and collect prohibited items, the guards perform both scheduled and surprise searches of the inmates and premises.", "32. Under the Civil Code, an abridged three-year statutory time-limit applies to claims for damages (Article 1.125 \u00a7 8). The Code also provides:", "\u201c1.

A careful appraisal should be made by the prison administration to determine whether individual prisoners pose risks to themselves and others. The range of risks assessed should include harm to self, to other prisoners, to persons working in or visiting the prison, or to the community, and the likelihood of escape, or of committing another serious offence on prison leave or release.", "13. Needs assessments should seek to identify the personal needs and characteristics associated with the prisoner\u2019s offence(s) and harmful behaviour (\u201dcriminogenic needs\u201d). To the greatest extent possible, criminogenic needs should be addressed so as to reduce offences and harmful behaviour by prisoners both during detention and after release.", "14.
