Metabolic myopathy provokes physical exhaustion, severe myalgia, difficulties in breathing, loss of the power of speech. The applicant in particular suffers from a \"thermal disability\" i.e. cold temperatures and changes in temperature cause him intense muscular pain. He is often forced to use a wheelchair.", "However, the applicant\u2019s illness was not diagnosed until 1979. Prior to that date, the applicant was thought to be a psychopath.", "In 1980 the applicant was recognised as 100% disabled and started receiving a pension as a result.", "The applicant embarked on a series of actions and demonstration, including hunger strikes, in order to obtain the removal of architectural obstructions (barriere architettoniche) and to obtain some form of social help.", "On an unspecified date in 1989, as a consequence of one of these actions, the applicant was allegedly ill-treated by the police. On 28 December 1989 the applicant filed a criminal complaint against the police in relation to the above facts, which was however dismissed.", "The applicant\u2019s detention", "On an unspecified date the applicant requested the President of the Province of Trento to enforce provincial law no. 43 of 17 December 1993, which, inter alia, imposes certain obligations upon the provincial social security service to help those suffering from metabolic myopathy. The President of the Province of Trento filed a criminal complaint against the applicant for extortion, on the ground that he had tried to force the administrative authorities to favour him. On 29 June 1995, the applicant was arrested.", "On 14 August 1995, after two medical experts\u2019 reports had established that the applicant\u2019s physical condition was not compatible with detention, he was released. The charge against him was then converted from extortion into \"arbitrary and violent exercise of his rights\" (esercizio arbitrario delle proprie ragioni con violenza alle persone), but later dropped, no formal complaint having been lodged against him on this charge (non doversi procedere per difetto di querela).", "On 20 June 1997 the Trento Court of Appeal awarded the applicant compensation (7,000,000 Italian lira) for the 58-day unfair detention (ingiusta detenzione), on the ground that the charge against him had been dropped and in consideration of his poor state of health.", "However, on 18 July 1997 the Ministry of the Treasury lodged an appeal against this decision to the Court of Cassation. These proceedings are currently pending.", "The applicant\u2019s accommodation", "Since 1973 the applicant had lived in a privately rented apartment in via Suffragio no. 53 (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe first apartment\u201d), which he had adapted, at his own expense, to his needs in view of his pathology.", "In 1988 the Trentino Institute for Housing (Istituto Trentino per l\u2019Edilizia Abitativa, hereinafter referred to as \"ITEA\") expropriated the building.

On an unspecified date, the Trento Magistrate\u2019s Court formally confirmed the notice to quit and set the date of the applicant\u2019s eviction at 22 July 1993.", "On 26 May 1993 ITEA submitted to the applicant a plan of payments of the arrears over twelve instalments; this proposal was refused.", "On 14 July 1993 ITEA decided to refrain from requesting the enforcement of the Magistrate\u2019s Court\u2019s order for possession for six months, in consideration of the applicant\u2019s health condition and of his alleged credit towards ITEA on account of the expenses he had incurred in order to adapt the apartment to his needs.", "On 29 September 1993 ITEA acknowledged part of the amounts claimed by the applicant.", "On 13 December 1993, the applicant paid part of his outstanding debt to ITEA.", "In connection with the remainder of the applicant\u2019s debt and for the legal costs and expenses incurred by ITEA, the enforcement of the eviction order was pursued and fixed at 24 June 1994.", "On 11 March 1994 the applicant, after having occupied as a protest the hall of the Province Building, poured 400 litres of petrol around the building where his flat is. He was arrested and subsequently convicted. In the meantime, the other occupants of the building had to vacate it for a week.", "On 17 March 1994 ITEA submitted to the applicant another plan of payment of the arrears of rent and legal costs and expenses.

The applicant\u2019s lawyer requested ITEA to refrain form the eviction so that he could find a solution.

The Government maintain that he received notification of it on 30 December 1996 and submit that the applicant failed to lodge an appeal to the competent Provincial Committee (Commissione Provinciale di Vigilanza) and was thus informed, on 5 February 1997, that the decision on withdrawal was final but that he had the possibility of requesting that its enforcement be suspended.", "In a report issued on 5 September 1997 by the Provincial Body for Health Services of the Autonomous Province of Trento it was stated that the second apartment did not meet the requirements laid down in the relevant legislation. In particular: a) access to the WC is difficult for a disabled person; b) the bathtub is inadequate for the hydrotherapy needed by the applicant; c) the windows are not triple glazed; d) there is no structural separation between the apartment and the loft; d) the roof is not adequately insulated due to the presence of cracks.", "On 1 October 1997 the applicant\u2019s eviction was stayed for six more months. ITEA inquired whether the decision on withdrawal could be suspended but the Province informed it that it was not possible in the absence of a request by the applicant.

However, by an ordinance issued on 11 April 1998 the Trento Magistrate\u2019s Court declared its incompetence to grant the applicant\u2019s requests and thus rejected them. The court pointed out that it was for the administrative courts to order ITEA to comply with its obligation and to provide the applicant with an adequate apartment.", "On 3 March 1998 the Commission for the study of metabolic diseases issued a report on the applicant\u2019s case listing the requirements which the applicant\u2019s accommodation should meet.", "In connection with the arrears of rent, on 5 March 1998 the Trento Magistrate\u2019s Court issued an injunction of payment.", "On 9 March 1998 the provincial body on residential housing (Servizio Edilizia Abitativa della Provincia autonoma di Trento) stated that it would not be possible to allocate another apartment to the applicant, on account of his insolvency.", "On 19 March 1998 the applicant was hospitalised in Trento; his condition has dramatically deteriorated on account of his living in an inadequate environment (camper van). On 26 April 1998 the applicant went on hunger strike. In a report issued on 15 June 1998 by a commission of doctors from the hospital, it was stated that the applicant should be discharged from hospital due to the lack of facilities adequate to his illness and that therefore a solution to his housing problem was urgently needed.", "On 1 July 1998 the applicant\u2019s moveable items were seized from the second apartment with a view to recovering the arrears of rent owed by the applicant.", "", "On 2 July 1998 the health and social affairs councillor\u2019s office (assessorato alla sanit\u00e0 e attivit\u00e0 sociali) of Trento Province decided that it would try to find an institution which would accept to bear the costs for the rent and maintenance of the apartment for the applicant, pursuant to Article 30 of Law no. 21/92. The apartment would thus be formally allocated to this institution, which would then make it available for the applicant. On 27 July 1998 a representative of the councillor\u2019s office was formally appointed to this task.", "In co-operation with the Trento municipality, six apartments owned by ITEA were found; the Commission for the study of metabolic diseases was requested to inspect them with a view to finding a suitable one.", "By a note of 11 August 1998, the Commission for the study of metabolic diseases stated to have found that the one in Aldeno (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe third apartment\u201d) was suitable. The applicant was informed accordingly.", "By a decision of 18 February 1999, the Comprensorio Valle dell\u2019Adige of the Trento Province allocated the third apartment to the applicant. The Commission for the study of metabolic diseases pointed out that certain works needed to be carried out in the third apartment with a view to making it fully adequate to the applicant\u2019s medical condition, and the Comprensorio stated that it would proceed with the works after the applicant\u2019s formal acceptance of the apartment.", "The applicant however refused to accept the third apartment and to leave the hospital.", "", "On 18 March 1999 the Director of the Trento Hospital, having learned that a suitable apartment had been put at the applicant\u2019s disposal, requested the latter to leave the hospital, as his presence there was not needed any more and the place he occupies in the hospital was necessary for other patients.", "On 24 March 1999 the applicant was formally discharged from hospital.
