The applicant, a limited liability company with its seat in Vienna, is the owner of the daily newspaper Der Standard.", "6. In its issue of 14 May 2004 Der Standard published an article in the domestic politics section under the heading \u201cGossip mongering\u201d (\u201cKolportiert\u201d). The article, which was entitled \u201cA society rumour\u201d (\u201cEin b\u00fcrgerliches Ger\u00fccht\u201d) commented on certain rumours relating to the marriage of Mr Klestil, the then Federal President. The article also appeared on the website of Der Standard. It read as follows:", "\u201cIf the stories circulating between the outlying district of D\u00f6bling and the city centre are to be believed, there is only one topic of conversation at the moment among the socalled upper crust of Viennese society: the marriage of the departing presidential couple Thomas Klestil and Margot Klestil-L\u00f6ffler [bold print in the original]. Rumour has it that not only is he about to leave office, but she is about to leave him. The latter claim has of course set tongues wagging furiously in bourgeois \u2013 and not-so-bourgeois \u2013 circles. People here like nothing better than to be able to express outrage about one of their own.", "In addition to the allegedly less-than-blissful domestic situation on the Hohe Warte [the Federal President\u2019s residence], there has been persistent gossip recently about the supposedly close ties between the First Lady, who is her husband\u2019s junior by 22 years, and other political figures. Head of the FP\u00d6 parliamentary group Herbert Scheibner [bold print in the original], for instance, is reported to be close to her (Scheibner has accompanied the presidential couple on a number of foreign trips). Ms L\u00f6ffler is also said to be well acquainted with the husband of the Canadian ambassador (unsurprisingly, given her post as head of the American department of the Foreign Affairs Ministry).", "The fact that the President\u2019s wife took a few days off recently to organise the move from the official residence to the couple\u2019s newly renovated home in Hietzing fuelled further speculation. So much so, in fact, that Klestil \u2013 never squeamish about putting his emotions on display \u2013 had the following pre-emptive statement published in his information bulletin, News [an Austrian weekly]: \u2018Rumours of a separation are nothing but idle gossip\u2019 he said. He added: As of 8 July we will be embarking on a new phase of our life together. Any assertions to the contrary are untrue.", "Be that as it may, the people are concerned for the well-being of their President. Apparently, the public information desk of the President\u2019s Office has recently had more callers than ever before enquiring about the state of the President\u2019s marriage. And more than a few of the callers made their enquiries in the ultra-refined tones of Sch\u00f6nbrunn.\u201d", "7. The article was accompanied by a picture of Mr Klestil and Mrs Klestil-L\u00f6ffler, looking in different directions.", "8. On 18 May 2004 Mr Klestil and Mrs Klestil-L\u00f6ffler brought proceedings under sections 6 and 7 of the Media Act (Mediengesetz) against the applicant company, claiming that the article published in Der Standard of 14 May 2004 reported on their marriage and family life and thus interfered with the strictly personal sphere of their lives.", "9. By judgment of 15 June 2004 the Vienna Regional Criminal Court (Landesgericht f\u00fcr Strafsachen) ordered the applicant company to pay compensation of 5,000 euros (EUR) to the first claimant, Mr Klestil, and EUR 7,000 to the second claimant, Mrs Klestil-L\u00f6ffler. Furthermore, the court ordered the applicant company to publish its judgment and to reimburse the claimants\u2019 costs.", "10. The Regional Court, referring to section 7 of the Media Act, held that the applicant company had reported on the strictly personal sphere of the claimants\u2019 lives in a manner that was likely to undermine them in public. It analysed the contents of the impugned article as alleging, on the one hand, that Mrs Klestil-L\u00f6ffler intended to divorce and, on the other hand, that she had close contacts with two men, thus describing her as a double adulteress and Mr Klestil as a deceived husband. In reply to the applicant company\u2019s defence that the article merely reported on a rumour, the Regional Court noted that even the dissemination of a rumour could breach section 7 of the Media Act, if it conveyed the impression that there was some truth in it.", "11. As to the applicant company\u2019s request to take evidence in order to show that the rumour had actually been spread at the time, the court noted that in cases concerning an infringement of the strictly personal sphere of a person\u2019s life, section 7 \u00a7 2 of the Media Act excluded the proof of truth (Wahrheitsbeweis), unless the statement at issue was directly related to public life. Such a direct link would exist, for instance, where a publication reported on the state of health of the Federal President which might prevent him from exercising his functions. However, the state of his marriage did not have any bearing on his capacity to exercise his functions nor did it have any other link with public life.", "12. In assessing the amount of compensation, the Regional Court had regard to the fact that Der Standard was a widely read newspaper and to the considerable degree of insult suffered by the claimants. In addition it noted that it was highly uncommon in Austria to report on (true or untrue) details of the private lives of politicians. Having regard to the above considerations and the need to deter other media from making similar publications, a relatively large amount of compensation appeared justified. The difference in the sums awarded was to the fact that the second claimant was described as a double adulteress, while the first claimant was \u201cmerely\u201d depicted as a deceived husband.", "13. The applicant company appealed. As a point of law it submitted that the Regional Court had wrongly refused its request for the taking of evidence. In its view the publication was directly related to public life within the meaning of section 7 \u00a7 2 of the Media Act. The claimants, being public figures, had made their private life part of their \u201cmarketing strategy\u201d. Like no other presidential couple before, they had kept the public informed about their marriage, starting with the first claimant\u2019s divorce from his former wife and his remarriage, to the second claimant. Moreover, the first claimant had relied heavily on family values during his first electoral campaign. He therefore had to accept that the public had an interest in being informed about his private life.", "14. As regards points of fact, the applicant company argued that the Regional Court had wrongly assessed the contents of the article at issue. Read in its proper context, the article did not state that Mrs Klestil-L\u00f6ffler actually intended to divorce and even less that she was an adulteress. On the contrary the article rather aimed at exposing the idle gossip propagated in certain upper-class circles. It clearly pointed to the absurdity of the rumour by explaining that the allegedly close ties of the second claimant with Mr Scheibner and with the husband of the Canadian ambassador had perfectly unsuspicious reasons. Seen in that light, the article did not even relate to the strictly personal sphere of the presidential couple but made fun of the gossip in bourgeois society.", "15. As regards the sentence the applicant company claimed that the compensation awards were excessive.", "16. While the appeal proceedings were pending, Mr Klestil died. By decision of 2 September 2004 the Vienna Regional Criminal Court discontinued the proceedings as regards Mr Klestil. On 9 December 2004 the Vienna Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht), on an appeal brought by Mr Klestil\u2019s estate, quashed the Regional Court\u2019s decision.", "17. By a judgment of 20 January 2005 the Vienna Court of Appeal upheld the Regional Court\u2019s judgment of 15 June 2004.", "18. It confirmed that in the present case, the proof of truth was excluded by section 7 \u00a7 2 of the Media Act. The applicant company\u2019s argument that the claimants were public figures and had exposed their private and marital life to the public eye like no other presidential couple before was not convincing. While the first claimant had relied on his family life and on his then marriage in his first campaign some twelve years ago, his marriage with Mrs Klestil-L\u00f6ffler had not played a role in his second campaign nor otherwise during his second period in office. Moreover, his second and last period in office had been drawing to a close at the time of the publication. In sum, the Regional Court had rightly found that the publication at issue was not directly related to public life. Consequently, it had rightly refused to take the evidence proposed by the applicant company.", "19. There was no basis for the applicant company\u2019s assertion that the article was aimed at unveiling the hypocrisy of the so called upper crust of Viennese society or that it described the rumours about the claimants\u2019 marriage as absurd. The Regional Court had rightly understood the article\u2019s contents as conveying rumours about the Federal President\u2019s marriage as if there was some truth in them.", "20. Finally, as regards the amounts granted in compensation, the Court of Appeal found that deterring other media from similar publications was not a relevant criterion. Nevertheless the other considerations relied on by the Regional Court justified the compensation awards.", "21. On 11 June 2004 Mr Scheibner brought proceedings under sections 6 and 7 of the Media Act against the applicant company in respect of the electronic version of the article, which had been published on the website of Der Standard and in respect of the print version. He alleged that the passage referring to him contained an untrue statement amounting to defamation.", "22. By judgment of 20 July 2004 the Vienna Regional Criminal Court ordered the applicant company to pay EUR 4,000 to Mr Scheibner as compensation for the publication in the printed version of Der Standard and EUR 2,000 as compensation for the publication on the website. Furthermore, the court ordered the applicant company to publish its judgment and to reimburse the claimant\u2019s costs.", "23. The court, arguing along the same lines as in its judgment of 15 June 2004 (see paragraphs 10-11 above), held that the applicant company had reported on the strictly personal sphere of the claimant\u2019s life in a manner that was likely to undermine him in public. It analysed the contents of the impugned article as alleging that the claimant, Mr Scheibner, who was a married man, had a close relationship with Mrs Klestil-L\u00f6ffler and therefore described him as an adulterer. Thus, his strictly personal sphere was affected. However, it found that the publication did not amount to defamation within the meaning of Article 111 of the Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch).", "24. As to the amount of compensation it considered that the insult as regards Mr Scheibner weighed less heavily than as regards the claimants in the first set of proceedings. In sum, compensation awards of EUR 4,000 as regards the publication in the paper version of Der Standard and EUR 2,000 for the publication on the website, which was less widely read, appeared appropriate.", "25. The applicant company and Mr Scheibner appealed, whereby the applicant company relied on the same grounds as in its appeal in the previous set of proceedings.", "26. On 22 December 2004 the Vienna Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant company\u2019s appeal but partly granted Mr Scheibner\u2019s appeal. It held that the impugned statement also breached Article 6 of the Media Act, since it fulfilled the objective elements of defamation as defined in Article 111 of the Criminal Code. The claimant was accused of adultery, which even in a liberal society was still considered an unlawful and dishonourable act. It considered however, that this had no influence on the amount of compensation to be paid, which was therefore upheld.", "27. As to the applicant company\u2019s appeal, the Court of Appeal again confirmed the Regional Court\u2019s reading of the contents of the article. It added that the placement of the article in the domestic politics section and its presentation including the picture of the presidential couple supported this assessment. Furthermore, the appellate court noted that the applicant company had not argued before the Regional Court that the publication was directly related to public life within the meaning of Article 7 \u00a7 2 of the Media Act.", "28. In any case, Mr Scheibner, though a public figure, had a right to respect for the strictly personal sphere of his life. Rumours about an alleged relationship between him and the wife of the Federal President had no link with his public functions and responsibilities and did therefore not justify the reporting at issue.", "29. Once the judgment of the Court of Appeal had become final, Mr Scheibner brought proceedings under the Civil Code (Allgemeines B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch) requesting an injunction ordering the applicant company to refrain from publishing any statement alleging that he had a relationship with Mrs Klestil-L\u00f6ffler.", "30. At the hearing of 22 April 2005 before the Vienna Commercial Court (Handelsgericht), the applicant company entered into a settlement with Mr Scheibner undertaking to refrain from publishing any such statement. The Commercial Court noted that according to constant case-law, a judgment under section 6 of the Media Act had binding effect in subsequent civil proceedings relating to the same facts. It ordered the applicant company to pay Mr Scheibner\u2019s procedural costs.", "31. The Commercial Court\u2019s judgment was served on the applicant company\u2019s counsel on 25 May 2005. The applicant company did not appeal.", "32. Section 6 of the Media Act provides for the strict liability of the publisher in cases of defamation; the victim can thus claim damages from him. In this context \u201cdefamation\u201d has been defined in Article 111 of the Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch), as follows:", "\u201c(1) Anybody who, in such a way that it may be noticed by a third person, attributes to another a contemptible characteristic or sentiment or accuses him of behaviour contrary to honour or morality and such as to make him contemptible or otherwise lower him in public esteem shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding six months or a fine ...", "(2) Anyone who commits this offence in a printed document, by broadcasting or otherwise in such a way as to make the defamation accessible to a broad section of the public, shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding one year or a fine ...", "(3) The person making the statement shall not be punished if it is proved to be true. In the case of the offence defined in paragraph 1 he shall also not be liable if circumstances are established which gave him sufficient reason to believe that the statement was true.\u201d", "33. Section 7 of the Media Act provides a claim for damages in cases of interference with the strictly personal sphere of an individual\u2019s life. In the version in force at the material time, it read as follows:", "\u201c(1) If the strictly personal sphere of an individual\u2019s life is discussed or portrayed in the media in a way liable to publicly undermine the individual concerned, he or she shall have the right to claim compensation for the damage sustained from the media proprietor (publisher). The amount of compensation may not exceed 14,535 euros; ...", "(2) The right referred to in paragraph 1 above shall not apply where:", "(i) the statements comprise an accurate account of a debate held during a public sitting of the National Council, the Federal Council, the Federal Assembly, a regional parliament or a committee of one of these general representative bodies;", "(ii) the statements published are true and are directly related to public life;", "(iii) it can be assumed from the circumstances that the person concerned had agreed to publication, or", "(iv) the statements were made during a live broadcast, and no employee or representative of the broadcaster failed to exercise proper journalistic care.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
