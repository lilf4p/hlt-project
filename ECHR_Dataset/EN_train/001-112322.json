The harassment, in their submission, was motivated by the first applicant\u2019s health and both applicants\u2019 Serbian origin. A larger group of children, also minors, came daily to a park in front of the applicants\u2019 flat, shouted obscenities at the first applicant, called him names and wrote insulting messages on the pavement.

He [I.M.] was holding a cigarette in his left hand ... and as he was passing Dalibor on his bicycle he [Dalibor] started to wave his hands and slapped him a few times on the hand in which he was holding the cigarette and thus Dalibor burned his hand. He was sure that he burned Dalibor only once and he was sorry for it.
