In the course of the proceedings the applicant amended his claim on three occasions.", "The applicant and the lawyer, who represented him in the proceedings, lodged ten motions with the court, requesting the latter to oblige the defendant company to provide copies of the contracts, which it had concluded with third parties allegedly due to the assistance of the applicant. According to him, although the court had allowed his motions and had made the requests, the defendant company had failed to submit copies of all such contracts and had refused to acknowledge that some of the contracts had existed.", "Out of thirty-five hearings scheduled by the court between May 1997 and May 2001 eleven were adjourned due to the absence of the applicant or of both parties and ten were adjourned because of the applicant\u2019s motions for calling of evidence.
