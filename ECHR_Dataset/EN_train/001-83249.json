The applicants, all siblings, were born in 1921, 1916, 1927, 1928, 1934 and 1943 respectively and live in Kavaja and Durr\u00ebs, Albania.", "6. During the communist regime several plots of land and two shops owned by the applicants\u2019 father were confiscated by the authorities without payment of compensation. The property, measuring in total 46,000 sq. m (the land) and 150 sq. m (the shops) (\u201cthe relevant property\u201d), was situated in the Kavaja region.", "7. On an unspecified date the applicants lodged an application with the Kavaja Property Restitution and Compensation Commission (Komisioni i Kthimit dhe Kompensimit t\u00eb Pronave \u2013 \u201cthe Commission\u201d) under the Property Act, seeking to have the relevant property returned to them.", "8.

Moreover, it decided not to rule on the adjacent plot of land measuring 30,500 sq. m, since agricultural property was outside its jurisdiction: rather the District Land Commission was the competent body pursuant to the Land Act (Law no. 7501 of 19 July 1991).", "9. On an unspecified date, in compliance with the Kavaja Commission\u2019s decision of 20 September 1996, the applicants took possession of the plot of land measuring 10,000 sq. m.", "10. Notwithstanding the applicants\u2019 requests, to date, the authorities have failed to comply with the parts of the Commission\u2019s decisions of 7 June 1995 and 20 September 1996 relating to the payment of compensation in respect of the shops and the plot of land measuring 5,500 sq. m.", "11.

On 11 November 1998 the Land Commission upheld the property claims of the applicants Sh. Ramadhi, R. Kapedani and R. Ramadhi (\u201cthe first three applicants\u201d) and dismissed those of the applicants Xh. Ramadhi, D. Ramadhi and N. Ramadhi (\u201cthe last three applicants\u201d) on the ground that the latter were not eligible to claim property rights over agricultural land, in so far as they were not resident in the area where the land was located.", "13. The first three applicants entered their ownership of the property in the Land Register. According to the ownership certificates, the applicants\u2019 titles nos. 462, 460 and 461 corresponded to the plots of land registered in the Register as nos. 89/15, 89/16 and 89/17 respectively.", "14. On 7 April 1999 the Land Commission, further to a request by the Ministry of Justice, declared the first three applicants\u2019 titles void on the basis that the decision of 11 November 1998 conflicted with substantive laws.", "15.

On 7 May 2001, by decision no. 366, the Kavaja Municipality held that it had no jurisdiction to enforce the decision on the ground that the Kavaja Land Commission, which would originally have had jurisdiction, had been dissolved pursuant to the Instruction of 8 November 1999 by the city\u2019s mayor.", "20. On 8 January 2003, the newly established Kavaja Land Commission, in compliance with the District Court\u2019s judgment of 4 February 2000, upheld the validity of the first three applicants\u2019 titles nos. 462, 460 and 461.", "21. The applicants maintained that the property issue was still unresolved since the local authorities had transferred the above-mentioned plots of land to third parties, so that the Commission decision was thus ineffective in practice.

Laws and other normative acts that relate to the expropriations and confiscations, adopted before the entry into force of this Constitution, shall be applied provided they are compatible with the latter.\u201d", "23. The Property Restitution and Compensation Act (Ligji p\u00ebr kthimin dhe kompensimin e pron\u00ebs) underwent several amendments during the past fourteen years.

Thus, hereinafter they will be referred to as the \u201cProperty Act 1993\u201d, the \u201cProperty Act 2004\u201d and the \u201cProperty Act 2006\u201d, respectively.", "The relevant provisions of each of these laws are abridged as follows:", "24. According to the Act of 1993 the former owners of properties expropriated by the relevant regime and their legal heirs had the right to claim the ownership over the original properties. Upon ownership being determined they were entitled either to have allocated the original immovable property or to be awarded compensation in kind (in a maximum of 10,000 sq. m) or in value if one of the following conditions was met: the alleged property (1) was pasture, meadow, forestry land, or agricultural or non-agricultural land; (2) was not subject to Law no. 7501 of 19 July 1991; (3) was currently State-owned; (4) had been designated as suitable for construction and is situated within the boundaries of a city.", "Section 16 of the Act provided for the following forms of compensation in respect of property which could not be restituted: (a) State bonds, equivalent to the compensation owed, and with a first option of acquiring shares in State enterprises being privatised by the Government or in other activities carried out through the granting of loans; (b) an equivalent plot of land or building site near to an urban area, in accordance with the general urban-development regulations; and (c) an equivalent plot of land in a tourist zone, in accordance with the general urban-development regulations.", "The Council of Ministers had the authority to define detailed rules for determining the methods and time-limits for such compensation to take place.", "25. Moreover, the 1993 Act instituted the Commission on Restitution and Compensation of Properties (Komisioni i Kthimit dhe Kompensimit t\u00eb Pronave) as the competent administrative body to deal with former owners\u2019 restitution and compensation of property claims. However, it omitted to provide a time-limit within which a decision could be appealed, thus preventing it from even becoming binding.", "26. The Property Act enacted in 2004, repealing the previous one, provided for two forms of restitution of immovable properties, namely the return, under certain circumstances, of the original property and compensation in the event of the impossibility for the authorities to return the original property. The restitution was not limited in size. The Act provided for five forms of compensation: (a) property of the same kind; (b) property of any other kind; (c) shares in State-owned companies; (d) the value of a State-owned property in the privatisation process, and (e) a sum of money corresponding to the value attributed to the property at the time of the decision (section 11). The Act instituted the State Committee for Property Restitution and Compensation (Komiteti Shteteror per Kthimin dhe Kompensimin e Pronave), composed of five members elected by Parliament. Its role was to decide on the lawfulness of district committees\u2019 decisions on restitution and compensation claims (sections 15 and 17). The Council of Ministers was to establish the rules and the criteria of these (sections 13).", "27. Section 19 provided for the enforcement of the decisions awarding compensation within the first six months of each financial year. On its entry into force, persons entitled to claim restitution or compensation had to lodge applications with the District Committee by 31 December 2007. The Act granted the Committee discretion to decide which form of compensation should be granted, but applicants could express in writing their preferred type of compensation. The District Committee\u2019s decision could be appealed to the State Committee (section 20) and to the district courts within thirty days of the date of issue of the Committee\u2019s decision.", "28. On 28 April 2005 Parliament adopted an Act, setting down the method by which immovable property would be valued for compensation purposes. Its implementation was left to the State Committee for the Compensation and Restitution of Properties, which was to issue the appropriate maps for the properties\u2019 valuation.", "29. In order to comply with the committees\u2019 decisions awarding pecuniary compensation, section 23 of the 2004 Act provided for the establishment of a ten-year Property Compensation Fund, whose aim was to provide financial support for such awards. The 2004 Act was examined by both the Constitutional and the Supreme Courts.", "On 24 March 2005 the Supreme Court, Joint Colleges, concluded that the Property Act of 2004 had no retroactive effect and that its provisions, could therefore, not have any impact on property rights recognised by administrative or court decisions given before its entry into force.", "30. On 17 July 2006 Property Act of 2004 was amended by means of the Property Act 2006 which entered into force on 17 August 2006. It provided, inter alia, for the establishment of the Agency for the Restitution and Compensation of Properties, a new body competent to decide restitution and compensation claims (section 15).
