On 3 June 1994 at about 4.30 a.m. while the applicant's brother, Sava\u015f Buldan, was leaving the casino at the \u00c7\u0131nar Hotel in the Ye\u015filyurt area of Istanbul, together with his two friends Adnan Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m and Hac\u0131 Karay, they were approached by seven or eight people with walkie-talkies, firearms and bullet-proof vests who introduced themselves as police officers. The three men were then forced into three cars.", "10. The applicant, who at this time was living in Turkey, was informed of what had happened to his brother at 5 a.m. that same day. With friends and family he began a search, especially along the Istanbul-Ankara motorway. Part of the search party came to an area called the Yedig\u00f6ller (Seven Lakes). This was a national park. According to the applicant, there was a shooting polygon situated therein, open only to members of the security forces and high-level State officials. The Government on the other hand deny the existence of such a shooting polygon. The search party met a watchman at the national park, who told them that 10 or 11 people in three cars had entered the area on the same day at about 7.30 a.m. The watchman then gave a description of the three vehicles that matched the description given by those who had witnessed the abduction at the \u00c7\u0131nar Hotel.", "11. When the applicant learnt about the kidnapping of his brother, he immediately contacted members of Parliament, the Governor of Istanbul and the media. The Office of the Prime Minister was also informed about the kidnapping. The applicant and his legal representative made a further written application to the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y public prosecutor's office. The initial enquiries made by the authorities showed that the three persons had not been taken into custody.", "12. The same day, Mr Nihat Buldan, one of Sava\u015f Buldan's brothers, submitted another petition to the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y public prosecutor's office in which he claimed that his brother and two of his brother's friends had been abducted by people who had identified themselves as plainclothes police officers. Mr Nihat Buldan requested the prosecutor to investigate the matter. The prosecutor asked the family members to go to the Ye\u015filk\u00f6y police headquarters, which was responsible for the area where the incident had taken place. The family members complied with this request but no written statements were taken from them at the police headquarters. The Ye\u015filk\u00f6y police headquarters informed the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y police headquarters and also the anti-terrorist branch of the police about the events on the same day.", "13. On 3 June 1994 at about 9 p.m., Mr \u0130smail Ta\u015fcan contacted the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca gendarmerie station within the district of Bolu, some 270 kilometres from where the three men had been abducted. He informed the gendarmes that he had seen three bodies in an area near the river where he had gone to fish. The same day at about 9.15 p.m. the gendarmerie arrived at the scene. During the preliminary search, no empty cartridges or other evidence could be found as it was very dark.", "14. The public prosecutor and two doctors arrived at the scene of the crime at about 11 p.m. The positions of the bodies were recorded. No documents or other property were found on the bodies which might establish their identities. It was further noted that valuable items such as gold rings and wrist watches were intact. The preliminary investigation of the bodies revealed that rigor mortis had set in and that the three men had been shot at point-blank range. Subsequently, at about 2.45 a.m. on 4 June 1994 the corpses were taken to the Health Centre in Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca for further examination.", "15. On the night of 3 June 1994, the gendarmerie in Bolu contacted the applicant and informed him that three corpses had been found in Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca.", "16. On 4 June 1994 the applicant identified the bodies of his brother and his two friends at the D\u00fczce State Hospital.", "17. On 4 June 1994 a statement was taken from Mr Sebahattin Uz, the doorman at the \u00c7\u0131nar Hotel. In his statement, Mr Uz explained that when the three persons who had disappeared, all of whom he knew as they were regular customers at the hotel casino, emerged from the hotel door sometime between 4.30 and 5 a.m. on 3 June 1994, six or seven persons, who had arrived in two cars, had approached them and held them against the wall and conducted body searches. The three persons were then put into a dark-coloured Mercedes car with registration number 34 CK 420. The doorman stated that he had overheard one of the men saying that they were police officers and that they would release the three persons as soon as statements had been taken from them. The Mercedes then left followed by the second car which, according to the doorman, was a sports car. The doorman was unable to describe any of the men as it was dark and they had been standing some distance from him.", "18. Also on 4 June 1994 a statement was taken from Mr H\u00fcseyin K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7, a security guard at the \u00c7\u0131nar Hotel. Mr K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 stated that seven or eight men had approached the three disappeared persons as they walked out the door. The men all wore waistcoats and were carrying weapons. They forced the three disappeared persons into the waiting cars, after having conducted body searches. This witness stated that one of the cars was a sports car.", "19. On 5 June 1994 a statement was taken from Mr Serdar \u00d6zdemir, who was a taxi driver waiting at the taxi rank outside the \u00c7\u0131nar Hotel. He stated that while waiting for customers, he had noticed three persons coming out of the casino. At that very moment, seven or eight men walked towards them, made the three persons face the wall and then searched them. Afterwards, the three were put into the waiting cars. One of the cars was a black-coloured Mercedes 300 SEL. The second car was a cherry-red Hyundai. The witness also recalled that he had seen a third car, a sports car, which had been driven away by one of the men wearing a waistcoat. The witness had been unable to see the licence plates of the cars or the faces of the seven or eight men.", "20. Again on 5 June 1994 another statement was taken from another taxi driver, Mr H\u00fcseyin Durmazer. Mr Durmazer stated that as he approached the taxi rank outside the hotel, he was able to see some people putting three other persons into a black car.", "21. The preliminary enquiries led the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y public prosecutor to issue a continuous search warrant on 23 June 1994, which was valid for ten years in accordance with the statutory limit stipulated for kidnapping.", "22. On 17 March 1995 the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y public prosecutor's investigation file, together with a report summarising the investigation, was forwarded to the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor in order to authorise him to investigate the killings since the bodies were found within his area of jurisdiction.", "23. When the bodies were brought to the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca Health Centre in the early hours of 4 June 1994, post mortem examinations of the bodies were carried out by two doctors in the presence of the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor. In the body examination report, it was noted that there was an ecchymosis measuring 1x1 cm and an abrasion on the surface of the knee cap of the second body that was later identified as that of Sava\u015f Buldan. It was further recorded that cyanosis was noted on the front part of the body, left leg upper part, left knee, genitals and the head. It was also perceived that rigor mortis was fading. It was observed that when the body was touched, the skin peeled - which was most probably due to its damp condition. One bullet entrance hall on right occipital area and burnt hair caused by a close-range shot and a bullet exit hole behind the right ear (which damaged the tissue, internal tissue and bones) were noted. A wide haematoma on the left eye due to trauma caused by a blunt object, fracture of the nose, and blood from the nostrils to the moustache area were also noticed. No other signs or abnormalities were observed either on the back of the body or the genital area. There were no documents to prove identification, nor were there any valuables or money. On the surface of the right hand and wrist a further ecchymosis measuring 1 cm. in width was noted, which was probably caused when the hands were tied with a rope. The doctors further concluded that as the cause of death was clearly cerebral haemorrhage, there was no need to conduct a classical autopsy. The estimated time of death was given as 10 hours before the autopsy was carried out.", "24. The bullets recovered from the bodies were sent for a ballistics examination to the Central Police Forensic Laboratory. The Central Police Laboratory prepared two forensic reports dated 6 and 14 June 1994. The ballistics report prepared by the Police Forensic Laboratory on 14 June 1994 showed that five spent bullet cases found at the scene of the killing had been discharged by three different pistols. The report also showed that two bullets recovered from the bodies of Sava\u015f Buldan and Hac\u0131 Karay had been fired from the same 9 mm. pistol. The report concluded that comparisons of the five spent bullet cases with other bullet cases recovered from the scenes of other unknown perpetrator killings since 1985 did not reveal any similarities.", "25. The bullets were then sent to the Gendarmerie Forensic Laboratory which prepared its own report on 17 June 1994. This report showed that the two bullets recovered from the bodies of Sava\u015f Buldan and Hac\u0131 Karay, both 9 mm and Parabellum type, had been fired from the same pistol. The report further concluded that comparisons of five spent bullet cases found at the scene of the killing with other bullet cases recovered from the scenes of other unknown perpetrator killings did not reveal any similarities. These ballistics reports, together with the photo fits of suspects, were sent to the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor on 21 June 1994.", "26. On 4 June 1994 the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor conducted a search of the scene of the crime in the presence of Mr \u0130smail Ta\u015fcan, who had found the bodies. During the examination, a person named Ms Ay\u015fe Ara\u00e7 told the public prosecutor that she had heard a gun shot in the morning of 3 June 1994.", "27. On 4 June 1994 the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca gendarmerie took statements from 13 persons who claimed to have seen three luxury cars travelling in the direction of the spot where the bodies were later found. One of these witnesses, Fevzi Ayd\u0131n, stated that at around 8 a.m. on 3 June 1994 he had been having his breakfast when he had seen three cars. The first car had stopped and one of the persons inside the car had asked him for directions to Bolu. The witness stated that it was a red car, but he was unable to remember the make of the car. There were two persons in the car, both around 40 years of age with one of them sporting a beard. The witness had also seen three persons in the third car. The witness was able to remember that the car registrations all started with '34', the prefix for cars registered in Istanbul. Most of the other witnesses also gave similar statements.", "28. On 6 June 1994 statements were taken from 11 other witnesses including a number of officials working at the Yedig\u00f6ller National Park. One of these witnesses, Muzaffer Y\u0131ld\u0131z, confirmed that the cars' licence plates all had the prefix '34'. The witness also stated that one of the passengers had asked for directions to the Yedig\u00f6ller National Park. Another witness, \u015eevket \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, similarly stated that he had seen the three cars and that he had also been asked for directions to the Yedig\u00f6ller National Park by a passenger in a Mercedes with darkened windows.", "29. On 7 June 1994 five more witnesses were questioned. These witnesses also stated that they had seen the three cars at 9 or 9.30 a.m. One of them stated that he had been asked for directions to Bolu.", "30. On 10 June 1994 all the witness statements and other documents were sent to the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor.", "31. On 21 June 1994 a statement was taken from Nihat Buldan, a brother of Sava\u015f Buldan. He stated that he had been told about the kidnapping which was said to have been carried out by persons claiming to be police officers. This was the reason why he had contacted the police to verify whether his brother had been taken into custody. The witness concluded his statement by stating that his brother had no enemies and that he did not suspect anyone. He requested that the perpetrators responsible for the kidnapping and the subsequent killing be apprehended.", "32. On 31 August 1995 the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor concluded in a continuous search warrant that it had not been possible to establish the identities of the perpetrators. The prosecutor further stated in this report that no evidence had been found during the investigation. It was decided, therefore, to issue a continuous search warrant for the perpetrators of the killings, which remained valid for twenty years, the statutory time limit under Article 102 of the Turkish Criminal Code. Copies of this search warrant were distributed to the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca gendarmerie and the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca police as well as to the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y public prosecutor in Istanbul so that they could inform the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor if they found the perpetrators. The prosecutor also instructed these authorities to continue to carry out meticulous searches for the perpetrators.", "33. On 10 January 1995 the Police Laboratory, which had carried out a forensic examination on a 9-mm Smith and Wesson pistol and 11 bullets found in a car in Istanbul, concluded that this weapon had not been used in any unknown perpetrator murder.", "34. On 4 June 1996 a statement was taken from Mr \u0130rfan Kur\u015funlu who had first seen the bodies together with his uncle at 8.15 p.m. on 3 June 1994. He stated that he had not heard any gun shots that day.", "35. Also on 4 June 1996 the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor visited the spot where the bodies had been found. He also went to take a statement from one Ay\u015fe Ara\u00e7 who claimed that she had heard gun shots on the day of the killing. The house of Ay\u015fe Ara\u00e7 was just outside Hac\u0131lar village and approximately two kilometres from the scene of the incident. In order to test whether this would have been possible, the prosecutor ordered a gendarmerie soldier to the incident scene and to fire a weapon similar to the one used in the killings. The prosecutor was able to hear the gun shot. The prosecutor summoned 12 persons who had seen the three cars on the day of the incident to his office in order to take further statements from them.", "36. On 6 June 1996 a gendarmerie non-commissioned officer visited the spot where the bodies had been found and prepared a report. According to this report, the scene of the incident was exactly 7,000 metres from Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca town centre. It was impossible for a person in Hac\u0131lar village, which was eight kilometres away, to have heard the gun shots. According to the experiments carried out that day, the maximum distance from which gun shots could have been heard was five kilometres.", "37. On 6 June 1996 a statement was taken by the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor from Ay\u015fe Uzun who had seen the three cars on the day of the incident. She stated that one of the cars had been a red Mazda with four persons in it. She had not seen any of the cars' number plates.", "38. On 6 June 1996 another statement was taken by the prosecutor from one Beng\u00fc \u00c7elebi who had also seen the three cars on the day of the incident. She was able to recall that one of the cars had been a red Mazda. She stated that there were three persons in the last car, which had darkened windows.", "39. On 7 June 1996 the Ministry of Justice informed the D\u00fczce public prosecutor about the application made to the former Commission by the applicant. The Ministry's letter stated that there were no documents in the investigation file showing that attempts had been made to trace the cars used in the kidnapping despite the fact that eyewitnesses had given the authorities the full registration number of one of the cars and the prefixes of the other two cars. In addition, some witnesses who lived near the spot where the three persons had been killed had stated that they had heard gun shots and that the timing of the gun shots coincided with the time of the killing. The Ministry's letter finally stated that although it was highly probable that further investigations would not produce any outcome, the investigating authorities should still take further steps in the investigation as this case would be scrutinised by the Commission which, in the past, had put prosecutors in difficulties when questioning them. The Ministry requested that the cars be traced, a check made as to whether witnesses could have heard the gun shots and whether any tyre marks had been subjected to forensic examination. It should also be confirmed with the local gendarmerie whether or not any of the witnesses had informed them on the morning of 3 June 1994 that they had heard gun shots.", "40. In response to the Ye\u015filk\u00f6y public prosecutor's office, on 15 November 1996 the Istanbul Security Department stated that the vehicle with registration number 34 CK 420 was a 1984 model, metallic grey Toyota which had belonged to a certain Mr J.H since 16 August 1995.", "41. Between 14 July 1998 and 24 August 1999 the area where the three bodies had been found was visited 20 times by the gendarmerie and the police in an attempt to find the perpetrators there. It had not been possible, however, to find the perpetrators or any other evidence at the place.", "42. After the Susurluk incident of 3 November 1996, the spent cartridges and bullets recovered from the scene were re-examined and compared with the bullets and cartridges of the guns found at the scene of the Susurluk incident by the Gendarmerie Criminal Laboratory. In a report dated 15 January 1997, it was concluded that there was no connection between them.", "43. On 7 February 1997 Hanefi Avc\u0131, who was the Head of Intelligence Branch of Istanbul Police Headquarters at the time, gave a statement to the public prosecutor in connection with the Susurluk incident. In his statement, Mr Avc\u0131 referred to the killings of Sava\u015f Buldan, Adnan Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m and Hac\u0131 Karay as the work of an illegal group. He further stated that, as that information was based on secret intelligence, he did not have any documents to prove the allegations. He was, however, of the opinion that, if an investigation was carried out into certain sources, it would be possible to find documents to verify the accuracy of these allegations. He was prepared to indicate those issues in respect of which it might be possible to find documents. Among his submissions, which were recorded in a seven-page statement, Mr Avc\u0131 stated, inter alia, the following:", "\u201cThe Gendarmerie and the National Intelligence Service (Milli \u0130stihbarat Te\u015fkilat\u0131, hereinafter MIT) became concerned about the financial assistance being provided to the PKK from certain members of the Kurdish community, which they felt accounted for its increased activity between 1991 and 1993. They did not feel that they had enough evidence to bring charges and consequently some officers from the Police, Gendarmerie and MIT started talking about using different methods of dealing with certain members of the Kurdish community. A special team was formed for this purpose by, inter alia, the Chief of Police, Mehmet A\u011far and the Chief of Special Forces, Korkut Eken. This team consisted both of members of the Special Forces and certain civilians, including Ya\u015far \u00d6z. The activities of this special team were known to other members of the MIT and the Intelligence Branch of the Gendarmerie (the J\u0130TEM). The kidnapping and the killing of Sava\u015f Buldan and his friends formed part of such activities. It was established that these persons were helping the PKK financially. The way they were kidnapped and killed did not bear any resemblance to the activities of a Mafia or other underground organisation known to us. Police identity cards and policing methods were used during the kidnapping of Sava\u015f Buldan and his friends, otherwise it would not have been possible to kidnap them and to kill them as there are checkpoints on the roads along which they would have been stopped. To go through these checkpoints could only have been possible by making use of an official title\u201d.", "44. On 24 March 1997 Hanefi Avc\u0131 was interrogated once again in Ankara at the request of the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor. In his statement, Mr Avc\u0131 stated that he did not know how and by whom the killings were carried out.", "45. On 11 March 1997 the police officers Ercan Ersoy, O\u011fuz Yorumaz and Ayhan \u00c7ark\u0131n, who were in detention as a result of the investigation into the Susurluk incident, were shown to the eyewitnesses to the abduction, H\u00fcsn\u00fc Durmazel and Sabahhattin Uz. However, the eyewitnesses stated that they had not seen these persons before.", "46. The photo-fit drawings of the three abductors made on the basis of the statements of the witnesses were compared with the photographs of Ercan Ersoy, O\u011fuz Yorulmaz and Ayhan \u00c7ark\u0131n at the Criminal Police Laboratory. In the laboratory report, dated 19 March 1997, it was stated that the photo-fits did not have the necessary facial characteristics to make a positive comparison.", "47. On 23 February 1998 the lawyer representing the families of the other two deceased persons lodged a petition with the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor's office. He requested that the photograph of the red car, belonging to Tar\u0131k Umit, which was found abandoned after his abduction, be shown to the witnesses heard in Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca. When the photograph of the red sports car with registration number 34 ZU 478 was shown to Ali Osman Sivri, Halit Sivri and Fevzi Ayd\u0131n, who had given statements about the incident in 1994, they all stated that it was not like the car they had seen that day, and that a long time had elapsed since the incident.", "48. The photo-fits were also compared with the photograph of Ya\u015far \u00d6z, another suspect detained in connection with the Susurluk investigation. The report of the criminal laboratory dated 27 March 1998 concluded that one of the photo-fits bore resemblances to the photograph and that the person in the photo-fit could be Ya\u015far \u00d6z. Accordingly, on 20 April 1998 the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca Magistrates' Court issued an arrest warrant for Ya\u015far \u00d6z. At that time, Mr \u00d6z was detained in the Metris prision in Istanbul in connection with another crime. On 5 May 1998 Ya\u015far \u00d6z gave a statement to the public prosecutor. He stated that he had not been in Istanbul between 1 April 1994 and October 1994 and that he did not know who had carried out the kidnapping on 3 June 1994. He further stated that he did not fit the description of any of the abductors as he had had a beard at the time of the kidnapping. Mr \u00d6z explained that this fact could be easily verified because he had given an interview to a local television channel in Milas at around the time of the kidnapping. On 7 May 1998 Ya\u015far \u00d6z was formally arrested by the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y Magistrates' Court.", "49. On 14 May 1998 the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca Criminal Court rejected the appeal of Ya\u015far \u00d6z against the decision ordering his arrest for the kidnapping and killing of the applicant's brother and the other two persons. On 29 May 1998 an identity parade was held in the prison where Ya\u015far \u00d6z was being detained on remand. Both Mr Sebahattin Uz, the doorman at the \u00c7\u0131nar Hotel, and Mr H\u00fcsn\u00fc Durmazer, the taxi driver who had witnessed the kidnapping on 3 June 1994, stated that Ya\u015far \u00d6z, who was included in a line-up of ten persons, was not one of the men who had carried out the kidnapping. On 14 July 1998 Ali Osman Sivri was questioned by the public prosecutor. Mr Sivri was a watchman working at the Karadere Forest, which was on the road to the Yedig\u00f6ller National Park. He referred to his previous statement which he had given on 7 June 1994 and stated that he had only seen a red car stop outside his office in the forest at around 10.30 a.m. on 3 June 1994. One person got out of the car and filled a container with water from a fountain and left. This witness was unable to recognise the red sports car with registration number 34 ZU 478. He was also shown pictures of Ya\u015far \u00d6z. The witness stated that the person he had seen did not look like Ya\u015far \u00d6z.", "50. On 24 July 1998 the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor took a decision of non-jurisdiction in respect of Ya\u015far \u00d6z. The prosecutor sent the investigation file to the Ankara State Security Court which, in the prosecutor's opinion, was the competent court to prosecute Mr \u00d6z.", "51. On 7 October 1998 the public prosecutor attached to the Ankara State Security took a decision of non-jurisdiction in respect of Ya\u015far \u00d6z. The prosecutor concluded that there was insufficient evidence to suggest that the killings had been carried out by or on behalf of an illegal organisation. He therefore concluded that the State Security Court did not have jurisdiction in this matter. The file was sent to the D\u00fczce public prosecutor, who later transferred the file to the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor.", "52. On 2 November 1998 the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor, noting that Ya\u015far \u00d6z had been arrested and put on trial for the killings, decided to continue the search for the other perpetrators. The prosecutor also asked the D\u00fczce public prosecutor to charge Ya\u015far \u00d6z, who, according to the evidence gathered by the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor, was one of the perpetrators of the kidnappings and subsequent killings.", "53. On 16 November 1998 the D\u00fczce public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the D\u00fczce Assize Court. The prosecutor alleged that the evidence justified the prosecution of Ya\u015far \u00d6z for the murder of the applicant's brother and his two friends.", "54. During the proceedings before the D\u00fczca Assize Court, the court took into consideration the indictment which had been submitted to the Istanbul State Security Court on 29 April 1997 and which dealt with Ya\u015far \u00d6z's role in the Susurluk affair. The D\u00fczce Assize Court noted that, according to this indictment, Ya\u015far \u00d6z was a notorious international drugs trafficker who held three official service passports, two of which were in the names of Tar\u0131k \u00dcmit and E\u015fref \u00c7u\u011fdar.", "55. The D\u00fczce Assize Court finally noted that Ya\u015far \u00d6z's name had been implicated in the Susurluk Report which had concluded that the fight against terrorism had gained momentum in 1993 when Mehmet A\u011far was appointed head of the General Police Headquarters in Ankara. According to this Report, there had been a number of unknown perpetrator murders in the area between Izmit, Adapazar\u0131 and Bolu after the then prime minister declared publicly that she had in her possession a list containing the names of those businessmen who were supporting the PKK. The Report further stated that the killings of Sava\u015f Buldan, Beh\u00e7et Cant\u00fcrk, Vedat Ayd\u0131n, Medet Serhat Y\u00f6\u015f and Metin Can formed part of such activities.", "56. Recalling that Sava\u015f Buldan, Adnan Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m and Hac\u0131 Karay had been kidnapped by seven persons and then killed in the area between Izmit, Adapazar\u0131 and Bolu, the D\u00fczce Assize Court held that these killings resembled the above-mentioned killings in the same area. Considering that the defendant was already facing prosecution before another court for membership of an organisation which was allegedly responsible for killing persons who had much in common with the deceased persons in the present case and as there was no other evidence to suggest that these killings were carried out for personal reasons, the D\u00fczce Assize Court concluded on 24 November 1998 that it was precluded from examining the merits of the case for reasons of jurisdiction.", "57. The case file was transferred to the Ankara State Security Court which had jurisdiction to deal with cases involving organised crime. On 16 December 1998 the Ankara State Security Court concluded that it too did not have jurisdiction to deal with the case. The court held that according to the D\u00fczce public prosecutor's indictment of 16 November 1998, Ya\u015far \u00d6z was charged with multiple murders. The indictment had made no reference to organised crime and the court did not have jurisdiction to examine this allegation ex officio. The case file was sent to the Court of Cassation in order to resolve the dispute over jurisdiction.", "58. On 25 February 1999 the Fifth Criminal Chamber of the Court of Cassation, upholding the decision of the Ankara State Security Court, ruled that the D\u00fczce Assize Court had jurisdiction to deal with the case.", "59. Seven hearings were held before the D\u00fczce Assize Court in the course of the criminal proceedings against Ya\u015far \u00d6z. Nihat Buldan, one of Sava\u015f Buldan's brothers, joined the proceedings as a civil party. Ya\u015far \u00d6z told the court that there was no evidence to link him to the killings and that the only reason for putting him on trial was to prove to the European courts that the killings were being investigated. 19 eyewitnesses, who had either seen the three men being put into the cars outside the hotel in Istanbul or had seen the three cars near the spot where these persons were killed, stated during the hearings that they had never seen Ya\u015far \u00d6z before.", "60. On 18 November 1999 the D\u00fczce Assize Court acquitted Ya\u015far \u00d6z of the charge of multiple murders due to lack of evidence. The case file was sent back to the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor's office to continue the search for the perpetrators.", "61.

After receiving the report in January 1998, the Prime Minister made it available to the public, although eleven pages and certain annexes were withheld.", "64. The introduction states that the Report was not based on a judicial investigation and did not constitute a formal investigation report. It was intended for information purposes and purported to do no more than describe certain events which had occurred mainly in south-east Turkey and which tended to confirm the existence of unlawful dealings between political figures, government institutions and clandestine groups.", "65. The Report analyses a series of events, such as murders carried out under orders, the killings of well-known figures or supporters of the Kurds and deliberate acts by a group of \u201cinformants\u201d supposedly serving the State, and concludes that there was a connection between the fight to eradicate terrorism in the region and the underground relations that formed as a result, particularly in the drug-trafficking sphere. In the Report, reference is made to the killing of the applicant's brother:", "\u201cAll the relevant State bodies were aware of these activities and operations. ... When the characteristics of the individuals killed in the operations in question are examined, the difference between those Kurdish supporters who were killed in the region in which a state of emergency had been declared and those who were not lay in the financial strength the latter represented in economic terms. These factors also operated in the murder of Sava\u015f Buldan, a smuggler and pro-PKK activist. (page 74).\u201d", "66. The Report concludes with numerous recommendations, such as improving co-ordination and communication between the different branches of the security, police and intelligence departments; identifying and dismissing security force personnel implicated in illegal activities; limiting the use of \u201cconfessors\u201d; reducing the number of village guards; terminating the use of the Special Operations Bureau outside the south-east region and incorporating it into the police force outside that area; opening investigations into various incidents; taking steps to suppress gang and drug-smuggling activities; and recommending that the results of the Grand National Assembly Susurluk inquiry be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for the relevant proceedings to be undertaken.", "67.
