On 27 October 1998 at 1 p.m. a group of 43 women belonging to \u201cMothers for Peace\u201d, including the applicant, arrived at the provincial branch of the Motherland Party (Anavatan Partisi (ANAP)) in Istanbul in order to meet that party\u2019s provincial leaders. Two women who received them at the entrance of the building stated that there was a press conference in progress, asked them to wait in the waiting room, which was on the third floor of the building, and left.", "6. Five to ten minutes later, police officers arrived in the waiting room, threw a smoke bomb inside and entered. A police officer hit the applicant on the back of her head with a truncheon, grabbed her hair and dragged her down the stairs. She was then put in a police vehicle and taken to the Beyo\u011flu police headquarters.", "7. On the same day at 3.50 p.m. the applicant, along with the other 42 women, was examined by a doctor at the Beyo\u011flu branch of the Forensic Medicine Institute. According to the medical report, the applicant had oedemas on her neck and scalp. The doctor considered that the injuries rendered the applicant unfit to work for three days.", "8. The applicant spent the night in a cell with 10 other women at the police headquarters. Police officers came to the cell two or three times and insulted and beat the detainees each time.", "9. On 28 October 1998 the applicant was examined by the same doctor at the Beyo\u011flu branch of the Forensic Medicine Institute, who noted no new injuries on the applicant\u2019s body.", "10. On the same day, the applicant and the other 42 women were brought before the Beyo\u011flu Magistrates\u2019 Court. They were questioned about whether they had deprived Y.U., the person who was in charge of the coffee bar in the waiting room, of his liberty and whether they had resisted the police officers who had arrested them. They all contended that they had neither deprived Y.U. of his liberty nor resisted the police officers. The court remanded five women in custody and ordered the release of the others, including the applicant.", "11. On 27 October 1998 a group of 43 women, including the applicant, entered the premises of the provincial branch of the Motherland Party in Istanbul after a press conference had been held by the party\u2019s Vice-President. They occupied the premises with the aim of protesting against a meeting which would be held there and attended by the party members. The security forces attempted to lead the women out of the building in order to prevent possible clashes between them and the party members. Three of the women, including the applicant, resisted the police and used physical violence. All 43 women were then arrested and taken to the Beyo\u011flu branch of the Forensic Medicine Institute for a medical examination. Subsequently, they were taken to the Beyo\u011flu police headquarters.", "12. The police took statements from Y.U., who maintained that the women who had occupied the premises had beaten four party members and deprived him of his liberty. He further stated that they had resisted the police officers during the arrest.", "13.

On 4 November 1999 the Beyo\u011flu Assize Court acquitted the applicant and the other accused. In its judgment, the trial court noted that the accused women were members of \u201cMothers for Peace\u201d and that they had visited the Motherland Party in order to hold a meeting with the members of that party with a view to informing them of their problems. The court further noted that there was no evidence in the case file demonstrating that the members of \u201cMothers for Peace\u201d had committed an offence. In particular, they had not deprived Y.U. of his liberty or damaged the building. Nor had they had any objects on their person which could have been used to commit offences. Furthermore, no complaint had been lodged against them by the party members who had allegedly been beaten by them. The court further observed that there was no evidence that the accused had resisted the police as no officer had been injured in the course of the arrest. On the contrary, some of the women, including the applicant, had sustained injuries.", "15. According to the information in the case file, no appeal was lodged against the judgment of 4 November 1999.", "16.

On an unspecified date the Beyo\u011flu public prosecutor initiated an investigation. Within the context of this investigation, on 26 May 1999 the applicant made statements to the public prosecutor and reiterated her allegations. On the same day, she was examined by a doctor, who noted that there were no injuries on her body.

On 8 October 1999 the Beyo\u011flu public prosecutor issued a decision not to prosecute F.M.S. in respect of the applicant\u2019s allegation. In his decision, the prosecutor noted that there was insufficient evidence to suggest that F.M.S. had ill-treated the applicant, who had participated in an illegal meeting and resisted the police. The public prosecutor considered that the force employed by the police had not been excessive and that they had acted within the scope of their duties.", "19. The decision of 8 October 1999 was not served on the applicant or her representatives. One of the applicant\u2019s representatives obtained a copy of the decision from the Fatih public prosecutor\u2019s office in October 2002.", "20.
