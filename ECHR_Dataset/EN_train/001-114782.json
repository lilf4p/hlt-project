The applicant worked as a professor of philosophy at the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Zagreb (Filozofski fakultet Sveu\u010dili\u0161ta u Zagrebu - hereinafter the \u201cFaculty\u201d).", "6. On 2 March 1994 the Dean of the Faculty (hereinafter: the \u201cDean\u201d), relying on section 21(1) and (2) of the Employment Relations Act, suspended the applicant from work (stavljen na \u010dekanje) for a period of six months on the minimum salary on the grounds that his job had become redundant. The applicant appealed against that decision to the Dean but his appeal was dismissed on 2 May 1994.", "7. On 7 March 1995 the Dean, relying on section 23(1) of the Employment Relations Act, issued a decision to terminate the applicant\u2019s employment.", "8. On 26 May 1994 the applicant brought a civil action in the Zagreb Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Zagrebu) contesting the Dean\u2019s decisions of 2 March 1994 and 2 May 1994 and seeking payment of his full salary. The case file was assigned number Pr-1158/94. This subsequently changed a number of times and the case bore numbers Pr-3166/97, Pr-1143/99 and Pr-4675/00.", "9. On 12 June 1995 the Zagreb Municipal Court declared the Faculty\u2019s decisions of 2 March 1994 and 2 May 1994 null and void and ordered that the applicant\u2019s salary for the period claimed be paid to him on the ground that the Faculty\u2019s decisions had been based on its lack of money for salaries which was not a lawful reason for suspending the applicant\u2019s employment.", "10. The Faculty appealed against the above-mentioned judgment to the Zagreb County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Zagrebu), and on 11 November 2007 that court quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case to the Zagreb Municipal Court for re-examination, on the grounds that all the relevant facts had not been established.", "11. On 17 September 1998 the Zagreb Municipal Court declared the Faculty\u2019s decisions of 2 March 1994 and 2 May 1994 null and void on the same grounds as before ordering it to pay the salary claimed by the applicant.", "12. Following an appeal by the Faculty, on 23 March 1999 the Zagreb County Court again quashed the first-instance judgment of the Zagreb Municipal Court and ordered a re-examination on the ground that the first-instance court had misinterpreted the relevant law.", "13. The applicant complained to the Zagreb Municipal Court on 7 October 1999 that the Zagreb County Court had treated him differently from other parties in similar cases.", "14. On 9 December 1999 the Zagreb Municipal Court again declared the Faculty\u2019s decisions of 2 March 1994 and 2 May 1994 null and void and ordered that salary claimed by the applicant be paid to him, stating that there had been no legal ground on which to suspend the applicant.", "15. Following a further appeal by the Faculty, on 27 June 2000 the Zagreb County Court quashed the first-instance judgment and ordered a re-examination, reiterating its previous reasoning that the Zagreb Municipal Court had failed to establish all the relevant facts.", "16. On 21 November 2002 the Zagreb Municipal Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s action, on the ground that the Faculty\u2019s decision to suspend the applicant\u2019s employment had been lawful.", "17. The applicant appealed against the above judgment, and on 18 January 2005 a panel of judges at the Zagreb County Court, including Judge D.M., dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal and upheld the Zagreb Municipal Court\u2019s judgment of 21 November 2002. In its decision the court referred, in passim, to the parallel civil proceedings the applicant had instituted against the Dean\u2019s decision of 7 March 1995 terminating his employment (see paragraph 23). That part of the Zagreb County Court\u2019s judgment reads as follows:", "\u201cThe case file shows that in case no. Pr-3903/99 [pending before the Zagreb Municipal Court] a judgment was adopted whereby the plaintiff\u2019s action challenging the defendant\u2019s decision of 7 March 1995 to permanently terminate the plaintiff\u2019s employment with the defendant was dismissed.\u201d", "18. The applicant then lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) on 20 March 2005.", "19. In this appeal the applicant, inter alia, challenged Judge D.M. on grounds of bias. The applicant explained that in the parallel civil proceedings (case no. Pr-1158/95), Judge D.M. had sat as the president of the panel of the first-instance court. In those proceedings Judge D.M. had delivered the judgment against the applicant, to which the County Court had referred in its judgment of 18 January 2005 (see paragraphs 17 and 27). However, Judge D.M.\u2019s judgment in those proceedings had later been quashed and the case remitted to the Zagreb Municipal Court for re-examination, after which that judge had on the resumption of proceedings, expressed a hostile attitude towards the applicant\u2019s representative on several occasions and had eventually issued the decision to stay those proceedings pending the outcome of the case no. Pr-1158/94 (see paragraphs 23-29).", "20. On 21 December 2006 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law. The relevant part of the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment reads as follows:", "\u201cThe appellant considers that there was a serious breach of procedure in that the judge who had sat as the first-instance judge in proceedings between the same parties before the Zagreb Municipal Court no. Pr-3903/99, had also sat in the panel which handed down the second-instance judgment.", "...", "... there is no serious breach of procedure raised by the plaintiff because, under section 71 subsection 5 of the Civil Procedure Act, a judge is disqualified from sitting in a case only if he or she had previously participated in the same proceedings before a lower court, whereas the plaintiff in his appeal on points of law refers to a judge of the second-instance court who did not sit as the first-instance judge in the case at issue but in another case before a lower court. \u201d", "21. The applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) on 24 March 2007, in which he complained, inter alia, of the lack of impartiality of Judge D.M.", "22. On 26 November 2009 the Constitutional Court declared the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint inadmissible. It found that even though the applicant had correctly relied on the relevant Articles of the Constitution, he had not substantiated his complaint by any constitutional law arguments but had merely repeated those arguments raised in the proceedings before the ordinary courts. Therefore, the Constitutional Court was unable to examine the merits of his constitutional complaint. Its decision was served on the applicant\u2019s representative on 23 December 2009.", "23. On 8 May 1995 the applicant brought a civil action in the Zagreb Municipal Court, asking that the Dean\u2019s decision of 7 March 1995 be declared null and void and that all the money he had claimed be paid to him. The case file was assigned number Pr-1158/95. This subsequently changed and the case bore numbers Pr-3903/99 and Pr-10588/01.", "24. Judge D.M. presided over the panel of the Zagreb Municipal Court in this case.", "25. On 10 April 1997 the Zagreb Municipal Court accepted the applicant\u2019s claim and ordered that his salary be paid on the ground that the applicant should not have been made redundant from work because of the Faculty\u2019s lack of financial means.", "26. Following an appeal by the Faculty on 7 November 1997, the Zagreb County Court on 23 March 1999 quashed the first-instance judgment and ordered a re-examination of the case on the ground that all the relevant facts had not yet been established.", "27. On 22 March 2001 a panel of the Zagreb Municipal Court, presided over by Judge D.M., dismissed the applicant\u2019s action on the ground that the impugned decision had been based on the relevant law.", "28. The applicant lodged an appeal and on 20 November 2001 the Zagreb County Court quashed the judgment of 22 March 2001 and ordered a re-examination, on the ground that all the relevant facts had not been established.", "29. On 22 May 2003 Judge D.M., acting as the president of the panel of the Zagreb Municipal Court, ordered that those proceedings be stayed until the adoption of a final decision in the case no. Pr-1158/94, since the outcome of those proceedings was crucial to the case.", "30. The applicant lodged an appeal, complaining, inter alia, that Judge D.M. had expressed a hostile attitude towards his representative and his complaint.", "31.
