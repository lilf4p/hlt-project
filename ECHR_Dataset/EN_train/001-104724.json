In cell no. 130 the window glass had been replaced with a layer of veneer, which also prevented daylight from entering the cell. The window in cell no. 132, in which the applicant had been held for two weeks in February 2008, faced a wall, in addition to the above-mentioned arrangements.", "44. Until April-May 2008 the artificial lighting in cells nos. 122, 124, 129, 130, 132 and 135 consisted of one 60-watt filament light bulb per cell.

The inmates were not provided with adequate medical assistance.", "55. The applicant\u2019s complaints about the conditions of his detention had availed nothing. Neither he nor the witnesses who could confirm his allegations were ever questioned on the circumstances of which he complained.", "56.

In his submission, wing 2/1 was reserved for inmates sentenced to life imprisonment at first instance pending the examination of their cases on appeal. The conditions of detention in all the cells were nearly identical. There were no chairs or desks in the cells. The beds were made of concrete. The cells were in a deplorable state.

Z. provided the following account of the conditions in wing 2/1 of facility IZ-47/1 in St Petersburg:", "\u201cFrom 30 March 2006 to 19 April 2007 and from 4 December 2007 to the present I have been detained in wing 2/1 of St Petersburg IZ-47/1. From December 2007 I was held in cell no. 129, and [the applicant] was held in cell no. 130. The conditions in those cells were horrible. The walls were half-destroyed. The ceiling was crumbling. The floor was made of concrete. The heating did not function; the cells were very cold. There were no hot water taps. Ventilation was non-existent. The cells were very dim since filament bulbs over 60 watts were prohibited; the only lamp in the cell was fitted with a 40-watt filament bulb ... The cells were overrun by rodents (rats, mice).", "...", "In April 2008 I was transferred to cell no. 134, and [the applicant] was moved to cell no. 135. The conditions in those cells were identical to the conditions described above.", "On 12 November 2008 I was transferred to cell no. 121, and in June 2009 I learned that [the applicant] was being held in cell no. 119. The floor and the ceiling in these cells are painted, but they are crumbling; the concrete floor is covered with a piece of linoleum. The remaining conditions are identical to those described above. ...\u201d", "59. According to the applicant, on 28 October 2007 in the afternoon the door of the cell where he was being held (cell no. 74 at the time) burst open and two prison officers entered and ordered the applicant and his inmates to leave the cell. The purpose of the operation was to make the detainees abandon a collective hunger strike. As soon as the detainees left the cell they were attacked by the \u201cTayfun\u201d special-purpose unit (\u043e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u201c\u0422\u0430\u0439\u0444\u0443\u043d\u201d \u0413\u0423\u0418\u041d). The officers of the unit wore balaclavas and used rubber truncheons to hit the detainees. The applicant saw that inmates from other cells were also being beaten up. As a result of the blows he received the applicant lost consciousness and regained it only when locked back in the cell.", "60. On the following day the applicant was placed in the punishment cell for ten days for alleged disobedience. Since he could not walk after the beatings he was helped by two wardens.", "61. According to the Government, a rubber truncheon was used against the applicant for the purpose of repelling an attack by him on a prison officer. They submitted a report on the use of a rubber truncheon against the applicant dated 28 October 2007, accompanied by a medical certificate drawn up following the examination of the applicant after the incident. The certificate recorded multiple abrasions in the area of the applicant\u2019s back and a haematoma in the region of his right knee.", "62. On 1 November and 2 November 2007 the applicant complained about the beatings to the public prosecutor\u2019s office.", "63. In its reply dated 14 December 2007 the St Petersburg public prosecutor\u2019s office informed the applicant as follows:", "\u201cIn the course of the inquiry [conducted into the applicant\u2019s allegations of illtreatment] it was established that on 28 October 2007 the prison officers of SIZO-1 had been carrying out a technical inspection of cell no. 74 where [the applicant] was held at the material time. In the course of the inspection [the applicant] refused to comply with the lawful orders given by the prison officers. In order to put a stop to [the applicant\u2019s] unlawful actions physical force and special means had been used against him in accordance with section 45 of the Federal Law on the detention of persons suspected of and charged with criminal offences.", "...", "Taking into account the foregoing, at the present time there are no grounds for the prosecutor\u2019s office to intervene.\u201d", "64. Further, on 27 August 2008 an investigator from the Kalininskiy District investigating department of the St Petersburg public prosecutor\u2019s office refused to institute criminal proceedings concerning the use of special means against the applicant. The decision read as follows:", "\u201cIn the course of the inquiry it was established that on 28 October 2007 on the territory of IZ-47/1 a general search was conducted by prison officers of [the above facility] aimed at finding and seizing prohibited items. During the search certain detainees ... broke the rules by failing to abide by the lawful orders of the [prison officers] and insulting [them], as a result of which physical force and special means were used against them.", "Therefore, physical force and special means were lawfully applied to [the applicant] since he had not abided by the lawful orders of the prison officers, a fact confirmed by the medical certificate, the report on the use of a rubber truncheon and the submissions by [four officers involved in the incident] ...\u201d", "65. On 27 July 2009 the acting head of the Kalininskiy District investigating department annulled the above decision, finding as follows:", "\u201cIn the course of the study of the material in the case file it was established that the inquiry had been incomplete.", "Therefore the decision [of 27 August 2008] was made prematurely and must be annulled.", "In the course of the additional inquiry it is necessary to question [the applicant], to obtain and examine the [applicant\u2019s] medical documents, to question the head of the \u201cTayfun\u201d special-purpose unit, and to take other measures required in order to reach a decision.\u201d", "66. The applicant has yet to be informed of the outcome of the additional inquiry. No information was provided by the Government in that regard.", "67.

They submitted a report on the use of physical force against the applicant dated 14 February 2008, accompanied by a medical certificate concerning the examination of the applicant after the incident. The certificate indicated that no visible injuries had been detected on the applicant\u2019s body. The Government further submitted statements by three prison officers, according to which in the course of the search conducted in cell no. 130, where the applicant was detained at the material time, the latter had behaved defiantly, had threatened the prison officers, had not responded to warnings and had prevented the officers from carrying out the search. After a mobile phone had been found in the cell the applicant had pounced on one of the prison officers and the latter had had to use physical force against him. The applicant had displayed active physical resistance and had tried to administer blows and kicks, following which he had been forced to the floor. Since he continued to resist, a painful hold (\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043e) had been applied to him and he had been put back in the cell.", "69.
