The first applicant was born in 1956 and the second applicant in 1977. They live in Ingushetia.", "7. The first applicant is married and has four children. Until 1999 he and his family lived in Grozny. In October 1999, because of the hostilities, they moved to the neighbouring republic of Ingushetia and settled in the village of Verkhny Alkun, Sunzhenskiy District, which is near the border with the Chechen Republic. There the first applicant and his family owned and tended several cows.", "8. On 8 September 2001 the village elder and the head of the administration went to the military unit of the border troops stationed near the village to warn them that on the following day the villagers were going to cut grass for hay in the meadows, and to indicate that the servicemen should not shoot at them. The commander of the military unit gave assurances that there would be no shooting.", "9. On 9 September 2001 the first applicant, together with his youngest son and other villagers (14 persons altogether, including women and children) went to the meadow to cut grass for hay. At about 10 a.m. the villagers were shot at from the nearby forest, where the troops were stationed. The first applicant\u2019s nephew, Mr A.K., born in 1984, was wounded in both legs. The first applicant and other villagers tied his wounds to stop the heavy bleeding and started shouting to the soldiers, who were 100-200 metres away, that they should stop shooting and that a boy had been wounded. However the shooting and shelling continued for about an hour.", "10. The first applicant and two women tied a handkerchief to a raised stick and walked up to the closest armoured personnel carrier (APC), shouting \u201cDon\u2019t shoot! There is a wounded person here!\u201d An officer in the APC told the first applicant that he would ask the others not to shoot and told him to get the other men out of the field. The villagers got into the Gaz-66 minivan in which they had arrived at the meadow and went down the hill to the village.", "11. At the edge of the village they were met by a group of servicemen, policemen and villagers of Verkhny Alkun. There they were told that the servicemen had been attacked and had fired in response. A local police officer told them that the injured should be taken to hospital, for which purpose he had called a car, and that the men should go and see journalists at the Sunzhenskiy District Department of the Interior (ROVD) in the village of Sleptsovskaya (also known as Ordzhonikidzevskaya) and tell them what had happened.", "12. Once at the Sunzhenskiy ROVD, the first applicant and other men were placed in a cell and questioned. Seven men, including the applicant and his son A., were detained for three days, and released on 12 September 2001. While in the ROVD, the applicant and other men were questioned by unknown men wearing military camouflage and by M. B., the investigator of the Sunzhenskiy District Prosecutor\u2019s Office. No documents were produced in respect of this detention.", "13. Following the opening of a criminal investigation into the attack of 9 September 2001, on 11 October 2001 an investigator of the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Ingushetia informed Mr A.K. that on 11 September 2001 he had been granted victim status in criminal case no. 21600040. The first applicant submitted several statements by other villagers about the circumstances of the events of 9-12 September 2001.", "14. On 22 February 2003 the head of the Verkhny Alkun village administration issued an explanation notice confirming the events of 9 September 2001 as presented by the applicant.", "15. After his release the first applicant spent several days in the Sunzhenskiy District hospital in Sleptsovskaya village looking after the wounded Mr A.K. In the meantime, the police carried out a search in the first applicant\u2019s house in Verkhny Alkun, of which he was informed by his wife.", "16. On 23 September 2001 the applicant left the hospital while another relative, Mr S., remained to look after the injured man. That evening, upon his return to the hospital, he was told that Mr S. had been taken to the ROVD and that he too should go there in order to provide certain explanations.", "17. The first applicant, who was afraid that he might be detained again, first visited the prosecutor\u2019s office and talked to investigator M.B., who allegedly assured him that nothing would happen and that he would personally guarantee this. The first applicant, accompanied by his wife, then went to the Sunzhenskiy ROVD. There the applicant was separated from his wife and placed in a cell, in which there were already several detainees, including his relative Mr S. and the second applicant, whom he had not met before.", "18. The second applicant is an agronomist by profession. In 2001 he worked as a mechanic in a boiler-house. He lived with his parents and siblings at 112 Dzerzhinskogo Street in the village of Ordzhonikidzevskaya.", "19. On 23 September 2001 the second applicant was at home. He was planning to go with relatives to the construction site of their new house. His parents, sister, three brothers and a relative were at home at the time and produced detailed statements about the following events.", "20. At about 10 a.m. a group of men in civilian clothes entered the house. The second applicant recognised M.Ye., the head of the Sunzhenskiy criminal police ,and two policemen whom he knew personally. The family members were ordered to go outside the house, where their identity documents were checked. The policemen searched the house. They then asked the second applicant to come to the Sunzhenskiy ROVD for a check. No documents were produced or submitted in respect of the search or the second applicant\u2019s detention.", "21. Once at the ROVD, the second applicant was questioned about what he had been doing on 9 September 2001. He understood from the questions that he was suspected of attacking Russian servicemen on that day near the village of Verkhny Alkun. The second applicant gave a written statement that on that day he had been working with his brother and father at the construction site of their new house, and that neighbours could confirm this.", "22. The second applicant was then questioned for several hours by three men with Slavic features, who were wearing military camouflage, about the attack of 9 September 2001. They asked him, in particular, whether he knew any fighters. They told him that they suspected him of being a member of an illegal armed group, and that he would be sent to Khankala \u2013 the main Russian military base in the Chechen Republic. No records of the questioning were made.", "23. On 24 September 2001 both applicants were taken to the Sunzhenskiy District Court, where the judge asked them for their personal details. The applicants later learned that they had been charged with resisting police officers and that they had been brought to the ROVD for that reason. On the same day a judge of the Sunzhenskiy District Court authorised the detention of both applicants for three days for violently resisting the police officers\u2019 attempt to check their identity documents.", "24. Later that day the applicants\u2019 passports were returned to them and they thought that they would be released. Instead, a group of servicemen from the Special Forces unit of the Ministry of the Interior (\u201cOMON\u201d) arrived and took charge of the applicants. The servicemen had \u201cOMON\u201d inscriptions on their jackets. They put the applicants into a bus where they were forced under the seats, punched and kicked.", "25. The bus arrived at the base of the Special Mission Division of the Ministry of the Interior (DON) no. 99, near Nazran, known to the locals as \u201cthe 58th army\u201d. There the beating continued. The applicants were severely beaten with rifle butts, boots, metal rods and wrenches; they were also suffocated with plastic bags and strangled with belts. When they lost consciousness the bags were removed from their heads, and when they came round the beatings continued. The servicemen did not ask the applicants any questions, but told them that they were beating them in revenge for their killed comrades.", "26. Then both applicants were thrown into a helicopter. The second applicant lost consciousness again and later awoke on the floor of the helicopter, with a bag over his head, a soldier\u2019s feet on his back and a gun pointed at his head. The first applicant\u2019s head was tightly wrapped with a cloth so that he could not see anything, but he was transported in a similar manner.", "27. The applicants later learned that the helicopter had taken them to the Khankala military base. They were thrown into a large pit in the ground and beaten for about an hour. They were also subjected to other forms of torture: their hands were tightly tied with metal wire, and their ribs and hips were burned with cigarettes. The soldiers also took photographs in which they were shown placing their feet on the applicants\u2019 heads.", "28. The first applicant was later taken to another pit, where he was allowed to remove the cloth from his face.", "29. The second applicant was taken somewhere for questioning, and for about an hour he was severely beaten on his head, ribs and on the heels of his feet. He was questioned about having some connection with fighters. He was then put into the same pit as the first applicant, where he was allowed to remove the bag from his head.", "30. The applicants remained in the pit for five days. They described it as about 2.5 metres by 2.5 metres wide, and about 2.5 metres deep. It was roofed with a wooden cover and only a small opening was left, concealed by a camouflage net. The applicants suffered from humidity and cold, and were not given any food.", "31. During the first four days of detention at Khankala the applicants were taken out for questioning, one after the other, into a room with wooden walls and electric lighting which had a sign marked \u201cChief of staff\u201d on the wall. They were questioned about whether they had known any fighters and asked to give names. The interrogators also read out the list of wanted persons and asked if the applicants knew any of them. No official records were made during the questioning.", "32. According to the applicants, they were subjected to the following forms of torture and ill-treatment: they were kicked and struck with rifle butts on different parts of their bodies, in particular on the soles of their feet; they were burned with cigarettes and forced to sit in a bucket while being beaten. As a result of the beatings the applicants could hardly walk, the skin on their feet peeled off, and their faces and bodies were bloated and covered with haematomas. The second applicant was forced to stand for hours with his forehead against the wall, with his hands tightly tied behind his back and legs spread widely apart. He still had clearly visible marks on his forehead one year after the events. The soldiers also threatened the applicants with execution and put guns to their heads. On one occasion both applicants were given a document to read which said that they had been caught trying to plant a mine on the road, that the mine had exploded and that both had died on the way to hospital.", "33. On the fifth day of detention \u2013 the applicants believed it was 29 September 2001 \u2013 they were called one after the other to sign a document to the effect that they had no complaints and that they had not been subjected to any ill-treatment. The applicants first refused to sign it, but after the soldiers beat them they signed the document to avoid further beatings. They were then transferred by car, with bags over their heads, to the Sixth Department of the Organized Crime Unit (RUBOP) of the Staropromyslovskiy District of Grozny. The applicants spent fifteen days in that department. The conditions of detention were satisfactory and the applicants were given food. However, on several occasions the servicemen kicked them and threatened them with torture.", "34. On 9 September 2001 in the forest on the outskirts of the village of Verkhny Alkun, Sunzhenskiy District, unidentified persons fired automatic weapons at servicemen of the federal forces. As a result two servicemen were killed and two other servicemen and a villager, Mr K., received shotgun wounds.", "35. On the same day the Sunzhenskiy District Prosecutor\u2019s Office opened criminal investigation no. 21600040 into the events. In the course of the investigation sixty persons, including the first applicant, his son A. and the second applicant were brought to the ROVD for enquiries concerning their possible involvement in the shooting. However, they were not detained. A search was conducted at the first applicant\u2019s house. The second applicant\u2019s house was not searched.", "36. On 23 September 2001 the applicants were again brought to the ROVD for further enquiries. Since they did not follow the orders of the law-enforcement officers, on 24 September 2001 the Sunzhenskiy District Court ordered their administrative imprisonment for three days.", "37. Later on 24 September 2001 the applicants were \u201ctransferred\u201d to officers of the mobile detachment of the Ministry of the Interior for enquiries concerning their possible participation in illegal armed groups.", "38. The Government submitted no information concerning the applicants\u2019 place of detention in the subsequent period. They stated that, according to the results of the investigation, the applicants had not been held in facilities for either remand or administrative detention in the Chechen Republic. Nor was the fact of their detention at the Khankala military base confirmed.", "39. On 12 October 2001 the applicants were released. They were not given any papers, and the servicemen told them that they should consider themselves lucky to be alive. At the gates of the RUBOP building they were met by the first applicant\u2019s sister and the second applicant\u2019s mother. The applicants were very weak and the second applicant could not walk without assistance. Both applicants were taken by their relatives to doctors for treatment.", "40. The first applicant was diagnosed as suffering from pneumonia, the fracture of three ribs, burns from cigarettes, partial paralysis of the left hand and bruises. He submitted no copies of medical documents but a statement from his wife, who confirmed that he had suffered from the consequences of the beatings and could not work.", "41. The second applicant was taken to Nazran hospital on 16 October 2001 and remained there until 19 October 2001. He was diagnosed with trauma to the lower back, concussion of the kidneys, chronic pyelonephritis and macrohaematuria. On 27 October 2001 the second applicant was again taken to a hospital in Malgobek by his relatives, and remained there until 19 November 2001. In addition to the previous findings, he was diagnosed with craniocerebral injury and concussion of the head and back. The doctors noted his complaints about his loss of sight, pain in the back and head and vertigo. The second applicant continued to suffer from pain, loss of sight, convulsions and other consequences of the ill-treatment for many months after his release. In February 2003 doctors advised him to undergo complicated kidney surgery, but he could not afford it.", "42. The applicants and their relatives complained to various official bodies about the search, arrest and ill-treatment of the applicants. In response, they received very little substantive information concerning actions taken by the authorities further to their complaints. On several occasions, they received copies of letters from various authorities informing them that their complaints had been forwarded to the local prosecutors.", "43. According to the applicants\u2019 relatives, from 24 September to 12 October 2001 they were not informed about the applicants\u2019 whereabouts, or the reasons for or places of their detention. By asking the military and police, they learned that at some point the applicants had been detained at the Khankala military base and then transferred to Grozny. However, this information was not official.", "44. On 27 September 2001 the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Ingushetia forwarded a request from the second applicant\u2019s father, seeking information on the reasons for the detention and whereabouts of his son, to the Sunzhenskiy District Prosecutor for investigation.", "45. On 8 and 10 October 2001 the second applicant\u2019s mother wrote to the Sunzhenskiy District Prosecutor\u2019s Office and the Sunzhenskiy District administration respectively, asking about the whereabouts of her son after his arrest on 23 September 2001.", "46. On 10 October 2001 the Sunzhenskiy District Prosecutor\u2019s Office informed the applicants\u2019 relatives that no official documents or reports existed in relation to the applicants\u2019 arrest, detention or alleged transfer to the Chechen Republic. The letter further stated that any transfer to the Chechen Republic or another region had not been authorised by the prosecutor\u2019s office, and that an investigation into possible breaches of correct procedure was underway.", "47. On 11 October 2001 the second applicant\u2019s mother again wrote to the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Ingushetia, complaining about her son\u2019s illegal detention and alleged transfer to the military authorities in the Chechen Republic.", "48. On 12 October 2001 the first applicant\u2019s wife submitted a complaint to the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Ingushetia in person, asking to be informed of her husband\u2019s whereabouts and the reasons for his arrest.", "49. After the applicants\u2019 release they themselves applied to the prosecutors, asking that an investigation be conducted into their allegations of ill-treatment and that the persons responsible be brought to justice.", "50. Soon after his release from hospital (sometime in November 2001) the second applicant submitted a detailed account of his arrest, detention and ill-treatment to the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Ingushetia, indicating the names, ranks and descriptions of the servicemen who had participated in his arrest and the beatings in Ingushetia.", "51. It appears that on 23 November 2001 the Sunzhenskiy District Prosecutor\u2019s Office refused to open a criminal investigation into the actions of the officials from the Ministry of the Interior, on the ground of absence of corpus delicti. The applicants did not submit a copy of that document, but on 20 December 2001 the second applicant, assisted by a lawyer, appealed against the decision to the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Ingushetia. He sought the quashing of the decision and the opening of an investigation into his allegations of ill-treatment. The appeal also contained references to the identity of the servicemen involved and a detailed description of the events.", "52. On 4 January 2002 the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Ingushetia informed the second applicant that on that date a criminal investigation had been opened into the complaint with regard to his arrest and beatings administered by unknown servicemen of the Ministry of the Interior, and that the investigation would be carried out by the Sunzhenskiy District Prosecutor\u2019s Office.", "53. On 27 February 2002 the applicants\u2019 representative, the SRJI, wrote to the Chechnya Republican Prosecutor, asking him to open a criminal investigation into the ill-treatment of the applicants at the Khankala military base on 24-27 September 2001. On 10 April 2002 the SRJI again wrote to that prosecutor, but received no reply.", "54. On 10 October 2002 the applicants talked to the SRJI representatives in Nazran, who filmed the interview. They have submitted a transcript of the videotape, in which the applicants displayed the scars still visible on their bodies and stated that they suffered from recurrent health problems. They also stated that no proper investigation had taken place into their complaints.", "55. On 4 January 2002 the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Ingushetia opened a criminal investigation in case no. 22600008, following the second applicant\u2019s complaint about alleged ill-treatment by officers of the federal forces. Criminal proceedings were instituted under Article 285 of the Criminal Code (abuse of official powers).", "56. On 16 January 2002 the second applicant was questioned and granted victim status in the proceedings. According to the Government\u2019s submissions, the second applicant stated that after he and the first applicant had been brought to the ROVD on 23 September 2001, they were transferred to unidentified persons in Nazran, Ingushetia, and then transported to Grozny. They had been ill-treated on the way to Nazran and in Grozny. They had been released a few days later. They would not be able to identify the persons who had ill-treated them.", "57.

The results of an enquiry subsequently conducted did not support the applicants\u2019 allegations that they had been detained at the base. On 8 August 2003 the UGA Prosecutor\u2019s Office refused to institute criminal proceedings, invoking the absence of corpus delicti. According to the applicants, they were never notified of this decision.", "74. On 7 June 2005 the decision to suspend the investigation of 15 May 2002 was quashed by the Deputy Prosecutor of Ingushetia.", "75. On 6 July 2005 the applicants underwent forensic medical examinations.
