GREECE", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Preliminary objection rejected (six month period);Preliminary objection rejected (non-exhaustion of domestic remedies);No violation of Art. 5-1", "JUDGES": "C. Russo;N. Valticos", "TEXT": ["6. On 4 March 1990 Mr Bizzotto was arrested in transit at Athens Airport while in possession of 3.5kg of cannabis which he had purchased in Islamabad (Pakistan) for 1,000 US dollars. He was detained pending trial in Korydallos Prison, Athens.", "7. On 6 May 1991 the Athens Court of Appeal, sitting as a first-instance criminal court with three judges (Trimeles efetio kakourgimaton), held as follows (in judgment no. 986/1991):", "\"The Court finds the defendant guilty of having deliberately and as a drug addict (a) purchased in Islamabad, Pakistan, on 1 March 1990 approximately 3.5kg of Indian hemp from persons unknown for the sum of 1,000 US dollars (b) brought the said cannabis from Karachi (Pakistan) to Athens by plane on 4 March 1990, (c) imported it into Greece on 4 March 1990 and (d) had it in his possession, wrapped in the lining of an anorak, at Athens Airport on 4 March 1990. The stratagems the defendant used to hide and transport this cannabis, the ease with which he travelled on several occasions to Pakistan, Thailand and other eastern countries and obtained cannabis in Pakistan, the connections which he has in that country, his knowledge of how strict customs security measures are in different countries, his previous convictions for drug-related offences, and the large quantity of cannabis he purchased for resale, show him to be particularly dangerous.\"", "It sentenced him to eight years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of two million drachmas. In addition, it suspended his civic rights for five years and ordered that he be permanently prohibited from re-entering the territory after his release. Lastly, it ordered his placement in an appropriate centre to receive treatment for his drug addiction (under section 14 of Law no. 1729/1987 - see paragraph 15 below).", "8. On 22 October 1992, on an appeal by the applicant, the Athens Court of Appeal sitting with five judges (Pentameles efetio) upheld the judgment of the court of first instance (see paragraph 7 above) but reduced the sentence to six years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of one million drachmas (judgment no. 1003/1992). It also ordered \"the defendant\u2019s placement in an appropriate prison or in a State hospital where he can receive treatment for drug addiction\".", "However, Mr Bizzotto was never admitted to any such institution; he served his sentence in Patras Prison.", "In a letter of 26 November 1992 the public prosecutor notified the governor of Patras Prison of the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision and indicated that the part of the judgment dealing with the applicant\u2019s placement in a prison with medical facilities did not apply as no such institutions existed. However, he added that he would contact the governor if such an institution opened before Mr Bizzotto finished serving his sentence.", "9. While detained at Patras Prison the applicant made four applications to the Patras Criminal Court (Trimeles plimmeliodikio) to be released on licence; three of them were made before the Athens Court of Appeal sitting with five judges had delivered its judgment (see paragraph 8 above).", "10. In his first application, made on 4 December 1991, Mr Bizzotto maintained that he had been cured and had ceased to be at all dependent on drugs during his long stay in prison and after medical treatment. He also stated that he had a wife and family, that he owned a profitable farm in Italy and that he was determined not to reoffend in future. He requested his release on licence under section 23 of Law no. 1729/1987 (see paragraph 15 below).", "In a decision (no. 595/1992) of 3 February 1992 the Patras Criminal Court dismissed the application.", "It began by noting that it was objectively impossible to admit drug addicts to treatment centres as no such centres existed.", "It added:", "\"It is apparent from sections 14 and 23 of Law no. 1729/1987 ... that a person who has been convicted under that Law and has been found to be a drug addict must be placed in an appropriate prison or in a State hospital for special treatment. The placement cannot last for less than a year. During the period of treatment, the convicted person is examined periodically in order to establish whether he has been cured or whether the placement must continue. Periodic reviews begin after one year and are carried out by the court either of its own motion or on an application by the prosecution. If the court ... considers - after studying the relevant expert\u2019s report - that the accused has been cured, it orders his discharge from the centre; if the term of imprisonment to which he has been sentenced is longer than the period of treatment, the prisoner is returned to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence. In that case, if the court considers that there is no serious reason why the prisoner should serve the remainder of his sentence, it orders his release on licence. ... Persons who have become habitual users of drugs and are unable to give up the use of them voluntarily - in other words `drug addicts\u2019 - are patients and are treated as such under section 23. It is to be noted that the Greek legislation in force ... does not use the scientifically accepted term of `drug addict\u2019 but the expression `user of narcotic substances subject to special treatment\u2019 (section 13 (1) of Law no. 1729/1987) ... The release on licence of persons convicted under Article 105 of the Criminal Code should not be confused with the discharge of convicted drug addicts under the provisions of section 23 of Law no. 1729/1987. In the first case the aim pursued is solely that of rehabilitation, whereas in the second case it is also therapeutic ... For an application to this end by a convicted person to be admissible it is a prerequisite that (a) he has been placed in a centre to receive treatment for drug addiction and (b) he has spent at least one year in such a centre and is considered cured ... A problem arises where a convicted person has never been admitted to such a centre. In that case, section 23 does not apply, because the procedural requirement will not have been satisfied. Such a person is deprived of his right to make such an application, which will accordingly be inadmissible. This is not affected by his alleged recovery in prison while serving his sentence. The fact that the prison psychiatrist has certified that he has been cured is of no avail. On the other hand, it raises serious questions and doubts as to the objectiveness of the findings in the psychiatric reports made during the investigation and taken into account by the relevant courts. Although these persons are described as \u2018drug addicts\u2019 ... in these reports, within a few months they are regarded as \u2018completely cured\u2019 after non-existent treatment and merely taking aspirin or Hypnostedon.", "...", "Besides, the essential requirements for an application to be admissible are that the convicted person has made a full recovery and that there is no serious reason why he should serve the remainder of his sentence. ... In order to make a finding that there is a \u2018serious reason\u2019, it is necessary to have regard to the criteria laid down in Article 106 para. 1 of the Criminal Code. It appears from the case file that the applicant does not satisfy the essential conditions laid down by law, in particular as regards his complete cure. In view of his antecedents ... and character, it is unlikely that the applicant will lead an honest life on leaving prison as he shows a marked tendency to commit drug-related offences.\"", "11. On 5 February 1992 the applicant made a second application for release on licence, in which he essentially repeated the same arguments as he had put forward in the first (see paragraph 10 above).", "On 27 February 1992 the Patras Criminal Court dismissed the application (in decision no. 1119/1992) in the following terms:", "\"The court is not convinced either from the documentary evidence or from the applicant prisoner\u2019s personal attendance before it that he is totally cured of his dependence on drugs. He has not been admitted to an appropriate treatment centre and the treatment in Patras Prison is insufficient to cure him of an addiction acquired over a very long period of drug use. In addition, no prison psychiatrist\u2019s certificate as to the progress of his treatment has been produced ...\"", "12. On 4 March 1992 the applicant made a third application, supported by psychiatric certificates of his recovery. He sought to benefit from the provisions of section 23 of Law no. 1729/1987 (see paragraph 15 below).", "At the hearing he admitted that he had \"been taking drugs\" since the age of 19 and had even taken heroin in the past. However, he said that he had managed to cure himself of his drug addiction whilst in prison, where conditions were not conducive, and added that, if his imprisonment were to continue, his condition would get worse.", "In a decision (no. 2694/1992) of 27 May 1992 the Patras Criminal Court reached the following conclusions:", "\"The prison doctor\u2019s diagnosis is not sufficient to prove that the applicant has recovered. The latter\u2019s application is inadmissible since he has not been admitted to an appropriate prison similar to the psychiatric clinic at Korydallos Prison. Furthermore, at the time of the application the applicant had served two years, one month and twenty-six days of his sentence and there is a serious reason for his serving the remainder, especially as his criminal record shows that in 1974 he was sentenced by the Athens Assize Court to three years\u2019 imprisonment for a drug-related offence.\"", "13. In a letter of 9 June 1993 the Minister of Justice, replying to an application by Mr Bizzotto to be placed in a treatment centre for drug addicts, informed him that there was no such centre inside the prison.", "14. On 15 December 1993 the applicant made a fourth application for his release on licence, relying on Articles 105 and 106 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 16 below). He said that he had served three-fifths of his sentence and had been of exemplary conduct throughout his time in prison. He was no longer addicted to drugs and was therefore no longer a danger to society; his continued detention would be harmful to him and could no longer be justified.", "On 11 February 1994 the Indictments Division (Symvoulio plimmeliodikon) of the Patras Criminal Court granted his application. It found that he had already served four years and fourteen days of his sentence - that is to say more than half of the sentence imposed and more than the one-year minimum (Article 105 of the Criminal Code) - and that during his time in prison he had been of good conduct, had shown repentance, had complied with prison regulations and had not incurred any disciplinary penalties.", "15.

On the basis of this report the Criminal Court, sitting with three judges, shall decide whether detention should continue. The court, which may also order an expert\u2019s report under section 13 (2), shall make a final decision whether detention in hospital should continue.", "(2) If a person detained in a hospital has recovered and was found not to be criminally responsible under Article 34 of the Criminal Code, the court shall order his release on an application by the public prosecutor.
