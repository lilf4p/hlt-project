Under that contract the company was to carry out building work on the applicant\u2019s house.

On 1 February 1996 the applicant and his wife (\u201cthe plaintiffs\u201d) sued E.W. and W.W. in the Zielona G\u00f3ra Regional Court (S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki), seeking compensation for the serious damage to the house allegedly caused by the defendants.", "13. On 13 March and 27 June 1996 the court held hearings and heard evidence from witnesses.", "14. On 24 July 1996 the court instructed Pozna\u0144 Technical University (Politechnika Pozna\u0144ska) to prepare an expert report. The report was submitted to the court on 4 November 1996. The defendants challenged the report on 2 December 1996.", "15. At a hearing on 23 December 1996 the Regional Court ordered the experts to revise their report. On 26 January 1997 they upheld their original conclusions.", "16. On 17 July 1997 the plaintiffs modified their claim.", "17. The court held a hearing on 29 October 1997.", "18. On 31 March 1998 the court ordered the experts to supplement their report.", "19. The parties filed their pleadings in March, April and October 1998.", "20.

On 19 November 1998 the court gave judgment and dismissed the claim. The plaintiffs appealed.", "22. On 18 May 1999 the Pozna\u0144 Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case to the Regional Court.", "23.

At the hearing held on 9 May 2000 the court heard evidence from the expert.", "26. The Government submitted that on 16 May 2000 the plaintiffs had altered the amount of the damages they had sought. Subsequently, they applied for an exemption from the court fee due for the increased claim. On 12 October 2000 the court refused their application. That decision was later upheld by the Pozna\u0144 Court of Appeal. The applicant denied that they had altered their claim.", "27.

However, on 4 June 2001 the particulars of the amended claim were again returned to them on account of their failure to pay the fee in question.", "29. The applicant stated that this was not true. He maintained that, in a pleading of 11 May 2001, after the experts had again revised their valuation of the damage sustained, he had indeed extended the amount of the damages sought to 300,000 Polish zlotys (PLN), mostly because he had been forced to do so by the court.

On 20 June 2002 the Pozna\u0144 Court of Appeal heard, and dismissed, the applicant\u2019s appeal.

Article 418 of the Civil Code, as applicable until 18 December 2001 (see paragraphs 38-39 below), provided for the following exception in cases where damage resulted from the issuing of a decision or order:", "\u201c1. If, in consequence of the issuing of a decision or order, a State official has caused damage, the State Treasury shall be liable only if a breach of the law has been involved in the issuing of the decision or order and if that breach is the subject of a criminal prosecution or a disciplinary investigation, and the guilt of the person who caused the damage in question has been established by a final conviction or has been admitted by the person\u2019s superior.", "2. The fact that such guilt has not been established by means of a criminal conviction or a decision given in disciplinary proceedings shall not exclude the State Treasury\u2019s liability for damage if such proceedings cannot be instituted in view of a [statutory] bar to prosecution or disciplinary action.\u201d", "36. On 1 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on amendments to the Civil Code and other statutes (Ustawa o zmianie ustawy \u2013 Kodeks cywilny oraz niekt\u00f3rych innych ustaw) (\u201cthe 2004 Amendment\u201d) entered into force. While the relevant amendments were in essence aimed at enlarging the scope of the State Treasury\u2019s liability for tort under Article 417 of the Civil Code \u2013 including the addition of a new Article 4171 and provision being made for the State\u2019s tortious liability for its omission to enact legislation, a concept known as \u201clegislative omission\u201d (zaniedbanie legislacyjne) \u2013 they are also to be seen in the context of the operation of a new statute introducing remedies in respect of the unreasonable length of judicial proceedings (see paragraphs 38-41 below).", "Following the 2004 Amendment, Article 4171, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:", "\u201c3. If damage has been caused by failure to give a ruling [orzeczenie] or decision [decyzja] where there is a statutory duty to do so, reparation for [the damage] may be sought after it has been established in the relevant proceedings that the failure to give a ruling or decision was contrary to the law, unless other specific provisions provide otherwise.\u201d", "37.

On 4 December 2001 the Constitutional Court (Trybuna\u0142 Konstytucyjny) dealt with two constitutional complaints in which the applicants challenged the constitutionality of Article 417 and 418 of the Civil Code. They alleged, in particular, that those provisions were incompatible with Article 64 and Article 77 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution (see paragraphs 41-42 below).", "On the same day the court gave judgment (no. SK 18/00) and held that Article 417 of the Civil Code was compatible with Article 77 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution in so far as it provided that the State Treasury was liable for damage caused by the unlawful actions of State officials in the performance of their duties. It further held that even though Article 418 of the Civil Code was compatible with Article 64 of the Constitution, it was contrary to Article 77 \u00a7 1 since it linked the award of compensation for such damage to the personal culpability, established in criminal or disciplinary proceedings, of the State official concerned.", "39. On 18 December 2001, the date on which the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment took effect, Article 418 was repealed. The Constitutional Court\u2019s opinion on the consequences of the repeal read, in so far as relevant:", "\u201cThe elimination of Article 418 of the Civil Code from the legal system ... means that the State Treasury\u2019s liability for the actions of a public authority consisting in the issuing of unlawful decisions or orders will follow from the general principles on State liability as laid down in Article 417 of the Civil Code. This, however, does not rule out the application in the present legal system of other principles on State liability, as laid down in specific statutes, and not necessarily only those listed in the Civil Code.\u201d", "40. Article 45 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution states:", "\u201cEveryone shall have the right to a fair and public hearing of his case, without undue delay, before a competent, impartial and independent court.\u201d", "41. Article 64 of the Constitution reads:", "\u201c1. Everyone shall have the right to ownership, other property rights and the right of succession.", "2. Everyone, on an equal basis, shall receive legal protection regarding ownership, other property rights and the right of succession.", "3. The right of ownership may only be limited by means of a statute and only to the extent that it does not violate the substance of such right.\u201d", "42. Article 77 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution reads:", "\u201cEveryone shall have the right to compensation for any harm done to him by any action of an organ of public authority contrary to law.\u201d", "43. On 17 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w post\u0119powaniu s\u0105dowym bez nieuzasadnionej zw\u0142oki) (\u201cthe 2004 Act\u201d) entered into force. It lays down various legal means designed to counteract and/or redress the undue length of judicial proceedings.", "A party to pending proceedings may ask for the acceleration of those proceedings and/or just satisfaction for their unreasonable length under section 2 read in conjunction with section 5(1) of the 2004 Act.", "Section 2, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:", "\u201c1.

Article 442 of the Civil Code sets out limitation periods in respect of various claims based on tort. That provision applies to situations covered by Article 417 of the Civil Code. Article 442, in so far as relevant, reads:", "\u201c1. A claim for compensation for damage caused by a tort shall lapse three years following the date on which the claimant learned of the damage and of the persons liable for it. However, the claim shall in any case lapse ten years following the date on which the event causing the damage occurred.\u201d", "46.
