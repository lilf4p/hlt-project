At a hearing held on 17 November 2006 D.D. gave oral evidence. He confirmed all his findings in the report. The parties made no objections to the report, nor did they put any questions to D.D.

In respect of the complaint about D.D., the Osijek County Court\u2019s judgment reads:", "\u201cUnder Article 331 paragraph 5 of the C[ode] [of] C[riminal] P[rocedure], in respect of crimes punishable by [up to] eight years\u2019 imprisonment, when an expert witness has already been heard before the president of a [trial] panel [and there has been no change in president], the expert\u2019s report can be read out without the agreement of the parties.

On 12 March 2009 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint of 30 October 2008 against the judgments of the Osijek Municipal Court and the Osijek County Court. The Constitutional Court found that the criminal proceedings against the applicant had been fair and that the judgments of the lower courts had been sufficiently reasoned and did not disclose any arbitrariness. As to the trial court\u2019s refusal to take the applicant\u2019s further evidence, the Constitutional Court noted that it had been for the trial court to decide which evidence to take and that the applicant had not objected to the evidence that had been read out during the trial.", "24. On 26 May 2009 the Constitutional Court declared the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint of 17 February 2009 against the judgment of the Supreme Court of 27 October 2008 inadmissible on the grounds that it had not been an act by which the applicant\u2019s civil rights or obligations or any criminal charge against him had been determined.", "25.
