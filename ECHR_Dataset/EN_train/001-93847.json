M.\u2019s claim for breach of confidence and upheld Mrs I.S.\u2019s claim for the annulment of the exchange, considering that the exchange had not been certified by a notary in breach of applicable law. However, having found that Mr V. K. had purchased the apartment in good faith, the court declared him the lawful owner of the apartment and ordered the applicant and Mr Y. S. jointly to pay Mrs I.S. compensation of 41,181 Ukrainian hryvnyas for the loss of the apartment. The applicant and Mr Y. S. appealed in cassation.", "11. On 31 December 1999 Mrs I.S. died.", "12.

Subsequently, the proceedings were transferred to the Prymorsky District Court of Odessa (the Prymorsky Court).", "26.
