They are the respective owners of estates described as Hof, Hof I and II and of Litla-Hof, located in \u00d6r\u00e6fum, and of Hverhamri in Hverager\u00f0i. They claim to be the owners of an estate named Fjall, which is the subject of their application under the Convention.", "A further applicant is Kv\u00edsker ehf. (Ltd.), a private limited-liability company, incorporated under the laws of Iceland, registered at Kvisker, in \u00d6r\u00e6fum, and whose executive director is Mr Gisli Sigurj\u00f3n J\u00f3nsson (1955), \u00d6r\u00e6fum. The applicant company's complaints under the Convention relate to its claim to be the owner of \u00bd of an estate named Brei\u00f0am\u00f6rk.", "The applicants are represented by Mr Ragnar A\u00f0alsteinsson and Mr \u00d3lafur Bj\u00f6rnsson, who are both lawyers practising in Selfoss.", "On 1 July 1998 a new Act (no. 58/1998) on public lands and the determination of the boundaries of private land, public land and upland ranges (hereinafter referred to as the \u201c1998 Act\u201d), entered into force. Prior to this all land that had not been subject to private ownership was regarded as res nullius. The purpose of the 1998 Act was to change this. Thus, its section 2 provided that the Icelandic State was the sole owner of any land which was not the private property of any natural or legal person. Moreover, a Wasteland Commission (\u00d3bygg\u00f0anefnd) was established (section 6), vested with powers to determine the boundaries between land that was regarded as the private property of a natural or legal person and land that was not, and was therefore the property of the State. In the latter event the Commission would also rule on whether a natural or legal person had any rights of use in respect of the land in question.", "On 13 July 2000 the Wasteland Commission announced its intention to examine a certain area within the commune of Hornafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur. Subsequently the Minister of Finance published the claims of the Icelandic State to all land that the Minister of Finance regarded as not being private property owned by any natural or legal person.", "In the proceedings before the Wasteland Commission, the applicants claimed that they were the legal owners of the disputed land, arguing:", "(i) that the disputed land was their property and was protected by Article 72 of the Icelandic Constitution and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention;", "(ii) that the disputed land had been the private property of individuals since the settlement of Iceland in the 9th and 10th centuries and therefore the conditions of section 2 of the 1998 Act had not been fulfilled;", "(iii) that their ownership, or the ownership of former owners, had never been challenged by the Icelandic State or others. On the contrary, before the entry into force of the 1998 Act, the Icelandic State had on several occasions treated the applicants and former owners of the disputed land as being the private owners of the land in question; in particular they had paid taxes in respect of their properties and they held written title deeds for the properties which had been acknowledged by the Icelandic State;", "(iv) that they and the former owners of the land had for many centuries made use of the disputed land by all feasible means at any given time, e.g. herding sheep out on to the disputed land to graze.", "In the alternative, the applicants relied on adverse possession as a means of establishing their ownership.", "In the further alternative the applicants called for a declaratory decision to the effect that they owned the grazing rights to the disputed land.", "On 14 November 2003 the Wasteland Commission found in favour of the applicants and held that the boundaries of public lands and private lands in the region should follow the edge of the glacier Vatnaj\u00f6kull in its state on the entry into force of the 1998 Act and that all land above this limit should be considered as public land and all land below as private land.", "Subsequently, the Icelandic State, appealed against the Wasteland Commission's decision to the District Court of Austurland (H\u00e9ra\u00f0sd\u00f3mur Austurlands), claiming that the disputed land should be regarded as State property in accordance with section 2 of the 1998 Act.", "In a judgment of 26 July 2005, the District Court upheld the Wasteland Commission's decision. Although it did not find it established that the applicants held direct title to the land at issue, the District Court was satisfied that they had fulfilled the conditions for adverse possession in respect of the land (section 2 of the Act No. 46/1905 on Adverse Possession).", "The Icelandic State appealed against the District Court's judgment to the Supreme Court, which by a judgment of 11 May 2006 overturned the District Court's finding that the applicants had acquired ownership of the land in question by way of adverse possession, but held that they possessed the right to customary use of grazing land in the disputed areas (section 5 of the 1998 Act).", "In its examination of the case, the Supreme Court relied on its earlier case-law expounded in a judgment of 21 October 2004 (case No. 48/2004). According to that judgment, it was not in the power of land owners to use a boundary deed to extend their land or other rights; a boundary deed was therefore not in itself sufficient but had to be supported by other evidence in order for ownership to be established.", "Thus, in relation to one group of respondents before it (other than the applicants), the Supreme Court found that their title to a specific area of disputed land, in addition to being supported by a boundary deed from 1890, was corroborated by certain public acts. This included a deed of conveyance, issued by owners to the Minister for Education in 1966 in connection with the creation of a national park and the determination of boundaries for division of land by an arbitration tribunal in 1969, according to which a large part of the disputed land was allocated to the owners (and where the State, as a party, had not made objections to title). It also comprised a declaration of 1987 by the Council of Nature Conservation in connection with the establishment of a new farm in the area. The Supreme Court therefore upheld the District Court's finding that the respondents in question should be exempted from the State's claim in respect of the relevant land.", "As regards the first nine applicants' claim regarding the farm Fjall, the Supreme Court extensively considered a number of sources, notably accounts in the Book of Settlements (Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k - old Icelandic manuscript describing in detail the settlement of Iceland by the Norse in the 9th and 10th centuries A.D), chartularies of Klemens Church at Hof from 1343 and 1570; entries made in 1641, 1706 and 1748 in episcopal visitations books; the Farm Register of a Mr \u00cdsleifur Einarsson of 1709, Farm Register Jar\u00f0atal \u00e1 \u00cdslandi by a Mr J\u00f3n Johnsen, published in 1847; the book of records of the land assessors in the Skaftafell counties dating from 1849; an official declaration of title by the owners of Hof dated 7 April 1851, the protest by the owners of the farm Fell in Su\u00f0ursveit and the ensuing settlement of 8 June 1854 between the owners of Hof and Fell respectively.", "The Supreme Court also took note of the records of the Real Estate Assessment Committee in Austur Skaftafellss\u00fdsla from 1916 stating the following about Hof:", "\u201cThe farm owns grazing land [Upprekstrarland]: Brei\u00f0amerkurfjall, which is far away, rising up from central Brei\u00f0amerkursandur, surrounded by glacier. ... \u201cThe farm owns driftage shores: The shores of Hof and Tangi, and in addition the shore of Fjall below Brei\u00f0amerkursandur.\u201d", "In addition, the Supreme Court had regard to a boundary deed of 1922 and reasoned as follows:", "\u201cA boundary deed was then prepared for Hof on 15 July 1922, which stated, inter alia, the following: 'Furthermore the farm owns all of Brei\u00f0amerkurfjall and land on the Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk Sand, in the west the boundaries are as follows: The top of the peak Mi\u00f0aftanstindur on Brei\u00f0amerkurfjall to bear on the cleft in Ei\u00f0natindur on the same mountain.' It also says: 'The farm owns these shores: ... The shore of Fjall between these boundaries: In the west: The top of the peak Mi\u00f0aftanstindur on Brei\u00f0amerkurfjall shall bear on the cleft in Ei\u00f0natindur on the said mountain. In the east: The higher mound of M\u00e1vabygg\u00f0ir shall bear east on M\u00falah\u00f6fu\u00f0 which is foremost to the east on Brei\u00f0amerkurfjall and the land boundaries shall be the same.' This boundary deed was endorsed as regards 'the shore and boundary between Tv\u00edsker and the land of Fjall' by an Ari H\u00e1lfd\u00e1narson, who at that time appears to have been the head of the Parish of Hofshreppur, together with two men who are said to be 'the owners of 5/6 of Kv\u00edsker' and by the said Ari 'as regards the eastern boundary between the lands of Fjall and Brei\u00f0am\u00f6rk.'", "In the case there are no further earlier or more recent officially registered sources of evidence concerning title to this land other than the last-mentioned boundary deed for Hof dating from 1922. The value of such sources as evidence is discussed earlier in this judgment as regards the boundaries of private land with other land, and the same must apply to the value of boundary deeds as evidence of title to land. In assessing whether any other factors have emerged which could support the claim of the respondents in this part of the case to Fjall, it should be noted that in their pleadings before the court it was maintained that the church at Hof was from the beginning a farm-owned church and therefore subject to the custodianship of the landowners, but that its possessions accrued to the farm no later than 1916, when the church as such became the possession of the congregation. As this was not contested by the appellant, equal account must be taken of the cited sources concerning the ownership rights of the Hof Church and the owners of the farm in the land of Fjall.", "When the sources concerning the ownership rights to this land are considered it can be assumed from the cited chartularies for the Hof Church from the years 1343 and 1387 that it came into the possession of the farm of Fjall during this period and this may have occurred at about the time that the farm was abandoned, as surmised pursuant to the above. It can only be assumed from the phrasing of the earlier chartulary that direct ownership of the farm was involved. After the writing of this chartulary, however, almost two centuries passed until the next available source of evidence, G\u00edslam\u00e1ldagi, was written. It includes no reference to the ownership by the church at Hof of the farm of Fjall, but it is specified that the church owned driftage and other easements from ancient times. The cited phrasing in the visitation book of Bishop Brynj\u00f3lfur Sveinsson dating from 1641 can only be understood to mean that it is discussing only the easements of Hofskirkja in the land of Fjall, which, more specifically, included the littoral rights, together with grazing rights in Fjallsfit [the Fjall meadow] and Brei\u00f0amerkurfjall. The two later visitations, dating from 1706 and 1748, cite the earliest visitation record to the effect that Hofskirkja 'owns' Fjallsfit and Brei\u00f0amerkurfjall, in addition to littoral rights. In light of the fact that these are based on the substance of the earliest visitation record, which in this context referred to easements, it cannot be maintained that the later sources provide independent support for the direct ownership rights of the Church at Hof. In this context it must also be kept in mind that the rights are said to concern two delimited parts of the land together with the shore, not the land as a whole, as would have been most logical if the farm as such had been considered the property of the church. The same applies to the discussion of the abandoned farm of Fjall in the Farm Register of 1709, although it says that 'its entire property' accrued to the church at Hof, but that of this property only Brei\u00f0amerkurfjall remained, surrounded by glacier and of little use, together with Fjallsfit and Fjallsfjara [the Fjall meadow and shore]. The Farm Register also says of the farm Hof, that to it was attributed 'Fjall and Fjallsfit in the land of Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk', together with Fjallsfjara [the Fjall shore], but from the context it can only be surmised that 'fjall' [mountain] in that context referred to the mountain Brei\u00f0amerkurfjall. The Farm Register dating from 1847 referred to the fact that a Farm Register dating from 1805 referred to Fjall as 'an abandoned smallholding' of Hof. This account can hardly have any significant value as evidence when it is kept in mind that it is clear from the Farm Register of 1709 that houses and cultivated land at Fjall had at that time already disappeared and that use of other land was virtually non-existent, and from the available information it can only be surmised that the glacier advanced still further after that down to the end of the 19th century. When the owners of Hof publicly declared their rights of title in 1851, their rights to the land of Fjall were entered among easements, but their agreement with the owners of Fell in 1854 said that the former should 'enjoy the full use' of that land 'as far west as they trust themselves to stake a claim'. These last cited words are not consistent with the assumption that the discussion concerns the use of land which is subject to the direct ownership of the owners of Hof. Finally, it should be noted that in 1890, the boundary deed for Kv\u00edsker was endorsed for the owners of Hof as regards the approval of littoral boundaries, but not the boundaries of Kv\u00edsker and Fjall, and that a real estate assessment in 1916 refers only to the grazing rights [uppresktrarr\u00e9tt]of Hof on Brei\u00f0amerkurfjall and the littoral rights to Fjallsfjara, as in the land assessment of 1849.", "Even though it can be regarded as adequately demonstrated that the farm Fjall came into the possession of the church at Hof during the period between 1343 and 1387, there is in general principle no firm evidence of anything other than easements belonging to the church or the owners of Hof after that time until a boundary deed was prepared for Hof in 1922. The possibility cannot be excluded that in the period from 1387 to 1570 the church may have divested itself of the farm Fjall while retaining littoral and grazing rights. Whatever the case may be, sources dating from about 1570 down to the third decade of the last century can only be understood to mean that the owners of Hof themselves, for a number of centuries, considered themselves only to possess rights of use to the land of Fjall and ceased to assume direct ownership of the land and thereby relinquished it, if indeed the ownership was not disposed of in another manner. For this reason, the boundary deed of 15 July 1922 cannot be said to provide sound evidence of the direct title of the respondents in this part of the case to the land in question. There is no evidence to support the contention that these respondents had any possession of the land of Fjall which could result in their direct title through adverse possession. Since no other parties have made any claim to such rights to the land, and nothing in the documents of the case gives any indication that any such claim could be made by anyone, it must be assumed that pursuant to section 1 of Act No. 58/1998 the land is public land subject, however, to the customary grazing and littoral use by the respondents of the land in accordance with section 5 of the same Act. As regards the boundaries of the public land, this is laid down in the adjudication, but in light of the limited rights of use declared in favour of the respondents, there is no reason to specify its boundary with the public land on the glacier.\u201d", "As regards the tenth applicant's claim regarding half of the farm of Brei\u00f0am\u00f6rk, the Supreme Court again extensively assessed the evidence before it, including a number of items, notably the Nj\u00e1ls saga (Icelandic epic from the 13th century) containing the earliest accounts of habitation at Brei\u00f0am\u00f6rk, the Book of Settlements, chartularies of the church of Mar\u00edukirkja at Brei\u00f0\u00e1 from 1343 and 1387. The Supreme Court further observed that one half of the farm had apparently accrued to the King, according to a judgment of the court of law, L\u00f6gr\u00e9tta, in 1646. Regard was also had to a Farm Register of a Mr \u00cdsleifur Einarsson of 1709, another Farm Register of 1805, a Farm Register of a Mr J\u00f3n Johnsen of 1847, records of the land assessors in the counties of Skaftafell dating from 1849; the above-mentioned public declaration made by owners of Hof on 7 April 1851 and the subsequent settlement of 8 June 1854, a deed of conveyance of 1670 and another such deed of 7 March 1857 issued on behalf of the owners of \u201cSk\u00e1lholt Church and lands by a Mr Vilhj\u00e1lmur Finsen (who held the combined offices of Country and County Sherriff [Land- og b\u00e6jarf\u00f3geti]); and a deed of conveyance of 31 May 1891.", "The Supreme Court went on:", "\u201cIncluded in the case documents is a boundary record for the farm Fell, prepared by the aforementioned Eyj\u00f3lfur on 1 May 1922, where boundaries and shore boundaries in the west were described as being located on a further specified parish boundary. These are the same boundaries as those referred to as the eastern boundary of the farm Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk. This boundary record was not endorsed as regards the boundaries with Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk. Also included in the case documents is a 'boundary record between Fell in the Parish of Borgarh\u00f6fn and Brei\u00f0am\u00f6rk in the Parish of Hof', which is signed on 13 May 1922 by the heads of both parishes, Ari H\u00e1lfdanarson and Stef\u00e1n J\u00f3nsson. In this record the boundary of land and shore between Fell and Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk is once again described in the same manner, and it is stated that the boundaries of the two parishes are also the same. This document is not endorsed by any other parties.", "A deed of conveyance was issued on 26 February 1937 for half of Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk and half of the Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk shore, which includes the following passage: 'In that I, the undersigned, former commissioner Bj\u00f6rgvin Vigf\u00fasson of Efri-Hvoll, have since 1910, without objection, collected rent from the land of half of Brei\u00f0am\u00f6rk in the Parish of Hof in the County of Austur-Skaftafellss\u00fdsla, as it was in ancient times, as well as rent from half of the Brei\u00f0am\u00f6rk shore, which is nine hundred [i.e. 1080] fathoms in length \u2013 from the tenant, Bj\u00f6rn P\u00e1lsson at Kv\u00edsker, an agreement has been reached between myself and him last year that he should come into possession of this land, together with half of the shore of Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk with driftage rights, for the sum of 100 \u2013 one hundred \u2013 kr\u00f3nur.' The persons who appear to have derived their rights from Bj\u00f6rn P\u00e1lsson issued on 20 June 2002 a deed of conveyance for the same property to the defendant Kv\u00edsker ehf.", "According to the documents of the case, the cited boundary records dating from 1922 were officially registered, as well as the deeds of conveyance dating from 1937 and 2002, on which the defendant Kv\u00edsker ehf. bases its rights. From the ruling of the Wasteland Commission it can be inferred that the cited deed of conveyance to Eyj\u00f3lfur Run\u00f3lfsson for the shares of his cousins in the Brei\u00f0amerkur shore was officially registered with a proviso relating to title rights to the sold property. It can also be inferred that the descendants of Eyj\u00f3lfur [Run\u00f3lfsson] and the parties deriving their rights from him officially registered certain declarations concerning rights to the Brei\u00f0am\u00f6rk shore, and to some extent the land of Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk, in the years from 1933 to 1997, but these documents were variously registered with a proviso concerning defects in rights of title or without such provisos. Evidence of this is not available in the case in other respects. The respondents in this part of the case, other than Kv\u00edsker ehf., as recounted earlier, apparently derive their rights from Eyj\u00f3lfur Run\u00f3lfsson. This has not been specifically contested by the appellant, even though there is no evidence in the case in support of this contention. The respondents have also submitted documents confirming that they are registered as the owners of the Brei\u00f0am\u00f6rk shore in the Iceland Land Registry.", "Looking at the evidence concerning the title to the land of Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk it is clear that the farm was for a long time a possession of the Church and that it was administered by the Bishop at Sk\u00e1lholt until it was sold in 1525. On that sale, a part of the littoral rights relating to major driftage was separated from the land and retained for the Episcopal See at Sk\u00e1lholt, while minor driftage remained attached to the farm. Before the farm was abandoned in 1698, half of it had become a possession of the king, while the other half was referred to as a farmers' holding. The share of the king is believed to have been sold in 1836, but there is no record of who might have come into possession of it. From the mid-19th century there are records that a half share of Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk was believed to be attached to Hof, and it appears to have been surmised that his part was previously the king's possession. A public declaration of title to Hof dating from 1851, however, referred to the right to Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk only in the enumeration of easements. In a settlement made in 1854 for the resolution of a dispute resulting from this declaration of title, the boundaries between the land of Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk and the farm Fell in Su\u00f0ursveit were determined. Since the time of the conclusion of this settlement there is no evidence that the owners of Hof claimed title to the land or interests in the land. No evidence has been submitted in the case to indicate that the owners of Fell felt that by this settlement they came into possession of a part of Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk from the owners of Hof, and indeed later sources do not indicate that the former conducted themselves as if they were the owners of the land in part or in full. There is therefore no further evidence in the case concerning the fate of the half of the land which purportedly belonged to the king until the year 1836.", "In 1857, the owners of Fell, the Reverend \u00deorsteinn Einarsson and G\u00edsli \u00deorsteinsson purchased the major driftage rights from the Church at Sk\u00e1lholt. It must be assumed that Eyj\u00f3lfur Run\u00f3lfsson later, by contract with the descendants of \u00deorsteinn Einarsson and G\u00edsli \u00deorsteinsson in the closing decade of the 19th century, came into possession of the major driftage rights, but there is no evidence that he thereby acquired any other rights to the land of Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk, as it is clear from the letter from Einar G\u00edslason of 31 March 1876 that the attempts of G\u00edsli \u00deorsteinsson to purchase such rights several decades earlier had proved fruitless. The respondents in this part of the case, other than Kv\u00edsker ehf., derive their rights from Eyj\u00f3lfur Run\u00f3lfsson. Accordingly, they cannot claim the rights to the land of Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk other than a part of the Brei\u00f0am\u00f6rk shore, and it appears to be undisputed in the case that this corresponds to a half share.", "It then remains to be resolved what became of the rights to the half of Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk which apparently continued to be farmer-owned after the other half accrued to the king. Following the sale of the major driftage rights from the Church at Sk\u00e1lholt, where Vilhj\u00e1lmur Finsen, Country and County Sherriff, had represented the seller, he recounted in the letter cited above to the Reverend \u00deorsteinn Einarsson of 6 September 1858 that he could not provide 'the least information' who could have owned half of the land against the king, then or later. As recounted earlier, it is specified in the land assessment of 1804-1805 that this half was owned by G\u00edsli Halld\u00f3rsson. From the cited letter from Einar G\u00edslason of 31 March 1876, it does not appear to have been regarded as certain that G\u00edsli did not subsequently dispose of this share, but, on the other hand, it can be inferred from the letter that his descendants still believed themselves to own rights to the land, which were referred to as an easement. There is no further information as to who these descendants were. Bj\u00f6rgvin Vigf\u00fasson, who issued the cited deed of conveyance to the owners of Kv\u00edsker on 26 February 1937 for half of the land of Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk and half of the shore of Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk, apparently was Einar G\u00edslason's son in law. There is no evidence available that Bj\u00f6rgvin owned any rights to the sold property, nor that his wife, who was not involved in the contract, could in this respect have had any precedence over other descendants of G\u00edsli Halld\u00f3rsson. Accordingly, this proof of title, to which the defendant Kv\u00edsker ehf. traces its rights, is entirely untenable. For all of these reasons it cannot be seen that anyone can claim direct title to this half of the Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk, and there is no evidence to support the contention that the owners of Kv\u00edsker must be regarded as having had the control of it which could lead to such ownership by adverse possession. The appellant, on the other hand, has not protested that the defendant, Kv\u00edsker ehf., and the parties from whom Kv\u00edsker ehf. derives its right, have had the use of half of the Brei\u00f0am\u00f6rk shoreline in addition to using the land of Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk for grazing for the time required to acquire ownership of these rights by adverse possession. It must therefore be assumed that the defendant owns such rights of use to the land, as there is no evidence that any other parties could have earned such rights.", "According to the above, and with reference to Article 1 of Act No. 58/1998, the land of Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk is public land, but subject to the rights of the defendant Kv\u00edsker ehf. to its customary use of the land as grazing land and subject to the littoral rights of all the respondents, as provided in Article 5 of the same Act.
