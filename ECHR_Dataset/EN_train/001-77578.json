On 12 February 2003 the Azov Town Court dismissed another complaint, holding that the decision of 27 December 2002 (by which the enforcement proceedings in respect of the judgment of 10 January 2002 had been discontinued) had been lawful because it had been impossible to locate Mr S. or his property. Although on 14 November 2001 the applicant had agreed to pay for the search of Mr S.'s property, the costs had not yet been calculated. The judgment of 12 February 2003 was upheld on appeal on 9 April 2003.", "46. On 13 November 2003 the Azov Town Court dismissed the applicant's complaint about the bailiffs' failure to enforce the judgments and to provide him with the calculation of the costs for the search of Mr S.'s property.
