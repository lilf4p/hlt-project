The Ministry of Justice informed him that on 22 May 1996 the Court of Appeal had in fact sent a written version of the appellate decision to a special hospital of the Ministry of Interior where, at the time, the applicant had been detained. The applicant applied to the Ombudsman, who confirmed that the hospital had received the decision on 23 May 1996. The Ombudsman advised the applicant to ask the hospital management about the alleged disappearance of the written decision. The applicant appears not to have approached the hospital management subsequently.", "Following the applicant\u2019s demand, on 13 March 1997 the Court of Appeal sent him a written version of the decision of 15 May 1996.
