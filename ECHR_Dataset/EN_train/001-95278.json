As a result, he had stopped going to work already in June 1997.", "On 12 January 2005 the District Court discontinued the proceedings. It held that the defendant had complied with the obligation set out in the judgment of 1995 by concluding the contract with the applicant on 31 May 1997. The contract fulfilled the conditions stated in the judgment of 1995 and the applicant\u2019s right pursuant to that judgment had been extinguished.", "The applicant appealed and on 23 February 2009 the Regional Court upheld the District Court\u2019s decision.", "On 4 January 2007 and 18 March 2008 the Constitutional Court rejected two complaints about the length of the enforcement proceedings lodged by the applicant. On 15 April 2009, on the applicant\u2019s third complaint, the Constitutional Court found that the District Court had violated the applicant\u2019s right to a hearing without unjustified delay under Article 48 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution. It further held that the overall duration of the proceedings of more than thirteen years had been unreasonable. It awarded the applicant 3,500 euros (EUR) as just satisfaction in respect of non-pecuniary damage suffered."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
