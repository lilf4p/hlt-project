It follows that the court must reject the argument that the State has engaged its responsibility and failed to comply with its undertakings because compensation has been paid for only part of the loss of the property in issue.", "The loss sustained ..., which directly originated from the action of a foreign State, cannot give rise to liability on the part of the French State on the basis of the rule that public burdens shall be borne equally (principe de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 devant les charges publiques).", "In accordance with the final paragraph of section 4 of the Law of 26 December 1961 on the Admission and Resettlement of French Overseas Nationals, the Law of 15 July 1970 referred to above instituted a national levy to raise compensation for French nationals who had been dispossessed of their property, notably in Algeria. The amount of compensation paid to such persons pursuant to that statute has been increased by the Laws of 2 January 1978 and 16 July 1987 referred to above, the amount being limited, however, by the latter statute to 1,000,000 or 2,000,000 francs depending on the circumstances. [Although it has been submitted] that the payment of compensation for only part of the loss contravenes both the principles of national solidarity and payment of compensation of loss in full and the right to the protection of property guaranteed by the Constitution, the Preamble to the Constitution of 27 October 1946 and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 26 August 1789 to which it refers, it is not for the administrative courts to determine the constitutionality of those statutory provisions. By instituting a national levy to provide compensation in the form of an advance on the sums owed to French nationals by the Algerian State for the dispossession of their property, by making the share of the compensation fund apportioned to each dispossessed person proportional to the value of the property which he or she had lost and by imposing a general limit on the amount of that share in the light of the resources which the nation could reasonably devote to it, the aforementioned statutes do not contain any provision that is incompatible with France\u2019s international obligations under, on the one hand, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention... relating to unlawful interference with private property by any of the States that have signed the Convention or, on the other hand, Article 14 of the Convention or Article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which prohibit any discrimination between individuals....\u201d", "The applicants appealed to the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat, alleging, inter alia, a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Article 14 of the Convention. They also maintained that, in violation of Article 6 of the Convention and of their right to a fair hearing, the Administrative Court of Appeal had not acted as an independent and impartial tribunal, as it had \u201cregarded itself as being bound in practice by the interpretation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs\u201d, as reproduced in the Moraly judgment delivered by the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat on 31 January 1969.", "On 25 November 1998 the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat dismissed the appeals on points of law for the following reasons:", "\u201cThe ground of appeal based on the interpretation of the declarations made by the Government on 19 March 1962 regarding Algeria, known as the \u2018\u00c9vian Accords\u2019:", "An examination of the impugned judgment, which contains sufficient reasons, shows that for the purposes of interpreting those provisions of the aforementioned accords which were relied on, the Administrative Court of Appeal did not regard itself as being bound by the interpretation the Minister of Foreign Affairs may have given and, therefore, did not infringe either the provisions of Article 6 of the ... Convention ..., or, in any event, the first sub-paragraph of Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Further, in finding that the said declarations did not contain any clause or promise guaranteeing French nationals living in Algeria compensation from the French State for any loss sustained in the event of their being wrongfully divested of their property by the Algerian State, the Administrative Court of Appeal has not erred in law. It was entitled in law to deduce from that finding that the State\u2019s responsibility could not be engaged on the ground that it had failed to comply with the terms of the said declarations.", "The ground of appeal based on the State\u2019s promises:", "The Administrative Court of Appeal did not misconstrue the scope of the leaflet entitled \u2018the \u00c9vian Accords and the pieds noirs\u2019, which was published and distributed in 1962 by the High Commission of the Republic in Algeria, by holding that it contained no undertaking or promise by the French State to pay compensation in full for losses sustained by French owners dispossessed of their property in Algeria should the Algerian State fail to pay compensation.", "The ground of appeal based on the fact that the compensation award ... contravened various principles and French international obligations:", "Firstly, the loss sustained ..., which directly originated from the action of a foreign State, cannot, as the Administrative Court of Appeal rightly held, result in the responsibility of the French State being engaged on the basis of the rule that public burdens shall be borne equally.", "Secondly, the administrative courts have no jurisdiction to decide whether the system of lump-sum partial compensation set up by the Laws ... of 15 July 1970, 2 January 1978 and 16 July 1987 infringe quasi-constitutional rules and principles and the Administrative Court of Appeal rightly declined to examine that issue.", "Thirdly, the Administrative Court of Appeal did not err in law in holding that the decision of the French State (which, as has been explained above, was under no obligation to take the place of the defaulting Algerian State in compensating the dispossessed French owners in full) to award partial compensation when the direct cause of the damage was the act of a foreign state could not have infringed Article 1 of Protocol No 1 to the ...
