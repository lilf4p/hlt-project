According to the arrest protocol, the police officers had to use force to apprehend the applicant since he resisted the arrest. The applicant refrained from signing this document. The applicant alleged that, contrary to what was indicated in the arrest protocol, he had been arrested on 5 September 1999.", "6. Following his arrest, the applicant was blindfolded, put in a car and threats were uttered against him.

Before the judge, the applicant maintained that he had been kept in police custody for about one week and that he had been subjected to ill-treatment during custody.

He further maintained that there had been no need to torture the applicant as the security forces had already found several organisational documents of the PKK in his house. The second officer, \u0130.K., denied the accusation and claimed that members of illegal organisations generally made this kind of false accusation. He further contended that the minor marks mentioned in the medical report of 14 September 1999 did not result from torture. He alleged that they might have been the marks resulting from handcuffing.", "18. On 19 February 2001 the Fatih public prosecutor took a statement from the applicant, who reiterated his allegations and emphasised that he had been arrested on 5 September 1999, although the date on the arrest protocol was 8 September 1999.", "19.
