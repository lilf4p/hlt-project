In March 2004 the municipal housing maintenance authority lodged a claim against the applicant, seeking to recover unpaid housing charges.", "8. On 31 March 2004 the applicant counterclaimed, seeking compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage. He insisted that he had paid the housing charges on time and in full. The amount of the charges paid had been calculated to include the 50% discount to which he and his family were entitled.", "9. On 26 July 2004 the Justice of the Peace of the 47th Court Circuit of the Prikubanskiy District of Krasnodar partly found against the applicant and ordered him to pay outstanding housing charges. It rejected the applicant\u2019s counterclaim, finding that by law only he, but not his family members, was entitled to the discount.", "10. The applicant appealed against the judgment.

On 6 April 2005 the Prikubanskiy District Court of Krasnodar heard the parties and rejected the applicant\u2019s request. The court established that the summons had been sent to the applicant on 1 February 2005, and there had been no evidence showing that the summons had reached him before the hearing on 2 February. Nevertheless, according to civil procedural law, improper summoning is not a ground for a review of the case.", "16.
