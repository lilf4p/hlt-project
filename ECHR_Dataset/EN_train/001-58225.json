The applicant was born in 1953. He lives in Stalowa Wola, Poland.", "8. In 1986 the Katowice regional prosecutor instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant on suspicion of manslaughter of his wife. On 18 October 1987 the applicant was examined by a medical panel composed of two psychiatrists, who found that, on health grounds, he could not be held criminally responsible. The panel further concluded that the applicant posed a threat to public order. On 31 October 1987 the Jastrz\u0119bie-Zdr\u00f3j district prosecutor, having regard to the medical opinion, decided to discontinue the criminal proceedings against the applicant. On 30 November 1987 the Jastrz\u0119bie-Zdr\u00f3j district prosecutor requested the Katowice Regional Court to order the applicant\u2019s committal to a psychiatric institution.", "9. On 8 February 1988 the Katowice Regional Court committed the applicant to a mental hospital. The court, taking into consideration the submission of the prosecutor that the applicant had killed his wife and the expert medical opinion of 18 October 1987, concluded that the applicant posed a threat to public order. On 18 March 1988 the Supreme Court upheld this decision. On 13 April 1988 the applicant was placed in Rybnik Psychiatric Hospital.", "10. On 4 November 1988, 15 September 1989, 13 November 1989, 12 March 1990, 9 July 1990 and 17 December 1990 the Katowice Regional Court gave decisions concerning the applicant\u2019s continued detention. The court had regard to the applicant\u2019s medical file, including opinions of psychiatrists from Rybnik Psychiatric Hospital, which indicated that in view of the applicant\u2019s condition, which remained unchanged, his continued detention was necessary as he still presented a threat to public order.", "11. On 4 April 1991 the applicant\u2019s officially appointed lawyer requested the latter\u2019s release from the psychiatric hospital. On 27 May 1991 the Katowice Regional Court again refused to order the applicant\u2019s release, finding that it would entail a threat to public order.", "12.

On 16 March 1993 the applicant\u2019s lawyer lodged a further request for the applicant\u2019s release with the Katowice Regional Court. He also insisted that psychiatrists from Cracow University examine the applicant as he was convinced that it was only from this institution that an unbiased opinion could be obtained. By letters of 25 March 1993 and 13 April 1993, the court ordered Rybnik Psychiatric Hospital to submit an up-to-date medical opinion on the applicant\u2019s condition.", "16. In their opinion of 19 April 1993, the Rybnik Hospital psychiatrists stated that the applicant\u2019s condition required his continued detention and suggested that in view of his repeated requests for a medical examination by psychiatrists from another institution it would be advisable to order such an examination. By a decision of 26 April 1993, the court ordered that the applicant\u2019s condition should be assessed by psychiatrists from Cracow University.", "17. On 5 May 1993 the court found that the applicant could undergo the necessary medical examination in the Psychiatric Department of Cracow Detention Centre. On 17 May 1993 it fixed the date of the applicant\u2019s admission to the Centre at 31 May 1993. The applicant was brought to the Centre on that date, but was not admitted since certain necessary documents had not been submitted to the Centre. The Centre informed the court that the applicant could only be admitted on the strength of an order for his detention on remand and that persons detained at the Centre were subject to the legal provisions governing detention on remand.", "18. In a letter of 31 May 1993, the applicant complained to the court that he had not been examined by the Psychiatric Department of Cracow University. He contended that any opinion prepared by psychiatrists of the Cracow Detention Centre would be biased and threatened to go on hunger strike if he was brought to the Centre for a medical examination.", "19. On 25 June 1993 the applicant requested the reopening of the criminal proceedings.", "20. On 4 August 1993 the Psychiatric Department of Cracow University informed the Katowice Regional Court that the exact date of the applicant\u2019s out-patient examination could be fixed only after 23 August 1993.

On 18 May 1994 the Katowice Regional Court informed the applicant that his file was still with the Psychiatric Department of the University and that the expert medical report was not yet ready.

On 21 June 1994 the court informed him that it was still at Cracow University.", "27. On 21 June 1994, in reply to the court\u2019s enquiry, the University informed the Katowice Regional Court that it could not return the applicant\u2019s medical file to the court, as the medical opinion had not been prepared. On 5 July 1994, the applicant again requested to be granted access to his medical file. On 21 July 1994 the Katowice Regional Court informed him that his file was still being examined by the specialists of the Cracow University Psychiatric Department, who were preparing an opinion.", "28. In their opinion of 30 November 1994, the psychiatrists from Cracow University stated that the applicant\u2019s condition required continued detention and that the grounds on which his committal to a psychiatric institution had been ordered had not ceased to exist. This opinion was submitted to the Katowice Regional Court on 15 December 1994.", "29.

On 28 September 1996, the applicant attempted to commit suicide at Rybnik Psychiatric Hospital. On 23 June 1997, the Katowice Regional Court ordered the applicant\u2019s release.", "31. Conditions for the detention of persons of unsound mind who are not criminally responsible were laid down in the Polish Criminal Code, as it stood at the material time:", "Article 99", "\u201cIf it has been established that a person has committed an offence in a state of mental disorder [excluding his criminal responsibility], and his remaining at liberty entails a serious danger to public order, the court shall commit him to a mental hospital or another appropriate institution.\u201d", "\u201cIn cases provided for in Article 99 ... the period of detention is not determined in the decision of committal to the psychiatric institution; the court shall order release if the detention ceases to be necessary.\u201d", "32. According to the case-law of the Polish Supreme Court, a threat to public order is to be determined on the basis of the situation obtaining at the time when the offender\u2019s detention in the psychiatric institution is imposed. The assessment of the existence and the degree of such threat should be made in the light of an expert medical opinion. For a decision ordering detention in a psychiatric hospital to be given, it is not necessary that the expert medical opinion should state expressly that public order would be threatened if the offender were to remain at liberty. It suffices that such a conclusion may be drawn from the expert medical opinion taken as a whole (Orzecznictwo S\u0105du Najwy\u017cszego, Izba Karna i Wojskowa 1974, item 47).", "A threat to public order is considered serious if an offender\u2019s remaining at liberty gives rise to a risk that he might commit an unlawful act (Orzecznictwo S\u0105du Najwy\u017cszego, Izba Karna i Wojskowa 1972, item 183).", "33. Article 242 \u00a7 1 read together with Article 244 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as applicable at the relevant time, provided that a court could impose a fine on an expert who, without reasonable cause, consistently failed to comply with his or her obligation to submit a report to the court.", "34. Article 197 of the Enforcement of Sentences Code, as applicable at the relevant time, read:", "\u201c1. The director of a medical institution is obliged to keep the court informed of the detainee\u2019s health and of the progress of the treatment.", "...", "3. The court, at intervals of not longer than six months, shall decide, on the basis of a medical opinion, on the necessity to maintain further security measures.\u201d", "According to Article 8 of the Enforcement of Sentences Code an offender, in the proceedings before a court supervising execution of criminal judgments, was entitled to submit requests and to lodge appeals against the court\u2019s decisions if the law expressly provided for such appeals."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
