CROATIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Anatoly Kovler;Dean Spielmann;George Nicolaou;Giorgio Malinverni;Khanlar Hajiyev;Sverre Erik Jebens", "TEXT": ["The first applicant, Mr Stjepan Rau\u0161, was born in 1932 and died on 24 May 2007. He was a Croatian national. The second applicant, Mrs Biserka Rau\u0161 Radovanovi\u0107, is a Croatian national who was born in 1958 and lives in Vara\u017edin. She is the first applicant's daughter and his sole heir. Before the Court both applicants were represented by Mr G. Vu\u010deti\u0107, a lawyer practising in Vara\u017edin. The Croatian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mrs \u0160. Sta\u017enik.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "On 2 March 1981 the administrative authorities issued a decision expropriating a plot of land in Vara\u017edin, together with the house built on it, with a view to building a public elementary school there. At that time, the house was owned by the first applicant who lived in it together with his wife and daughter (the second applicant). Even though the decision stipulated that the house was to be demolished, it appears that this never happened and that the applicants remained living there. The second applicant left the house in 1984, after she got married.", "As the first applicant and the local authorities (who were the beneficiaries of the expropriation) had not been able to agree on the amount of compensation that should be granted for the expropriated property, on 13 July 1981 non-contentious proceedings for determining the said compensation were instituted before the Vara\u017edin Municipal Court. The parties to those proceedings were the first applicant, on one side, and the local authorities, on the other. The second applicant acted as her father's representative in those proceedings.", "On 8 May 1984 the Municipal Court issued a decision awarding the first applicant 1,091,809.66 Yugoslav dinars (YUD) in compensation. On 28 September 1984 the Vara\u017edin County Court dismissed the first applicant's appeal and upheld the first-instance decision. On 5 March 1987 the Supreme Court allowed the first applicant's appeal on points of law (revizija), quashed the lower courts' decisions in part and remitted the case back to the first-instance court. It instructed the first-instance court to determine whether, apart from the sum already awarded on 8 May 1984, the first applicant should receive an additional amount of compensation.", "In the resumed proceedings, on 7 March 1988 the Vara\u017edin Municipal Court issued a decision awarding the first applicant the additional amount of YUD 4,555,093. On 29 September 1988 the Vara\u017edin County Court allowed the first applicant's appeal, quashed the first-instance decision and remitted the case.", "In the resumed proceedings, on 13 May 1993 the Vara\u017edin Municipal Court dismissed the first applicant's claim for additional compensation. On 21 October 1993 the Vara\u017edin County Court allowed his appeal, quashed the first-instance decision and remitted the case.", "In the fresh proceedings, the Vara\u017edin Municipal Court held a hearing on 11 February 1994. On 18 February 1994 the new Expropriation Act entered into force. Shortly afterwards, the case was transferred to the administrative authorities, in particular the regional office of the state administration in the County of Vara\u017edin (the Vara\u017edin Office).", "In the ensuing administrative proceedings, the Vara\u017edin Office held hearings on 22 September 1995, 24 January 1996, 26 June and 4 September 2001 and 20 December 2002.", "On 30 December 2002 the Office issued a decision dismissing the first applicant's claim for additional compensation.
