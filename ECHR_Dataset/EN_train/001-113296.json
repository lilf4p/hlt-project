The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Yerevan.", "6. The applicant is an active member of civil society who holds leading positions in several NGOs, including the Unity of Armenian Volunteers, the Defence of Liberated Lands and AraksKur charity fund. He is of an Armenian origin and since 1992 has apparently been permanently resident in Armenia where he has a family and owns an apartment.", "7. The applicant appears to be a critic of the Armenian authorities. He alleges that in this connection he has been invited to visit the National Security Service (NSS) on several occasions, where he was ordered to stop his cooperation with the opposition and his criticism of the government.", "8. On an unspecified date the Head of the Principal Department for Safeguarding the Constitutional Order and Fight Against Terrorism of the NSS filed a motion, seeking to carry out secret surveillance and recording of the applicant\u2019s telephone and other conversations.", "9. On 15 August 2006 the Kentron and Nork-Marash District Court of Yerevan examined the motion, finding:", "\u201cIt is evident from the materials submitted to the court and the motion that the Principal Department for Safeguarding the Constitutional Order and Fight Against Terrorism of the NSS has sufficient grounds to believe that [the applicant], born in 1967 in Lebanon, a Lebanese national, residing at 17 Lepsius Str, apt 42, Yerevan, leader of the Armenian Volunteers Unity organisation, is carrying out activities aimed to destabilise the internal political situation in Armenia and to create a situation of civil disobedience, thereby creating a basis for the change of government in Armenia through unconstitutional means by making public calls.\u201d", "10. The District Court decided to grant the motion, authorising the interception and recording of the applicant\u2019s telephone and other conversations made to and from the applicant\u2019s three mobile and three landline numbers for a period of six months, taking into account that they might contain information substantiating the above-mentioned circumstances, the use of which would facilitate the disclosure of a crime and obtaining evidence, since there were elements of an offence prescribed by Article 301 of the Criminal Code (CC) in the applicant\u2019s actions. In doing so, the District Court referred to, inter alia, Articles 281 and 284 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP).", "11. On 2 December 2006 the applicant gave a speech at an assembly organised by the Unity of Armenian Volunteers. The assembly took place in the hall of the Yerevan State Choreography College and was attended by about 150 people. The applicant called on the participants of the assembly to get organised, otherwise nothing would move forward. It was not enough to keep telling the President and the Prime Minister to resign; they would never do that. Peaceful assemblies would not make them resign. Nor would external pressure. He called on the participants to create a significant force, in order to make the authorities resign, stating that the main and only objective was to get rid of them. He further stressed that they should not allow those in power to multiply, otherwise the future plans of the participants of the assembly would encounter serious obstacles. The applicant called the authorities \u201cmonsters\u201d who would become even more dangerous if they were allowed to multiply. The applicant agreed with other speech makers that any means were acceptable for achieving their goals.", "12. On 8 December 2006 the Investigative Department of the National Security Service decided to institute criminal proceedings under Article 301 of the CC on the ground that public calls for a violent overthrow of the government had been made during the speeches given at the above assembly.", "13. On 9 December 2006 at 10.30 p.m. the applicant was arrested and taken to the NSS.", "14. On the same date the applicant\u2019s office was searched, as a result of which a revolver and various types of bullets were found.", "15. On 10 December 2006 at 3.45 p.m. the relevant arrest record was drawn up. It stated that the applicant was suspected of offences under Articles 235 \u00a7 1 and 301 of the CC. It appears that his passport was seized.", "16. On the same date the applicant was questioned as a suspect. He refused to give testimony, stating that the criminal proceedings against him were politically motivated.", "17. On 12 December 2006 the applicant was formally charged under Articles 235 \u00a7 1 and 301 of the CC. He was accused of making calls for a violent overthrow of the government and of not handing in, and illegally keeping, his weapon after his demobilisation in 1998. Another person, V.M., who had also given a speech at the above assembly, was accused together with the applicant under Article 301 of the CC. Their speeches had been recorded.", "18. On the same date the investigator filed a motion with the Kentron and Nork-Marash District Court of Yerevan, seeking to have the applicant detained for a period of two months and arguing that, if at large, he could abscond and obstruct the investigation. It appears that on the same date three members of the parliament filed a statement with the District Court, giving their personal guarantees for the applicant\u2019s proper conduct and requesting that no detention be imposed.", "19. On the same date the District Court examined the investigator\u2019s motion, including the charge and the circumstances surrounding it. The District Court decided to grant the motion, taking into account the nature and degree of dangerousness of the imputed offence and the fact that it was at the top of the list of offences directed against state power and finding that the materials of the case provided sufficient reasons to believe that the applicant could abscond and obstruct the investigation by exerting unlawful influence on persons involved in the proceedings.", "20. On 19 December 2006 the applicant lodged an appeal, arguing, inter alia, that there was no reasonable suspicion of his having committed an offence and that the District Court had failed to provide reasons justifying the necessity of his placement in detention. He submitted, in particular, that the investigating authority had a recording of his speech at its disposal, so the allegation that he could unlawfully influence witnesses was unfounded. Furthermore, the allegation that he could abscond was not supported by any arguments or evidence, while the court did not take into account the fact that he was a permanent resident in Armenia, with two minor children and an elderly, sick mother who were dependent on him.", "21. On 27 December 2006 the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal. In dismissing the applicant\u2019s argument about the lack of a reasonable suspicion, the Court of Appeal found that his involvement in the imputed acts, which included features of offences envisaged by Articles 235 \u00a7 1 and 301 of the CC, was substantiated by evidence, such as various records and expert opinions, produced by the investigator and examined in court. As to the reasons given by the District Court, the Court of Appeal found these to be justified.", "22. On the same date the applicant filed a motion requesting to be released on bail. He submitted that he was known to the investigating authority and the court, he had a clear and concrete place of residence and he had never attempted to abscond. He asked the court to fix the amount of bail.", "23. On 30 December 2007 another person, V.A., who was the applicant\u2019s friend, was also charged under Article 235 \u00a7 1 of the CC with illegal possession of firearms and ammunition in the context of the same criminal proceedings.", "24. On 7 January 2007 the District Court refused the applicant\u2019s request for bail, citing the same grounds as those justifying his detention.", "25. On 22 January 2007 the Court of Appeal upheld this decision, adding that the applicant was a foreign national and therefore could abscond. Furthermore, it was unacceptable to release the applicant on bail in view of the fact that his co-accused, V.A., who was also charged with illegal possession of firearms and ammunition, was in detention.", "26. On 1 February 2007 the investigator filed a motion with the District Court seeking to have the applicant\u2019s detention period, which was to expire on 10 February 2007, extended by two months. The investigator argued that the applicant could abscond because he was a foreign national. He further argued that on 15 January 2007 the applicant had transmitted through his lawyer a short note to co-accused V.A. which said \u201cbe strong\u201d. This suggested that he was attempting to exert unlawful influence on the participants in the proceedings.", "27. On 7 February 2007 the District Court, having examined the investigator\u2019s motion and other materials, granted this motion, finding that there was a need to carry out further investigative measures and citing the same grounds as before in justifying the applicant\u2019s continued detention.", "28. On 8 February 2007 the applicant lodged an appeal. In his appeal he argued, inter alia, that the extension of his detention had been effected in violation of the time-limits prescribed by Article 139 \u00a7 1 of the CCP.", "29. On 23 February 2007 the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, finding that the District Court, taking into account the circumstances mentioned in the investigator\u2019s motion, had taken a reasoned decision, since the grounds for the applicant\u2019s detention had not ceased to exist. As to the violation of the time-limits, the Court of Appeal considered this not to be of such gravity as to have affected the correct outcome of examination of the investigator\u2019s motion.", "30. On 30 March 2007 the investigator filed a motion with the District Court seeking to have the applicant\u2019s detention period, which was to expire on 10 April 2007, extended by two months on the same grounds.", "31. On 4 April 2007 the District Court examined and granted this motion on the same grounds. In the proceedings before the District Court the applicant\u2019s lawyer asked the court whether any evidence had been submitted by the investigator in support of his motion which would be examined in court. The presiding judge replied that the materials of the criminal case related to the motion had been submitted by the investigator during the examination of his previous motion. These materials had been examined and returned by the court. The criminal procedure rules did not allow the lawyers access to the materials of a criminal case before the completion of the investigation.", "32. Following this announcement the applicant\u2019s lawyer challenged the judge\u2019s impartiality, inter alia, on the ground that the judge had not disclosed the materials in question to the defence during the previous proceedings. The judge dismissed this challenge with reference to, inter alia, Article 73 \u00a7 1 (12) of the CCP.", "33. On 19 April 2007 the applicant lodged an appeal, raising similar arguments as previously.", "34. The applicant alleged that his lawyers had not been notified of the hearing to take place upon his appeal and were therefore not able to appear.", "35. The Government contested this allegation and alleged that on 11 May 2007 the Court of Appeal had sent notifications to both the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office and the applicant\u2019s lawyers, which were received by them, informing them that the hearing on the applicant\u2019s appeal would take place on 14 May 2007.", "36. On 14 May 2007 the applicants lawyers filed a challenge with the Chairman of the Court of Appeal, contesting the impartiality of the judges who were assigned to examine the appeal. The lawyers stated in their challenge that they had been informed on 11 March that the case had been assigned to a judge rapporteur.", "37. On the same date the Court of Appeal examined the applicant\u2019s appeal in the absence of both parties. The Court of Appeal decided to dismiss the appeal with the same reasoning as on 23 February 2007. This decision stated that the parties had been duly notified of the hearing but failed to appear. The same follows from the transcript of the court hearing, in which it was stated that the parties had also been informed by a judge\u2019s assistant by telephone. It appears that a copy of this decision was received by the applicant\u2019s lawyers on 18 May 2007.", "38. In May 2007 the investigation was over and from 15 to 29 May the applicant was granted access to the case file. He submits that only then did he find out about the decision of 15 August 2006 authorising the secret surveillance of his telephone communications.", "39. On 5 June 2007 the prosecutor approved the indictment and the case was sent to court.", "40. On 7 June 2007 Judge M. of the Kentron and Nork-Marash District Court of Yerevan decided to take over the applicant\u2019s criminal case.", "41. On 10 June 2007 the applicant\u2019s detention period, authorised by the decision of 4 April 2007, expired.", "42. On 12 June 2007 the applicant complained to the General Prosecutor and the Minister of Justice that his detention authorised by a court had expired on 10 June 2007 and that his continued detention was unlawful. He sought to be released.", "43. On 22 June 2007 Judge M. decided to put the applicant\u2019s criminal case down for trial. This decision stated that the preventive measure imposed on the applicant was to remain unchanged.", "44. On 6 August 2007 the Kentron and Nork-Marash District Court of Yerevan found the applicant guilty under Article 235 \u00a7 1 and acquitted him under Article 301. The District Court, having examined the statements the applicant had made in his speech, found that they could not be qualified as calls for a violent overthrow of the government. As to the charge of illegal possession of a weapon, the District Court found that the applicant had kept the weapon and the ammunition without a permit after his demobilisation. The applicant was sentenced to one year and six months\u2019 imprisonment. The applicant\u2019s two co-accused were found guilty as charged.", "45. On 25 September 2007 the Criminal Court of Appeal upheld this judgment on appeal.", "46. The relevant provisions of the CC provide:", "\u201c1. Illegal acquisition, sale, possession, transportation or carrying of firearms, except for smooth-bore firearms and their bullets, ammunition, sawn-off firearms, bullets and explosive materials or devices shall be punishable by detention of up to three months or by imprisonment for a period not exceeding three years.\u201d", "\u201cPublic calls aimed at violently seizing State power and violently changing the constitutional order of Armenia shall be punishable by a fine of between 300 and 500 times the minimum wage or by detention of between two and three months or by imprisonment for a period not exceeding three years.\u201d", "47. For a summary of the relevant provisions see the judgment in the case of Poghosyan v. Armenia (no. 44068/07, \u00a7\u00a7 26-41, 20 December 2011). The provisions of the CCP which were not cited in that judgment read as follows.", "48. According to Article 135, the court, the prosecutor, the investigator or the body of inquest can impose a preventive measure only when the materials obtained in the criminal case provide sufficient grounds to believe that the suspect or the accused may: (1) abscond from the authority dealing with the case; (2) hinder the examination of the case during the pre-trial or court proceedings by exerting unlawful influence on persons involved in the criminal proceedings, by concealing or falsifying materials significant for the case, by failing to appear upon the summons of the authority dealing with the case without valid reasons or by other means; (3) commit an act prohibited by criminal law; (4) avoid criminal liability and serving the imposed sentence; and (5) hinder the execution of the judgment. When deciding on the necessity of imposing a preventive measure or choosing the type of preventive measure to be imposed on the suspect or the accused, the following should be taken into account: (1) the nature and degree of danger of the imputed offence; (2) the personality of the suspect or the accused; (3) age and state of health; (4) sex; (5) occupation; (6) family status and dependants, if any; (7) property situation; (8) whether he has a permanent residence; and (9) other important circumstances.", "49.

According to Article 73 \u00a7 1(12), defence counsel is entitled to familiarise himself with all the materials of the case, to make copies of and to take notes on any information contained in the case and in any volume, after the completion of the investigation.", "54. According to Article 201, materials of the investigation may be made public only with the permission of the authority dealing with the case.", "55. According to Article 265, the investigator, finding that the collected materials are sufficient to draw up the bill of indictment, informs the accused of this and decides on the location and time for his familiarising with the materials of the case.", "56. According to Article 281, operative and search activities which restrict the right to secrecy of correspondence, telephone conversations, postal, telegraphic and other communications of citizens shall be carried out only upon a judicial warrant.
