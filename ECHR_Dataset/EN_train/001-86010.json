On 13 January 1998 the Mukacheve State Tax Inspectorate (the \u201cInspectorate\u201d) ordered that the applicant company\u2019s accounting records for the period of 1997 be inspected for compliance with tax regulations. As a result of the inspection, held from 13 to 19 January 1998, the Inspectorate issued two decisions: nos. 26-87/2 of 19 January 1998 and 26-87/11 of 12 March 1998.

On 21 March 1998 it ordered the applicant company to pay in fiscal penalty of UAH 2,332,850 and UAH 79,150.", "5. On 17 March and 27 August 1998 the Regional Tax Administration upheld the decisions taken in the context of the tax inspection. On 22 and 25 May and 28 July 1998 the State Tax Administration of Ukraine rejected similar complaints as unsubstantiated.", "6. On 20 March 1998 the Zakarpatsky Regional State Control and Revision Service (\u0414\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0435 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e-\u0420\u0435\u0432\u0456\u0437\u0456\u0439\u043d\u0435 \u0423\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0456\u043d\u043d\u044f; the \u201cRevision Service\u201d) ordered the applicant company to pay UAH 9,596 as a penalty for infringement of financial regulations.", "7.

On 7 October 1998 the Mukacheve City Court remitted the indictment against the Director to the Mukacheve Prosecutor\u2019s Office for additional investigation, having noted that the investigation was incomplete and did not comply with procedural regulations. The remittal was upheld by the Zakarpatsky Regional Court on 11 November 1998. It also partly revised it, in relation to the alleged absence of unlawful intention on the part of the accused to evade tax, and confirmed that the charges had not been duly corroborated. The Directors signed an undertaking not to abscond.", "10. From December 1998 to May 2000 the Mukacheve Prosecutor\u2019s Office and the Zakarpatsky Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office (\u201cRegional Prosecutor\u2019s Office\u201d) reopened and suspended investigations for various procedural reasons. The charges against the Directors were amended on several occasions.", "11. On 14 August 2000 the criminal investigation against the Directors in relation to tax evasion episodes was terminated as the fiscal sanctions imposed by the Inspectorate had been declared null and void by the Arbitration Court (see paragraph 7 above). New criminal proceedings were instituted in respect of forgery committed by an official of the company, which were joined to the original proceedings.", "12. On 23 September 2000 the prosecutor in charge of the case filed a new bill of indictment against the Deputy Director on charges including abuse of power, forgery committed by an official, tax evasion and embezzlement. On 30 November 2000 the bill of indictment was lodged with the Mukacheve City Court. The Director was indicted for forgery committed by an official, theft and financial fraud.", "13.

On 5 January 2002 the case file, with the indictment against the Deputy Director on charges of financial fraud, abuse of power and forgery committed by an official, and the indictment against the Director on charges of financial fraud, abuse of power and forgery committed by an official, was referred to the Mukacheve City Court for preliminary examination.", "16. On 16 July 2004 the Mukacheve City Court, in the presence of the accused, their two representatives and the prosecutor, found the Directors guilty of document forgery and financial fraud. The Court decided not to convict them as the limitation period had expired, acquitted them of the remainder of the charges and ordered \u201cthe return of the material evidence as relevant\u201d. No appeal was lodged against this judgment and it became final.", "17. On 13 and 22 January 1998 the Inspectorate and Assistant Prosecutor, respectively ordered the seizure of the banking documents, main record book, cash registers, invoices, receipts, agreements and other accounting documents of the applicant company for the period from 1 January 1997 to 1 January 1998 and the accounting records of the applicant company for 1996.

On 26 and 27 January 1998 the Inspectorate seized petroleum products belonging to the applicant company from three different locations:", "- petrol station AZS MPP Petrol, the village of Chmonin;", "- petrol station no. 2, Mukacheve (AZS MPP Petrol);", "- petrol store of the MP \u201cErko\u201d (a private enterprise).", "20. On 27 January 1998 the Inspectorate attached diesel, petroleum and motor oil stored with Z.M. (The applicant company alleged that the petrol stations in Chmonin and Mukacheve, where the products were stored, were in a \u201cnatural disaster zone\u201d and had been destroyed by natural disaster, as allegedly stated in the notice issued by the Zakarpatsky Regional Chamber of Trade and Commerce of 29 December 1999. The applicant company mentioned that products stored at MP Erko had also disappeared).", "21. On 13 February 1998 the Assistant Prosecutor ordered a search of the private joint household of the Directors. The search resulted in the seizure of documents relating to the activities of the applicant company.", "22. On 24 February 1998 G.K. and the private company OJSC \u201cAPPEK\u201d were declared \u201ccivil plaintiffs\u201d in the criminal proceedings. On the same date the Assistant Prosecutor made a report on the transfer of diesel, petroleum and oil to storage by G.K. (G.K. had previously requested the Mukacheve Prosecutor\u2019s Office to declare it a \u201ccivil plaintiff\u201d and to order a transfer of petroleum products stored at Z.M.\u2019s premises to it, allegedly for recovery of the applicant company\u2019s debts for petroleum supplied in 1997.) The applicant company and G.K. signed the decisions on transfer of these products to G.K. They were transferred to this company under bills of transfer, with the application of Incoterms provisions traditionally used in commercial activities for contracts on sale of goods (see paragraph 105 below). (Later, on 17 September 1999, at G.K.\u2019s request, the applicant company signed a verification of debt record, which confirmed the applicant company\u2019s debts to G.K. of UAH 560,385.33.)", "23. On 14 May and 31 May 1998 the JSC Ukrbudresoursy (a private company) and the Revision Service were also declared civil plaintiffs.", "24. On 24 and 25 May 1998 the Assistant Prosecutor allowed the Deputy Director\u2019s requests for access to the accounting documents seized and for an additional forensic economic examination in the case. He also ruled that the documents seized, including accounting documents for 1997, were material evidence and a part of the criminal case file.", "25. On a number of occasions throughout the criminal investigation, and in particular from 9 January 1999 to November 2001, the Mukacheve Prosecutor\u2019s Office and the Zakarpatsky Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office informed the applicant company that:", "- the documents seized could not be returned as they were part of the case file, but that the Directors were not prohibited from copying them;", "- the petroleum products seized had been transferred to G.K. for storage;", "- it was not possible to terminate the criminal proceedings;", "- it was not possible to lift the attachment on property and documents, including accounting records, and return them, as they were material evidence.", "26. On 16 April and 8 December 1999 and 11, 14 and 25 January 2000 the applicant company lodged several complaints with the President\u2019s Administration, the Ministry of Justice, the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office and the Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office, of unlawful seizure of accountancy documents and requesting their return. In particular, it made unsuccessful requests to:", "- have the documents returned for completion as some formal information was missing from them, such as signatures, seals and so on;", "- be recognised as a \u201ccivil plaintiff\u201d in the criminal investigation and to have the prosecutor\u2019s office which had seized documents designated a \u201crespondent\u201d.", "27. On 17 and 27 January 2000 the Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office stated that the Directors\u2019 access to the accounting records was not limited as they had been able to familiarise themselves with the case file from 11 to 17 January 2000.", "28. On 27 December 2000 and 29 October 2002 the applicant company unsuccessfully requested the Mukacheve City Court to annul the attachment of its property and the Directors\u2019 private property.", "29. On 16 July 2004 the Mukacheve City Court ordered the return of material evidence \u201cas relevant\u201d (see paragraph 16 above).", "30.

It also ruled that the company had failed to pursue a pre-arbitration settlement procedure.", "31. On 15 April 2000 the applicant company lodged a request for pre-arbitration settlement with the Inspectorate, demanding damages and compensation for loss of profit in the amount mentioned in paragraph 30 above. On 5 September 2000 the Inspectorate disagreed with the request for settlement, finding it unsubstantiated, both as to form and content.", "32. On 8 May 2000 the applicant company lodged its claims with the Arbitration Court again and requested it to declare unlawful the verbatim reports on the seizure of documents and attachment of property by the Inspectorate on 13 and 27 January 1998 (see paragraphs 17 and 20 above).", "33. On 15 May 2000 the Arbitration Court refused to examine the applicant company\u2019s claims as it had failed to pay the court fee for bringing the claims and thus had not complied with Article 63 of the Code of Arbitration Procedure (see paragraph 87 below). It also stated, referring to the recommendation of the Presidium of the Higher Arbitration Court of 26 January 2000, that these claims should be resolved in accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 99 below).", "34. On 22 May 2000 the applicant company complained to the Mukacheve City Court that the tax authorities\u2019 acts were unlawful and requested the court to annul the Inspectorate\u2019s reports of 13 and 27 January 1998 (see paragraphs 17 and 20 above). On 30 May 2000 the court dismissed the applicant company\u2019s complaint without examining it on the merits, finding that it had no jurisdiction to deal with it. The court indicated that complaints concerning criminal proceedings were to be examined by the courts of general jurisdiction, pursuant to Articles 24 and 248-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 76 below).", "35. The applicant company appealed in cassation to the Zakarpatsky Regional Court. The first-instance court informed the applicant company that a hearing was scheduled on 15 June 2000 and ruled that the presence of its representative was not obligatory.", "36. On 27 June 2000 the regional court, with no parties present and in a preliminary hearing, returned the appeal in cassation to the first-instance court without examining it. The court ruled that the Deputy Director had failed to provide a letter of authority and the case file was returned to the first instance court.", "37. In August 2000 the applicant company lodged a complaint with the Mukacheve City Court, contending that the appeal in cassation had been properly lodged. In a letter of 11 August 2000 the Acting President of the Mukacheve City Court stated that the letter of authority had been sent to the Regional Court in order to be appended to the case file. He stated that the returned case file had had no letter of authority attached to it and requested a new letter of authority.", "38. The parties have provided no information as to the outcome of these proceedings.", "39. On 22 August and 11 September 2000 the Arbitration Court refused to examine three claims against G.K. lodged by the applicant company for annulment of the decision on the transfer of petroleum products from it to G.K. as they were beyond the jurisdiction of the arbitration courts (Article 12 of the Code of Arbitration Procedure). In particular, the \u201ctransfer decisions\u201d were not \u201cnormative acts\u201d within the meaning of this provision (see paragraph 85 below).", "40. On 17 November 2000 the Kyiv Court of Arbitration refused to examine three new claims by the applicant company against G.K. by which it sought annulment of the transfer decisions mentioned above as the company had no legal capacity after having been declared insolvent: only the company\u2019s liquidator could act on its behalf.", "41. On 19 December 2000 the Kyiv Court of Arbitration, in a different composition, left the applicant company\u2019s claims unexamined as they were unsubstantiated, meaning that the copy of the \u201ctransfer decision\u201d did not provide evidence of a legal act, nor could it lead to a finding of the existence of a legal act.", "42. On 18 September 2000 the applicant lodged a claim with the Arbitration Court against the Inspectorate seeking damages of UAH 35,095,760 for the Inspectorate\u2019s unlawful actions.", "43. On 25 September 2000 the Arbitration Court returned this claim without having examined it, under Article 63 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Arbitration Procedure (see paragraph 87 below), as the applicant company had failed to provide corroborating evidence in support of its claims for loss of income and to prove a causal link between the fiscal sanction and the damage alleged.", "44. In October 2000 the applicant company lodged its claims again and on 2 October 2000 the Arbitration Court returned this claim for the same reasons as on 25 September 2000 (see paragraph 43 above).", "45. On 22 and 29 December 1999 Z.M. informed the applicant company that it had been instructed by G.K. to sell the petroleum products and that the seized petroleum products had been transferred to that company.", "46. On 12 May 2000 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Arbitration Court against G.K., seeking the return of the petroleum products or reimbursement of their cost. On 18 May 2000 the Arbitration Court returned these claims as not having been lodged, without having examined them on the merits, as the applicant company had failed to substantiate the sum claimed and had not paid the court fee.", "47. On 24 August 2001 the Directors complained to the Mukacheve City Court against the Mukacheve Prosecutor\u2019s Office, seeking a declaration that the actions of the Prosecutors\u2019 Office were unlawful and requesting compensation for pecuniary damage. The outcome of these proceedings, which apparently were not pursued, is unknown.", "48. On 10 November 1999 the Inspectorate lodged an application with the Arbitration Court seeking to declare the applicant company insolvent.", "49. On 15 November 1999 the Arbitration Court assumed jurisdiction over the case and instituted liquidation proceedings against the company, prohibiting the sale of its assets.", "50. On 3 April 2000 the Arbitration Court requested the parties to provide it with additional information on the case and ordered that the applicant company should be managed by an insolvency officer, D.M.A., (\u0430\u0440\u0431\u0456\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0436\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0435\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0447\u0438\u0439) who should analyse the company\u2019s finances, and attach its property and prohibit its sale. The court also prohibited enforcement of any claims of creditors against the company, except those allowed by section 12(4) of the Insolvency Act (salary- and social-related payments).", "51. On 7 April 2000 D.M.A. issued an order prohibiting any actions with regard to the company or its assets.", "52. On 16 June 2000 the Arbitration Court, in the presence of the Deputy Director, representatives of the applicant company\u2019s creditors and D.M.A., ordered the Inspectorate to publish information on the initiation of the liquidation proceedings. D.M.A. was ordered to draw up a list of creditors. The next hearing was scheduled for 5 September 2000.", "53. On 25 September 2000 the Arbitration Court, in the presence of the Deputy Director, approved the list of the company\u2019s creditors, consisting of the Inspectorate, G.K. and the Uzhgorod Branch of Ukrsotsbank. It approved the list of their financial claims and ordered the creditors to meet on 12 October 2000. D.M.A. had to inform the court of the results of the meeting and to provide the court with a final register of creditors\u2019 claims. In particular, the court noted that the claims of G.K. amounted to UAH 450,843.30 and had not been challenged by the Deputy Director in the course of the hearing.", "54. On 6 November 2000 the Arbitration Court declared the applicant company insolvent and initiated its liquidation, which had to be completed within twelve months. D.M.A. was appointed as the company\u2019s liquidator and was ordered to publish information about the applicant company\u2019s insolvency, to form a liquidation commission and to finalise the liquidation procedure. The applicant company had to provide the liquidator with all the documents, official seals and other property belonging to it by 17 November 2000. The liquidator had to provide a liquidation balance to the court by 5 November 2000.", "55. On 21 November 2000 the Directors unsuccessfully requested the Arbitration Court to review and quash its own ruling of 6 November 2000.", "56. On 17 September 2001 the Directors unsuccessfully requested the Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office to return the accounting records, which from their point of view were necessary for finalising the liquidation, and to lift the attachment of the petroleum products so as to have them included in the register of the liquidated company\u2019s property. (According to the applicant this request remained unanswered.)", "57. On 18 September 2001 the Directors instituted proceedings against the liquidator in the Zakarpatsky Regional Commercial Court (formerly the Arbitration Court; hereafter \u201cCommercial Court\u201d) seeking to declare unlawful his failure to include the seized petroleum products in the register.", "58. By a ruling of 28 September 2000, which apparently was adopted on 28 September 2001, the Commercial Court approved the liquidation balance and the liquidator\u2019s report. The court ruled that the company should be liquidated, that the relevant State authorities and the company\u2019s management should be informed of the court\u2019s ruling and the termination of the proceedings.", "59. On 17 October 2001 the Directors appealed against the ruling of 28 September 2001 to the L\u2019viv Commercial Court of Appeal. They also requested that the ruling of 6 November 2000 be quashed and the time-limit for lodging an appeal be extended, alleging that they had received that ruling late.", "60. On 29 October 2001 the L\u2019viv Commercial Court of Appeal, composed of three judges, dismissed the applicant company\u2019s request for the extension of the time-limit as it had been lodged outside the statutory time-limit of three months under Article 91 of the Code of Commercial Procedure. It also returned the appeal of 17 October 2001 to the applicant company, without examining it on the merits.", "61. On 24 November 2001 the applicant company appealed in cassation to the Higher Commercial Court, seeking to have declared null and void the rulings of 28 September 2001 and 6 November 2000. In particular, it alleged that the liquidator had failed to include the property seized by the prosecutor\u2019s office in the liquidation report. The company noted a technical mistake in the year of the ruling dated 28 September 2000, which in fact had been adopted on 28 September 2001. It alleged that a request for extension of the time-limit had been lodged with the Higher Commercial Court.", "62. On 9 January 2002 the Higher Commercial Court informed the applicant company that the appeal in cassation had been wrongly lodged, as it should have been sent through the first instance commercial court.", "63. On 6 March 2002 the Higher Commercial Court refused to examine the applicant company\u2019s appeal in cassation as it had failed to comply with the requirements of Chapter XII of the Code of Commercial Procedure in that the company had failed to pay the court fee for lodging the appeal (see paragraphs 91 \u2013 94 below).", "64. On 14 May 2002 the Higher Commercial Court dismissed the applicant company\u2019s appeal in cassation as it had not complied with the one-month time-limit envisaged by Article 110 of the Code of Commercial Procedure (see paragraph 95 below). The Court also informed the applicant company that no request for extension of this time-limit had been lodged.", "65. On 20 June 2002 the Supreme Court remitted the applicant company\u2019s appeal, without having examined it, to the Higher Commercial Court and eventually it was sent to the first-instance commercial court.", "66. On 9 July 2002 the Higher Commercial Court again dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal in cassation as having been lodged out of time, finding that no request for extension had been lodged.", "67. The applicant company alleged that it had lodged a request for extension of the time-limit, together with its appeal in cassation, with the Higher Commercial Court after the ruling of 9 July 2002.", "68. On 27 October 2006 the Directors lodged compensation claims against the prosecution authorities with the Mukacheve City Court. They sought UAH 24,537,664 in pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage caused by the allegedly unlawful actions during the criminal investigation against them.", "69. On 6 November 2006 the Mukacheve City Court left the aforementioned claims unexamined and returned them to the Directors, finding that they had not complied with the requirements of Article 119 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The claimants were asked to rectify these shortcomings before 15 November 2006. On 16 November 2006 the court returned these claims unexamined, for failure to comply with the court\u2019s previous ruling.", "70. The relevant provisions of the Constitution read as follows:", "\u201cEveryone shall have a right to compensation ... for losses sustained as a result of unlawful decisions, acts or omissions by public or municipal bodies or civil servants in the performance of their official duties.\u201d", "By virtue of Article 442 of the Code everyone has the right to compensation for damage caused by unlawful actions by State authorities.", "71. Section 2 of the Enterprises Act envisages that private enterprises are commercial companies founded by private persons. The private enterprise has no distinct shareholding and particularised ownership of property, except if specified in the articles of its association, statute or other internal corporate regulations.", "72. The private enterprise, in accordance with the Section 4 of the Property Act, is an object of a free exercise of property rights envisaged for any kind of privately owned property. The ownership rights and the rights and legal obligations of a founder of a private enterprise can also be transferred to other private persons on the basis of an agreement (this is confirmed in other normative acts and recommendations, such as the letter no. 4-422-329/7239 of 10 December 2001 of the State Committee on Entrepreneurship; Resolution no. 740 of the Cabinet of Ministers of 25 May 1998).", "73. In accordance with Section 7 of the Property Act the owner of a private enterprise was not responsible for its legal obligations (letter no. 2222/1068 of 22 February 2002 of the State Committee on Entrepreneurship). The liability of an owner for debts of a private enterprise could only be established on the basis of its statute or articles of association or specific normative acts.", "74. Section 13 of the Enterprises Act provides that the State must guarantee protection of enterprises\u2019 property rights. Seizure of funds and property belonging to enterprises is only allowed in situations provided for by the law. Also, a decision to pay compensation for damage caused to an enterprise by the infringement of its property rights by citizens, legal entities or State bodies must be based on a judgment of a court or court of arbitration.", "75. Sections 24 and 31 of the Enterprises Act stated that the private enterprise must, as all other legal entities, comply with the credit agreements and State tax and other payment obligations. A private enterprise that fails to comply with its financial obligations could be declared bankrupt in the course of ordinary insolvency proceedings and could be liquidated, as any other legal entity.", "76. The relevant extracts from the Code can be found in Merit v. Ukraine, no. 66561/01, 30 March 2004 (Relevant domestic law and practice).", "77. Pursuant to Article 80 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (the conditions for storage of material evidence), material evidence must be stored until the judgment or decision terminating proceedings in the criminal case becomes final. Documents that are material evidence must be stored together with the case file and interested persons or organisations can receive copies of these documents on request. If there is a dispute as to the right of ownership of the material evidence, this evidence must be stored until the final judgment is given in civil proceedings.
