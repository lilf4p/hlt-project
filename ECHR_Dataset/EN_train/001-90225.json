Pursuant to the provisions of this contract, in the event of a delay in completion of the construction works, the applicant could claim late-payment penalties from the Bank.", "6. As the Construction Company officially completed the works only on 29 August 1996, on 2 October 1996 the applicant instituted civil proceedings in the Pechersky District Court of Kyiv claiming payment from the Bank for delay in completion of the works.", "7. On 2 December 1996 Judge V. held a hearing. Subsequently Judge Z., the President of the Pechersky Court at the material time, withheld the case from Judge V. for unspecified reasons.", "8. On 27 October 1997 the Bank lodged a counterclaim, alleging that the promise to pay a penalty for the Construction Company\u2019s failure to fulfil the work on time had been given by it ultra vires, and had to be annulled as incompatible with the applicable banking law.", "9. On 19 November 1997 Judge Z. pronounced a judgment dismissing the applicant\u2019s claim and allowing the Bank\u2019s counterclaim. However, he did not sign this judgment.", "10.

In July 2001 Judge Z. was dismissed on disciplinary grounds.", "14. On 10 December 2001 the Kyiv City Department of Justice informed the applicant that it had investigated his complaint about the lengthy consideration of his cassation appeal and discovered that former Judge Z. had failed to register it and had withheld the case file from the court\u2019s registry. The Department assured the applicant that the case would be promptly transferred to the Kyiv City Court of Appeal for consideration.", "15. On 7 May 2002 the City Court quashed the judgment of 19 November 1997 as unsigned by the presiding judge and remitted the case for a fresh consideration.", "16. On 10 October 2002 the Pechersky Court allowed the applicant\u2019s claim and dismissed the Bank\u2019s counterclaim. On 24 October 2002 the Bank appealed.", "17. On 4 December 2002 the Kyiv Court of Appeal reversed the judgment, having annulled the clause concerning the Bank\u2019s responsibility for the Construction Company\u2019s delay as incompatible with the applicable law.", "18. On 23 December 2002 the applicant appealed in cassation before the Supreme Court.", "19. On 16 October 2003 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant\u2019s request for leave to appeal in cassation.", "20.

His criminal case included several episodes, none of which concerned the applicant\u2019s civil case.", "21.
