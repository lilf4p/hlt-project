On 2 December 2004 the R\u0113zekne Court (R\u0113zeknes tiesa) detained the applicant for a period of two months. The decision referred to five previous convictions of the applicant, the risk of his absconding, the fact that the applicant had been charged with committing a particularly serious offence and that he had been detained within a month of his release from earlier imprisonment.

On 11 August 2006 the Latgale Regional Court examined the R\u0113zekne Court\u2019s request to extend the applicant\u2019s detention until 25 November 2006. The court established that the co-defendants were coordinating their activities by hindering the trial with the aim of reaching the maximum statutory time-limit for pre-trial detention, after which they would have to be released. The decision was not subject to appeal.", "15. On 28 August 2006, following the applicant\u2019s request, the R\u0113zekne Court refused to lift the preventive measure by stating that circumstances had not changed since adoption of the last refusal, and that by submitting various requests the applicant was attempting to postpone the trial.", "16.

Accordingly, on 26 November 2006 the applicant was released.", "20. From January to November 2007 the trial was postponed on various occasions owing to the applicant\u2019s health.
