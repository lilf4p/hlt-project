The applicant was born in 1933 and lives in Cahul.", "6. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "7. In 1983 the applicant bought a house. The Cahul municipality subsequently allocated to the applicant the plot of land on which his house stood. In 1995, E., the applicant\u2019s neighbour, moved the fence separating their respective plots and thus reduced the size of the applicant\u2019s land.", "8. The applicant brought court proceedings against E., seeking the removal of all impediments on the part of E. to his use of his land. On 29 May 1995 the Cahul District Court found in favour of the applicant. No appeal was lodged and the judgment became final. Following a request by the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, on 13 October 1995 the Supreme Court of Justice quashed the judgment of 29 May 1995 and ordered a full re-hearing. On 24 May 1996 the Cahul District Court rejected the applicant\u2019s claims.", "9. In parallel, the applicant requested the municipality to determine the boundary between his land and that of E. This was carried out on an unknown date in 1996. E. challenged the municipality\u2019s actions in court but her complaint was rejected on 4 May 1996 by the Cahul District Court. There was no appeal and the judgment became final.", "10. The applicant requested the municipality to establish his title to the land. On 26 February 1997 the municipality did so, determining the area of the land respectively owned by E. and the applicant. E. challenged that decision in court. Her request was rejected by the Cahul District Court on 8 August 1997. That judgment was upheld by the Cahul Regional Court on 13 November 1997 and the Court of Appeal on 17 March 1998. The judgment thus became final.", "11. On 4 February 1999 the municipality annulled its own decision of 26 February 1997 and granted the applicant title to a smaller parcel of land. The applicant challenged the 1999 decision in court and sought an order for the removal of all impediments to his use of his land. On 20 September 1999 the Cahul District Court annulled the 1999 municipality\u2019s decision. That judgment was upheld by the Comrat Regional Court on 2 May 2000 and the Court of Appeal on 7 September 2000. That judgment was final.", "12. The applicant requested the Cahul District Court to issue an enforcement warrant, which was apparently refused. He made a number of complaints in this respect to various State authorities such as the Parliament, the Supreme Court of Justice, the municipality (for instance, in November 2000, September 2001, April and June 2002, January and March 2003) and was informed that during the period 1995-2000 no enforcement warrant in his name had been submitted for execution. On 19 December 2001 he was informed by the Ministry of Justice that it was not necessary to issue any enforcement warrant since the court in its judgment of 8 August 1997 had rejected E.\u2019s claims and thus the municipality\u2019s decision of 26 February 1997 remained in force.", "13. On 8 October 2001 E.\u2019s representative C.M. lodged a separate appeal against the judgment of 20 September 1999. On 5 December 2001 the Supreme Court of Justice decided that the appeal by E.\u2019s representative should be examined by the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Regional Court, since most of the judges in the Cahul District Court had already sat in the case. On 18 April 2002 the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Regional Court dismissed the appeal on grounds of res judicata. There was no appeal and the judgment became final.", "14. On 6 August 2002 E. initiated new proceedings asking the court to determine the rights over the land (both hers and the applicant\u2019s). The applicant argued that there was no need to examine the case since all outstanding issues had been settled by the various municipality and court decisions adopted earlier. On 30 May 2003 he asked for an expert report to be made concerning the feasibility of using the land in any other manner than that in which it had been allocated by the municipality in 1997.", "15. On 11 July 2003 the Cahul District Court rejected E.\u2019s claim and found that the land should be divided in accordance with the municipality\u2019s decision of 26 February 1997. That judgment was upheld by the Cahul Court of Appeal on 9 April 2004 and by the Supreme Court of Justice on 26 May 2004.", "16. On 26 May 2004 the applicant was issued with an enforcement warrant ordering the delimitation of the border between the applicant\u2019s land and that belonging to E.", "17.
