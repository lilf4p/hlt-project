On 31 January 1980 that same office informed the applicant that his other public law paper had been marked \u201cinsufficient\u201d (ungen\u00fcgend, 0 points).", "10.

By letter to the Regional Court of 7 February 1990 the applicant requested that the proceedings should be continued. Referring to expert opinions submitted by fifteen legal scholars, he claimed that the evaluations of his two examination papers were incorrect.

By partial judgment (Teilurteil) of 29 August 2000 the Court of Appeal rejected the applicant's claim in so far as it concerned damages for the time after 31 May 1980. It found that the applicant had failed to prove that any illness after the end of July 1981 had been caused by the alleged incorrect evaluation of his examination papers. In this respect, the court followed the expert's opinion that any illness which had been caused by the evaluation had subsided after a maximum period of 1.5 years and that any following illness was solely caused by the structure of the applicant's personality. According to the Court of Appeal, the expert's reasoning duly took into account the medical statements submitted by the applicant. Accordingly, that Court did not find it necessary to hear witnesses on the applicant's state of health.", "44.

On 18 September 2001 the Court of Appeal, by final judgment (Schlussurteil), found that the evaluation of the two examination papers had been indeed incorrectly low and that the examiners had acted in breach of their official duties. Had the examination papers been correctly evaluated, the applicant would have very probably passed the examination and would have found employment as a trainee lawyer. Accordingly, it granted the applicant DEM 1,500.00 as damages for lost income in the month of May 1980 and further DEM 10,000.00 for non-pecuniary damages."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
