On the same day the case file was sent to the Warszawa District Court which was competent to deal with the subject-matter.", "7. The first hearing was scheduled for 22 February 1993. It did not take place because on 21 December 1992 the Warszawa District Court stayed the proceedings due to the fact that on 3 December 1992 winding-up proceedings had been instituted against the defendant.", "8.

It appears that between the date when the proceedings were resumed and the day on which the first-instance judgment was given, no hearing took place.
