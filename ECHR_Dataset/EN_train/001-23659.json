THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant, Mr Mark Cronin, is a United Kingdom national, who was born in 1956 and lives in Sheffield. He is represented before the Court by Mr P. Mahy, a lawyer practising in Sheffield.", "On 21 November 2001 a warrant to search the applicant\u2019s home was granted by justices sitting at Sheffield Magistrates\u2019 Court under, inter alia, section 23 (3) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The warrant authorised a search for cannabis and associated drug paraphernalia. It was granted on the basis of an Information dated 20 November, sworn by police constable Frost, which set out the following grounds for the application:", "\u201cIn October/November 2001, the police were contacted by an anonymous male stating that they had witnessed various persons visiting the target address at all times of the day, both on foot and in vehicles. These persons were unknown to the source but only visited the target premises for a matter of minutes before leaving. It has been stated that the premises were involved in the supply of cannabis.", "The source has since contacted the police and confirmed that the activity is constant.", "This same unregistered source has contacted the police on several occasions and has supplied reliable information.", "Enquiries with the council reveal that [the applicant] is the tenant of the semi-detached property and they have also received complaints in relation to vehicles visiting the address in the summer of 2001 by local residents.", "The vehicles, which are visiting the address on a regular basis, are used by the local drug fraternity who have previous criminal convictions for possession of cannabis.\u201d", "The Information went on to outline why alternative methods of enquiry were considered unsuitable and why the search was necessary. It stated:", "\u201cA search warrant is considered to be a proportionate response\u201d.", "The warrant was executed on 29 November 2001. Eight police officers searched the applicant\u2019s home for forty five minutes, during which time the applicant and his wife were present. No items were found and no further action was taken against the applicant.", "The applicant issued judicial review proceedings in March 2002, alleging that the failure of the justices to give reasons for their decision or to make a record of the hearing at which the warrant was granted meant that there were no adequate or effective safeguards against abuse of the warrant procedure. He submitted that the information supplied to the justices was ambiguous and inconsistent; for example because the \u201canonymous\u201d male was also a \u201csource\u201d known to the police, and because the statement that the premises were involved in the supply of cannabis was merely an unattributed assertion. Moreover, the source of the statement about the use of the vehicles by the local \u201cdrug fraternity\u201d was unclear.", "Permission to apply for judicial review was granted on 10 May 2002. Witness statements were served from the police officer, the two lay magistrates and the legal adviser who were at the hearing on 21 November 2001. The police officer made two statements, the second of which outlined police concerns that, as applications for warrants were often based on confidential information, recording of the evidence or the justices\u2019 reasons at the hearing of an application for a warrant could have a severe impact on police effectiveness. As to the particular application, the officer recalled being asked various questions by the justices about the vehicles mentioned in the Information and the geographical layout of the area.", "The legal adviser to the justices, although unable to remember the specific case, gave details in his statement of his \u201cinvariable practice\u201d when dealing with applications for warrants. In particular, he stated that he would draw the justices\u2019 attention to the relevant statutory requirements and if any matters arose during the application which did not appear within the body of the Information, he would direct the justices to endorse those matters on the Information. In general, he asserted that the Information itself became the written record of evidence, together with any additional comments noted as a result of the justices\u2019 questions to the constable. Taking a full note of the evidence would therefore simply be to restate the facts already set out in the Information and serve no useful purpose.", "In the Divisional Court\u2019s judgment on 20 November 2002, the Lord Chief Justice, dismissing the application and endorsing the views of the legal adviser to the justices, said:", "\u201c23. The evidence that exists in this case, as it seems to me, shows that the safeguards which the statute rightly requires and which article 8 makes necessary, which would also be required in the appropriate circumstances by article 6, were fully complied with. In considering compliance with article 8 and article 6 the facts of the particular case will in the end always be decisive. When justices accept an information as containing all the material upon which they rely as satisfying them ... it is unreasonable to require them to make a note. If a particular matter is elicited in the course of questioning the deponent who is seeking the warrant, then ... it would be desirable to make a note of that matter, not only for the benefit of any subsequent citizen who wished to challenge the legality of the warrant, but also to protect the justices and police from unwarranted allegations.\u201d", "The Lord Chief Justice went on to say that, in the applicant\u2019s case:", "\u201cThe material upon which the warrant was issued is clearly contained in the information and the basis on which the warrant was issued is obvious without any need for the justice merely to repeat that he is satisfied as required by section 23 of the 1971 Act. To require the justice to set out that he was so satisfied would serve no purpose whatsoever.\u201d", "The Divisional Court referred with approval to the prescribed form in which the Information was contained, noting that it appeared to have been carefully drafted with Articles 6 and 8 of the Convention in mind. The court concluded that, whilst an exceptional case would have to be considered on its merits, in the ordinary case it would be unreasonable to require anything additional to the Information itself, which the person affected ought to be able to obtain. The court refused permission to appeal, as did the Court of Appeal itself on 23 December 2002.", "Section 15 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (\u201cPACE\u201d) provides:", "\u201cSearch warrants-safeguards.
