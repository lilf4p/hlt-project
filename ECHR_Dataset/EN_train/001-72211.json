The period of detention on remand was included in the sentence. In his appeal the applicant\u2019s lawyer challenged the court\u2019s assessment of facts and law; however, he did not raise the issue of the non-public examination of the case.", "20. On 20 April 2001 the Regional Court ruled that the first instance court had failed to comply with certain procedural requirements regarding the defendants\u2019 right to be duly notified about the conduct of the appeal proceedings.
