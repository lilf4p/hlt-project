On 7 March 1997 the applicant parked his car in an unauthorized place. He was stopped by the municipal police officers while he was transporting flowers and more than 200 kilos of soil to his shop. The police officers proposed the applicant to pay PLN 50 as a fine for parking in an unauthorized place. The applicant refused to pay the fine and, consequently, in accordance with the law then in force, the municipal police officers lodged a motion for punishment of the applicant by the Petty Offences Board (Kolegium do Spraw Wykrocze\u0144).", "On 19 March 1997 the municipal police requested the Petty Offences Board to punish the applicant for a petty offence of illegal parking.", "The hearings listed for 10 October 1997 and for 29 October 1997 by the Przemy\u015bl Petty Offences Board were adjourned due to the absence of the municipal police officers.", "At the hearing held on 11 December 1997 the Petty Offences Board heard a municipal police officer in the presence of the applicant.", "By a decision of 11 December 1997 the Petty Offences Board imposed a fine of PLN 120 on the applicant for illegal parking of his car.", "The applicant appealed against this decision, claiming that he could not transport the commodity in a different manner, especially the flowers, without exposing them to damage during the winter.

Thus, the postman left him a written notice on the door of his apartment to collect the summons at the post office. The summons was not collected by the applicant by 23 February 1998 and consequently, it was returned to the court with a note that it was not collected by the applicant within the prescribed time-limit of seven days.", "By a judgment in default of 27 March 1998 the Przemy\u015bl District Court upheld the contested decision.

He confirmed this fact with his own signature.", "In a letter of 10 April 1998 he requested to be served with the written grounds of the judgment.
