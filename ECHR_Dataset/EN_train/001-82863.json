During the communist regime several plots of land owned by the applicants\u2019 parents had been confiscated by the authorities without compensation. The property measuring in total 132 hectares was situated in the Vlora region on the southern Albanian coast.", "7. On 30 March 1994, pursuant to the Property Act, the applicants lodged a request with the Vlora Commission on Restitution and Compensation of Properties (Komisioni i Kthimit dhe Kompensimit t\u00eb Pronave, \u201cthe Vlora Commission\u201d) seeking the allocation of the original property to them.", "8.

On 29 December 1997 the applicants brought an action before the Tirana District Court to quash the decree.", "14. On 17 February 1998 the Tirana District Court annulled the decree on the ground that the transaction concerned private property.", "15. On 16 June 1998 the Tirana Court of Appeal quashed the District Court\u2019s decision and upheld the validity of the decree, stating that the Commission\u2019s decision of 27 August 1996 had been invalid in that it had not complied with formal requirements. Consequently, the applicants could not claim title to the relevant property.", "16. On 10 June 1999, following an appeal by the applicants, the Supreme Court quashed the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment of 16 June 1998 on the ground that it had been illogical and sent the case back to the Court of Appeal for re-hearing.", "17.

Ordinary proceedings", "25. On 18 April 2000 the applicants initiated proceedings with the Vlora District Court seeking the annulment of the decision of the Vlora Commission in K.B.\u2019s favour.

On 25 May 2001 the Vlora Court of Appeal, having examined the applicants\u2019 appeal, rejected the applicants\u2019 argument as to the nullity of the Commission\u2019s decision allocating the land to K.B. on the ground that it was unsubstantiated. It also rejected their second request, holding that an irregular act, even if not considered formally invalid, as in this case, should not have any legal effect.", "27. On 6 March 2003 the Supreme Court quashed the first and second instance decisions in part. It dismissed the applicants\u2019 request for a declaration that the Vlora Commission\u2019s decision allocating the plot of land to K.B. was null and void, on the ground that its nullity could only be determined once a valid decision determining the applicants\u2019 rights over the land had been taken. It accordingly ordered the Vlora Commission to issue a decision vis-a-vis the applicants in compliance with the formal requirements.", "2. Enforcement proceedings", "28. On 14 April 2004 the Vlora District Court, upon a request by the applicants, issued an enforcement order instructing the Vlora Commission to comply with the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 6 March 2003.", "29.

Moreover, they were reluctant to submit the requested documents since they disagreed with any suggestion that their case had to be decided ex novo. In their opinion, the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment only required the formalisation of the decision of 1996.", "33. On 29 May 2006 the Vlora Commission decided not to consider the case for apparent insufficiency of documentation and on 30 November 2006 it sent the case for further consideration to the National Committee for the Restitution and Compensation of properties.", "34.

The Property Restitution and Compensation Act (Ligji p\u00ebr kthimin dhe kompensimin e pron\u00ebs) underwent several amendments during the past fourteen years. The main changes to the first Property Act of 1993 came about as a result of two laws which entered into force respectively in 2004 and 2006. Thus, hereinafter they will be referred to as the \u201cProperty Act 1993\u201d, the \u201cProperty Act 2004\u201d and the \u201cProperty Act 2006\u201d, respectively.", "The relevant provisions of each of these laws are abridged as follows:", "37. According to the Act of 1993 the former owners of properties expropriated by the relevant regime and their legal heirs had the right to claim the ownership over the original properties. Upon ownership being determined they were entitled either to have allocated the original immovable property or to be awarded compensation in kind (in a maximum of 10,000 sq. m) or in value if one of the following conditions was met: the alleged property (1) was pasture, meadow, forestry land, or agricultural or non-agricultural land; (2) was not subject to Law no. 7501 of 19 July 1991; (3) was currently State-owned; (4) had been designated as suitable for construction and is situated within the boundaries of a city.", "Section 16 of the Act provided for the following forms of compensation in respect of property which could not be restituted: (a) State bonds, equivalent to the compensation owed, and with a first option of acquiring shares in State enterprises being privatised by the Government or in other activities carried out through the granting of loans; (b) an equivalent plot of land or building site near to an urban area, in accordance with the general urban-development regulations; and (c) an equivalent plot of land in a tourist zone, in accordance with the general urban-development regulations.", "The Council of Ministers had the authority to define detailed rules for determining the methods and time-limits for such compensation to take place.", "38. Moreover, the 1993 Act instituted the Commission on Restitution and Compensation of Properties (Komisioni i Kthimit dhe Kompensimit t\u00eb Pronave) as the competent administrative body to deal with former owners\u2019 restitution and compensation of property claims. However, it omitted to provide a time-limit within which a decision could be appealed, thus preventing it from even becoming binding.", "39. The Property Act enacted in 2004, repealing the previous one, provided for two forms of restitution of immovable properties, namely the return, under certain circumstances, of the original property and compensation in the event of the impossibility for the authorities to return the original property. The restitution was not limited in size. The Act provided for five forms of compensation: (a) property of the same kind; (b) property of any other kind; (c) shares in State-owned companies; (d) the value of a State-owned property in the privatisation process, and (e) a sum of money corresponding to the value attributed to the property at the time of the decision (section 11). The Act instituted the State Committee for Property Restitution and Compensation (Komiteti Shteteror per Kthimin dhe Kompensimin e Pronave), composed of five members elected by Parliament. Its role was to decide on the lawfulness of district committees\u2019 decisions on restitution and compensation claims (sections 15 and 17). The Council of Ministers was to establish the rules and the criteria of these (sections 13).", "40. Section 19 provided for the enforcement of the decisions awarding compensation within the first six months of each financial year. On its entry into force, persons entitled to claim restitution or compensation had to lodge applications with the District Committee by 31 December 2007. The Act granted the Committee discretion to decide which form of compensation should be granted, but applicants could express in writing their preferred type of compensation. The District Committee\u2019s decision could be appealed to the State Committee (section 20) and to the district courts within thirty days of the date of issue of the Committee\u2019s decision.", "41. On 28 April 2005 Parliament adopted an Act, setting down the method by which immovable property would be valued for compensation purposes. Its implementation was left to the State Committee for the Compensation and Restitution of Properties, which was to issue the appropriate maps for the properties\u2019 valuation.", "42. In order to comply with the committees\u2019 decisions awarding pecuniary compensation, section 23 of the 2004 Act provided for the establishment of a ten-year Property Compensation Fund, whose aim was to provide financial support for such awards. The 2004 Act was examined by both the Constitutional and the Supreme Courts.", "On 24 March 2005 the Supreme Court, Joint Colleges, concluded that the Property Act of 2004 had no retroactive effect and that its provisions, could therefore, not have any impact on property rights recognised by administrative or court decisions given before its entry into force.", "43. On 17 July 2006 Property Act of 2004 was amended by means of the Property Act 2006 which entered into force on 17 August 2006. It provided, inter alia, for the establishment of the Agency for the Restitution and Compensation of Properties, a new body competent to decide restitution and compensation claims (section 15). The new law repealed sections 11 \u00a7 2; 19 and 20 of the previous law which, inter alia, provided for the procedure for the enforcement of decisions that awarded compensation."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
