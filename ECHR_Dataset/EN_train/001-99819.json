On 15 November 2002 the applicant submitted a request for a licence to keep another type of firearm.", "9. On 19 December 2002 police officials decided not to grant a new licence, given that on 13 December 2002 the applicant had been listed in an \u201coperational records file\u201d (policijos operatyvin\u0117 \u012fskaita), that is, a database containing information gathered by law-enforcement authorities (see paragraphs 17-19 of the 'Relevant domestic law' below).", "10.

The applicant instituted court proceedings challenging the entry of his name in the operational records file.", "12. On 25 September 2003 the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court dismissed his action. The decision was based on classified material submitted by the police and analysed by the judges without it being disclosed to the applicant. The court concluded that the applicant's listing in the operational records file had been lawful and reasoned, in view of the information about the applicant held by the police.", "13.

According to Article 18 \u00a7 2 (5) of that Law, a person was not regarded as having an impeccable reputation if his or her name had been entered in an operational records file. Article 38 of the Law provided that, after a firearms licence had been revoked, the arms and ammunition were to be taken from the person concerned and sold through the Arms Fund (a State agency) or through other companies authorised to sell them.", "19.
