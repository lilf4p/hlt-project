The applicant was born in 1967 and is at present serving a prison term in Gospi\u0107 Prison.", "5. On an unspecified date an investigation was opened in respect of the applicant, who was suspected of having committed a number of thefts and aggravated thefts.", "6. On 20 February 2004 a Vara\u017edin County Court investigating judge (istra\u017eni sudac \u017dupanijskog suda u Vara\u017edinu) issued a warrant for the search of the applicant's flat. The search was carried out by the police on 23 February 2004 and a number of items were seized.", "7. The applicant was arrested on 23 February 2004 at 10 p.m. but was released on 24 February 2004 at 6.00 p.m.", "8. On 1 March 2004 the applicant was indicted in the Prelog Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Prelogu) on numerous counts of theft and aggravated theft. He was represented in these proceedings by an officially appointed defence counsel.", "9. He was arrested again on 2 March 2004 and placed in pre-trial detention in Vara\u017edin Prison (Zatvor Vara\u017edin) and later on in other prison facilities (see below).", "10. During the criminal proceedings against him, the applicant was examined by a psychiatrist and, in a psychiatric report of 16 May 2004, it was established that the applicant suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).", "11. In a judgment of the Prelog Municipal Court of 26 August 2004 the applicant was found guilty of twenty counts of theft and aggravated theft and sentenced to six years and six months' imprisonment. The applicant appealed against the judgment to the \u010cakovec County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u \u010cakovcu) complaining about the outcome of the proceedings and also that his defence rights had been violated in that he had not been informed of the hearings in time to prepare his defence and that he had not had sufficient contact with the officially appointed defence counsel.", "12. On 1 October 2004 the applicant was taken to the Prelog Municipal Court, where he examined the case file. His request that certain documents be copied for him was complied with.", "13. The first-instance judgment of 26 August 2004 was quashed on 14 January 2005 by the \u010cakovec County Court which extended the applicant's detention at the same time. The first-instance judgment was quashed, inter alia, on the grounds that the applicant had not been informed of the hearings in time to prepare his defence and that he had not had sufficient contact with the officially appointed defence counsel.", "14. On 30 January 2005 the applicant lodged a request with the Prelog Municipal Court seeking permission to contact his officially appointed defence counsel and some other persons. On 2 February the Municipal Court allowed the applicant unrestricted telephone communication with his defence counsel.", "15. At a hearing held on 3 February 2005 the applicant challenged the presiding judge for bias. The defence counsel opposed the challenge. The hearing was adjourned pending the decision on the applicant's objection. In his submission of the same date the defence counsel requested to be relieved of his duties.", "16. On 4 February 2005 the President of the Prelog Municipal Court dismissed the applicant's challenge to the presiding judge as unfounded. On the same day the presiding judge relieved the officially appointed defence counsel of his duties and the president of the court appointed a new defence counsel. The applicant was allowed unrestricted telephone communication with his new counsel.", "17. On 14 February 2005 the applicant informed the presiding judge that his attempts to contact his newly appointed defence counsel had remained unsuccessful, since there had been no answer to his calls, and requested a visit from his defence counsel in prison since the next hearing had been scheduled for 17 February 2005. On the same day the presiding judge allowed an unlimited number of visits to the applicant's sister and mother but made no decision about the request concerning the defence counsel. However, the hearing scheduled for 17 February 2005 was adjourned on the oral request of the defence counsel, in order to prepare the defence. The next hearing was scheduled for 10 March 2005.", "18. In the meantime, on 11 February 2005, the Prelog Municipal Court further extended the applicant's detention. A subsequent request by the applicant that his detention be lifted was dismissed on 23 March 2005 by the Prelog Municipal Court. The applicant appealed against this decision.", "19. On 7 March 2005 the applicant lodged a request with the presiding judge for leave to consult the case file. He alleged that on 1 October 2004, when he had been brought to the Prelog Municipal Court, he had not had sufficient time to consult the entire file and that not all copies he had requested had been given to him and that at that time the case file had not yet been completed. This request remained unanswered.", "20. At the beginning of the hearing of 10 March 2005 the applicant insulted the presiding judge and was removed from the courtroom, followed by his defence counsel. Soon afterwards counsel returned and challenged the presiding judge, and the hearing was adjourned. On 14 March 2005 the President of the Prelog Municipal Court dismissed the challenge as unfounded.", "21. Upon the appeal by the applicant against the decision of 23 March 2005, on 30 March 2005 the \u010cakovec County Court quashed the first-instance decision and ordered the applicant's immediate release. It found that, pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act, the statutory time-limit for the applicant's detention had expired on 2 March 2005 and that therefore there had been no grounds for keeping him in detention after that date.", "22. The applicant was released on 30 March 2005. On 31 March 2005 the presiding judge relieved the applicant's officially appointed defence counsel of his duties.", "23. The next hearing before the Prelog Municipal Court was held on 1 April 2005. The applicant was present in person, but legally unrepresented. The transcript of the hearing shows that the applicant expressly stated that he did not want a defence counsel and decided to remain silent. The applicant did not sign the transcript of the hearing. In a judgment adopted on the same day, the first-instance court again found the applicant guilty of twenty counts of theft and aggravated theft and sentenced him to six years and six months' imprisonment. Immediately after the hearing the applicant was detained and placed in Vara\u017edin Prison. On the same day the same defence counsel was officially assigned to the applicant.", "24. The applicant appealed against the first-instance judgment on 4 and 22 April 2005, alleging that his defence rights had been violated in that he had not been given an opportunity to consult the case file. He alleged that on 1 October 2004 he had been brought to the Prelog Municipal Court in order to consult the case file. However, owing to the large volume of documents in the case file, the time allowed for that purpose had not permitted him to consult all the documents he had wished to. It had therefore been agreed that the requested documents would be copied and sent to him in prison. However, this request had only partially been complied with and he had never had an opportunity to read the whole case file. He further alleged that he had complained about this at the hearing held on 1 April 2005 but that his allegations had been ignored. He further complained that the search of his premises had been carried out in contravention of the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure because the requirement that two witnesses be constantly present had not been complied with. He also complained about the qualification of some of the offences as aggravated theft instead of theft and about the severity of the sentence.", "25. On 18 April 2005 the officially appointed defence counsel also lodged an appeal, referring to the factual findings of the first-instance court.", "26. On an unspecified date the applicant asked the Prelog Municipal Court if he could consult the case file. In its letter of 28 April 2005 addressed to the Head of Prison Administration at the Ministry of Justice, a copy of which was also forwarded to the applicant, the president of that court allowed the applicant's request. The applicant then requested that a date be fixed for consulting the case file. The President of the Prelog Municipal Court replied that the consultation was not possible because the case had been forwarded to the \u010cakovec County Court upon an appeal against the first-instance judgment. In a letter of 13 May 2005 a judge of the same court informed the applicant that his request had been granted and that the case file had been forwarded to the \u010cakovec County Court.", "27. On 17 May 2005 the \u010cakovec County Court allowed the applicant's appeal in the part concerning the qualification of certain offences and reduced the sentence to six years and four months' imprisonment while dismissing the remainder of his complaints. The relevant parts of the appeal judgment read as follows:", "\u201cIn his personal appeal the defendant complains of serious breaches of the provisions regulating criminal proceedings, [these being] his inability to consult the case file; reliance of the impugned judgment on evidence under Article 9, paragraph 2, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, namely, the written record of the search of his flat and other premises, and the allegation that the identification of items (as potential evidence) by the injured parties had not been carried out in accordance with Article 243 (a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.", "The officially appointed defence counsel also alleges in his appeal that there was a serious breach of the provisions regulating criminal proceedings in the reliance of the first-instance judgment on illegally obtained evidence, because the search of the defendant's premises had been carried out without the simultaneous presence of two witnesses.", "The search of the defendant's flat and other premises at the address Donji Kraljevec, Gornji kraj no. 13, was carried out by the police pursuant to search warrant no. Kir-75/04-02, issued by a Vara\u017edin County Court investigating judge on 20 February 2004 and served on the defendant beforehand, as can be seen from a receipt on page 18 of the first-instance [court] case file. The report of the search of the [defendant's] flat and other premises of 23 February 2004 shows that the search was carried out in the presence of the defendant and two witnesses. On that occasion objects, which were enumerated in the certificates on temporarily seized items, were found and temporarily seized from the defendant. The defendant's assertion that the witnesses were not simultaneously and continually present during the search is unfounded and uncorroborated, since neither the defendant nor the present witnesses put forward any objections. As the search was carried out in compliance with Articles 211 and 214 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the report in question and the certificates regarding the items temporarily seized from the defendant constitute fully valid and legal evidence.", "The defendant's assertion that the first-instance court breached the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure [regulating] identification of certain objects in that the injured parties were shown the objects for identification without previously being asked to describe those objects is unfounded. Article 243(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure requires that a defendant or a witness be asked beforehand to describe a person or an object [to be identified] and describe their distinguishing marks only when necessary; following which the person or the object [to be identified] are to be shown to the defendant or a witness, together with other persons unknown to them, or with similar objects. It follows that this provision does not oblige the court or the police authorities to present the persons identifying [objects as potential evidence] with similar objects at each instance but [this requirement applies] only where possible. In the present case, where a large number of different objects were [to be identified], the police officers were not obliged to act in the manner the defendant argued they were in his appeal and therefore, in the view of this court, the identification of objects [as potential evidence] was carried out in accordance with the law. Therefore, the reports on identification in the present case constitute valid evidence, especially since some of the injured parties emphatically stated at the main hearing that the objects they had been presented with were theirs, which in any event \u2013 save for a few of [these objects] \u2013 the defendant did not deny in his initial defence.", "As regards the [alleged] inability of the defendant to consult the case file, it is to be noted that the [documents] from the case file show that the first-instance court allowed the defendant to consult the case file on 1 October 2004 (page 520) and that the requested copies of material evidence were served on the defendant in detention on 14 October 2005 (page 572).", "The defendant complains that his written request of 7 March 2005 to consult the case file while he was in detention was not granted.", "On the basis of the above [considerations], this court considers that in the present case there was no breach of Article 367, paragraph 3, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, since the defendant regularly attended the hearings, where he was able to consult the case file, copy the documents thereof and [examine] the objects aimed at establishing the facts of the case. Furthermore, during practically the entire first-instance proceedings the defendant had an officially appointed defence counsel. Thus, this court finds that there was no breach of his defence rights within the meaning of Article 367, paragraph 3, of the Code of Criminal Procedure.", "...", "As regards the [allegations] that the facts of the case were wrongly established and incomplete, both appeals allege the same fact: that the first-instance court's refusal to hear evidence from the witnesses to the search resulted in a failure to establish whether the search of the applicant's house and adjoining courtyard had been carried out in accordance with the law.", "This court considers that the first-instance court correctly and completely established all the relevant facts, including those concerning the question whether the carrying out of the search on the applicant's flat and other premises was in accordance with the law. In this connection the first-instance court gave valid reasons for its decision not to accept the above-mentioned defendant's request [that two witnesses be heard], which reasons this court entirely endorses ...\u201d", "28. The applicant then lodged a request for extraordinary review of a final judgment.", "29. In response to repeated requests by the applicant to consult the case file, the President of the Municipal Court informed him in a letter of 7 November 2005 that his request could not be granted because the case file had been forwarded to the Supreme Court.", "30. On 22 November 2005 the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) dismissed the applicant's request for extraordinary review of a final judgment. The relevant parts of the judgment read as follows:", "\u201c.. the defendant ... alleges that the impugned judgment rests on unlawfully obtained evidence, namely the report on the search of his flat, and that his defence rights were violated because he was not allowed to consult the case file before presenting his defence.", "...", "The report on the search of the [defendant's] flat and other premises shows that the search was carried out pursuant to Vara\u017edin County Court search warrant no. Kir 75/04-2 of 20 February 2004; and that two witnesses were present who were instructed at the outset to observe the procedure for carrying out [the search] and informed of their right to make objections before signing the report if they considered its contents to be inaccurate. The defendant was also present. All of these persons signed the report after it had been read to them, without making any objections, thus expressing their agreement with the content of the report.", "Such a report is lawful evidence because it shows that the search was carried out in accordance with Articles 213 and 214 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.", "The defendant's assertion that the witnesses were not constantly present during the search is an objection to the established facts and cannot be accepted as a valid ground for lodging this extraordinary remedy.", "This court may consider the veracity of decisive facts only if a suspicion in that regard arises when it examines a request lodged under Article 427 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In the present case, bearing in mind the content of the report on the search of the [defendant's] flat and other premises, this panel does not find any reasons to suspect that the search was not carried out in accordance with Articles 213 and 214 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.", "Under Article 427(3) a request for extraordinary review of a final judgment may also be lodged [on the allegation that] the defendant's rights were violated at a main hearing.", "At the main hearing held on 1 April 2005, when the first-instance judgment was adopted and pronounced, the defendant's rights were not violated. The transcript of the hearing shows that the hearing started anew with a deputy State Attorney reading out the indictment. The defendant was informed of his right to a defence counsel under Article 320, paragraphs 2 and 4, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but he decided neither to exercise that right nor to present his defence, and remained silent.", "The defendant did not object to the procedure followed by the court or ask for the hearing to be adjourned in order to prepare his defence.", "The defendant's allegation that the court denied him the right to consult the case file while in detention is irrelevant for the examination of this request because he was informed of his rights at the main hearing, after which he chose not to submit his defence.", "...\u201d", "31. In reply to a further request to consult the case file, lodged by the applicant on 23 January 2006, the President of the Prelog Municipal Court informed the applicant that his request could not be granted because the case file had been forwarded to the Vara\u017edin Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Vara\u017edinu).", "32. A constitutional complaint subsequently lodged by the applicant was declared inadmissible on 23 February 2006 by the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) on the grounds that the impugned decision, namely the Supreme Court's judgment of 22 November 2005, had not concerned the merits of the case. The relevant part of the decision reads:", "\u201cIn accordance with [section 62 of the Constitutional Court Act], only a decision in which a competent court has decided on the merits of a case, namely, on the suspicion or indictment in respect of a criminal offence committed by the applicant, is an individual act within the meaning of section 62(1) of the Constitutional Court Act in respect of which the Constitutional Court, in proceedings instituted upon a constitutional complaint, is competent to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms of the applicant guaranteed by the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia.", "In the proceedings before the Constitutional Court it has been established that the impugned judgment of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Croatia no. Kr-83/05 of 22 November 2005 is not an individual act within the meaning of section 62(1) of the Constitutional Court Act in respect of which the Constitutional Court is competent to give constitutional protection to the applicant.\u201d", "33. The medical documentation submitted by the parties shows that the applicant has been diagnosed as suffering from PTSD and a personality disorder.", "34. The applicant was arrested on 23 February 2004 at 10 p.m. and released on 24 February 2004 at 6.00 p.m. He was arrested again on 2 March 2004 and placed in pre-trial detention in Vara\u017edin Prison. As to the latter, the applicant alleges that the cells were overcrowded, that he was placed in a smoking cell and that he was only allowed to spend fifteen to twenty minutes a day in the fresh air. On 11 June 2004 the applicant was transferred to Zagreb Prison Hospital further to his complaint that he suffered from being placed in a cell with smokers. The discharge letter of 15 June 2004 shows that no lung disease had been established. The applicant was returned to Vara\u017edin Prison.", "35. In a complaint of 7 July 2004 addressed to the Prison Administration of the Ministry of Justice (Uprava za zatvorski sustav Ministartsva pravosu\u0111a), the applicant complained about his placement in a cell with smokers. In a letter of 12 July 2007 of the Vara\u017edin Prison authorities, addressed to the above Administration, it was explained that, owing to overcrowded conditions in that prison, it was not possible to place the applicant in a cell with non-smokers only. This information was forwarded to the applicant in a letter of the Prison Administration of the Ministry of Justice of 16 July 2004.", "36. In his complaint of 12 October 2004 addressed to the Vara\u017edin County Court, the applicant complained, inter alia, about the conditions in detention and, in particular, that he was placed in a cell with smokers and was allowed only fifteen to twenty minutes daily outdoor exercise. The applicant's complaints remained unanswered.", "37. In October 2004 the applicant was released.", "38. The applicant was again detained in January 2005 and placed in Vara\u017edin Prison until 30 March 2005, when he was released.", "39. On 1 April 2005, after his conviction by the Prelog Municipal Court, the applicant was arrested and again placed in Vara\u017edin Prison. He was placed in cell no. 15, measuring 10.26 square metres, together with one other inmate, a non-smoker.", "40. On 1 May 2005 the applicant made a commotion in his cell by banging chairs and his bed and verbally insulting the prison personnel. He was taken out of his cell and strapped down in a special cell. There is no written record of this measure or its exact duration.", "41. During an outdoor walk on 13 May 2005 an attempt by the applicant to hit another inmate was prevented by a prison guard. The applicant was strapped down in a special cell and returned to his regular cell the same day. There is no written record of this measure or its exact duration. The same day the applicant attempted to attack a prison guard. As a consequence, he was strapped to his bed. There is no written record of this measure or its exact duration. Furthermore, the same day the applicant was transferred to Zagreb Prison Hospital. The relevant part of the discharge letter of 25 May 2005 reads:", "\u201cThe patient was brought from Vara\u017edin Prison in reactive exacerbation of his mental condition.

Actually, he is highly anxious and over-sensitive, everything bothers him. In terms of his personality, he is impulsive and emotionally unstable. He easily loses control of his behaviour and acts in an emotionally impulsive and inadequate manner. The low tolerance of frustrations is evident, which leads to irritability and accentuated touchiness. His tendency to react aggressively is marked and he has a significantly lowered capacity to maintain self-control and self-protection, which makes him prone to undertake activities involving a high level of risk.

He explained that he had been continually placed in a cell with smokers and that he was detained in overcrowded conditions. He further complained that he had not been receiving any treatment for his psychiatric ailments, in particular the PTSD, and that he was being given no psychiatric treatment at all. He also complained that the examination by a doctor, who had seen him on 8 July 2005 in order to establish his fitness to work in prison, had lasted two minutes. In a letter of 11 October 2005 the judge found that the applicant was allowed to use some of his personal items, that he had complained about his placement in a smoking cell, that he had adequate medical care, and that he had been on hunger strike between 2 and 14 September 2005.", "49.

He also alleged that on 8 May 2006 he had been attacked by his cellmate, who had allegedly attempted to strangle him. The applicant further complained that he had been forced to share the cell with that inmate although he had complained to the prison authorities that later on that inmate had threatened him and had been allowed to keep a knife in the cell. The applicant also alleged that on 9 May 2006 he had been denied the prescribed pharmacotherapy and had therefore asked one of the guards to take him to the medical ward. The guard, however, had refused and threatened to crush the applicant, following which the applicant had inflicted self-injuries by cutting his veins, whereupon he had been taken to the medical ward within the prison. The applicant also alleged that on 10 May 2006, during breakfast, he had been attacked by another inmate who bit his finger.
