On 9 June 1992 the court made the order for payment, allowing the plaintiff\u2019s application. The applicant lodged an appeal against that order.", "9. Subsequently, the applicant applied for exemption from the court fees. On 4 July 1996 the Warsaw Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) finally allowed his application.", "10. The Warsaw Regional Court scheduled hearings for 22 May, 18 September, 23 October and 24 November 1997. However, all of them were adjourned.

Articles 417 et seq. of the Civil Code (Kodeks cywilny) provide for the State\u2019s liability in tort.", "In the version applicable until 1 September 2004, Article 417 \u00a7 1, which lays down a general rule, read as follows:", "\u201c1.

The absence of the establishment of guilt by way of a criminal conviction or in a decision given in disciplinary proceedings shall not exclude the State Treasury\u2019s liability for damage if such proceedings cannot be instituted in view of the [statutory] exception to prosecution or disciplinary actions.\u201d", "17. On 1 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on amendments to the Civil Code and other statutes (Ustawa o zmianie ustawy \u2013 Kodeks cywilny oraz niekt\u00f3rych innych ustaw) (\u201cthe 2004 Amendment\u201d) entered into force. While the relevant amendments have in essence been aimed at enlarging the scope of the State Treasury\u2019s liability for tort under Article 417 of the Civil Code \u2013 which included adding a new Article 4171 and the institution of the State\u2019s tortious liability for its omission to enact legislation (the so-called \u201clegislative omission\u201d; \u201czaniedbanie legislacyjne\u201d) \u2013 they are also to be seen in the context of the operation of a new statute introducing remedies for the unreasonable length of judicial proceedings (see paragraphs 21-24 below).", "Following the 2004 Amendment, Article 4171, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:", "\u201c3. If damage has been caused by failure to give a ruling (orzeczenie) or decision (decyzja) where there is a statutory duty to give them, reparation for [the damage] may be sought after it has been established in the relevant proceedings that the failure to give a ruling or decision was contrary to the law, unless otherwise provided for by other specific provisions.\u201d", "18.

On 4 December 2001 the Constitutional Court (Trybuna\u0142 Konstytucyjny) dealt with two constitutional complaints in which the applicants challenged the constitutionality of Article 417 and 418 of the Civil Code. They alleged, in particular, that those provisions were incompatible with Articles 64 and 77 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.", "On the same day the court gave judgment (no. SK 18/00) and held that Article 417 of the Civil Code was compatible with Article 77 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution in so far as it provided that the State Treasury was liable for damage caused by the unlawful action of a State official carried out in the course of performing his duties. It further held that even though Article 418 of the Civil Code was compatible with Article 64 of the Constitution, it was contrary to Article 77 \u00a7 1 since it linked the award of compensation for such damage with the personal culpability of the state official concerned, established in criminal or disciplinary proceedings.", "20. On 18 December 2001, the date on which the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment took effect, Article 418 was repealed. The Constitutional Court\u2019s opinion on the consequences of the repeal read, in so far as relevant:", "\u201cThe elimination of Article 418 of the Civil Code from the legal system ... means that the State Treasury\u2019s liability for an action of a public authority consisting in the issue of unlawful decisions or orders will flow from the general principles of State liability laid down in Article 417 of the Civil Code. This, however, does not rule out the application in the present legal system of other principles of State liability laid down in specific statutes and not necessarily only those listed in the Civil Code.\u201d", "21. On 17 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w post\u0119powaniu s\u0105dowym bez nieuzasadnionej zw\u0142oki) (\u201cthe 2004 Act\u201d) entered into force. It lays down various legal means designed to counteract and/or redress the undue length of judicial proceedings.", "A party to pending proceedings may ask for the acceleration of those proceedings and/or just satisfaction for their unreasonable length under section 2 read in conjunction with section 5 (1) of the 2004 Act.", "Section 2, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:", "Section 5 provides, in so far as relevant:", "\u201c1.
