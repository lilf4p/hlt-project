ROMANIA", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of P1-1;Violation of Art. 6-1 concerning the reasonable time;Inadmissible under Art. 6-1 concerning the others complaints;Pecuniary damage - financial award;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - domestic proceedings;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["4. The applicants were born in 1914, 1920, 1921 and 1945 respectively. The first lives in Timi\u015foara, the second in Del\u00e9mont (Switzerland) and the others in Arad.", "5. The first two applicants and their deceased brother, Mircea Stoinescu, whose heirs are the other two applicants, were the owners of a house in Arad. In 1950 the State took possession of that house under Decree no. 92/1950 on nationalisation. The house was converted into four flats intended for rental.", "6. On 27 September 1993 the first two applicants and Mircea Stoinescu brought an action for the recovery of possession of immovable property in the Arad Court of First Instance against Arad Town Council and R., a State-owned company responsible for the management of property belonging to the State. After the death of Mircea Stoinescu, the action was pursued by his heirs, Mrs Felicia Stoinescu and Mrs Maria T\u0103ucean. The applicants sought a declaration that they were the rightful owners of the house and appurtenant land that the State had, in their opinion, wrongfully seized in 1950. They claimed that, under Article 2 of Decree no. 92/1950, property belonging to persons in certain social categories was not subject to nationalisation, and that they fell within such a category. In their view, the nationalisation of the house in question had therefore been improper and unlawful.", "7. In a judgment of 12 April 1994, the Arad Court of First Instance dismissed the applicants' action, refusing to rule on the merits on the ground that they could not obtain redress for the damage they had sustained until the enactment of special legislation introducing reparation measures. The judgment was upheld by the Arad County Court on 3 November 1995. The applicants appealed against that decision.", "8. In 1996 the tenants of the flats making up the house applied to purchase them, relying on Law no. 112/1995. Arad Town Council informed the R. company that a dispute was pending concerning the title to the house and instructed it not to pursue the sale of the flats in question.", "9. Consequently, the tenants of three flats had their purchase applications rejected, but not H.D. (a former football player and international celebrity) and his wife, to whom the R. company sold flat no. 3 on 18 December 1996.", "10. On 25 February 1997 the Timi\u015foara Court of Appeal upheld an appeal by the applicants and remitted the case to the Arad Court of First Instance for a decision on the merits.", "11. On 12 May 1997 Mr and Mrs D. applied to intervene in the Court of First Instance proceedings on the ground that they had been the owners of flat no. 3 since its sale on 18 December 1996.", "12. Further to the couple's application to intervene, the applicants requested the court to find that the sale of flat no. 3 was null and void. In their view, as the nationalisation had been improper and unlawful, the State could not have been the rightful owner of the property and thus could not lawfully have sold any part of it. The applicants relied in particular on Article 966 of the Civil Code, whereby an undertaking entered into on an erroneous or unlawful basis could not produce any useful effect.", "13. On 7 June 1997 the Arad Court of First Instance held that the nationalisation of the house had been unlawful and that the applicants were therefore the rightful owners. However, the court rejected the request for the rescission of the contract of sale between the State and Mr and Mrs D., on the ground that the couple had made the purchase in good faith.", "14. The applicants appealed against that judgment. On 28 November 1997 the Arad County Court allowed the appeal and remitted the case to the Court of First Instance for reconsideration.", "15. In a judgment of 6 July 1998, the Arad Court of First Instance held that the nationalisation of the house had been unlawful, that the applicants were the rightful owners and that the contract of sale between the State and Mr and Mrs D. was null and void.", "16. On 2 February 1999 the Arad County Court allowed an appeal by Mr and Mrs D. and dismissed the applicants' action, finding that the nationalisation had been lawful and that, consequently, the sale by the State of flat no. 3 was also lawful.", "17. The applicants appealed to the Timi\u015foara Court of Appeal, which gave its judgment on 30 June 1999. It partly allowed the applicants' appeal in so far as it found the nationalisation to have been unlawful and acknowledged that they had remained the rightful owners of the property. However, it dismissed the appeal as regards the rescission of the sale of flat no. 3, considering that the State had been presumed to be the owner of the property at the time of the sale, in spite of the dispute over the property that was pending in the courts. It moreover relied on the fact that Law no. 112/1995, which had formed the statutory basis for the sale of the property, did not provide for any penalty in respect of property sold when the title to it was in dispute before the courts. The Court of Appeal did not address the applicants' argument relating to the principle of unjust enrichment (see paragraph 27 below).", "18. On 20 August 2001 the applicants again requested the Arad Court of First Instance to order the rescission of the sale of flat no. 3, contending that the purchasers had broken the law. Their action was dismissed on 13 December 2001 on the ground that the matter had become res judicata.", "19.

On 23 January 1996 the Government adopted decision no. 20/1996 implementing Law no. 112/1995. The decision provided that immovable property that had passed into State ownership under a legislative provision was to be regarded as immovable property legally vested in the State. It also specified that Law no. 112/1995 did not apply to immovable property held by the State where its right of property was not based on any legislative provision.", "22. On 18 February 1997 the Government adopted decision no. 11/1997, supplementing decision no. 20/1996. Paragraph 1 (3) of decision no. 11/1997 provided that, in order for property to be defined as having been acquired by the State under Decree no. 92/1950, it had to have been acquired in accordance with the decree and the person referred to as the owner in the lists enumerating nationalised property had to have been the true owner at the time of the nationalisation.", "23.

Article 966 of the Civil Code reads:", "\u201cAn obligation without legal basis or based on an erroneous or unlawful ground cannot produce any useful effect.\u201d", "26. Under Romanian law, an action for recovery of possession is one of the principal remedies for the protection of a right of property. Such action is not governed per se by statute but has emerged from case-law. An action for recovery of possession can be defined as the bringing of proceedings to enforce a right in rem in which a dispossessed owner claims back his or her property from the person currently in possession of it. The main outcome of such an action, if successful, is the acknowledgment by the court of the claimant's title to the property, with retrospective effect, thus obliging the defendant to return the property. If physical restitution is no longer possible, that obligation is replaced by an obligation to pay compensation on the basis of an equivalent sum (see, for example, Liviu Pop, Dreptul de proprietate \u015fi dezmembr\u0103mintele sale (Ownership and its Attributes), Lumina Lex, Bucharest 1997, pp. 278-90, and Ion Dogaru and T. S\u00e2mbrian, Elementele dreptului civil, vol. 2, Drepturile reale (Elements of Civil Law, vol. 2, Rights in rem), Oltenia, Craiova 1994, p. 160).", "27. In legal systems derived from Roman law there is an equitable rule that when a person has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another, the latter may claim compensation in the amount by which that person has been enriched (see Fran\u00e7ois Terr\u00e9, Philippe Simmler and Yves Lequette, Droit civil : les obligations (Civil Law: Obligations), Dalloz, 5th edition, 1993, pp. 742-44, and Ion Filipescu, Drept civil : Teoria general\u0103 a obliga\u0163iilor (Civil Law: General theory of obligations), Editura Actami, Bucharest 1994, p. 98). Whilst an action for tortious liability enables the injured party to claim exact reparation for the loss sustained as a result of negligence on the part of an enriched person, in an action for unjust enrichment the claimant can only seek an amount corresponding to the other party's gain, provided that some pecuniary benefit has been obtained, without just cause, at the expense of the claimant (see Terr\u00e9, Simmler and Lequette, op. cit., p. 744, and Filipescu, op. cit., p. 98)."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
