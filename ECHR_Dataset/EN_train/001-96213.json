On 2 November 2004 the Dornbirn LMS refused the request in accordance with section 2(5) of the Aliens' Employment Act (Ausl\u00e4nderbesch\u00e4ftigungsgesetz). It found that the chef did not fulfil the conditions to be a key worker as defined in section 2(5).", "8. The applicant appealed against the refusal to the Vorarlberg LMS on 17 November 2004. She maintained in substance that the authority had failed to assess properly the evidence.", "9. On 15 February 2005 the Vorarlberg LMS dismissed the applicant's appeal. It held that the submitted documents did not sufficiently prove her contention that the proposed chef fulfilled the conditions required to be a key worker or that the requested employment would secure existing jobs or create new jobs, as required by section 2(5) of the Aliens' Employment Act. His professional skills could not be seen as specific and extraordinary since any chef could with further training obtain a certificate in Ayurvedic cuisine.", "10.

In her appeal the applicant maintained that the authorities had failed to assess the evidence properly and give appropriate reasons.

In accordance with section 39(2) of the Administrative Court Act (Verwaltungsgerichtshofgesetz) it also dismissed the applicant's request for an oral hearing as it found that it would not be likely to contribute to the clarification of the case. The decision was served on the applicant's counsel on 6 June 2006.", "12. The Employment of Foreigners Act (Ausl\u00e4nderbesch\u00e4ftigungs-gesetz) regulates a foreigner's access to the Austrian labour market.

Section 39(1) of the Administrative Court Act requires the Administrative Court to hold a hearing after its preliminary investigation of the case where the complainant has requested a hearing within the time-limit. Section 39(2) (6) provides, however, that, notwithstanding such a request, the Administrative Court may decide not to hold a hearing if it is apparent from the written pleadings of the parties and the files relating to the previous proceedings that an oral hearing would not be likely to contribute to the clarification of the case and that the lack of a hearing would not be in breach of Article 6 of the Convention."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
