On 6 February 2003 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of fraud. On the following day, the Prague 1 District Court (obvodn\u00ed soud) ordered his pre-trial detention pursuant to Article 67 (a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter \u201cthe CCP\u201d). The court held that, given the applicant\u2019s British citizenship and lack of residence in the Czech Republic, and the fact that he was likely to be sentenced to a lengthy prison sentence, there was a risk that he would abscond to avoid the criminal proceedings.", "7. On 29 April 2003 an indictment against the applicant on a charge of fraud was filed in the District Court.", "8. On 6 May 2003, 1 July 2003 and 24 September 2003 the District Court dismissed requests for release from custody filed by the applicant. The court held that the reasons for the applicant\u2019s detention continued to apply. Two appeals by the applicant directed against the second and third of the District Court\u2019s decisions were dismissed by the Prague Municipal Court on 7 August 2003 and 29 October 2003, respectively.", "9. On 22 September 2003 the applicant filed a constitutional appeal (\u00fastavn\u00ed st\u00ed\u017enost) against the Municipal Court\u2019s decision of 7 August 2003, alleging a violation of his right to personal liberty under Article 8 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 5 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms (Listina z\u00e1kladn\u00edch pr\u00e1v a svobod), of his freedom of movement under Article 14 of the Charter and of the right to judicial protection under Article 36 \u00a7 1 of the Charter, in that the reasoning of the court decisions was insufficient. He added that Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention had also been violated.", "10. On 9 December 2003 the District Court dismissed a request for release from custody filed by the applicant on 5 December 2003 and decided, under Article 71 \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 6 of the CCP, that the applicant was to remain in detention. The court did not accept the applicant\u2019s written pledge.", "11. In a judgment of 17 December 2003 the District Court convicted the applicant of fraud, sentenced him to three and a half years\u2019 imprisonment and ordered his expulsion from the Czech Republic.", "12. On 12 January 2004 the applicant supplemented his constitutional appeal, alleging that despite his request the Municipal Court\u2019s decision of 7 August 2003 had not been translated into English, in violation of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (e) of the Convention. He also complained that in the decision of 9 December 2003 the District Court had decided to renew the order for his detention for the first time since the pre-trial detention had been ordered on 7 February 2003. The applicant thus regarded the period of detention after 7 May 2003, that is after the expiry of an initial three months period covered by the first detention order, as unlawful. In this respect he relied, inter alia, on Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.", "13. On 26 February 2004 the Municipal Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint against the District Court\u2019s decision of 9 December 2003.", "14. On 31 March 2004 the Municipal Court varied the District Court\u2019s judgment of 17 December 2003 but the applicant\u2019s prison sentence remained unchanged. In response to the applicant\u2019s argument that the trial court had not given him the opportunity to question one of the witnesses, the appellate court held that this witness had been heard at trial in the applicant\u2019s and his counsel\u2019s presence and that they had used this opportunity to ask him questions.", "15. In a decision of 25 November 2004 the Constitutional Court (\u00dastavn\u00ed soud) held that the Municipal Court had violated the applicant\u2019s rights guaranteed under Article 8 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 5 of the Charter in that it had not decided on extension of the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention or his release within the statutory time-limit. The court stated in particular:", "\u201cIt appears from the case-file that the courts decided on the applicant\u2019s requests for release and/or his complaints against the respective dismissals, but not on his remaining in custody or his release as provided for in Article 71 \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 6 of the CCP. Such a decision complying with the requirements laid down in the CCP was adopted by the Prague 1 District Court on 9 December 2003, that is, more than ten months after the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention had been ordered. The Constitutional Court underlines that when deciding on a request for release filed by an accused, a court \u2018merely\u2019 examines, as in the present case, whether there are still reasons for his detention. The criteria specified in Article 71 \u00a7 4 of the CCP require stricter conditions to be fulfilled for a decision to continue the accused\u2019s detention \u201d", "16. The Constitutional Court did not grant the applicant\u2019s request for the Municipal Court\u2019s decision of 7 August 2003 to be quashed, the applicant having been sentenced to a term of imprisonment in the meantime.", "17. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning pre-trial detention and the possibility of compensation for its unlawfulness are set out in the Court\u2019s judgment Smatana v. the Czech Republic, no. 18642/04, \u00a7\u00a7 49-76, 27 September 2007."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-5"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
