About 3 a.m. on 17 December 2002 a group of five or seven men wearing camouflage uniforms and white camouflage cloaks entered the house. They were all armed and masked and spoke Russian and Chechen.", "12. One of the men woke up Leoma Meshayev and told him in Chechen \u201cLeoma, wake up!\u201d They threw him on the floor and handcuffed him. When one of the intruders pointed his automatic rifle at Meshayev\u2019s nine-year-old son, another told him in Chechen \u201cDon\u2019t touch the children, they are not guilty\u201d.

The eleventh applicant rushed into the courtyard and his mother pointed towards the back of the yard, to the vegetable patch. The eleventh and fourteenth applicant tried to pursue the men who had taken their brother away, but they shouted at them to get back and made a few warning shots from automatic guns with silencers, so the applicants had to stop. The applicants noticed an APC, an Ural truck and a UAZ vehicle that had been stationed about 200 metres from their house in the Rechnaya Street. The vehicles left in the direction of Urus-Martan.", "26.

The applicants have submitted copies of some of the letters they had written.", "32. The applicants received hardly any substantive information from official bodies about the investigations into the disappearances and their results.

The applicants submitted that in the weeks following Leoma Meshayev\u2019s arrest they had applied in person to the district military commander\u2019s office, the district department of the FSB, the district department of the interior (ROVD), the Urus-Martan District Prosecutor\u2019s Office (the district prosecutor\u2019s office) with inquiries about the fate of their relative.", "34. Within this initial period the applicants also submitted written applications stating the circumstances of Mr Meshayev\u2019s detention and requesting assistance in finding him. They did not retain copies of these applications, but on 5 January 2003 the district prosecutor\u2019s office opened criminal investigation file no. 34002 into Leoma Meshayev\u2019s abduction by unidentified armed persons in camouflage uniforms under Article 126 of the Criminal Code. The applicants submitted that they had learnt of the investigation only on 5 March 2003 when the first and the second applicants were questioned and granted victim status in the proceedings.", "35.

On 30 July 2003 the first applicant appealed the adjournment of the criminal investigation to the Chechnya Prosecutor\u2019s Office. She reasoned that Leoma Meshayev, and also Bislan Saydayev, who had been detained on the same night by the same group of persons, could only have been detained by servicemen because of the use of military vehicles and the fact that these vehicles had been allowed to travel freely through the roadblock, despite the curfew in place. The first applicant requested the prosecutor to resume the investigation, to question the servicemen from the roadblock, the military commander\u2019s office and other law-enforcement bodies of the district about the details of the operation, to identify and question witnesses among local residents, and to collect and examine the bullets and cartridges left behind by the abductors who had shot at the applicant as she was trying to pursue them. He was requested to carry out the investigation urgently, before the traces of the detained men had been lost. The first applicant also requested the prosecutor to join the investigation to the one opened into the abduction of Bislan Saydayev.", "44. On 4 September 2003 the district prosecutor\u2019s office replied to the first applicant that the investigation had taken all possible steps to solve the crime, but had failed to identify the culprits.", "45.

Efforts to find the two men would continue.", "49. On 14 November 2005 the SRJI asked the district prosecutor\u2019s office to inform them of the progress in the investigation and to carry out the following actions: to identify the provenance of the military vehicles involved in the abduction, to locate and review all registration documents related to the movement of military vehicles in the district on the night in question, to identify the authorities that had carried out special operations in the district on 17 December 2002 and to question their officers about the detention of Leoma Meshayev and Bislan Saydayev, and to question the servicemen of the Urus-Martan military commander\u2019s office and other officials in charge of enforcing the curfew.", "50.

He submitted that the commander had told him that he did not know who had detained his brother. The commander also told him that on the previous day, on 16 December 2002, he had received a warning that an operation was being prepared in their village, but that later this operation had been cancelled.

He also allegedly promised to help them if Bislan Saydayev had been detained by the military, but said that he would not be able to do anything if he had been detained by the FSB.", "51. The applicants submitted that in the following weeks they applied in person with inquiries about the fate of their relative to the district military commander\u2019s office, the FSB, ROVD and the prosecutor\u2019s office. The ninth applicant also asked the head of the Administration of Chechnya to order an investigation of his brother\u2019s detention by unidentified servicemen.", "52. At some point the applicants submitted written applications to the authorities stating the circumstances of Mr Saydayev\u2019s detention and requesting assistance in finding him.

It is unclear if these requests were granted.", "57. On 10 June 2003 the district prosecutor\u2019s office informed the ninth applicant that on 10 June 2003 criminal investigation no. 34041, opened on 10 April 2003, had been adjourned due to failure to identify the culprits. The applicant was informed of the possibility to appeal.", "58. On 17 June 2003 the military prosecutor of military unit no. 20102 forwarded the ninth applicant\u2019s complaint to the district prosecutor\u2019s office and stated that there were no grounds to suspect the involvement of military servicemen.", "59. On 28 July 2003 the ninth applicant appealed against the adjournment of the criminal investigation to the Chechnya Prosecutor\u2019s Office. He reasoned that his brother could only have been detained by servicemen because of the use of military vehicles and the fact that the vehicles had been allowed to travel freely through the roadblock, despite the curfew in place. The ninth applicant requested the prosecutor to resume the investigation, to question the servicemen of the roadblock, of the military commander\u2019s office and other law-enforcement bodies of the district about the details of the operation, to identify and question witnesses among local residents, to collect and examine bullets and cartridges left behind by the abductors who had shot at the eleventh and fourteenth applicant as they were trying to pursue them.

In their observations the Government did not dispute the information concerning the investigations as presented by the applicants. Relying on information obtained from the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office, they referred to other procedural steps which had not been mentioned by the applicants. However, despite specific requests from the Court, the Government did not submit copies of most of the documents to which they referred (see below). The Government submitted the following.", "63. On 5 January 2003 the district prosecutor\u2019s office opened criminal investigation file no. 34002 concerning the abduction of Leoma Meshayev on 17 December 2002. According to a document issued on 21 June 2006 by the acting district prosecutor, the main version of the crime examined by the investigation was the involvement of \u201cpower structures and military units\u201d (\u201c\u0441\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0440 \u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439\u00bb).", "64. On 8 January 2003 the first applicant was questioned and granted victim status in the proceedings. She was also questioned again on several occasions.

On 10 April 2003 the district prosecutor\u2019s office opened criminal investigation file no. 34041 concerning the abduction of Bislan Saydayev on 17 December 2002.", "66. According to the Government, on 23 April 2003 the investigators granted victim status to the ninth applicant. When questioned he stated that at about noon on 17 December 2002 he had returned from Grozny and had learnt from his brother, the fourteenth applicant, that at about 3 a.m. on that night unknown armed persons had entered their house and taken away their other brother, Bislan Saydayev. The tenth and the fifteenth applicants gave similar statements on unspecified dates.", "67. The Government stated that other relatives of Bislan Saydayev, notably, the tenth, fourteenth and fifteenth applicants, had not sought the status of victims in the proceedings related to his disappearance and had not been accorded it.", "68. On 13 December 2003 the investigation of the two cases was joined and the case file was assigned number 34001 (to quote the text).", "69. The Government submitted to the Court one witness statement made by the first applicant, dated 23 June 2006, in which she described the circumstances of her husband\u2019s arrest and the fact that she had been hit in the face by one of the intruders. No other statements were produced.", "70. In their observations the Government referred to witness G.\u2019s statement of 10 December 2003 that on the night of 16 December 2003 [should probably be 2002] a large part of his supply of cut wood for winter, which had been stored near the cemetery, had been stolen. He had seen the tracks of heavy military vehicles, such as APCs or Ural trucks, near that place. On 23 June 2006 the investigation decided not to open criminal proceedings in relation to the theft in view of the expiration of the statutory time-limits.", "71. The Government noted that the applicants\u2019 statements that their relatives had been detained by servicemen could not be confirmed. The applicants did not recall any details of the clothing, arms or distinctive marks on the uniforms of the abductors.", "72. The Government also noted that the investigation had found no grounds to support the first applicant\u2019s allegations that she had been hit during the arrest of her husband, as she and other witnesses had not mentioned this during questioning. As to the first applicant\u2019s statement that the armed men had also taken her husband\u2019s passport, the Government informed the Court that the investigators had decided not to open criminal proceedings in this respect, due to expiration of statutory time-limits. Finally, the Government contended that Leoma Meshayev had not been on the register of the local tuberculosis health centre, despite the applicants\u2019 allegation that he had suffered from that disease.", "73. According to the Government, the investigators had sought information about the two men from various State authorities. On unspecified dates the district military commander\u2019s office, the Urus-Martan district department of the FSB and \u201cother power structures\u201d stated that they had no information about the carrying out of special activities on the night in question in Martan-Chu. Their offices had not detained Leoma Meshayev and Bislan Saydayev. The law-enforcement agencies of Chechnya informed the investigators that they had never detained or arrested the two missing men, nor carried out a criminal investigation in their respect. The investigation failed to establish the whereabouts of Mr Meshayev and Mr Saydayev. Requests for information sent by the investigators in 2007 and 2008 produced no new results in the investigation of the crime.", "74. As it appears from the documents submitted by the Government, the investigation had been suspended and reopened a number of times. The applicants had been occasionally informed of these developments. According to the Government, the investigation was under the control of the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office.", "75. Despite specific requests by the Court the Government did not submit a copy of the file in criminal case no. 34002, providing only copies of decisions to suspend and resume the investigation and to grant victim status, notifications to the applicants of the suspension and reopening of the proceedings and one witness statement mentioned above. Relying on the information obtained from the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, the Government stated that the investigation was in progress and that disclosure of the documents would be in breach of Article 161 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, since the file contained information of a military nature and personal data concerning the witnesses or other participants in the criminal proceedings.", "76. On 6 April 2006 the first and ninth applicants applied to the Urus-Martan Town Court (\u201cthe town court\u201d). They complained that the district prosecutor\u2019s office had failed to effectively investigate the disappearances and requested to be granted access to the case file.", "77. On 4 May 2005 the town court partially allowed the complaint based on the district prosecutor\u2019s office\u2019s failure to take effective steps and to investigate the abduction. The court ordered the district prosecutor\u2019s office to resume the investigation and to carry out a number of investigative actions as requested by the applicants, such as questioning the residents of Martan-Chu and the servicemen of the military roadblock situated on the road towards Urus-Martan who had been on duty on the night of 16-17 December 2002. The court refused to grant the applicants access to the case file, stating that that right was accorded to victims only on completion of the investigation, and not when the proceedings were adjourned. On 7 July 2005 the Chechnya Supreme Court upheld this decision.", "78. For a summary of relevant domestic law see Akhmadova and Sadulayeva v.
