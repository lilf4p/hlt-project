On 21 July 1993 he was charged, inter alia, with murder before the Vantaa District Court (kihlakunnanoikeus, h\u00e4radsr\u00e4tt). He was accused of committing the murder of L together with K. The charge had already been brought against K on 22 April 1993 and there had been seven previous hearings in the case. In these hearings eight witnesses had given evidence in K's presence.", "The applicant and K, who both had been on the scene of crime, denied having shot L and accused one another.", "In the eleven hearings that followed the applicant's apprehension, the District Court heard evidence from the two accused and from six of the previously heard and twelve new witnesses, some of whom were called by the applicant.", "In the hearing on 4 August 1993 the applicant's legal counsel stated that witnesses should be examined in the presence of the accused and the accused should be allowed to put questions to witnesses.", "In the hearing on 18 August 1993 the Public Prosecutor called two witnesses ML and KS, among others. ML was the victim's girlfriend and KS an acquaintance of the accused. The Public Prosecutor requested evidence from these witnesses to be heard in the absence of the applicant and K. They had already given evidence in K's presence in the previous hearings. No objection from the applicant's part was entered in the record. Under Chapter 17, Section 34, Subsection 2, of the Code of Judicial Procedure (oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari, r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken, see below) the District Court accepted the Public Prosecutor's request. The applicant's legal counsel examined the witnesses. After the testimonies were given, the presiding judge summarised them to the applicant and K, who were then allowed to put further questions to the witnesses.", "In the hearing on 25 October 1993 the District Court heard testimony from RS, an acquaintance of the applicant and K, in their absence. RS had earlier given evidence in K's presence. The applicant's legal counsel was able to examine the witness. When asked after the testimony, the applicant did not have further questions to RS. The witness KS gave testimony anew, this time in the presence of the applicant and K. The District Court also heard testimony from HT, who had already given evidence in the hearing on 21 July 1993. This time the Public Prosecutor requested HT to be examined without the applicant and K's presence, but the request was rejected. However, during HT's evidence the applicant and K were removed from the courtroom, as the District Court got the impression that the witness failed to tell what he knew when the accused were present. The applicant's legal counsel continued to examine the witness. After HT's testimony, the presiding judge summarised it briefly to the applicant and K, who were then allowed to put further questions.", "Other witnesses' testimonies before the District Court were heard in the presence of the applicant and K.", "On 25 March 1994, the District Court convicted the applicant of murder and other offences and sentenced him to life imprisonment. It based the judgement on the testimonies of the two accused and the witnesses. When evaluating the testimony of the applicant, the District Court took into consideration that the applicant had had the opportunity to follow the news reports of the proceedings prior to his arrest.", "Immediately after the pronouncement of the District Court's judgment, the applicant gave notice of his intention to appeal and asked for a copy of the reasons of the judgment. On 15 April 1994 the District Court informed the applicant's legal counsel that a copy of the District Court's record, including the judgment, could be fetched after 3 p.m. On the same day the applicant requested three weeks' extension of time for appeal. The District Court rejected the request on 19 April 1994. The time for appeal expired on 25 April 1994.", "The applicant appealed against the judgment of 25 March 1994 and the decision of 19 April 1994 to the Helsinki Court of Appeal (hovioikeus, hovr\u00e4tt). On 7 February 1995, the Court of Appeal rejected the appeals. As regards the murder charge, it stated: (translation from Finnish) \u201cThere is no reason to change the District Court's judgment.\u201d", "On 21 December 1995, the Supreme Court (korkein oikeus, h\u00f6gsta domstolen) refused the applicant leave to appeal.", "B.

The testimony must be read to the absent party and he must be allowed to put further questions to the witness.", "According to Chapter 25, Section 5, of the Code of Judicial procedure, a party who wishes to appeal against a District Court's judgment must give notice of his intention to appeal within seven days from the pronouncement of the judgment.
