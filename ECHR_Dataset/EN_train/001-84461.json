The applicant was born in 1947 and lives in Baku.", "6. The applicant was one of the founders of an association named \u201cHumanity and Environment\u201d (\u201c\u0130nsan v\u0259 M\u00fchit\u201d \u0130ctimai Birliyi), established on 6 September 1999.", "7. On 30 September 1999 the founders applied to register the association with the Ministry of Justice (\u201cthe Ministry\u201d), the government authority responsible for the state registration of legal entities. In accordance with the domestic law, a non-governmental organisation acquires the status of a legal entity only upon its state registration by the Ministry.", "8. On 11 February 2000, approximately four and a half months after the date of application for registration, the Ministry returned the registration documents to the founders without taking any action, that is without issuing either a state registration certificate or an official refusal to register the association. The Ministry noted that the association's charter did not comply with Article 1 of the Law on Public Associations of 10 November 1992.", "9. The founders redrafted the charter in line with the Ministry's comments and on 24 July 2000 reapplied for state registration, submitting a new version of the charter. On 28 December 2000 the Ministry responded with another refusal, stating that the charter provisions concerning the association's members were not in compliance with Article 10 of the Law on Non-Governmental Organisations (Public Associations and Funds) of 13 June 2000 (\u201cthe NGO Law\u201d).", "10. The applicants again revised the charter and on 28 August 2002 submitted their third registration request.", "11. Having not received any response to their third registration request, on 25 October 2002 the founders lodged an action, complaining that the Ministry \u201cevaded\u201d registering their organisation within the time-limits specified by law and asking the court to oblige the Ministry to register it. They also demanded compensation for non-pecuniary damage. On 2 December 2002 the Yasamal District Court dismissed the founders' claim, finding nothing unlawful in the actions of the Ministry. The court found that the association's charter had not been drafted in accordance with the requirements of the domestic law. The founders lodged an appeal against this judgment with the Court of Appeal.", "12. In the meantime, on 6 December 2002 the Ministry again returned the registration documents to the founders. This time the reason for declining the registration was the founders' failure to include in the charter the conditions for terminating membership of the association, as required by Article 13 of the NGO Law.", "13. On 22 May 2003 the Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the Yasamal District Court. On 5 November 2003 the Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' judgments dismissing the founders' claim.", "14.
