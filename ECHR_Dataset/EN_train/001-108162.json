On 29 January 2009 the applicant complained to the Smolninskiy District Court that his detention pending extradition was unlawful. On 2 February 2009 the court allowed his complaint in full and released him.

The prosecutor\u2019s office appealed against that decision.

On 18 March 2009 (in the documents submitted the date was sometimes given as 10 March 2009) the applicant complained to the Dzerzhinskiy District Court, stating, among other things, that in the absence of an extradition order his detention was unlawful, that he had already been detained with a view to extradition between 1 September 2008 and 2 February 2009 and that his further detention from 3 March 2009 was against the law as it was based on the same grounds.", "28. On 18 March 2009 the Dzerzhinskiy District Court examined the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 125 of the CCP (complaints against acts and decisions of officials involved in criminal proceedings) and dismissed it, stating that the prosecutor\u2019s detention order of 6 March 2009 was lawful and substantiated as it had been based on the detention order issued by the Andijan Town Court on 2 March 2009. The court did not examine the applicant\u2019s allegation that his continued detention from 3 March 2009 was against the law as it was based on the same grounds as his previous detention between 1 September 2008 and 2 February 2009.", "29. On 8 May 2009 the City Court upheld the decision of 18 March 2009 on appeal. It did not examine the applicant\u2019s allegations concerning the use of the same grounds for his continued detention either.", "30.

The applicant remained in detention.", "33. On 25 August 2009 the Dzerzhinskiy District Court again allowed the applicant\u2019s complaint of 13 May 2009. The court stated that the applicant\u2019s detention as of 7 May 2009 had been unlawful as it had not been duly extended by the domestic courts. It ordered the applicant\u2019s release from detention even though he had actually been released on 14 August 2009 following the decision of the City Court (see paragraph 16 above). The prosecutor\u2019s office appealed against the decision. On 27 October 2009 the City Court upheld the decision of 25 August 2009 on appeal.", "34. On 6 September 2010 the applicant was arrested by the National Interpol Bureau in St Petersburg and the Leningrad Region and taken to the Viborgskiy district department of the interior in St Petersburg (the Viborgskiy ROVD), where he was detained from 11.35 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. before being released on an undertaking to visit the Viborgskiy district prosecutor\u2019s office.", "35.

Between 7 and 11 March 2009 the applicant was detained in cell no. 82, measuring 18 sq. m, with ten other inmates. There were only eight bunk beds; the applicant therefore had to sleep on the floor. The cell had neither a table nor hot water. No proper bedding was provided for the applicant. His personal space amounted to 1.6 sq. m. The inmates constantly smoked in the cell, which had an adverse effect on the applicant\u2019s health.

The applicant\u2019s personal space amounted to less than 3 sq. m. In addition, the inmates smoked in the cell, which had an adverse effect on the applicant\u2019s health as the cell was not properly ventilated.", "44. The applicant substantiated his account of the conditions of detention in the remand prison by the following documents: a witness statement by Mr K. Petrov, who was detained with the applicant in cell no. 82, dated 16 February 2011; a witness statement by Mr Z. Elmuratov, who was detained with the applicant in cells no. 130/2 and no. 149, dated 16 February 2011; a witness statement by Ms E.

In its decision of 18 March 2009 the Dzerzhinskiy District Court left the applicant\u2019s complaint about the conditions of his detention unexamined. The applicant did not raise the issue of the conditions of his detention on appeal as he considered that an appeal would be ineffective.", "49. From the documents submitted it appears that the applicant neither applied for medical assistance while in remand prison IZ-47/4 nor complained about the lack of such assistance to the prison\u2019s administration.", "50. On 20 October 2008 the applicant applied to the St Petersburg Department of the Federal Migration Service (\u201cthe FMS\u201d) for refugee status in Russia, referring to his politically motivated persecution in Uzbekistan and the risk of ill-treatment.", "51. On 22 December 2008 the FMS rejected the applicant\u2019s request, stating that it had been motivated by an attempt to avoid lawful criminal prosecution in Uzbekistan and that his allegations of a risk of ill-treatment there were unsubstantiated. The applicant was informed of the refusal on 22 January 2009.", "52. On 4 March 2009 (in the documents submitted the date is sometimes given as 4 April 2009) the Dzerzhinskiy District Court upheld the refusal by the FMS.

Placement in custody is a preventive measure applied on the basis of a court decision to a person suspected of or charged with a crime punishable by at least two years\u2019 imprisonment where it is impossible to apply a more lenient preventive measure (Article 108 \u00a7 1). A request for placement in custody should be examined by a judge of a district court or a military court of a corresponding level (Article 108 \u00a7 4). A judge\u2019s decision on placement in custody may be challenged before an appeal court within three days (Article 108 \u00a7 11). The period of detention pending investigation of a crime cannot exceed two months (Article 109 \u00a7 1) but may be extended up to six months by a judge of a district court or a military court of a corresponding level (Article 109 \u00a7 2).

The court must examine the complaint within five days of its receipt.", "86. Chapter 54 (\u201cExtradition of a person for criminal prosecution or execution of sentence\u201d) regulates extradition procedures. On receipt of a request for extradition not accompanied by an arrest warrant issued by a foreign court, a prosecutor must decide on the preventive measure to be applied to the person whose extradition is sought. The measure must be applied in accordance with the established procedure (Article 466 \u00a7 1). Upon receipt of a request for extradition accompanied by an arrest warrant issued by a foreign judicial body, a prosecutor may place the person whose extradition is being sought under house arrest or in custodial detention without prior approval of his or her decision by a court of the Russian Federation (Article 466 \u00a7 2).", "87. An extradition decision made by the Prosecutor General may be challenged before a court. Issues of guilt or innocence are not within the scope of judicial review, which is limited to an assessment of whether the extradition order was made in accordance with the procedure set out in the relevant international and domestic law (Article 463 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 6).", "88.

Nor do other rules of criminal procedure provide for such a possibility. Moreover, Article 10 \u00a7 2 and Article 109 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure expressly require the court, prosecutor, investigator ... to immediately release anyone who is unlawfully held in custody beyond the time-limit established in the Code.

In this ruling the Supreme Court reiterated that the arrest and detention of a person with the aim of extraditing him or her under Article 466 of the CCP should comply with the requirements of Article 108 of the CCP, and that detention pending extradition could be extended only in compliance with the requirements of Article 109 of the CCP.", "96.

If an inmate\u2019s health deteriorates, the medical officers of the remand prison are obliged to examine the inmate promptly and inform him or her of the results of the examination in writing.

Reference was made in the Preface to the potential tension between a State\u2019s obligation to protect its citizens against terrorist acts and the need to uphold fundamental values. This is well illustrated by the current controversy over the use of \u2018diplomatic assurances\u2019 in the context of deportation procedures. The prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment encompasses the obligation not to send a person to a country where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would run a real risk of being subjected to such methods. In order to avoid such a risk in given cases, certain States have chosen the route of seeking assurances from the country of destination that the person concerned will not be ill-treated. This practice is far from new, but has come under the spotlight in recent years as States have increasingly sought to remove from their territory persons deemed to endanger national security. Fears are growing that the use of diplomatic assurances is in fact circumventing the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment.", "39. The seeking of diplomatic assurances from countries with a poor overall record in relation to torture and ill-treatment is giving rise to particular concern. It does not necessarily follow from such a record that someone whose deportation is envisaged personally runs a real risk of being ill-treated in the country concerned; the specific circumstances of each case have to be taken into account when making that assessment. However, if in fact there would appear to be a risk of ill-treatment, can diplomatic assurances received from the authorities of a country where torture and illtreatment is widely practised ever offer sufficient protection against that risk? It has been advanced with some cogency that even assuming those authorities do exercise effective control over the agencies that might take the person concerned into their custody (which may not always be the case), there can be no guarantee that assurances given will be respected in practice. If these countries fail to respect their obligations under international human rights treaties ratified by them, so the argument runs, why should one be confident that they will respect assurances given on a bilateral basis in a particular case?", "40. In response, it has been argued that mechanisms can be devised for the postreturn monitoring of the treatment of a person deported, in the event of his/her being detained. While the CPT retains an open mind on this subject, it has yet to see convincing proposals for an effective and workable mechanism. To have any chance of being effective, such a mechanism would certainly need to incorporate some key guarantees, including the right of independent and suitably qualified persons to visit the individual concerned at any time, without prior notice, and to interview him/her in private in a place of their choosing. The mechanism would also have to offer means of ensuring that immediate remedial action is taken, in the event of it coming to light that assurances given were not being respected.\u201d", "98.

It is the view of the Special Rapporteur that diplomatic assurances are unreliable and ineffective in the protection against torture and ill-treatment: such assurances are sought usually from States where the practice of torture is systematic; post-return monitoring mechanisms have proven to be no guarantee against torture; diplomatic assurances are not legally binding, therefore they carry no legal effect and no accountability if breached; and the person whom the assurances aim to protect has no recourse if the assurances are violated. The Special Rapporteur is therefore of the opinion that States cannot resort to diplomatic assurances as a safeguard against torture and ill-treatment where there are substantial grounds for believing that a person would be in danger of being subjected to torture or illtreatment upon return.", "52. The Special Rapporteur calls on Governments to observe the principle of nonrefoulement scrupulously and not expel any person to frontiers or territories where they might run the risk of human rights violations, regardless of whether they have officially been recognised as refugees.\u201d", "100. Specifically referring to the situation regarding torture in Uzbekistan and returns to torture effected in reliance upon diplomatic assurances from the Uzbek authorities, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture stated to the 2nd Session of the UN Human Rights Council on 20 September 2006:", "\u201cThe practice of torture in Uzbekistan is systematic, as indicated in the report of my predecessor Theo van Boven\u2019s visit to the country in 2002. Lending support to this finding, my mandate continues to receive serious allegations of torture by Uzbek law enforcement officials ... Moreover, with respect to the events in May 2005 in Andijan, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that there is strong, consistent and credible testimony to the effect that Uzbek military and security forces committed grave human rights violations there. The fact that the Government has rejected an international inquiry into the Andijan events, independent scrutiny of the related proceedings, and that there is no internationally accepted account of the events, is deeply worrying. Against such significant, serious and credible evidence of systematic torture by law enforcement officials in Uzbekistan, I continue to find myself appealing to Governments to refrain from transferring persons to Uzbekistan. The prohibition of torture is absolute, and States risk violating this prohibition \u2013 their obligations under international law \u2013 by transferring persons to countries where they may be at risk of torture. I reiterate that diplomatic assurances are not legally binding, undermine existing obligations of States to prohibit torture, are ineffective and unreliable in ensuring the protection of returned persons, and therefore shall not be resorted to by States.\u201d", "101.

In general, assessing the suitability of diplomatic assurances is relatively straightforward where they are intended to ensure that the individual concerned will not be subjected to capital punishment or certain violations of fair trial rights as a consequence of extradition. In such cases, the wanted person is transferred to a formal process, and the requesting State\u2019s compliance with the assurances can be monitored. While there is no effective remedy for the requested State or the surrendered person if the assurances are not observed, non-compliance can be readily identified and would need to be taken into account when evaluating the reliability of such assurances in any future cases.", "23. The situation is different where the individual concerned risks being subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment in the receiving State upon removal. It has been noted that \u2018unlike assurances on the use of the death penalty or trial by a military court, which are readily verifiable, assurances against torture and other abuse require constant vigilance by competent and independent personnel\u2019. The Supreme Court of Canada addressed the issue in its decision in Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), contrasting assurances in cases of a risk of torture with those given where the person extradited may face the death penalty, and signalling", "\u2018... the difficulty in relying too heavily on assurances by a state that it will refrain from torture in the future when it has engaged in illegal torture or allowed others to do so on its territory in the past. This difficulty becomes acute in cases where torture is inflicted not only with the collusion but through the impotence of the state in controlling the behaviour of its officials. Hence the need to distinguish between assurances regarding the death penalty and assurances regarding torture. The former are easier to monitor and generally more reliable than the latter.\u2019", "24. In his report to the UN General Assembly of 1 September 2004, the special Rapporteur of the UN Commission on Human Rights on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment examined the question of diplomatic assurances in light of the non-refoulement obligations inherent in the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other forms of ill-treatment. Noting that in determining whether there are substantial grounds for believing that a person would be in danger of being subjected to torture, all relevant considerations must be taken into account, the Special Rapporteur expressed the view that:", "\u2018in circumstances where there is a consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights, or of systematic practice of torture, the principle of nonrefoulement must be strictly observed and diplomatic assurances should not be resorted to.\u2019\u201d", "103.
