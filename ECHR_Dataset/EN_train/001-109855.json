They were represented before the Court by Ms Nuala Mole, of the Aire Centre (Advice on Individual Rights in Europe, London). The Macedonian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were initially represented by their former Agent, Mrs R. Lazareska Gerovska, succeeded subsequently by their present Agent, Mr K. Bogdanov.", "2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "3. The first applicant is the father of Mr Agron Deari (\u201cMr A.D.\u201d) who was killed on 30 August 2002; the second applicant is the father of Mr Jakup Murtezanov (\u201cMr J.M.\u201d); and the third applicant is the father of Mr Qahil Sherifi (\u201cMr Q.S.\u201d). Mr J.M. and Mr Q.S. were killed on 7 September 2003.", "4. The Government invited the Court to view the events giving rise to the applicants\u2019 complaints in the light of the 2001 armed conflict between ethnic Albanians and the Government security forces and the fact that armed criminal groups were still active in the former crisis areas several years after the conflict. In respect of Mr A.D.\u2019s killing, particular attention was drawn to the incidents of 29 August 2002 on the Tetovo-Gostivar highway (\u201cthe highway\u201d) in which armed civilians kidnapped eight persons, including two minor girls. In this connection the Government referred to a public announcement of 30 August 2002 in which the Ministry of the Interior (\u201cthe Ministry\u201d) called for the inhabitants of neighbouring villages to remain, for security reasons, in their homes.", "5. At 3.30 a.m. on 30 August 2002 Mr A.D. was travelling in a car with foreign registration plates, together with J.I., when police officers from the special police force \u201cLions\u201d, under the Ministry, stopped them on the highway. According to a report drawn up the same day by the Ministry, Mr A.D., in an attempt to flee the scene, resisted the security forces by pulling out a pistol. Firearms were used against him. He sustained several bodily injuries. Furthermore, two pistols were found in the car. The local police station was alerted immediately. Police officers arrived at the scene and took Mr A.D., who still held the pistol in his hand, to the local medical centre where his death was confirmed. J.I. was arrested on account of unlawful possession of firearms and released without charge. The names of the officers involved in his arrest were not recorded in any register of the Ministry.", "6. On the same day the investigating judge, public prosecutor, police and representatives of the OSCE\u2019s mission in the respondent State inspected the scene, but no useful evidence was found owing to heavy rainfall. In a written and duly signed statement given before the investigating judge, the first applicant requested that no autopsy or investigation be conducted in relation to his son\u2019s death. In view of that request, the investigating judge ordered an external examination of Mr A.D.\u2019s corpse and requested that an expert describe the injuries, the way in which they had been sustained, as well as to determine, if possible, the time and direct cause of Mr A.D.\u2019s death. The expert report noted bruises to Mr A.D.\u2019s head, face, chest and stomach and several penetrating gun-shot wounds to his leg, arms, chest and neck.", "7. On 2 September 2002 the public prosecutor requested that the investigating judge take certain steps to investigate Mr A.D.\u2019s death. The request referred to the on-site examination report of 30 August 2002, which was to be regarded as a criminal complaint.", "8. On 5 September 2002 the Ministry questioned J.I. According to a report signed by a police officer, J.I. stated, inter alia:", "\u201c... we [with Mr A.D.] were stopped by the police. I showed them my ID and car registration document. The officers ordered me to step out of the car. A. [Mr A.D.] got out of the car as well. I was ordered to open the boot. ... During the search of the boot and the interior of the car, I heard an officer saying \u2018I\u2019ve found two guns\u2019. After this statement, my hands were put behind my back and tied ... At one moment, they put my head in the boot. While my torso was in the boot I heard gunshots, after which a sweater was put over my head to prevent my sight ... I heard one of the officers speaking into the radio, saying that one of the persons concerned had been killed after he had fired a gun while attempting to flee ...\u201d", "9. On the same day, the Ministry submitted a criminal complaint against an unidentified perpetrator. Photo documentation of the scene and of Mr A.D.\u2019s corpse, as well as expert reports confirming his bodily injuries and bullet wounds were submitted to the investigating judge.", "10. On 22 November 2002 the Forensic Science Department (\u0423\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430) at the Ministry sent the investigating judge an expert report concerning Mr A.D.\u2019s pistol, which stated the following:", "\u201c... it was concluded that it had been fired from the pistol submitted for examination ... all parts of the weapon are fully operational ... A test was done for nitrate residue on samples taken from Mr A.D. ... The reaction was negative, namely no nitrate residue was discovered. We emphasise that the samples were covered in blood, which significantly affected the analysis for nitrate residue... Since the clothes were abundantly covered in blood, we cannot determine the distance from which the gunshots were fired ...\u201d", "11. The first applicant alleged that on 27 September 2002 he had notified the OSCE\u2019s representatives in the respondent State that he had not been contacted by any competent institution in respect of his son\u2019s death. No evidence was provided in this respect.", "12. In February 2003 the investigating judge returned the case file to the public prosecutor. The latter requested that the Ministry determine the identity of the police officers involved in the incident.", "13. In a letter of 15 August 2003, the Ministry confirmed that the special police forces had used weapons against Mr A.D. Information was sought from the relevant department as to whether the officers concerned had taken the required actions (see paragraphs 35 and 36 below) after the incident.", "14. In December 2003 the public prosecutor again asked the Ministry to submit the required information.", "15. At the same time, a working group was set up to investigate several cases of alleged police abuse of citizens of Albanian ethnic origin, including the present case.

The working group operated between December 2004 and October 2005.", "16. On 12 January 2005 the investigating judge heard evidence from J.I. According to the transcript signed by J.I., the latter stated, inter alia:", "\u201c... When we approached the toll booth on the Tetovo-Gostivar highway, I noticed a high police presence and decided to turn around and take the \u2018old road\u2019... While driving on the old road ... I again noticed a high police presence; the road was blocked by a heavy vehicle. At both sides of the road there were many armed police officers. A police officer used a lamp to stop our car. He approached the car and requested documents. I gave him my registration document and my ID. Then he grabbed my shirt and pulled me out of the car. After me, Mr A.D. was also removed from the car. Both of us were standing in front of the car, while police officers conducted the search. One of them said that he had found two guns in the car. Each of them belonged to me and A. [Mr A.D.]. At that moment, a police officer grabbed the handcuffs on my hands which were behind my back and pulled them up; another officer grabbed my leg and pushed me to the ground. They dragged me to the back of the car. ... They put me head first into the boot. My legs were outside the car. An officer pointed an automatic gun at my head and another beat me. I couldn\u2019t see what was happening to A. I heard someone saying \u2018stop, hold on\u2019. Gunshots were subsequently heard, I think from several weapons, but I did not know what was going on. They took off my sweater and put it over my head. They took me out of the boot and placed me on the ground ...The two pistols were in the compartment in front of A.\u2019s seat ... The person who pulled me out of the car that night was wearing a mask, so I could see only his eyes, I couldn\u2019t see his face. Others were wearing masks as well. I only noticed the \u2018Lions\u2019 symbol on their uniforms...\u201d", "17. Between March and June 2005, the investigating judge examined eight police officers.

After the file was returned to the public prosecutor, the latter requested, by a letter of 2 February 2007, that the Ministry undertake additional measures to identify the individuals involved in Mr A.D.\u2019s killing.", "19. On 15 September 2008 the first applicant, with the assistance of Mr M.R., a lawyer from Skopje, sought information from the public prosecutor about the death of his son and requested a copy of the case file.

There was an exchange of fire in which automatic long-range weapons and mortars were used. After the exchange of fire, the security forces searched the area and discovered five bunkers and a large quantity of heavy weaponry and ammunition. Mr J.M. and Mr Q.S. were killed in this operation. According to the post-mortem reports of the same date drawn up by the Forensic Institute, Mr J.M. sustained six bullet wounds and Mr Q.S. sustained four.

In a letter of 5 June 2006, the Ministry of Defence indicated that the operation had been carried out by the Ministry of the Interior. On 15 February 2007 the public prosecutor requested that both Ministries clarify the inconsistencies concerning their involvement in the operation. In submissions of 16 April 2007, the Ministry of the Interior confirmed its position indicated in its letter of 11 July 2005 and invited the public prosecutor to clarify the matter with the Ministry of Defence.
