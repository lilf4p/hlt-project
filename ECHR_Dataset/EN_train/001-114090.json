After an ambulance had been summoned by the police officers and medical help had arrived, the beatings ceased.", "7. On 24 July 2003 the applicant\u2019s lawyer submitted a request for the applicant to be examined by a forensic medical expert. The examination took place on the same day.

This finding is based, inter alia, on the results of the forensic medical examination undergone by [the applicant].\u201d", "11. On 1 October 2003 the applicant filed another complaint with the district prosecutor\u2019s office about the beatings he had allegedly received in police custody. On 3 October 2003 the investigator K.- who was also in charge of the criminal investigation against the applicant - dismissed his allegations as unsubstantiated based on the statements made by three policemen.

At the beginning of September 2005 the Oktyabrskiy district prosecutor questioned the applicant, who gave a description of the police officer who had allegedly hit him with \u201can object looking like a mobile phone\u201d. The prosecutor then questioned police officer Z. who denied beating the applicant and further claimed that none of the police officers of the Oktyabrskiy district police station matched the description given by the applicant. He did not remember whether the applicant had sustained any visible injuries immediately after the arrest. The prosecutor also questioned the head of the temporary detention centre where the applicant had been held on 23 and 24 July 2003 and the doctor who had admitted the applicant to the remand prison on 25 July 2003. They both stated that the applicant had not had any visible injuries and that there were no complaints of illtreatment by him recorded in the registration logs of their respective detention facilities.", "15. On 8 September 2005 investigator T. refused to open criminal proceedings, finding that there was no evidence of ill-treatment. On 7 November 2005 the district prosecutor set that decision aside and ordered an additional inquiry.", "16. On 10 November 2005 the investigator T. again refused to open a criminal investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations. In order to obtain further evidence, the investigator questioned the applicant\u2019s neighbours who had seen him prior to the arrest on 23 July 2003. S. confirmed that the applicant had had no visible injuries on that day. D. did not remember if the applicant had evidence of any injuries prior to the arrest.

He reiterated the findings of the previous inquiries, concluding, in particular, as follows:", "\u201c... the evidence collected disproves the [applicant\u2019s] allegations that the investigator K. and [the police officers] put any physical or psychological pressure on [him]. It follows that [the investigator and the police officers] acted in compliance with the law, they did not abuse their authority and did not infringe the [applicant\u2019s] rights and interests. These conclusions are confirmed by the evidence collected and numerous witness statements. There is no sufficient ground to believe that the injuries [the applicant] had when examined on 24 July 2003 were sustained by him after he was taken into custody. Furthermore, there is sufficient information ... showing that no physical or psychological pressure was put on [the applicant] by the investigator K. and [the police officers].\u201d", "19. On 15 February 2006 the deputy district prosecutor set the decision of 2 February 2006 aside finding that the investigator had failed to comply with the decision of 18 January 2006. In particular, he had not established when, where and under what circumstances the applicant had sustained the injuries.", "20. On 7 March 2006 the investigator G. issued a fifth decision refusing to initiate criminal proceedings, finding that the existing evidence refuted the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment.", "21. On 10 October 2007 the District Court partly upheld a complaint by the applicant and found the decision of 7 March 2006 unlawful and unsubstantiated.

On 29 December 2007 the investigator N. issued a sixth decision refusing to open criminal proceedings. As regards the applicant\u2019s injuries, the investigator stated as follows:", "\u201cThe fact that the applicant had certain injuries detected in the course of the examination conducted on 24 July 2003 does not signify that they were inflicted by [the policemen or the investigator]. There is no causal link and it is not required to establish when, where and how the applicant had sustained them.\u201d", "23. On 29 January 2008 the District Court found the investigator\u2019s decision of 29 December 2007 not to open criminal proceedings unlawful as he had failed to discover the reasons for the applicant\u2019s injuries. On 22 February 2008 the deputy head of the investigating committee attached to the regional prosecutor\u2019s office quashed the decision of 29 December 2007 and referred the matter back for a further inquiry.", "24.

The investigator reiterated practically verbatim the reasoning set out in the previous decision.", "25. On 31 March 2008 the District Court found the decision of 3 March 2008 unlawful on the grounds that the investigator had not provided a plausible and convincing explanation of how the applicant\u2019s injury had been caused. On 15 May 2008 the Orenburg Regional Court upheld the decision of 31 March 2008 on appeal.", "26.

Subsequently, the investigators attached to the regional prosecutor\u2019s office refused to open a criminal investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations on five further occasions. The relevant decisions, providing identical reasoning to that underlying the earlier decisions, were taken on 23 April, 28 June, 8 and 18 July and 20 August 2008. All these decisions were subsequently quashed by the investigators\u2019 superiors on 18 and 28 June, 8 July and 11 and 20 August 2008 on account of their failure to clarify", "28. On 30 September 2008 the investigator F. issued the thirteenth decision refusing to open a criminal investigation. Although he found no evidence supporting the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment in police custody he allowed that the applicant\u2019s injuries could have been caused by his having been beaten and that a criminal investigation should be opened on charges of battery but this was not within the jurisdiction of his office. The materials were transmitted to a district police unit. The applicant\u2019s complaint against the decision of 30 September 2008 was subsequently dismissed by the District and Regional Courts on 16 October and 20 November 2008 respectively.", "29. On 13 October 2008 the police investigator refused again to open a criminal investigation because the statutory time-limit for criminal liability on the charge of battery had expired. On 18 March 2009 the District Court dismissed a complaint by the applicant against that decision.", "30. On an unspecified date the applicant was committed for trial on a charge of manslaughter before the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Orsk.", "31.

On 22 April 2005 the Leninskiy District Court of Orsk dismissed his claim. It referred, in particular, to the results of the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry into the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment; the investigator K.\u2019s decision of 3 October 2003 refusing to open criminal proceedings against the police officers; and the applicant\u2019s conviction. It also observed that the applicant\u2019s complaint that the police officers had beaten him to obtain a confession was unconvincing, given that he had never confessed to the crime. There was no evidence that the bruise on the applicant\u2019s face had been the result of illtreatment by the police officers.", "35. On 16 June 2005 the Orenburg Regional Court quashed the decision and remitted the matter to the Leninskiy District Court for fresh consideration.", "36.
