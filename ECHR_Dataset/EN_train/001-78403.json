The time-limit was subsequently extended and \u017dan \u017dagar paid the advance on 19 April 2001.", "On 9 May 2001 the court ordered the enforcement officer to proceed with the enforcement.", "A new attempt of attachment was unsuccessful, because the debtor had moved again.", "On 19 February 2003 the court requested \u017dan \u017dagar to provide the debtor\u2019s new address. He complied the following day.", "On 24 March 2003 the court appointed a new enforcement officer, since the previous one ceased to exercise his functions.", "On 17 February 2004 \u017dan \u017dagar made a proposal for enforcement by new means for attachment.
