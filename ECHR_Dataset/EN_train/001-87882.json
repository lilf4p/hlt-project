On 11 January 2000 the Office for the Supervision of Credit Unions (\u00da\u0159ad pro dohled nad dru\u017estevn\u00edmi z\u00e1lo\u017enami) (\u201cthe OSCU\u201d) placed the applicant credit union in receivership (nucen\u00e1 spr\u00e1va) for a period of six months under section 28(3)(c) of the Act, on the ground that it had contravened the legislation in question, having engaged in activities outside its remit without authorisation. A receiver (nucen\u00fd spr\u00e1vce) was appointed to replace the applicant credit union\u2019s decision-making bodies. The OSCU was acting under section 27(1) of the Act read in conjunction with section 26(2) of the Banks Act (z\u00e1kon o bank\u00e1ch).", "7. Referring to an audit of the applicant credit union\u2019s activities, the OSCU noted that the applicant credit union had on 6 May 1999 concluded three contracts with S7, a limited liability company, under the terms of which the latter had assigned to the applicant credit union receivables due to it from two debtor companies, amounting to CZK 126,235,132 (EUR 3,366,582) in total, for an agreed price of CZK 14,431,000 (EUR 384,862). The OSCU ruled that the applicant credit union had thereby purchased the receivables of a third party by effectively covering the latter\u2019s debt. It qualified the transaction as a loan to a third party. Since section 3 of the Act prohibited credit unions from providing loans to non-members, the OSCU concluded that the applicant credit union had acted in flagrant breach of the Act.", "8. The OSCU further noted that the auditors had discovered that the applicant credit union had entered into a contract on 2 and 5 August 1999 to grant a loan of CZK 22,000,000 (EUR 586,721) to a limited liability company, MLM Brno, and had signed two contracts on 25 June 1999 with OPES, a joint stock company, for the purchase of securities (cenn\u00e9 pap\u00edry) at a total price of CZK 41,200,056 (EUR 1,098,770). The OSCU ruled that these transactions were also illegal, as section 1(6) read in conjunction with section 3 of the Act did not allow credit unions to acquire securities other than public bonds (dluhopisy), municipal bonds (komun\u00e1ln\u00ed obligace) or mortgage bonds (hypote\u010dn\u00ed z\u00e1stavn\u00ed listy).", "9. The receivership became effective on 12 January 2000, when the applicant credit union was notified of the OSCU\u2019s decision.", "10. On 26 March 2000 the applicant credit union lodged a constitutional appeal (\u00fastavn\u00ed st\u00ed\u017enost) with the Constitutional Court (\u00dastavn\u00ed soud) against the receivership order and applied at the same time for an order striking down certain provisions of the Act. It relied, inter alia, on section 75(2)(a) of the Constitutional Court Act, which enables the Constitutional Court to hear a constitutional appeal even if domestic remedies have not been exhausted, if it substantially affects the appellant\u2019s personal interests.", "11. On 7 April 2000, following an administrative appeal by the applicant credit union, the Ministry of Finance upheld the receivership order of 11 January 2000.", "12. On the same date a petition to adjudge the applicant credit union bankrupt (konkusn\u00ed \u0159\u00edzen\u00ed) was filed with the Brno Regional Court (krajsk\u00fd soud). During 2001 a large number of creditors joined the proceedings.", "13. On an unspecified date the applicant credit union applied for judicial review (spr\u00e1vn\u00ed \u017ealoba) of the imposition of receivership under Article 247 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure, asserting that the statutory conditions for such a step on the part of the OSCU had not been met.", "14. On 1 May 2000 Act no. 100/2000 entered into force, extensively amending the Act (hereinafter \u201cthe amended Act\u201d). The powers of supervisory boards of credit unions were confined to the right to appeal decisions adopted by the OSCU.", "15. On 21 June 2000 the OSCU granted the receiver permission to suspend withdrawals from deposit accounts held with the applicant credit union in view of its precarious financial situation. According to its findings, the sum owed by the applicant credit union on outstanding term deposits amounted to at least CZK 83,000,000 (EUR 2,213,539), while the cash available in its current accounts was only CZK 21,500,000 (EUR 573,386).", "16. On 12 July 2000 the OSCU renewed the receivership order under the amended Act as the previously identified deficiencies remained. It referred, inter alia, to the first receivership order and to three decisions by which it had prohibited or restricted the applicant credit union\u2019s activities, including withdrawals from deposit accounts (decision nos. 322/2000/II of 20 January 2000, 1217/2000/II of 9 March 2000 and 2407/2000/II of 25 April 2000).", "17. On 9 November 2000 the Ministry of Finance upheld that decision.", "18. On 12 December 2000 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant credit union\u2019s constitutional appeal for non-exhaustion of ordinary remedies under section 75(1) of the Constitutional Court Act. It reiterated that the principle requiring the exhaustion of ordinary remedies could be derogated from in exceptional circumstances if the effective protection of constitutionally guaranteed fundamental rights and freedoms was endangered. It found that, contrary to section 72(1) of the Constitutional Court Act, which provides, inter alia, that \u201ca constitutional appeal may be introduced by any natural person who claims to be the victim of a breach of the fundamental rights or freedoms recognised in a constitutional law or an international treaty by a valid decision taken in proceedings to which he was a party\u201d, the applicant credit union had lodged its constitutional appeal before the receivership order had become effective.", "19. On 15 January 2001 the applicant credit union, represented by the president of its supervisory board, applied for judicial review, challenging the Ministry of Finance\u2019s decision of 9 November 2000.", "20. On 10 and 25 January, 2 February, 4 April and 3 May 2001 respectively (decisions nos. 114/2001, 369/2001, 838/2001, 1645/2001 and 2134/2001), the OSCU allowed the receiver to suspend withdrawals from deposit accounts held with the applicant credit union.", "21. According to the Government, on 6 June 2001 the OSCU granted the receiver permission to file on its own a petition with a court to adjudge the credit union bankrupt, which he did on 18 June 2001.", "22. On 9 July 2001 the Regional Court appointed an interim trustee (p\u0159edb\u011b\u017en\u00fd spr\u00e1vce).", "23. On 12 July 2001 the OSCU again placed the applicant credit union in receivership. It based its decision on the applicant credit union\u2019s report of 3 July 2001 which included a statement of its outstanding debts and available funds. It was noted in the report that the applicant credit union was insolvent, as it had only CZK 59,257,000 (EUR 1,580,333) at its disposal, which was insufficient to enable it to honour its outstanding debts of at least CZK 218,000,000 (EUR 5,813,872). Moreover, because of its lack of liquid assets the applicant credit union had omitted to pay an annual contribution to the OSCU that had fallen due on 30 April 2001. The OSCU further noted that the applicant credit union\u2019s financial statements as of 31 December 2000 disclosed negative equity to the tune of CZK 222,949,000 (EUR 5,945,858).", "24. On 4 October 2001 the Ministry of Finance upheld the third receivership order.", "25. On 21 March 2002 the applicant credit union, represented by the president of its supervisory board, filed an application for judicial review of the Ministry\u2019s decision.", "26. On 17 April 2002 the applicant credit union filed a claim for damages with the Ministry of Finance under the State Liability Act (Act no. 82/1998).", "27. On 19 April 2002 the OSCU withdrew the applicant credit union\u2019s licence (povolen\u00ed p\u016fsobit jako dru\u017estevn\u00ed a \u00fav\u011brn\u00ed z\u00e1lo\u017ena). It found irregularities in the way the applicant credit union had conducted its affairs, as attested by its inability to meet its liabilities, and considered that no improvement could be expected. It observed that by 15 March 2002, the applicant credit union had recorded overdue liabilities totalling at least CZK 200,000,000 (EUR 5,333,828), while having at its disposal only CZK 56,006,000 (EUR 1,493,632). The cumulative value of the ratios reflecting the balance between assets and liabilities was just under 28%, whereas section 7(1) of Ministry of Finance Decree no. 387/2001 on the liquidity and solvency requirements for credit unions required a cumulative value from 31 December 2001 onwards of at least 45%.", "28. The OSCU found that as of 15 March 2002 the applicant credit union had disclosed a negative capital value of CZK 243,705,000 (EUR 6,499,403), whereas under section 10(1) of Ministry of Finance Decree no. 386/2001 on the capital adequacy requirements for credit unions, cooperative savings associations were obliged to have achieved by 31 December 2001, and to maintain thereafter, a capital adequacy of at least 0.1%. The OSCU further stated that on 17 April 2002 the applicant credit union had submitted a report on its financial management results which showed that the irregularities in the applicant credit union\u2019s affairs, including its failure to comply with the capital adequacy, liquidity and solvency requirements, were so serious that there was no reasonable prospect of their being remedied.", "29. By a letter of 22 May 2002 the Ministry of Finance dismissed the applicant credit union\u2019s claim for damages. On 28 May 2002 the applicant credit union, through its legal representative empowered by the presidents of the board of directors and the supervisory board, brought an action for damages against the Ministry of Finance.", "30. In a judgment of 21 June 2002 the Prague High Court (Vrchn\u00ed soud) dismissed the applicant credit union\u2019s first request for judicial review as being unsubstantiated, finding that the applicant credit union had been placed in receivership in accordance with the national legislation then in force and that the OSCU had not decided outside its discretionary power (voln\u00e9 uv\u00e1\u017een\u00ed). The court held, inter alia, that:", "\u201cPlacing a credit union in receivership is one of the measures which the [OSCU] may apply in addition to or instead of other sanctions specified in section 28(2) of [the Act]. ...", "Admittedly, the [OSCU] chose the strictest measure. However, [it] did not breach the [Act] and did not proceed contrary to the [Act\u2019s] aims, which are the only grounds on which [the OSCU\u2019s] decision may be quashed (Article 245(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure)... If the [OSCU] found ... that the amount of available assets reserved for direct payments to members of [the applicant credit union] within three months had decreased to 6.77% of deposits (the Act lays down a minimum of 15%) ... as a consequence of ... a number of ... financial transactions entered into by the [applicant credit union], and if the [OSCU] discovered other breaches of the [Act] and the applicant credit union\u2019s articles of association, then there is no ground for this court to find that the OSCU, when imposing the receivership, decided outside its discretionary powers.\u201d", "31. On 3 July 2002 the OSCU appointed its liquidator (likvid\u00e1tor). On 31 October 2002, following an appeal by the applicant credit union, the Ministry of Finance upheld the appointment.", "32. In the meantime, on 12 September 2002, the applicant credit union had lodged a constitutional appeal against the High Court\u2019s judgment, alleging a violation of Article 11 \u00a7 4 and Articles 36 and 38 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms (Listina z\u00e1kladn\u00edch pr\u00e1v a svobod), as well as Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.", "33. On 5 December 2002 the High Court upheld the Regional Court\u2019s decision of 9 July 2001 concerning the appointment of the interim receiver.", "34. On 30 January 2003 the Constitutional Court rejected the constitutional appeal of 12 September 2002 as manifestly unfounded.", "35. On 10 April 2003 two shareholders of the applicant credit union joined the proceedings concerning its action for damages.", "36. On 23 April 2003 the Prague 1 District Court (obvodn\u00ed soud) dismissed the applicant credit union\u2019s action for damages on the ground that it had been lodged by an unauthorised person. It stated, inter alia, that members of the board of directors and of the supervisory board were not entitled to bring the action on behalf of the applicant credit union. At the same time, the court severed the two shareholders\u2019 claims, ruling that they should be heard separately.", "37. On 20 May 2003 the applicant credit union appealed. However, on 5 September 2003 the District Court discontinued the proceedings, stating in particular:", "\u201cSection 28(d)(1) of [the Act] grants the supervisory board of a credit union the right to challenge the conduct of receivership, but an action for damages sustained as a result of the receivership cannot be equated with the right of the supervisory board to appeal against decisions of [the OSCU] under section 28(d)(1) of [the Act].\u201d", "38. On 9 February 2004 the Supreme Administrative Court (Nejvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed spr\u00e1vn\u00ed soud) rejected the second application for judicial review, lodged by the applicant credit union on 15 January 2001 against the Ministry of Finance\u2019s decision of 9 November 2000 upholding the second receivership order. The court, referring to section 28(d) of the amended Act, found that the application had been lodged by an unauthorised person, as only the receiver had authority to lodge such an appeal.", "39. On 23 April 2004 the applicant credit union lodged a constitutional appeal against the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court.", "40. On 26 April 2004 the Prague Municipal Court (m\u011bstsk\u00fd soud) upheld the District Court\u2019s decision of 5 September 2003.", "41. On 28 April 2004 the Regional Court, on a petition filed by 217 creditors, shareholders of the applicant credit union, declared the applicant credit union to be insolvent. A trustee (spr\u00e1vce konkurzn\u00ed podstaty) was appointed, accordingly.", "42. On 13 October 2004 a creditors\u2019 meeting (sch\u016fze v\u011b\u0159itel\u016f) was held, at which the creditors\u2019 committee (v\u011b\u0159itelsk\u00fd v\u00fdbor) was elected. On 8 December 2004, 7 November 2005 and 18 January 2006 respectively, three review meetings took place.", "43. In the meantime, on 7 March 2005, the Constitutional Court had dismissed the applicant credit union\u2019s latest constitutional appeal.", "44. On 8 March 2006 the Regional Court received a list of the applicant credit union\u2019s assets. The realisation of the assets included in the list is, according to the Government, under way. In connection with this insolvency dispute, the Regional Court has registered 35 judicial disputes.", "45. It would appear that the third application for judicial review filed by the applicant credit union is still pending before the Supreme Court.", "According to the Commercial Register as it stands, the applicant credit union is still the subject of insolvency proceedings.", "46. Article 11 \u00a7 4 provides that expropriation or other forcible limitation of ownership rights is possible only in the public interest and on the basis of law, and against compensation.", "47. Under Article 36 \u00a7 1 anyone may assert his or her rights under a set procedure before an independent and impartial tribunal, and in specified cases before another organ. Under paragraph 2, anybody who claims that his or her rights have been violated by a decision of a public administrative organ may apply to a court for a review of the legality of that decision, unless the law provides otherwise.

In its reasoning the Constitutional Court found these provisions contrary to Article 6 of the Convention as they, inter alia, limited jurisdiction of administrative courts to review administrative acts to issues of legality. It found that that the legislation in question empowered administrative courts to quash merely illegal decisions, not those embodying errors in fact. In other words, as the Constitutional Court put it, deliberation of administrative authorities could not be replaced, according to those provisions, by that of independent courts."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
