He remained in custody pending trial and was repeatedly questioned by the investigator.", "9. On 9 October 2001 the Supreme Court of the Udmurtiya Republic set the trial for 23 October 2001.", "10. On 19 October 2001 the head of the organised crime unit of the regional department of the interior informed the Supreme Court as follows:", "\u201cSince December 2000, [the organised crime unit] has been investigating [S.'s murder] ... Defendants [D]., [M]. and [Gil.] ... pleaded guilty and gave truthful statements. On the basis of those statements and the evidence collected it was possible to establish that a leader of the Izhevsk organised criminal gang [V.] had been involved in S.'s murder, committed in April 1998. V. has been put on the federal wanted list.", "... [The organised crime unit] received information that the organised crime leaders had decided to kill D. after he testified against V. ...

We hereby request that the trial be closed to the public and conducted at correctional colony no. 9 ...", "11. On 22 October 2001 the Supreme Court of the Udmurtiya Republic decided to dispense with the public hearing of the criminal case against the applicant and D., M., Gil. and Gut. The defendants or their lawyers were not present. In particular, the court noted as follows:", "\u201cThe Supreme Court of the Udmurtiya Republic received a letter from the head of the [organised crime unit] concerning the possibility that D. would be assassinated during the trial. D. had earlier testified about V. being involved in the crimes under investigation.", "Having regard to the fact that [(1)] the defendants are charged with particularly serious offences, including involvement in organised crime and [(2)] the court is under obligation to ensure the safety of D. and all parties to the proceedings, the employees of the Supreme Court of the Udmurtiya Republic and other persons, [the court] decides to close the trial and to conduct [it] at remand prison no. 1. Another reason to justify the closure of the trial is the fact that D. is accused of murdering [S.] because the latter had raped [D.'s sister].\u201d", "12. On 23 October 2001 the Supreme Court opened the trial at remand prison No. 1. The applicant was represented by counsel of his own choice.
