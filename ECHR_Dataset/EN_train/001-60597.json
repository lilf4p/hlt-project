At the material time the applicant was employed as a clerk in the \u0130zmir 2nd Court of Taxation. On 18 July 1995 the \u0130zmir Civil Court of General Jurisdiction forwarded the name and workplace of the applicant to the \u0130zmir public prosecutor's office, stating that the applicant was suspected of having stolen and falsified court documents relating to a decided divorce case.", "12. On 25 July 1995 the office of the public prosecutor referred the case to the \u0130zmir Security Directorate.", "13. At 5.10 p.m. on 25 July 1995 the applicant was taken into police custody and detained at the \u0130zmir Security Directorate. He was accused of the above offences. The applicant gave a statement in which he denied that he had been involved in the incident relating to the court's case file. The applicant later claimed that he was not permitted to contact his family or consult a lawyer and that he was insulted and beaten for two hours.", "14. Two other suspects were also detained and statements were taken from them. A statement was also taken from A.B., a party to the divorce proceedings.", "15. On 27 July 1995 an investigation record was drawn up for the applicant and the two other suspects. At 5 p.m. on the same day the applicant was released pursuant to the decision of the public prosecutor. The two other suspects were kept in custody.", "16. In the evening of 27 July 1995, following his release, the applicant went to the \u0130zmir State Hospital. He was subsequently granted four days' sick leave by his employer. The medical report prepared at the hospital referred to the fact that the applicant was suffering from a common skin disease caused by the inflammation of the roots of his facial hair.", "17. On 31 July 1995 the office of the public prosecutor of Kar\u015f\u0131yaka decided not to bring charges against the applicant (takipsizlik karar\u0131) for lack of evidence. The decision was served on the applicant on 19 August 1995.", "18. The public prosecutor took a statement from the applicant on 28 August 1995. In his statement the applicant declared that he had applied to the Ministry of Justice to have proceedings brought against the individual who had reported him to the authorities.", "19. On 29 August 1995 the public prosecutor decided not to bring charges against the person named by the applicant.", "20. On 5 September 1995 the applicant filed a complaint under Law no. 466 with the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka Assize Court (A\u011f\u0131r Ceza Mahkemesi) against the Treasury requesting 200,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL) by way of compensation for his detention between \u201c24 and 27 July 1995\u201d. In the petition, the applicant's lawyer stated, inter alia, that the applicant, while in detention, had been tortured and ill-treated by being beaten and insulted for two hours and deprived of his right to contact his family and a lawyer. As a result of his injuries, the applicant had had to take four days' sick leave. Furthermore, the applicant's reputation had suffered. He did not rely on any specific section of Law no. 466.", "21. On 14 September 1995 the three-judge Kar\u015f\u0131yaka Assize Court appointed one of its members (naip hakim) to investigate the case and draft a report. The judge designated for this purpose verified, inter alia, that the office of the public prosecutor of \u0130zmir had dropped the charges against the applicant. He also obtained information about the applicant's personal, financial and social status. The judge found that the evidence obtained was sufficient to enable him to draft his report and decided in the exercise of his discretion under section 3 of Law no. 466 that it was unnecessary to hear the applicant. The public prosecutor was asked for his written observations on the applicant's claim. On 7 December 1995 the public prosecutor, as required by Law no. 466, submitted his opinion to the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka Assize Court. The public prosecutor noted that the applicant was taken into custody on 25 July 1995, and not on 24 July 1995 as claimed, and was released on 27 July 1995. The public prosecutor recommended that the applicant be granted compensation for non-pecuniary damage in an amount to be assessed by the court. This opinion was not served on the applicant.", "22. The judge stated in his report of 7 December 1995 to the President of the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka Assize Court, inter alia, that the applicant had been detained for two days from 25 July to 27 July 1995 and upon his release had obtained a medical report which indicated that he had been assaulted (darp edildi\u011fi).

He further observed that, at the time when he was taken into custody, the applicant had been working in the \u0130zmir 2nd Court of Taxation, had been paying TRL 3,000,000 in rent, was divorced and had two children. The judge concluded:", "\u201cThe complainant requested that he be granted the sum of TRL 200,000,000 in compensation. In determining the amount of compensation the court should consider both the complainant's economic and social position as well as the intensity of his emotional suffering. In the light of the above facts, I propose that the court grant the amount of compensation requested by the complainant.\u201d", "23. On 7 December 1995 the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka Assize Court found that the applicant had been detained for two days and qualified for compensation. In its judgment, the court took note of all the complaints set out in the petition lodged by the applicant's lawyer as well as the content of the judge's report and the written submissions of the public prosecutor (see paragraphs 21 and 22 above). The court concluded that", "\u201c... at the time he was taken into custody, the applicant had been working in the \u0130zmir Tax Court, had been paying TRL 3,000,000 in rent, and was divorced with two children. The complainant requested that the court award him TRL 200,000,000, including interest, for the non-pecuniary damage suffered. The court considers that, in determining the amount of compensation, it should have regard both to the complainant's economic and social position as well as the intensity of his emotional suffering. In the light of the above facts and having considered the above criteria, the court concludes that the sum of TRL 10,000,000 should be awarded to the complainant\u201d.", "The court also awarded the applicant TRL 1,500,000 for his legal costs.", "24. The applicant's lawyer and the Treasury both appealed against the award. The applicant's lawyer contended on appeal that the amount of compensation was insufficient reparation for his wrongful arrest and detention. He did not challenge the dates of detention as determined by the court. The Treasury considered that the amount awarded was excessive.", "According to the relevant rules governing the functioning of the Court of Cassation in litigation of this nature, the case file at the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka Assize Court was referred to the competent division of the Court of Cassation through the intermediary of the office of the public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation. On 17 October 1996 the Principal Public Prosecutor submitted his opinion on the merits of both parties' appeals. In his written opinion (tebli\u011fname) to the Sixth Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation (Yarg\u0131tay), the Principal Public Prosecutor stated that, having regard to the first-instance proceedings, the evidence collected, the subject matter of the claim and the discretion of the first-instance court, neither of the parties had grounds for appeal.
