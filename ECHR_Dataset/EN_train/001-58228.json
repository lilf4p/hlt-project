The applicant, Mrs Ivanka Nikolova, is a Bulgarian national born in 1943 and residing in Plovdiv.", "9. The applicant used to work as a cashier and accountant in a State-owned enterprise.", "An audit undertaken in the enterprise at the beginning of 1995 revealed a cash deficit of 1,290,059 levs.", "In February 1995 the applicant was given a copy of the final act of the audit, which contained the auditors\u2019 opinion that, inter alia, she had made deliberately false entries in the accounting books and had thus misappropriated funds.", "10. On 15 March 1995 criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant. In the following months the investigator (\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b), Mr S., questioned her in the framework of these proceedings.", "11. On 24 October 1995 the applicant was arrested and charged under Article 203 \u00a7 1 in conjunction with Article 201 of the Criminal Code (\u041d\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d \u043a\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441) with misappropriation of funds in large amounts.", "12. On 24 October 1995 investigator S. heard the applicant in the presence of her lawyer and decided to detain her on remand. On the same day, without having heard the applicant, a prosecutor from the Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office (\u041e\u043a\u0440\u044a\u0436\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430) in Plovdiv confirmed the investigator\u2019s decision to detain her.", "13. On 6 November 1995 the applicant appealed against her detention to the Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office (\u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430). In accordance with the established practice the applicant\u2019s lawyer lodged the appeal with the Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office. He stated that the applicant had not attempted to abscond or to obstruct the investigation during the six months since she had become aware of the criminal charges against her; that she was no longer working as a cashier or accountant and could not, therefore, commit other crimes; and that the applicant had undergone gynaecological surgery and had still not recovered completely.", "14. On 9 November 1995, before transmitting the appeal to the Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, a prosecutor of the Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office confirmed the decision to detain the applicant on remand. The prosecutor found that the applicant was charged with a serious crime punishable by more than ten years\u2019 imprisonment and that \u201ctherefore, the [detention on remand] [was] lawful: it [was] based on the imperative provision of Article 152 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (\u041d\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0443\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d \u043a\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441)\u201d (see paragraph 30 below). The prosecutor further stated that the question whether or not Article 152 \u00a7 2 of the Code should be applied was to be assessed by the investigator and by the supervising prosecutor. In the applicant\u2019s case the investigator and the supervising prosecutor had not applied Article 152 \u00a7 2 of the Code \u201cin view of the current stage of the proceedings\u201d. It followed that the applicant\u2019s detention was lawful.", "15. By decision dated 15 December 1995 and registered on 28 December 1995 the Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office dismissed the applicant\u2019s request for release. A further appeal against her detention on remand was dismissed by the Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office by a letter of 12 January 1996.", "16. On 14 November 1995 the applicant appealed to the Plovdiv Regional Court (\u041e\u043a\u0440\u044a\u0436\u0435\u043d \u0441\u044a\u0434) against her detention on remand. In his written submissions to the Court the applicant\u2019s lawyer stated, inter alia, that the decision to detain the applicant on remand had been based solely on the gravity of the charges against her whereas other important factors had not been taken into account. Thus, the applicant had a permanent address where she lived with her husband and two daughters. Also, the applicant had known about the criminal charges against her for more than six months prior to her arrest but had made no attempt to abscond or obstruct the investigation. Furthermore, the evidence against the applicant was weak, it having been established that six other persons had been in possession of a key to the cashier\u2019s office. The prosecutor had blindly followed the conclusions of the auditors who had pointed to the applicant on the sole ground that she had been the person in charge. However, there was nothing to show that the applicant had been the author of the false entries in the accounting books. The applicant\u2019s lawyer also invoked his client\u2019s medical condition and enclosed medical certificates.", "17. In accordance with the established practice the applicant\u2019s lawyer lodged his appeal and submissions through the Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office.", "18. On 4 December 1995 the Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office transmitted the appeal together with the investigator\u2019s file to the Regional Court. The covering letter, prepared by the prosecutor, stated, inter alia:", "\u201cI consider that the appeal should be dismissed and that the detention on remand should be confirmed as being lawful. The charges concern a serious wilful crime within the meaning of Article 93 \u00a7 7 of the Criminal Code and, [therefore], in accordance with Article 152 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the imposition of detention is obligatory.", "The present case does not fall under Article 152 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure: [it] does not involve a situation where the accused has no possibility of absconding or reoffending, as required by the Supreme Court\u2019s practice [follows a reference to the Supreme Court\u2019s practice \u2013 see paragraph 31 below].\u201d", "19. On 11 December 1995 the court examined the case in camera, without the participation of the parties, and dismissed the appeal. The court stated, inter alia:", "\u201c[The charges against the applicant] concern a serious crime within the meaning of Article 93 \u00a7 7 of the Criminal Code, that is, a crime under Article 203 of the Criminal Code, punishable by ten or more years\u2019 imprisonment. In this respect there exists the requirement, under Article 152 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, that detention on remand shall be imposed.", "... [The medical certificates submitted by the applicant] reflect her state of health during a past period of time. No information concerning her current state of health has been submitted. It follows that currently there exist no circumstances requiring the modification of the measure \u2018detention on remand\u2019 imposed on the [applicant]. Therefore the appeal is ill-founded and must be dismissed.\u201d", "20. On 19 January 1996 the applicant was examined by three medical experts who had been asked by the investigator in her case to establish, inter alia, whether the conditions of detention were dangerous for her health. In a report of the same date the experts found that the problems related to the surgery which she had undergone more than a year ago did not affect her condition, and that she could remain in detention.", "21. On 5 February 1996 the applicant was urgently transferred to hospital due to pain in her gall bladder. On the same day she underwent surgery.", "22. On 15 February 1996 the investigator in the applicant\u2019s case appointed another group of medical experts to examine the applicant. The experts found that the applicant needed a convalescence period which was incompatible with the conditions in detention.", "23. On 19 February 1996 the applicant\u2019s detention on remand was discontinued in view of her health problems by an order of the Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office. The applicant was put under house arrest.", "24. In June 1996 the investigator concluded his work on the case and sent the file to the Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office with a proposal to submit an indictment in court. On an unspecified date the competent prosecutor returned the case to the investigator for further clarifications.", "25. According to the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure and to legal theory and practice, the prosecutor performs a dual function in criminal proceedings.", "During the preliminary stage he supervises the investigation. He is competent, inter alia, to give mandatory instructions to the investigator; to participate in examinations, searches or any other acts of investigation; to withdraw a case from one investigator and assign it to another, or to carry out the entire investigation, or parts of it, himself. He may also decide whether or not to terminate the proceedings, order additional investigations, or prepare an indictment and submit the case to court.", "At the judicial stage he is entrusted with the task of prosecuting the accused.", "26. The investigator has a certain independence from the prosecutor in respect of his working methods and particular acts of investigation, but performs his functions under the latter\u2019s instructions and supervision (Articles 48 \u00a7 2 and 201 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). If an investigator objects to the prosecutor\u2019s instructions, he may apply to the higher prosecutor, whose decision is final and binding.", "27. Under Article 86 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the prosecutor and the investigator are under an obligation to collect both incriminating and exonerating evidence. Throughout criminal proceedings, the prosecutor must \u201ceffect a supervisory control of lawfulness\u201d (Article 43 of the Code).", "28. An accused can be detained on remand by decision of an investigator or prosecutor. In cases where the decision to detain has been taken by an investigator without the prior consent of a prosecutor, it must be approved by a prosecutor within twenty-four hours. The prosecutor usually makes this decision on the basis of the file, without hearing the accused (Code of Criminal Procedure, Articles 152, 172, 201-03 and 377-78).", "29. There is no legal obstacle preventing the prosecutor who has taken the decision to detain an accused on remand, or who has approved an investigator\u2019s decision, from acting for the prosecution against the accused in any subsequent criminal proceedings. In practice this frequently occurs.", "The Supreme Court has found that a former investigator who was appointed prosecutor may represent the prosecution at the trial of the same accused person on whose case he had been working as an investigator. As both the investigator and the prosecutor performed investigative functions there was no legal obstacle (\u0440\u0435\u0448. \u043e\u0442 9.5.1995 \u043f\u043e \u043d.\u0434.
