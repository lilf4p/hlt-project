SLOVENIA", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Corneliu B\u00eersan;David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson", "TEXT": ["1. The applicant, Mr Branko \u017duni\u010d, is a Slovenian national who was born in 1953 and lives in Dolenja Vas. He was represented before the Court by Mr B. Verstov\u0161ek, a lawyer practising in Celje.", "2. y be summarised as follows.", "3. On 12 May 1997 the applicant was injured in an accident at work. The applicant\u2019s employer had taken out insurance with the insurance company ZT.", "4. On 28 March 2000 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against ZT in the Celje District Court (Okro\u017eno sodi\u0161\u010de v Celju) seeking damages in the amount of 9,970,530 Slovenian tolars (approximately 41,550 euros (EUR)) for the injuries sustained.", "5. Between 14 September 2000 and 29 May 2007 the applicant lodged six preliminary written submissions and adduced evidence.", "6. Between 22 June 2004 and 26 August 2005 he made four requests that a date be set for a hearing.", "7. During the proceedings the court appointed a medical expert. On 23 May 2005 the court sought an additional opinion from the appointed expert.", "8. On ZT\u2019s objection the court, on 6 September 2005, declared lack of jurisdiction to consider the case and ordered that it be heard before the Novo Mesto District Court (Okro\u017eno sodi\u0161\u010de v Novem mestu). The applicant appealed against that decision on 9 September 2005. On 23 November 2005 the Celje Higher Court (Vi\u0161je sodi\u0161\u010de v Celju) allowed the applicant\u2019s appeal and rejected the defendant\u2019s objection as to the lack of jurisdiction.", "9. On 17 April 2007 the first hearing to be held in the case was adjourned until 18 May 2007 since ZT needed time to prepare pleadings in reply to those of the applicant.", "10. On 18 May 2007 the court held a hearing on the merits of the case.", "11. The proceedings are currently pending before the Celje District Court.", "12. On 23 February 2007 the applicant lodged a supervisory appeal with the Celje District Court under section 5 of the 2006 Act complaining that the civil proceedings had been pending since 28 March 2000. He further argued that the proceedings were not of particular complexity and that there were no reasons for such a delay. It would appear that the applicant\u2019s legal representatives have lodged supervisory appeals in 650 cases pending before the same court.", "13. On 15 March 2007 the President of the Celje District Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s supervisory appeal as ill-founded. He relied on the fact that the applicant\u2019s case had not been granted priority; that the judge C.K., to whom the applicant\u2019s case had been assigned on 1 March 2007, had to deal with 264 other cases, some of them much older than the applicant\u2019s; that the order of precedence had to be respected; and that the delays in the present case had resulted from systemic problems and were not the fault of the judge. The President of the Celje District Court therefore deemed it impossible to order any of the measures stipulated in the 2006 Act. Referring to section 6, paragraph 7, the President noted that since other judges were likewise overburdened, it would not be sensible to assign the case to another judge. Moreover, seven new judicial posts had been created at the court as a result of the Lukenda Project (see paragraph 16 below), three of which had been filled, and the rest of which were in the process of being filled. According to him, this would, reduce delays in the future.", "14. On 30 March 2007 the applicant lodged a motion for a deadline under section 8 of the 2006 Act. He relied on substantially the same reasons as in his supervisory appeal and requested that the case be decided in one month\u2019s time.", "15. On 25 April 2007 the President of the Celje Higher Court, in agreement with the first-instance decision, dismissed the motion for a deadline, finding that the applicant had simply reiterated the general complaints contained in his supervisory appeal and had, in respect of the requirements stipulated in section 5 paragraph 2 (5), only indicated the date of the beginning of the proceedings.", "16. Following the judgment in Lukenda v. Slovenia (no. 23032/02, 6 October 2005), and decision no. U-I-65/05 of the Constitutional Court (22 September 2005), both binding the Slovenian State to establish conditions in which the right to a trial without undue delay must be afforded, the Slovenian Government adopted on 12 December 2005 a Joint State Project on the Elimination of Court Backlogs, the so-called Lukenda Project. Its goal is the elimination of backlogs in Slovenian courts and prosecutor\u2019s offices by the end of 2010, by providing for structural and managerial reform of the judiciary.", "17. The Act on the Protection of the Right to a Trial without undue Delay (Zakon o varstvu pravice do sojenja brez nepotrebnega odla\u0161anja, Official Journal, No. 49/2006- \u201cthe 2006 Act\u201d), as a part of the Lukenda Project, has been implemented since 1 January 2007.", "18. Section 3 of the 2006 Act provides for two remedies to expedite pending proceedings - a supervisory appeal (nadzorstvena prito\u017eba) and a motion for a deadline (rokovni predlog) - and, ultimately, for a claim for just satisfaction in respect of damage sustained because of the undue delay (zahteva za pravi\u010dno zado\u0161\u010denje).", "19.

The report shall include the declaration in respect of criteria referred to in section 4 of this Act and the opinion on the time-limit within which the case may be resolved.

He may also propose that an additional judge be assigned to the court or order other measures in accordance with the statute governing the judicial service.", "...\u201d", "21. Sections 8 and 11 define the motion for a deadline and provide for measures that may be applied by the court dealing with the motion. They read, in so far as relevant, as follows:", "\u201c(1) If, under section 6(1) or (5) of this Act, the president of the court dismisses the supervisory appeal ..., the party may lodge a motion for a deadline under section 5(1) of this Act with the court hearing the case.", "...", "(3) The party may lodge the motion for a deadline within fifteen days after receiving the ruling or after the time-limits provided for in paragraph 1 of this section.\u201d", "\u201c(1) If the motion for a deadline is manifestly unfounded, having regard to the timetable for the resolution of the case and the actions of the party, the president of the court shall dismiss it by a ruling.", "...\u201d", "(3) If the president of the court establishes that in view of the criteria referred to in section 4 of this Act the court is not unduly protracting the decision-making in the case, he shall dismiss the motion for a deadline by a ruling.", "(4) If the president of the court establishes that, in view of the criteria referred to in section 4 of this Act, the court is unduly protracting the decision-making in the case, he shall order, by a ruling, that the appropriate procedural acts be performed by the judge and shall also set the time-frame for their performance, which may not be less than fifteen days and not longer than four months, as well as set the appropriate deadline for the judge to report on the acts performed.", "(5) The president of the court shall decide on the motion for a deadline within fifteen days after receiving it.\u201d", "22. Section 7 provides for the limitations concerning filing of a new supervisory appeal or a motion for a deadline.", "\u201c(1) If the president of the court acts in compliance with Article 6, paragraphs 4 or 6 of this Act, the party may not file a new supervisory appeal nor a motion for a deadline concerning the same case before the expiry of deadlines set in the notification or ruling of the president of the court.
