The applicant was born in 1983 and lives in Moscow.", "6. The applicant is a member of the National Bolsheviks Party.", "7. On 14 December 2004 a group of about forty members of the National Bolsheviks Party occupied the waiting area of the President\u2019s administration building in Moscow and locked themselves in an office on the ground floor.", "8. The members of the group asked for a meeting with the President, the deputy head of the President\u2019s administration and the President\u2019s economic adviser. They handed out leaflets through the windows, featuring a printed letter to the President which listed ten ways in which he had failed to comply with the Constitution and which called for his resignation.", "9. The intruders stayed in the office for an hour and a half until the police broke down the locked door and arrested them. They did not offer any resistance to the authorities.", "10. On 16 December 2004 the Khamovnicheskiy District Court of Moscow ordered the applicant\u2019s detention on the following grounds:", "\u201c[The applicant] is suspected of having committed several offences, one of which is particularly grievous. If at liberty, he may continue his criminal activities, interfere with the investigation or put pressure on witnesses. He might abscond or prevent the investigation of the truth.\u201d", "11. On 21 December 2004 the applicant was charged with the attempted violent overthrow of State power (Article 278 of the Criminal Code) and the intentional destruction and degradation of others\u2019 property in public places (Articles 167 \u00a7 2 and 214).", "12. On 7 February 2005, referring to the gravity of the charges against the applicant, the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow extended the applicant\u2019s detention until 14 April 2005.", "13.

On 14 April 2005 the District Court granted the prosecution\u2019s request for an extension of the applicant\u2019s detention until 14 July 2005, for the following reasons:", "\u201c... the defendants and their counsel have started to study the case file. Given the file size (12 volumes) and the number of persons studying it (39 defendants and their counsel), the court considers that there are sufficient reasons to extend [the applicant\u2019s] detention for three months, because he has not yet finished studying the case file while his counsel has not yet started.", "Notwithstanding the fact that [the applicant] has a registered place of residence in Moscow, the court, taking into account the gravity of charges and the fact that the grounds justifying his placement into custody still persist today, sees no reason to apply a more lenient preventive measure.\u201d", "15. On 19 May 2005 the Moscow City Court upheld the decision of 14 April 2005 on appeal, finding that it had been lawful, sufficiently reasoned and justified.", "16.

On 30 June 2005 the District Court held a preliminary hearing. It rejected the defendants\u2019 requests for release taking into account their characters, age, state of health, family situation and stability of lifestyle. However, it found, referring to the gravity of the charges, that \u201cthe grounds on which the preventive measure [had been] previously imposed, still exist[ed]\u201d and that \u201cthe case file gave sufficient reasons to believe that, once released, the defendants would flee or interfere with the trial\u201d. It therefore ordered that all the defendants should remain in custody pending trial.", "18. On an unspecified date in July 2005 the applicant and his codefendants lodged applications for release. The District Court rejected these requests on 27 July 2005, finding that their detention was lawful and justified. On 5 October 2005 the City Court upheld the decision of 27 July 2005 on appeal.", "19. On 10 August 2005 the applicant and his co-defendants lodged new applications for release. On the same day the District Court rejected the requests. It held:", "\u201cThe court takes into account the defence\u2019s argument that an individual approach to each defendant\u2019s situation is essential when deciding on the preventive measure.", "Examining the grounds on which ... the court ordered and extended the detention period in respect of all the defendants without exception ... the court notes that these grounds still persist today. Therefore, having regard to the state of health, family situation, age, profession and character of all the defendants, and to the personal guarantees offered on their behalf by certain private individuals and included in the case file, the court concludes that, if released, each of the applicants might abscond or obstruct the course of justice in some other way ...", "In the court\u2019s view, in these circumstances, having regard to the gravity of the charges, there are no grounds for varying or revoking the preventive measure in respect of any defendant ...\u201d", "20.

On 8 December 2005 the District Court found the applicant and his co-defendants guilty of participation in mass disorder. It gave the applicant a three-year suspended sentence and then released the applicant on three years\u2019 probation.", "23. The applicant was held in remand prison no. IZ-77/3 in Moscow from 24 December 2004 to 8 December 2005. According to his submission, he was detained in a cell together with eleven other inmates. The cell was overcrowded.
