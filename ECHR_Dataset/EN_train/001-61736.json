By a decision of 11 April 1995 the Bia\u0142ystok Regional Prosecutor preferred charges against the applicant. It was stated that the suspicion against him was rendered credible by evidence gathered in the investigations. The prosecutor referred in particular to documents concerning the circumstances in which the applicant had taken the loan, to the manner in which the funds had been transferred to the applicant's bank account, and to the links established between the suspects in the case.", "13.

The court considered that the case was complex, that there were many suspects, and that the offences concerned were of a very serious nature.", "16. On 28 April 1995 the Bia\u0142ystok Regional Prosecutor refused the applicant's application for release of 25 April 1995. On 18 May 1995 the Bia\u0142ystok Appellate Prosecutor upheld this decision, considering that a medical certificate confirmed that the applicant was suffering from Marfan syndrome which was a connective tissue disorder, so affected many structures, including the skeleton, lungs, eyes, heart and blood vessels.

An identical decision was given on 15 September 1995 in respect of his fresh request for release, the prosecuting authorities considering that the evidence gathered so far in the proceedings supported the charges against the applicant, and that there were genuine grounds for believing that, if released, he would exert pressure on the witnesses.", "24. On 18 September 1995 the applicant's detention was prolonged until 29 November 1995, the Warsaw Regional Court considering that further measures had to be taken in order to complete the evidence gathered so far during the investigations.

On the same date the prosecutor ordered that the applicant be given access to documents that he had requested on 15 December.", "33.

The refusal to release the applicant, given on 25 January 1996, was upheld by the Warsaw Appellate Court on 13 February 1996, which considered that the applicant's appeal had failed to advance any arguments capable of casting doubt on the lawfulness of the decision under appeal.", "39.
