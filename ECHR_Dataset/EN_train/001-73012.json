MOLDOVA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 3;Violation of Art. 13;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["8. The applicant was born in 1981 and lives in C\u0103rpineni, Moldova.", "9. On 9 July 1998 the applicant, who was seventeen years old, was arrested on charges of theft. On the way to the police car he made an attempt to throw away a pocket-knife. After being alerted by a passer-by, the police officers A. Tulbu and V. Dubceac threw the applicant to the ground. According to the applicant, they also punched him in the face and handcuffed him. They also allegedly assaulted him all the way to the police station.", "10. At the police station the police officers allegedly continued beating the applicant during questioning. They kicked him, punched him and beat him with batons all over his body and on the soles of his feet in order to obtain a confession. During the beatings he was handcuffed. He was also allegedly suspended on a metal bar for a long period of time. The Government deny these allegations.", "11. On 10 July 1998 the applicant claims to have been taken by the arresting police officers to a forest for the reconstruction of the crime. He was allegedly beaten up on the way to the forest. In the forest, one of the officers allegedly put a gun to the applicant\u2019s head and threatened to shoot him if he did not confess. He was released from detention in the evening. It appears from the documents submitted by the parties that the applicant confessed to having committed the theft. However, later the criminal proceedings against him were discontinued on grounds of lack of \u201cconstitutive elements\u201d of an offence.", "12. According to the Government, the applicant could not have been threatened with a gun by the police officers because they did not accompany him to the woods. He was taken to the woods for investigation purposes, but not for a reconstruction of the crime.", "13. On 11 July 1998, the applicant\u2019s state of health worsened and his mother took him to a doctor who established that he had suffered a head trauma and cerebral post-concussion syndrome.", "14. On 13 July 1998 a forensic doctor examined the applicant and established that he had grey-yellowish bruises of 3 x 2 cm and of 6 x 5 cm around his right eye, right ear, lips and on the sole of his left foot. The soft tissue on his head and his teeth on the right side were painful when touched. The doctor concluded that the injuries could have been inflicted by blows with a blunt object, possibly in the conditions described by the applicant, and corresponded to the category of light corporal injuries.", "15. On 13 July 1998 the applicant\u2019s mother lodged a criminal complaint with the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of H\u00e2nce\u015fti County, asking it to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers who had allegedly ill-treated her son and threatened him with death.", "16. On 14 July 1998 an ear, nose and throat specialist examined the applicant and concluded that he was suffering from hyperaemia and had a central perforation of the right tympanic membrane.", "17. On 28 July 1998 another specialist concluded that the applicant was suffering from post-traumatic acute otitis media on the right side and agnogenic otitis on the left side with perceptive deafness.", "18. Between 14 and 25 July, 30 July and 22 August, 2 and 17 September and 14 October and 3 November 1998, the applicant was hospitalised with the diagnosis of head trauma and sudden deafness (surditate de percep\u0163ie brusc instalat\u0103).", "19. On 3 August 1998 the applicant\u2019s mother was informed by the H\u00e2nce\u015fti Prosecutor\u2019s Office that her complaint had been dismissed on grounds of lack of \u201cconstitutive elements\u201d of an offence. She appealed against that decision to a hierarchically superior prosecutor.", "20. On 21 August 1998 the applicant\u2019s mother received a letter from a hierarchically superior prosecutor of the H\u00e2nce\u015fti Prosecutor\u2019s Office informing her that her appeal had been dismissed. She appealed against that decision to the H\u00e2nce\u015fti District Court.", "21. On 16 November 1998 the H\u00e2nce\u015fti District Court quashed the prosecutor\u2019s decision to dismiss the applicant\u2019s complaint about ill-treatment and ordered that an additional investigation be carried out. It found inter alia that it was undisputed that the applicant had sustained his injuries on 9 July 1998 either at the police station or on the way there; however, the circumstances were not clear. The court also found that the H\u00e2nce\u015fti Prosecutor\u2019s Office had not paid sufficient attention to the fact that since 9 July 1998 the applicant had been permanently undergoing medical treatment in hospital and had thus been prevented from attending school.", "22. On 15 January 1999 the H\u00e2nce\u015fti Prosecutor\u2019s Office issued a new decision by which it again refused to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers who had allegedly ill-treated the applicant. In the decision it was stated inter alia that the injuries sustained by the applicant had been caused by his fall on 9 July 1998, when the police officers had to throw him to the ground in order to counter his attack with a knife on one of them. The decision relied on a medical report dated 14 January 1999 which stated that the injuries could have been inflicted either by a blunt object or by a fall. The applicant\u2019s mother appealed to the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office.", "23. On 25 February 1999 the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office quashed the decision of 15 January 1999 for being \u201cpremature\u201d and the file was remitted to the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of H\u00e2nce\u015fti County for \u201cadditional review\u201d. The Prosecutor\u2019s Office considered inter alia that the investigation had failed to elucidate the circumstances of the alleged attack with a knife committed by the applicant on one of the police officers.", "24. On 15 March 1999 the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of H\u00e2nce\u015fti County issued a new decision by which it refused to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers on the ground that their actions did not disclose any signs of an offence.", "25. On 25 March 1999 the hierarchically superior prosecutor quashed the decision of 15 March 1999 on the ground that the applicant\u2019s alleged attack with a knife on the police officers had not been properly investigated.", "26. On 9 April 1999 the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of H\u00e2nce\u015fti County issued a new decision by which it again refused to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers, because their actions were justified. At the same time the Prosecutor\u2019s Office found that the applicant did not attack the police officers with a knife, but rather the police officers thought that there was a risk of his attacking them. The applicant\u2019s mother appealed to the hierarchically superior prosecutor.", "27. On 1 May 1999 the hierarchically superior prosecutor quashed the decision of 9 April 1999 and ordered the institution of criminal proceedings against the two police officers.", "28. On an unspecified date, the applicant lodged a complaint with the Ministry of Internal Affairs.", "29. On 14 June 1999 the Ministry of Internal Affairs informed the applicant that disciplinary sanctions would be imposed on police officers A. Tulbu and V. Dubceac only to the extent that they were found guilty in the criminal proceedings.", "30. On 20 September 1999 the H\u00e2nce\u015fti Prosecutor\u2019s Office issued a decision dismissing the criminal investigation. The decision found inter alia that the applicant had had a knife in his hand but that he had not tried to attack the police officers with it. The applicant\u2019s mother appealed against the decision.", "31. On 18 November 1999 the hierarchically superior prosecutor of the L\u0103pu\u015fna Prosecutor\u2019s Office dismissed the appeal. In the decision it was stated inter alia that the injuries sustained by the applicant had been caused by his fall on 9 July 1998, when the applicant had made an attempt to throw away a knife but the police officers had thought that he was going to use it against them and had thrown him to the ground. The applicant\u2019s state of health was \u201cnormal\u201d and none of the witnesses had seen the police beating him. The applicant\u2019s mother appealed.", "32. On 10 February 2000 the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office upheld the applicant\u2019s appeal and ordered the re-opening of the criminal investigation. It stated inter alia that the investigation had been conducted \u201cin an extremely superficial manner\u201d. It instructed the investigators inter alia to re-hear the witnesses and the parties to the case and to investigate whether the police officers A. Tulbu and V. Dubceac had fired a gun in the woods. It also ordered the conduct of a medical investigation of the applicant and pointed to several contradictory statements of the witnesses and to procedural irregularities.", "33. On 28 February 2000, at the request of investigator V.B. from the H\u00e2nce\u015fti Prosecutor\u2019s Office, an independent medical commission of four experienced forensic doctors performed a thorough medical investigation. On the basis of earlier medical certificates and of its own investigation the commission drafted a report which stated inter alia that:", "\u201cAt the forensic examination it was found that [the applicant] had bruises around his right eye, right ear, on his lips and on the sole of his left foot.", "From [the applicant]\u2019s records it appears that at the age of eight months... he suffered purulent otitis in his left ear.", "On 11 July 1998 a neurologist found that [the applicant] had suffered an acute head trauma with cerebrostenic syndrome.", "On 14 July 1998 an ear, nose and throat specialist found that [the applicant] had suffered from tympanic hyperaemia and had a central perforation of the right tympanic membrane as a result of a barotrauma [an injury caused by rapid and extreme changes in pressure] of 9 July 1998.", "On 14 July 1998, [the applicant] did not appear to have any injury to his teeth.", "On 28 July 1998 an ear, nose and throat specialist found that [the applicant] had suffered post-traumatic acute otitis media on the right side and agnogenic otitis on the left side. He suffered from sudden deafness (surditate de percep\u0163ie brusc instalat\u0103).", "On 9 October 1998 a neurologist found that as a consequence of the head trauma [the applicant] was suffering intracranial hypertension with signs of epilepsy.", "On 20 April 2000 [the applicant] was examined by an otolaryngologist who found that he was suffering from post-traumatic bilateral hypoacusis [slightly diminished auditory sensitivity, with hearing threshold levels above normal]. Hospitalisation was recommended.", "...", "1. On the basis of the above, the commission comes to the conclusion that M. Corsacov suffered injuries in the form of bruises on his face (right eye, right ear and lips) and the sole of his left foot; head trauma and concussion; post-traumatic acute otitis media on the right side and agnogenic otitis on the left side with bilateral hypoacusis.", "... The applicant\u2019s injuries necessitated medical treatment of a long duration and could be qualified as moderately serious (mai pu\u0163in grave).", "...", "3. The commission does not have any objective grounds to believe that the injuries could have been sustained by the applicant prior to 9 July 1998.", "4. The injuries were inflicted by blows with blunt objects (aceste leziuni au fost cauzate prin ac\u0163iunea corpurilor contondente (lovire)), possibly in the circumstances described by the applicant and they could not have been sustained as a result of a fall (n-au putut fi produse prin c\u0103dere).", "5. ...Currently Mr Corsacov\u2019s state of health is relatively satisfactory and he suffers of posttraumatic bilateral hypoacusis...\u201d", "34. On 10 June 2000 the L\u0103pu\u015fna Prosecutor\u2019s Office issued a decision dismissing the criminal investigation. The decision found inter alia that the applicant had had a knife in his hand but that he had not tried to attack the police officers with it. The applicant\u2019s mother appealed against the decision.", "35. On 12 July 2000 the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office quashed the decision of 10 June 2000 and ordered that an additional investigation be carried out. It found inter alia that the quashed decision was illegal and had a tendentious character. It stated inter alia:", "\u201cContrary to the conclusion of the medical commission, which clearly found that Corsacov\u2019s injuries were inflicted by blows with a blunt object, possibly in the circumstances described by the applicant and that they could not have been sustained as a result of a fall, investigator V.B. indicated in his decision that the injuries were caused by the applicant\u2019s fall...\u201d", "36. On 30 August 2000 the L\u0103pu\u015fna Prosecutor\u2019s Office issued a decision by which it dismissed the criminal investigation against the applicant for the alleged attack with a knife on the police officers on 9 July 1998. It found that there were no grounds to believe that the applicant intended to use the knife against the police officers.", "37. On 31 August 2000 the L\u0103pu\u015fna Prosecutor\u2019s Office issued a decision by which the criminal proceedings against the police officers were also dismissed. It stated inter alia that the applicant had had a knife in his hand and that the police officers had interpreted that as a threat and had thrown him to the ground. Accordingly, the applicant had sustained his injuries by hitting the ground with his head while the police officers had been acting in legitimate defence. The applicant appealed against this decision.", "38. On 21 January 2001 the decision of 26 August 2000 was quashed by the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office and the criminal proceedings were re-opened.", "39. On 28 February 2001 the L\u0103pu\u015fna Prosecutor\u2019s Office again dismissed the criminal investigation against the police officers. The applicant appealed.", "40. On 20 March 2001 the hierarchically superior prosecutor from the L\u0103pu\u015fna Prosecutor\u2019s Office quashed the decision of 28 February 2001 and ordered the re-opening of the investigation.", "41. On 20 June 2001 the L\u0103pu\u015fna Prosecutor\u2019s Office issued a decision by which it dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint. It stated inter alia that:", "\u201c... According to the medical certificate of 15 January 1998, Corsacov had bruises around his right eye, right ear, and consequences of a barotrauma, head trauma, which could have been caused by a fall and which fell in the category of light corporal injuries.", "According to the conclusion of the Commission [the medical report of 28 February 2000], Corsacov\u2019s teeth were not injured and it was discovered that he was suffering from post-traumatic acute otitis media on the right side and agnogenic otitis on the left side with bilateral hypoacusis, which could also have been caused by blows.", "It is not disputed that the applicant was injured; however, his injuries were inflicted within the limits of the law. As to the agnogenic otitis on the left side, the applicant was suspected of having suffered from it since his childhood... According to doctor A.M., the agnogenic otitis on the left side is not connected with the otitis on the right side and could have been caused by a cold or an infection but not by a blow.", "Deafness can have a multitude of causes, and in order to know its origin it is important to determine the moment of its appearance. In the present case it is impossible to establish the exact moment of commencement of the applicant\u2019s deafness; more so since, in his first declaration, Corsacov stated that only after receiving the blows did he start to experience ringing in his right ear, but he did not say anything about the pain and the deafness in his left ear.", "The police officers [A. Tulbu and V. Dubceac] and the witness C. stated that on 9 July 1998, on the way to the police station, no physical force was used against the applicant except when he was relieved of a knife that he had in his hand. Then, by means of a special technique, the applicant was thrown to the ground, which he hit with his head...", "Corsacov admitted having had a knife and explained that he had been trying to throw it away in order to avoid trouble at the police station.", "The police officers M.I and D.I. who were present at the police station on 9 July 1998 stated that nobody used physical force against the applicant in their presence, no handcuffs were used and that he was not beaten with a baton...", "The applicant\u2019s mother stated that in the evening of 9 July 1998 she saw her son at the police station and he did not have any injuries... The applicant\u2019s uncle B.V. also stated that he had seen the applicant in the police station on 10 July 1998 between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. and that he did not have any sign of injury... and the applicant did not complain to him about having been assaulted.", "...", "The injuries sustained by Corsacov were caused by his hitting the ground with his head when police officers A. Tulbu and V. Dubceac faced a real threat of injury. The officers acted within the limits of Articles 14 and 15 of the Law on Police while relieving him of his knife.\u201d", "42. The decision did not include any reference to the applicant\u2019s allegation that on 10 July 1998 he was taken to the woods and threatened with death. The applicant appealed.", "43. After 20 June 2001 the investigation was re-opened and closed on several occasions. The final decision closing the investigation was that of 10 January 2002 of the L\u0103pu\u015fna Prosecutor\u2019s Office.", "44. After the case was declared admissible by the Court, on 7 November 2005, the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office ordered the re-opening of the investigation. The re-opened investigation is still pending. According to the Government the re-opening was prompted by the Prosecutor General\u2019s concern that the injuries sustained by the applicant in July 1998 had deteriorated into invalidity of the second degree which under Moldovan law is equivalent to a loss of working capacity of 50-75%, and that the applicant needed permanent medical treatment.", "45.
