He stated that the long-term development of the health of Mr Br\u00e1zda justified the other two experts\u2019 conclusion that he could not understand the purpose of the criminal proceedings against him.", "In a note of 24 January 2001 included in the case file the judge stated that, in view of the experts\u2019 conclusions, the decision to stay the proceedings was still justified.", "According to the explanation submitted by the President of the Regional Court in 2001, the criminal proceedings against Mr Br\u00e1zda could not be discontinued as his mental disorder had begun after the offences in question had been committed. The note further stated that the Regional Court would examine the validity of the reasons for staying the proceedings at sixmonth intervals.", "On 26 February 2001 the case file was submitted to the Ministry of Justice, which was to examine whether the case was covered by the presidential pardon of 14 December 2000.", "Article 48 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution provides, inter alia, that every person has the right to have his or her case tried without unjustified delay.", "Pursuant to Article 130 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution, as in force until 30 June 2001, the Constitutional Court could commence proceedings upon a petition (podnet) presented by any individual or a corporation claiming that their rights had been violated.", "As from 1 January 2002, the Constitution has been amended in that, inter alia, individuals and legal persons can complain about a violation of their fundamental rights and freedoms under Article 127, the relevant part of which provides:", "\u201c1. The Constitutional Court shall decide on complaints lodged by natural or legal persons alleging a violation of their fundamental rights or freedoms or of human rights and fundamental freedoms enshrined in international treaties ratified by the Slovak Republic ... unless the protection of such rights and freedoms falls within the jurisdiction of a different court.", "2. When the Constitutional Court finds that a complaint is justified, it shall deliver a decision stating that a person\u2019s rights or freedoms set out in paragraph 1 were violated as a result of a final decision, by a particular measure or by means of other interference. It shall quash such a decision, measure or other interference. When the violation found is the result of a failure to act, the Constitutional Court may order [the authority] which violated the rights or freedoms in question to take the necessary action. At the same time the Constitutional Court may return the case to the authority concerned for further proceedings, order the authority concerned to abstain from violating fundamental rights and freedoms ... or, where appropriate, order those who violated the rights or freedoms set out in paragraph 1 to restore the situation existing prior to the violation.", "3. In its decision on a complaint the Constitutional Court may grant adequate financial satisfaction to the person whose rights under paragraph 1 were violated.\u201d ...", "The implementation of the above constitutional provisions is set out in more detail in sections 49 to 56 of Law no. 38/1993 (the Constitutional Court Act), as amended. The relevant amendments entered into force on 20 March 2002 and provide the following.", "Pursuant to section 50(3), a person claiming adequate financial compensation must specify the amount and explain the reasons for such a claim.", "Section 56(3) provides that, when a violation of fundamental rights or freedoms is found, the Constitutional Court may order the authority liable for the violation to proceed in accordance with the relevant rules. It may also return the case to the authority concerned for further proceedings, prohibit the continuation of the violation or, as the case may be, order the restoration of the situation existing prior to the violation.", "Under section 56(4), the Constitutional Court may grant adequate financial compensation for non-pecuniary damage to a person whose rights or freedoms were violated.", "Section 56(5) provides that the authority which violated a person\u2019s rights is in such a case obliged to pay the compensation within two months after the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision has become final.", "According to its case-law under former Article 130 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution, as in force until 30 June 2001, the Constitutional Court lacked jurisdiction to draw legal consequences from a violation of a petitioner\u2019s rights under Article 48 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution. It could neither grant damages to the person concerned nor impose a sanction on the public authority liable for the violation found. In the Constitutional Court\u2019s view, it was therefore for the authority concerned to provide redress to the person whose rights were violated.", "On 30 May 2002 the Constitutional Court delivered decision No. III. \u00daS 17/02-35 in which it found, upon a complaint under Article 127 of the Constitution, a violation of Article 48 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution and of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as a result of undue delays in proceedings concerning the plaintiff\u2019s action for recovery of property filed with the general court on 24 February 1999.", "The Constitutional Court\u2019s decision stated that the firstinstance court dealing with the case had remained inactive for a total period of fourteen months and that the property claimed by the plaintiff was necessary for the every day life of the latter and of her children.", "The plaintiff had claimed 25,000 Slovakian korunas", "In its decision of 10 July 2002 in a case registered as No. I. \u00daS 15/02 the Constitutional Court found a violation of the plaintiffs\u2019 rights under Article 48 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution. At the moment of the delivery of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision the civil proceedings complained of had been pending for more than six years at first instance. The Constitutional Court examined their length in the light of the criteria established by its case-law, namely the complexity of the matter and the conduct of the parties. It established delays in the proceedings imputable to the court dealing with the case, the total length of which amounted to twenty-two months.", "In view of this finding, the Constitutional Court ordered the general court concerned to proceed with the case without further delays. The Constitutional Court granted in full the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for SKK 20,000 each in compensation for non-pecuniary damage, and pointed out that the general court in question was obliged to pay those sums within two months after the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision had become final. The decision expressly stated that, when deciding on the above claim, the Constitutional Court had also considered the relevant case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. Reference was made to the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Zander v. Sweden (25 November 1993, Series A no. 279-B).", "The Constitutional Court has subsequently delivered several other decisions to the same effect.", "According to an explanatory letter of 6 June 2002 by the President of the Constitutional Court, nothing prevents the Constitutional Court from dealing with complaints about the length of proceedings in cases in which proceedings have also been instituted before the European Court of Human Rights provided that the domestic proceedings complained of are still pending at the moment when the constitutional complaint is filed.", "The letter further states that the Constitutional Court can also examine complaints about delays in proceedings in cases in which it has earlier found a violation of Article 48 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution. In such cases, the Constitutional Court would only consider the period after the delivery of its first decision. However, it would take into account the fact that a violation of Article 48 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution had earlier been found in the proceedings under consideration."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
