POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4", "TEXT": ["The applicant, Mr Grzegorz Olszewski, is a Polish national, who was born in 1958 and lives in Lucie\u0144, Poland. He was represented before the Court by Mr Piotr Sendecki, a lawyer practising in Lublin, Poland. The respondent Government were represented by their Agent, Mr Krzysztof Drzewicki.", "The following account of facts is based on the applicant\u2019s submissions made to the Court and the Polish prosecution service.", "On 29 September 1998 the applicant got involved in a domestic dispute between his wife and stepdaughter. No violence was used during the dispute. Subsequently, the applicant\u2019s stepdaughter called the police. When the police officers arrived they woke up the applicant and informed him that he would be taken to a sobering-up centre (izba wytrze\u017awie\u0144). Although the applicant had drunk wine before the dispute started, he was sober when the police officers arrived. He therefore told the officers that he was not drunk and refused to follow them to the sobering-up centre. The police officers pushed the applicant on the floor and handcuffed him. The applicant and the police officers started to swear at each other.", "The applicant was placed in a police car. He quarrelled with the officers and they continued to swear at each other. The police car stopped. The police officers kicked the applicant three or four times in his abdomen. Subsequently, the police car was driven to Gostynin where it was parked for a while near the District Police Station (Komenda Rejonowa Policji). The applicant stayed inside the car.", "He was then being taken to the sobering-up centre in P\u0142ock. The applicant and the police officers continued to exchange insults. The applicant asked the police officers to take his handcuffs off because they were too tight and his hands were swollen but his request was ignored. His request to be let out to relieve himself was also ignored. When the car arrived at the sobering-up centre the police officers left it. The applicant urinated in his underwear. When the police officers came back and saw that he had wetted himself, they said \u201cthey will see pissed scum.\u201d", "Subsequently, the applicant was dragged by the police officers inside the building. While being pulled, he lost his shoes and trousers, which he had lowered before he had urinated. The police officers laughed at the applicant.", "Once inside the premises of the P\u0142ock sobering-up centre, the applicant asked for a doctor but his request was ignored. The applicant was given a breathalyser test. During the test an employee of the centre started to insult him and the applicant replied in offensive language. One of the police officers hit the applicant with a fist in the right part of the face. The blow made the applicant\u2019s teeth loose.", "The applicant was then knocked down. He tried to stand up but was hit with an opened hand. The applicant fell down again. While he was lying on his back, an employee of the centre said \u201cwe do not like roughnecks here\u201d and stepped on his testicles with a heavy boot.", "Subsequently, the applicant was taken to a cell where the employees of the centre started to put a straightjacket on him. At this point, the police officers were not present on the scene. While a straightjacket was being put on the applicant, a struggle evolved. The applicant heard somebody saying: \u201cbeat so that marks do not show\u201d. He was hit with a knee in his abdomen. He was also hit in his nose and started to bleed. The applicant was kicked in testicles and fainted.", "When he regained consciousness he was in a straightjacket and was tied up with elastic bandages. The applicant\u2019s face was covered with a dirty cloth. The employees of the centre twisted and squashed his testicles. The applicant fainted for the second time during the night. The employees then burned his scrotum.", "During the night the applicant was shouting \u201cgive me a doctor\u201d but his requests were ignored. From time to time, somebody would shout in reply \u201cgo to sleep you whore\u201d.", "On 30 September 1998 the applicant was released from the sobering-up centre. He visited a doctor in P\u0142ock but was refused admission because he did not have documents. The applicant was then seen by Dr \u0141udczak at the Gostynin health centre (o\u015brodek zdrowia). He described the applicant\u2019s injuries in his medical file. He also pointed to the applicant that he had burns on his scrotum and referred him to Dr Gier\u017cy\u0144ski, the Chief Surgeon of the Gostynin Hospital. When Dr Gier\u017cy\u0144ski saw the applicant, he initially considered that the applicant should stay in the hospital because of the discharge of yellow fluid from his nose and the symptoms of brain concussion. However, he later changed his mind, examined the applicant and issued a forensic medical certificate. According to the applicant, the certificate does not indicate the following injuries: a bruise on his thigh and swollen testicles.", "On 1 October 1998 the applicant worked on a construction site. He was in pain but decided to report to work since it was the first day on a new job, which he had got with great difficulty.", "On 29 September 1998 the applicant got involved in a domestic dispute. He was drunk, behaved aggressively and threatened to kill his stepdaughter and mother-in-law. The stepdaughter called the police. Subsequently, both women left the house and waited for the police outdoors.", "When the police arrived the applicant woke up. The attending officers informed him about the reasons for their intervention. The applicant began to behave aggressively. He used abusive language towards the police officers and threatened to kill his stepdaughter and mother-in-law in their presence. Both women asked the officers to take the applicant to a sobering-up centre.", "The police officers ordered the applicant to follow them to the centre but he refused and started a fight. The officers pushed the applicant on the floor and handcuffed him. At that moment, the applicant suffered a skin abrasion on his forehead.", "The applicant was resisting the officers while they were taking him to the police car. Once placed inside the car, the applicant kicked it.", "Subsequently, the applicant was brought to the Gostynin District Police Station where the police officers collected H.S. in order to escort him to the P\u0142ock sobering-up centre.", "The police officers testified that they had not stopped the car on the way to the sobering-up centre and had not assaulted the applicant. Their testimony was confirmed by the documentation of the P\u0142ock sobering-up centre.", "On the way to the centre the applicant behaved aggressively and kicked the car. When it arrived to the centre, the applicant refused to leave it. Therefore, the police officers had to drag the applicant inside the building.", "The applicant continued his aggressive behaviour inside the building. He used abusive language and tried to fight with the employees of the centre. The medical staff of the centre tried to carry out a breathalyser test but the applicant was too intoxicated to provide a specimen of breath. As a result of the applicant\u2019s aggressive behaviour, he was forced to wear a straightjacket between 11.15 p.m. and 5 a.m. The applicant was shouting for almost the whole night. He asked to unbind the straightjacket.", "The applicant was released from the sobering-up centre on 30 September 1998 at 7.00 a.m.", "On 1 October 1998 the applicant worked on a construction site.", "On 1 October 1998 the applicant was examined by a doctor, who made an entry in his medical file kept by the Gostynin health centre and referred him to Dr Gier\u017cy\u0144ski. On the same day Dr Gier\u017cy\u0144ski issued a medical certificate.", "The Detention Card (karta pobytu) no. 001959, which contains the record of the applicant\u2019s presence in the P\u0142ock sobering-up centre, provides the following description of his medical condition:", "\u201cINITIAL MEDICAL OPINION", "As a result of the initial medical examination I confirm that the client:", "1. is intoxicated and qualifies for a detention in the sobering-up centre,", "2. requires a referral to a public medical facility /hospital, emergency service, other/,", "3. does not require to be present in the sobering-up centre.", "The examination with a device detecting intoxication (breathalyser, alcohol test, blood test) showed: Unable to blow a breathalyser.

The witness made a two-page statement in which he gave his account of the intervention in the applicant\u2019s house and his transfer to the soberingup centre.

The applicant had remained aggressive in the police car where he had continued to use abusive language and had kicked the car. The applicant had not been assaulted by any of the responding police officers. After he had been turned over to the employees of the sobering-up centre, he had been bound in a straightjacket because of his aggressive behaviour.", "On 17 November 1998 prosecutor K. also interviewed the second responding police officer, Sergeant G.

In addition, he confirmed that the applicant had urinated in the police car.", "On 19 November 1998 prosecutor K. interviewed B. The witness stated that he was an employee of the P\u0142ock sobering-up centre. He also said that he remembered the surname of Grzegorz Olszewski but did not remember his presence in the centre. The prosecutor asked the witness the following question:", "\u201cDo you remember that he was aggressive and had a straightjacket put on?\u201d", "The witness replied that there were many situations of that nature and that straightjackets and strapping down would be used in respect of aggressive individuals. However, he did not remember the applicant\u2019s presence and behaviour in the sobering-up centre.", "Subsequently, the applicant\u2019s detention card was shown to the witness but he repeated that he did not remember the applicant\u2019s presence in the centre.", "On 19 November 1998 prosecutor K. also interviewed L., a paramedic who was on duty in the P\u0142ock sobering-up centre at the time of the applicant\u2019s detention. She made the following statement:", "\u201cI am on duty in the P\u0142ock sobering-up centre 24 hours a week. During the night of 29/30 September 1998 I received in the centre a patient from Gostynin. The patient was aggressive and made threats against the employees of the centre. He was heavily intoxicated. There were three attempts to use breathalyser. He was unable to blow. In view of his aggressive behaviour and for the sake of his safety a straightjacket was put on him.\u201d", "At this point, the witness was shown a copy of the applicant\u2019s detention card. After consulting it, she continued:", "\u201cAccording to the card Grzegorz Olszewski wanted to beat the centre staff and on his body there were skin abrasions on the right temple \u2013 they had existed at the time of admission. I do not remember anything else. I would like to add that the patient had spent a long time in a straightjacket, which shows that for a very long time he had shown psychomotor agitation. A patient, who is in a straightjacket, is under strict control of a doctor on duty. After two hours straps were eased. They were repeatedly eased during the whole period of his presence. While the patient was in a straightjacket he was aggressive and insulted and cursed everybody. I do not remember his release from the centre.\u201d", "On 30 November 1998 prosecutor K. interviewed M. The witness made the following statement:", "\u201cI was on duty in the sobering-up centre between 29 and 30 September 1998. From what I remember Grzegorz Olszewski was brought by the police officers from Gostynin, he was taken from a domestic dispute. While he was being taken out of a police car, he quarrelled, i.e. resisted the police officers, did not want to get in. They had to make him get in by using force. We had to use force while we were undressing him. He was aggressive and therefore we had to bind him in a straightjacket. He was insulting us, pulling us, wanted to fight with us, waved his hands, was saying that he was sober. In the room, while he was lying in a straightjacket, he was shouting, insulting, threatening us that he would finish us and those who had brought him. Other patients were asking to calm him because he was yelling all the time. He was shouting without any break during two hours. I do not know for how long he was lying in a straightjacket but it was a long period. That is all I remember.\u201d", "On 24 November and 11 December 1998 prosecutor K. and assistant prosecutor S. took statements from two witnesses, who had been detained in the P\u0142ock sobering-up centre on 29 and 30 September 1998. The first witnesses confirmed that he had heard somebody shouting during the night. That person shouted \u201chitlerites\u201d, \u201cmurderers\u201d \u201cpeople, help me\u201d and was asking to unbind his straightjacket. Other individuals present in the centre shouted back to let them sleep and asked the staff to unbind the yelling individual\u2019s straightjacket.", "The second witness testified that at the end of September 1998 he was drunk and was taken to a police station. At the station, he saw a man who was calm. They were taken together to a sobering-up centre. However, he did not remember the man\u2019s behaviour on the way to the sobering-up centre and in the centre. The witness also stated that he did not know whether anybody had used violence against the man while he had been detained in the sobering-up centre.", "On 21 December 1998 prosecutor K. discontinued the investigation of the allegations made by the applicant and refused to prosecute the police officers and the employees of the P\u0142ock sobering-up centre involved in the applicant\u2019s arrest and detention on 29 and 30 September 1998. In addition to the evidence taken from witnesses, he relied on the applicant\u2019s detention card and the medical certificate issued by Dr Gier\u017cy\u0144ski. The prosecutor also took into account the applicant\u2019s medical file kept by the Gostynin health centre, which contained the following entry: \u201c15 VIII 98. Dental caries. Swollen face. Referred to a dentist.\u201d", "The reasoning of the prosecutor\u2019s decision gave firstly an overview of the evidence collected in the course of the investigation. It then stated the following conclusions:", "\u201cThe collected evidence leads to two versions of events \u2013 (1) a version of the complainant Grzegorz Olszewski [and] (2) a version described by the witnesses with respect to the behaviour of Grzegorz Olszewski \u2013 members of his family, the police officers, the staff of the sobering-up centre.", "The evidence taken from the members of the complainant\u2019s family shows that he was drunk and during the police domestic intervention (intervention took place after the police officers had been called by the complainant\u2019s stepdaughter) Grzegorz Olszewski was an aggressive and attacking party and cursed and insulted the members of [his] family and the police officers. The account of events given by the members of the family was confirmed by the police officers.", "The responding police officers used force against the complainant because of his aggressive behaviour. Using the so-called overpowering grips, they pushed him down and handcuffed him. As a result of the complainant\u2019s fall, he suffered face injuries on the right side in the form of skin abrasions.", "The aforesaid injuries suffered by the complainant were described in the statements made by the police officers, they were recorded in the detention card of the sobering-up centre, an entry in the health centre medical file and the forensic medical opinion.", "The police officers testified consistently that they had taken Grzegorz Olszewski from [his] home to a police car and transported him to Gostynin and then to P\u0142ock. In addition, they took from Gostynin one more person in order to transport it to the sobering-up centre. They denied that during transporting the complainant from his place of residence in Gostynin, they stopped or beat him, they did not hit him 34 times in the abdomen, he was held in the police car in a separate room. This denies entirety of the complainant\u2019s testimony.", "In the same way, the evidence taken from the employees of the sobering-up centre confirmed by a person present in the centre rebuts the complainant\u2019s version of events.", "The version submitted by the employees of the sobering-up centre is confirmed by the entries \u2013 notes in the sobering-up centre\u2019s detention card concerning the complainant.", "As for the injuries on the complainant\u2019s body described in the forensic medical certificate it should be stated that the skin abrasions on the right side of the face resulted from the use of force by the police officers when they were overpowering Grzegorz Olszewski in his home. Loose upper and lower teeth could result from caries and related swelling of the face already in August 1998 \u2013 note in the medical file of the health centre. However, it is not possible to establish in what circumstances the complainant\u2019s scrotum was burned. Twenty-four hours elapsed between the release of the complainant from the sobering-up centre and the diagnosis of [the burns] by the doctor who issued the forensic medical certificate.", "The use of physical force and handcuffs against Grzegorz Olszewski constituted an activity resulting from the rights of the police to use the measures of direct coercion against the complainant under Article 16 section 1 point 1 of the Police Act of 6.4.1990.", "In view of the above considerations, it should be stated that the police officers from the Gostynin District Police Station who intervened, did not exceed their powers and did not act against the private interest. Also the employees of the sobering-up centre did not exceed their powers and did not beat the complainant.", "For those reasons, it should be stated that the behaviour of the police officers and the employees of the sobering-up centre did not constitute an offence under Articles 231 \u00a7 1 and 158 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code.", "On the basis of the above considerations I have decided as in the operative part [of the decision].\u201d", "The applicant filed with the P\u0142ock Regional Prosecutor (Prokurator Okr\u0119gowy) an appeal against the decision of the District Prosecutor. On 12 March 1999 the Regional Prosecutor advised the applicant that he had not seen any grounds for allowing his appeal and had therefore transmitted it together with the case file to the Gostynin District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy).", "On 8 April 1999 judge S. of the Gostynin District Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal. The reasoning of the decision was worded as follows:", "\u201cThe appeal is unsubstantiated. In the course of the investigation no breach of law by the intervening police officers was found. The evidence taken from the witnesses shows that G. Olszewski, while intoxicated, behaved aggressively, whereas the police used measures provided by law. The court shares the arguments contained in the reasoning of the prosecutor\u2019s decision and having regard to the above decides as in the operative part [of the decision].\u201d", "On 22 April 1999 the President of the Gostynin District Court rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal against that decision because no appeal lay against it.", "5.
