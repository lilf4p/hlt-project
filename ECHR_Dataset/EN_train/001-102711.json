After reminding him that letters should in principle be written in Turkish, they informed him that they could not have the letter translated, for lack of staff, so they were unable to ascertain, as required under Rule 122 \u00a7 1 of the Regulations on prison management and the execution of sentences (\u201cthe Prison Regulations\u201d), whether the content of the letter was \u201cinoffensive\u201d.

On 21 and 26 September 2007 the Disciplinary Board decided to keep one letter written by each of the applicants in Kurdish. Arguing that the prison had neither the staff nor the money to have them translated, they explained that the letters could be sent once they had been translated, at the applicants\u2019 expense, by a sworn translator and their content had been found to be inoffensive.", "12. On 6 November 2007, based on the case file, the Tekirda\u011f enforcements judge dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicants. That decision was reached after the judge examined the public prosecutor\u2019s submissions, according to which \u201cit [was] necessary to have the correspondence \u2013 which was written in a language other than the official language \u2013 translated in order to have it verified in accordance with section 68 \u00a7 3 of Law no. 5275; there [were] no legal provisions requiring the prison to cover the cost of the translation; as the interested parties themselves had not paid for a translation, there [was] nothing unlawful about the impugned decisions\u201d.", "13. On 19 and 27 November 2007, based on the case file, the Tekirda\u011f Assize Court dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant against that decision, having found no legal or procedural defect.", "14.

On 20 May and 18 June 2008 respectively, on the basis of the case file, the Bolu enforcements judge dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal against those decisions not to send his letters, considering that the Board\u2019s decisions were fully in keeping with section 68 \u00a7 3 of Law no. 5275 and Rule 123 \u00a7 1 of the Prison Regulations, as it had not been possible to determine whether the content of the letters matched any of the criteria set forth in section 68 \u00a7 3 of Law no. 5275.", "20. On 6 June and 11 July 2008 respectively, basing itself on the case file, the Bolu Assize Court rejected the applicant\u2019s complaint against these decisions, noting that the refusal to dispatch the letters had been based not on the fact that they were written in Kurdish but on the fact that their content was incomprehensible and therefore impossible to verify having regard in particular to the imperatives of order and security.", "21.

After pointing out that correspondence should, in principle be written in Turkish, they explained that they did not have any staff to translate the letter.", "28. On 20 May 2008, noting that the letter in question contained characters which were not in the Latin alphabet, the Bolu enforcements judge dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal, pointing out that while the right to correspondence was guaranteed, it was not unlimited, and that in this particular case it was not possible to ascertain whether the content of the letter fell within the scope of the restrictions set forth in section 68 \u00a7 3 of Law no. 5275.", "29. On 10 June 2008 the Bolu Assize Court observed that the reason behind the decision not to send the letter was not the fact that it was written in Kurdish but the fact that its content was incomprehensible, making it impossible to carry out the verification provided for in section 68 \u00a7 3 of Law no. 5275.", "30.
