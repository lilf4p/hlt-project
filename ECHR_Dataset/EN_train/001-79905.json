On various dates, the applicants bought plots of land, near the coast, in Hatay. Some of the applicants constructed houses, others built restaurants and hotels on this land.", "6. In 1995 the Samanda\u011f Municipality, acting on behalf of the Treasury, requested the Samanda\u011f Court of First Instance to determine whether the applicants' land was located within the coastline area. A group of experts, composed of a geomorphologist, a cartography engineer and an agricultural engineer, appointed by the court, inspected the applicants' land and concluded that it was located within the coastline area.", "7. Following the conclusion of the experts' report, the Treasury filed actions before the Samanda\u011f Court of First Instance requesting the annulment of the applicants' title-deeds to the plots because of their coastal area location.", "8. On various dates, the Samanda\u011f Court of First Instance, after having obtained additional expert reports, upheld the request of the Treasury and decided to annul the title-deeds of the applicants. In its decisions, the court held that, pursuant to domestic law, the coast could not be subject to private ownership and that, therefore, the applicants could not rely on the argument that they had acted bona fides or on the fact that they had constructed buildings on the land.", "9. The applicants' appeals against the judgments of the first-instance court were dismissed by the Court of Cassation.
