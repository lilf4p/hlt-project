In 1934, fully-automatic weapons were prohibited, and in 1962, airguns and shotguns were made subject to restrictions for the first time. The controls were consolidated in the Firearms Act 1968. In 1988, semi-automatic and self-loading rifles were prohibited, and in 1992, disguised firearms were prohibited.", "In March 1996, an individual entered a primary school in Scotland and shot dead a teacher and 16 children, and wounded 13 others.

It was made on 10 June 1997. The First Scheme provided compensation for the large-calibre handguns themselves, for prohibited expanding ammunition and for certain ancillary equipment. There were three options for claiming compensation: Option A, a flat rate payment for individual items; Option B, a payment for an individual item at the price in the list of values annexed to the First Scheme; and Option C, a payment based on the market value of an individual item at or immediately before 16 October 1996 (the date of the announcement by the Government of their response to, and legislative intention following, the Cullen Report).", "Under Option A, a payment of \u00a3150 could be claimed for each large-calibre handgun.

Under Option C, dealers were entitled to claim the \u201cfull market value\u201d of the large-calibre handguns and ancillary equipment which they held in stock. The full market value was to be calculated on the basis of the cost to the dealer of the item plus 25%.", "By section 2 of the Second Amendment Act, the provisions of sections 16 to 18 of the First Amendment Act were applied to small-calibre pistols.
