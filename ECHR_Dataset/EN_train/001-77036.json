The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in the Lad-Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6spuszta Social Home, Hungary.", "5. On 4 November 1999 the applicant was taken by ambulance to the Psychiatric Department of Nagyat\u00e1d Hospital. Pursuant to section 199 \u00a7 2 of the Health Care Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), the Hospital notified the Nagyat\u00e1d District Court of this fact the next day.", "6. In the opinion of an expert psychiatrist, dated 8 November 1999, it was observed that the applicant had been committed to hospital because of his erratic, pyromaniac behaviour, and was in a deranged state of mind which warranted his compulsory psychiatric treatment in a closed institution. On the same day the court heard the applicant and ordered his treatment under section 199 \u00a7 5 of the Act.", "7. Between 21 January 2000 and 22 November 2002 the applicant\u2019s compulsory treatment was reviewed by the court at the statutory intervals.", "8. On 21 January 2003 the District Court again reviewed the applicant\u2019s psychiatric detention. At the hearing he was represented by an ad hoc guardian (eseti gondnok). The judge in charge appointed an expert psychiatrist, specifying that his task was", "\u201cto give an opinion as to whether or not the patient\u2019s (elj\u00e1r\u00e1s al\u00e1 vont szem\u00e9ly) admittance to, and prolonged treatment at, the psychiatric department was justified because of his pathological mental status (k\u00f3ros elme\u00e1llapot)\u201d.", "The expert confirmed the need to continue the applicant\u2019s treatment.", "9. Based on that opinion, the court ordered the prolongation of the applicant\u2019s compulsory psychiatric treatment for an indefinite period, the necessity of which was to be reviewed within 60 days. It reasoned as follows:", "\u201cThe patient (elj\u00e1r\u00e1s al\u00e1 vont szem\u00e9ly) was admitted to the psychiatric department.", "Relying on the evidence taken and the expert opinion, the court has established that the patient\u2019s prolonged psychiatric treatment was justified and lawful.", "The patient is in need of further therapy; the court has therefore given its decision according to section 198(1) of Act no. 154 [on Health Care].\u201d", "10. The applicant\u2019s lawyer appealed to the Somogy County Regional Court, arguing that the first-instance decision was unlawful in that its reasoning was substantially deficient. He pointed out that section 198(1) did not provide any substantive ground for prolonging his compulsory treatment, which could only be authorised under sections 200(1) and 188(b) of the Act.", "11. On 28 February 2003 the Regional Court upheld the District Court\u2019s decision, finding that it was in compliance with the relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. It noted that, according to the expert psychiatrist\u2019s opinion, no change had occurred in the applicant\u2019s condition as to warrant his release, and that his prolonged therapy was justified and necessary. It was satisfied that the first-instance proceedings were in compliance with section 201 of the Act. This decision was received at the District Court for despatch on 11 March, and was served on 17 March 2003.", "12. On 15 May 2003 the applicant\u2019s lawyer filed a petition for review by the Supreme Court. He reiterated that the reasoning of the first-instance decision was insufficient, and argued that the lower courts\u2019 decision infringed the applicant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair hearing. He pointed out that the Act provided no ground for compulsory psychiatric treatment because of a patient\u2019s \u201cpathological mental status\u201d \u2013 a criminal-law notion which had mistakenly been referred to when the expert psychiatrist had been appointed. The potential grounds for the applicant\u2019s psychiatric confinement were enumerated in section 200(1) of the Act. In his view, this element deprived the expert\u2019s opinion of any relevance. He stressed that the fairness of any proceedings which might result in coercive measures required detailed reasoning in the relevant decisions. Referring to the Court\u2019s conclusions in the case of Van der Leer v. the Netherlands (judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 170A), he also argued that the failure to inform a patient of the reasons for his involuntary psychiatric treatment might amount to a violation of his Convention rights.", "13. On 27 October 2004 the Supreme Court rejected the petition for review as inadmissible. It held that it was incompatible ratione materiae with the relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.", "14. Meanwhile, on 24 April 2003 the applicant was released from hospital.", "15.
