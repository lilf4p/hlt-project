SPAIN", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 5-3", "JUDGES": "Alejandro Saiz Arnaiz;Anatoly Kovler;Christos Rozakis;Corneliu B\u00eersan;Egbert Myjer;Elisabet Fura;Elisabeth Steiner;Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens;George Nicolaou;Georgieva;Giovanni Bonello;Ineta Ziemele;Ireneu Cabral Barreto;Jean-Paul Costa;Josep Casadevall;Ledi Bianku;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra;Mark Villiger;Mihai Poalelungi;Nicolas Bratza;Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["13. The applicant was born in 1935 and lives in Greece.", "14. On 13 November 2002 the ship Prestige, flying the flag of the Bahamas, was sailing in the Spanish exclusive economic zone off the coast of Galicia, carrying 70,000 tonnes of fuel oil. At a distance of 28 miles from Cape Finisterre it sent out an SOS after sustaining sudden and severe damage which produced a leak and caused the contents of its tanks to spill into the Atlantic Ocean.", "15. As the Prestige was in danger of sinking, the maritime authorities launched a large-scale operation to rescue its crew. The ship was adrift and was approaching the coast, spilling its cargo into the sea. The applicant, who was the ship\u2019s Master, was taken by helicopter to the offices of the Corunna (A Coru\u00f1a) harbourmaster, where he was arrested.", "16. The spillage of the ship\u2019s cargo caused an ecological disaster whose effects on marine flora and fauna lasted for several months and spread as far as the French coast. The shores of the Atlantic coast of Cantabria and Galicia were severely polluted by the numerous waves of oil which were washed up. The oil spill blackened beaches and cliffs, destroyed marine life, adversely affected water quality and had an immediate environmental impact on numerous animal species. It caused damage to protected natural areas and had considerable repercussions on several sectors of the economy in the regions concerned, particularly on fishing, commerce and tourism.", "17. By a decision of 17 November 2002, the Corunna no. 4 investigating judge remanded the applicant in custody and set bail at 3,000,000 euros (EUR), after finding that the facts of the case disclosed sufficient indicative evidence to justify opening a criminal investigation. While acknowledging that the oil spill had been caused by an accident, the judge said that some of the information in the file, although still provisional at that stage in the proceedings, suggested that the applicant had been at fault in several respects, in particular in failing to cooperate sufficiently with the port authorities when they had tried to take the vessel in tow. The applicant\u2019s conduct could constitute an offence of causing damage to natural resources and the environment and one of failing to comply with the instructions of the administrative authorities. In the judge\u2019s opinion, the seriousness of the offences in question and the fact that the applicant was a foreign national who had no particular ties with Spain justified the high sum set for bail. The relevant part of the decision reads as follows:", "\u201cThe information obtained discloses indicative evidence \u2013 still provisional at the preliminary investigation stage \u2013 of an offence of causing damage to natural resources and the environment for the purposes of Article 325 and, possibly, Article 326 of the Criminal Code, and of an offence of failure to comply with the instructions of the administrative authorities, punishable under Article 556 of the Code. The investigation has produced sufficient indicative evidence to suggest that Mr Apostolos Mangouras could be criminally responsible for the offences in question. In view of the penalties laid down in the Criminal Code for these offences, and the fact that the application provided for in Article 504 bis \u00a7 2 and Article 539 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was made at the mandatory hearing, an order should be made, in accordance with Articles 503 and 504 of that Code, for the accused\u2019s pre-trial detention as a preventive measure, accompanied by the right for the accused to communicate with others and the possibility of release on bail.", "The reasonable indications referred to above emerge from the documents in the case file and, in particular, from detailed examination of the testimony of the witnesses who appeared this morning. All the evidence indicates that the severe damage to the Prestige was caused by the unforeseeable phenomenon of a storm surge, but that actions were taken which could form the basis of a criminal prosecution, as indicated in the previous paragraph.", "It should be stressed that the steps taken hitherto and the conclusions to be drawn for the purposes of this decision are of a wholly provisional nature and that many further steps and much more expert evidence will be needed in order to fully elucidate the facts. However, it is clear at this stage that the Prestige did not have any emergency towing equipment or that if it did, it was not in working order, as demonstrated by the recordings of conversations. It is also clear that the ship\u2019s Master, by repeatedly ignoring the instructions of the port authorities, hampered meaningful joint efforts to lessen the extremely serious risks.", "It appears that the Master of the Prestige refused for almost three hours to cooperate and subsequently continued to do so indirectly, creating difficulties by refusing to take the necessary steps to ensure effective towing of the vessel or to start the engine so that the ship could advance, however slowly. These events occurred within the country\u2019s 24-mile limit and, by definition, within the 200-mile zone. It is true, as already indicated, that further investigative elements are required, in particular the ship\u2019s log, which has been urgently requested, and that it will be necessary to verify all the other information contained in the recordings of conversations, transcripts of which appear to be in the possession of the Cape Finisterre control centre.", "Without prejudice to all of the above, the accused\u2019s detention could be dispensed with subject to bail being furnished in the amount of three million euros. In the court\u2019s view, the security in question is justified in view of the seriousness of the offences concerned and the heavy sentence they carry and also because the investigation is in the early stages, the accused\u2019s release could impede the investigation, the case has clearly caused a major public outcry and, in addition to the issues of criminal responsibility raised, there are significant civil liability issues at stake involving substantial sums. Furthermore, Mr Mangouras has no ties in Spain and could leave the country at any time and thus evade prosecution. For all the reasons outlined above it is necessary and unavoidable, in the present circumstances, to fix bail. Bail cannot, for the time being at least, be replaced by a less restrictive measure.\u201d", "18. On 19 November 2002 the applicant requested his release and, in the alternative, the reduction of bail to EUR 60,000 to reflect his personal situation. He also submitted that his advanced age should be taken into account. In a decision of 27 November 2002, the Corcubi\u00f3n (Corunna) no. 1 investigating judge refused the applicant\u2019s request. The judge took the view that the seriousness of the offences of which the applicant stood accused justified his continued pre-trial detention and that the latter measure was exceptional, subsidiary, temporary and proportionate in nature and thus satisfied the remaining criteria laid down by the case-law of the Constitutional Court. As to the amount set for bail, the judge stated that the applicant\u2019s appearance at trial was vital in order to elucidate the sequence of events following the leak in the vessel. He also reiterated the arguments of the first investigating judge to the effect that the seriousness of the offences, the public outcry caused by the marine pollution, the applicant\u2019s Greek nationality, the fact that his permanent address was abroad and the fact that he had no ties with Spain justified setting a high level of bail in order to rule out any risk that the applicant might fail to appear.", "19. On 7 December 2002 the same investigating judge confirmed the decision, rejecting an application from the applicant to set it aside (recurso de reforma).", "20. An appeal by the applicant was dismissed on 3 January 2003 by the Corunna Audiencia Provincial subject to the posting of bail in the amount of EUR 3,000,000. The Audiencia Provincial noted the outcry caused by the alleged offences and took the view that the impugned decision was not open to criticism on any account, \u201cincluding with regard to the amount of bail\u201d.", "The Audiencia Provincial stressed that the prima facie evidence taken into consideration by the investigating judge in ordering the applicant\u2019s pretrial detention concerned serious offences, that it was too early to rule on whether the offence had been committed intentionally and that the applicant\u2019s detention pursued the legitimate aim of preventing the risk of his absconding, a risk closely linked to the seriousness of the alleged offence and his lack of any particular ties in Spain. It referred in that regard to the category of offences in question and the severity of the likely sentence, the fact that the accused\u2019s presence was essential to the investigation, the possibility that the trial might collapse if he absconded and the public outcry surrounding the established facts.", "The Audiencia Provincial dismissed the ground of appeal based on the applicability of Article 230 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982, holding that the provision in question referred only to administrative offences relating to pollution of the marine environment committed by foreign vessels beyond the territorial sea, for which only monetary penalties could be imposed, and not to wilful and serious acts of pollution in the territorial sea.", "21. On 6 February 2003 the Corcubi\u00f3n (Corunna) no. 1 investigating judge recorded the lodging of a bank guarantee in an amount corresponding to the sum set for bail, which was provided as a one-off, spontaneous humanitarian gesture by the London Steamship Owners\u2019 Mutual Insurance Association Limited (\u201cthe London P&I Club\u201d), which insured the ship\u2019s owner. Accordingly, on 7 February 2003, the judge ordered the applicant\u2019s provisional release after eighty-three days in detention, subject to the following conditions:", "\u201c(a) that [the applicant] supply an address in Spain;", "(b) that he report every day before 1 p.m. to the police headquarters corresponding to the address supplied;", "(c) that he remain in the country and surrender his passport to the court\u2019s registry.\u201d", "22. On 28 May 2003 the London P&I Club and the ship\u2019s owner, Mare Shipping Inc., paid out EUR 22,777,986 in compensation for the damage for which they were civilly liable within the limits laid down by Article V of the 1992 International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage (\u201cthe CLC 1992\u201d, see paragraph 54 below).", "23. Relying on Article 17 of the Constitution (right to liberty and security), the applicant lodged an amparo appeal with the Constitutional Court. While he did not appeal against his pre-trial detention, for which he considered sufficient reasons to have been given, the applicant complained of the amount set for bail, arguing that it had been excessive and disproportionate in view of his financial circumstances and had made any prospect of provisional release unrealistic. He alleged that the amount had been fixed without account being taken of his personal circumstances, in disregard of the requirements of the court\u2019s case-law.", "24. By a reasoned decision (auto) of 29 September 2003, the Constitutional Court declared the appeal inadmissible. It began by observing that, according to its case-law, the fact that the applicant had been released did not render the amparo appeal devoid of purpose, given that \u201c... in the event of a breach of the fundamental right asserted, the [c]ourt should allow the appeal and grant the applicant amparo relief\u201d.", "25. However, on the merits, the Constitutional Court ruled as follows:", "\u201c... Article 531 of the Code of Criminal Procedure stipulates that the amount set for bail should take into account, among other factors, the nature of the offence, any previous convictions and other circumstances that might prompt the accused to seek to evade justice. According to the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, the object of bail is to secure the presence of the accused at the trial ... and the amount should act as a deterrent against any wish to abscond.", "...", "The rulings given in the instant case concerning the amount of bail and the refusal to reduce it provided ample reasons based on the primary objective of securing the accused\u2019s presence at the trial, the seriousness of the offences in question, the national and international disaster caused by the oil spill, the fact that the accused is a nonnational and the fact that he has no ties in Spain.", "These circumstances led the courts to consider that the risk of flight could only be reduced by setting such a high sum for bail ... They also took into consideration the accused\u2019s personal and financial circumstances and his professional environment. ... In fixing bail at a level such as to dispel any wish to abscond, they further took account of other aspects of the accused\u2019s personal situation, namely his Greek nationality, the fact that his permanent address is abroad and the fact that he has no ties whatsoever in Spain.", "It follows that bail was fixed on the basis of criteria of proportionality ... The exceptional amount reflects the exceptional nature of the situation.\u201d", "26. Subsequently, in March 2005, the Spanish authorities authorised the applicant\u2019s return to his country of origin, where he is now living, on condition that the Greek authorities ensured his compliance with the periodic supervision to which he had been subject in Spain. The applicant is therefore required to report every two weeks to a police station on the island of Icaria, where he was born, or in Athens, where his children live.", "27. The criminal proceedings are currently pending before the Corcubi\u00f3n (Corunna) no. 1 investigating judge.", "28. The relevant provision of the Spanish Constitution reads as follows:", "\u201cEveryone has the right to liberty and security. No one may be deprived of his liberty other than in accordance with the provisions of this Article and in the circumstances and form provided by law.\u201d", "29. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code in force at the material time stipulated as follows:", "\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of the preceding Articles, convicted persons who have reached the age of 70 or who reach that age while serving their sentence, and who satisfy the requirements laid down [by the law], with the exception of the requirement to have served three quarters or, where appropriate, two thirds of [the sentence], may be granted conditional release.", "...\u201d", "\u201cAny person who ... causes or produces, directly or indirectly, emissions, discharges ... into ... inland or maritime waters or groundwater ... likely to severely upset the balance of natural systems, shall be liable to a term of imprisonment of between six months and four years, a day-fine payable for between eight and twentyfour months and a prohibition of between one and three years on carrying out his or her occupation. Where there is a risk to persons\u2019 health the term of imprisonment shall be in the upper half of the range.\u201d", "\u201cThe commission of any of the acts described in the previous Article shall entail a more severe sentence when accompanied by:", "a. illegal operation of an industrial or other activity using facilities which have not obtained the necessary administrative authorisation or approval; or", "b. failure to comply with the express instructions of the administrative authority aimed at remedying or putting an end to the activities referred to in the previous Article; or", "c. falsification or concealment of information on the environmental implications of the activities in question; or", "d. hampering of the administrative authorities\u2019 inspection activities; or", "e. a risk of irreversible or catastrophic damage; or", "f. illegal pumping of water while restrictions are in place.\u201d", "\u201cThe penalty imposed for an offence referred to in this Chapter shall be in the lower half of the range where the offence was the result of gross negligence.\u201d", "30. The second paragraph of Article 325 of the Criminal Code, as amended in November 2003, provides:", "\u201c2. Persons who knowingly release, discharge or introduce ionising radiation or other substances into the air, soil or maritime waters ... in quantities such as to cause death or illness ... with irreversible effects, shall be liable to a term of imprisonment of between two and four years in addition to the penalty for causing personal injury.\u201d", "31. The relevant provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads as follows:", "\u201cIn determining the nature and amount of the security, consideration should be given to the nature of the offence, the social circumstances of the accused and any previous convictions, together with any other circumstance which may increase or reduce the incentive to evade justice.\u201d", "32. The Environmental Liability Act (Law no. 26/2007 of 23 October 2007) regulates operators\u2019 responsibility to prevent and remedy environmental damage in accordance with Article 45 of the Constitution and the precautionary and \u201cpolluter pays\u201d principles.", "33. An increasing tendency has been observed at European level to use the criminal law as a means of enforcing the environmental obligations imposed by European Union law.", "34. In 1998 the Council of Europe opened for signature the Convention on the Protection of the Environment through Criminal Law (ETS No. 172). To date, however, only thirteen States have signed the Convention and Estonia is the only country to have ratified it. The text includes the following provisions:", "Article 2 \u2013 Intentional offences", "\u201c1. Each Party shall adopt such appropriate measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law:", "a. the discharge, emission or introduction of a quantity of substances or ionising radiation into air, soil or water which:", "(i) causes death or serious injury to any person, or", "(ii) creates a significant risk of causing death or serious injury to any person;", "b. the unlawful discharge, emission or introduction of a quantity of substances or ionising radiation into air, soil or water which causes or is likely to cause their lasting deterioration or death or serious injury to any person or substantial damage to protected monuments, other protected objects, property, animals or plants;", "c. the unlawful disposal, treatment, storage, transport, export or import of hazardous waste which causes or is likely to cause death or serious injury to any person or substantial damage to the quality of air, soil, water, animals or plants;", "d. the unlawful operation of a plant in which a dangerous activity is carried out and which causes or is likely to cause death or serious injury to any person or substantial damage to the quality of air, soil, water, animals or plants;", "e. the unlawful manufacture, treatment, storage, use, transport, export or import of nuclear materials or other hazardous radioactive substances which causes or is likely to cause death or serious injury to any person or substantial damage to the quality of air, soil, water, animals or plants,", "when committed intentionally.", "2. Each Party shall adopt such appropriate measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law aiding or abetting the commission of any of the offences established in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article.\u201d", "Article 3 \u2013 Negligent offences", "\u201c1. Each Party shall adopt such appropriate measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law, when committed with negligence, the offences enumerated in Article 2, paragraph 1 a to e.", "2. Any State may, at the time of signature or when depositing its instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, by a declaration addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, declare that paragraph 1 of this Article, in part or in whole, shall only apply to offences which were committed with gross negligence.", "3. Any State may, at the time of signature or when depositing its instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, by a declaration addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, declare that paragraph 1 of this Article, in part or in whole, shall not apply to:", "\u2013 sub-paragraph 1.a.ii. of Article 2,", "\u2013 sub-paragraph 1.b. of Article 2, in so far as the offence relates to protected monuments, to other protected objects or to property.\u201d", "Article 6 \u2013 Sanctions for environmental offences", "\u201cEach Party shall adopt, in accordance with the relevant international instruments, such appropriate measures as may be necessary to enable it to make the offences established in accordance with Articles 2 and 3 punishable by criminal sanctions which take into account the serious nature of these offences. The sanctions available shall include imprisonment and pecuniary sanctions and may include reinstatement of the environment.\u201d", "35. In its report on sea pollution of 30 March 2005, the Committee on the Environment, Agriculture and Local and Regional Affairs of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe stated as follows:", "\u201c...", "167. Four lines of thought must be pursued:", "(a) The excessively absolute principle of freedom of navigation must be revised, as it is no longer appropriate in the context of present-day transport flows. Legally speaking, this would open the way for passive control and ultimately active control, at least in zones subject to risk. The issue of the responsibilities of control bodies could be considered at the same time.", "(b) A State which has suffered pollution damage caused by a ship must be able to demand reparation from the State whose flag that ship flies where it is established that the damage results completely or partly from the flag State\u2019s failure to exercise any effective monitoring of the vessel causing the damage.", "(c) Article 230 of the Convention on the Law of the Sea must be amended to make clearer the possibility of penalties of imprisonment for the most serious pollution offences.", "(d) An international maritime criminal court must be set up. In the same way that the notion of crimes against humanity finally yielded the creation of the International Criminal Court, it cannot be excluded in the future that states may eventually enshrine the notion of \u2018crime against the environment\u2019, drawing the consequences, in legal terms, of the idea put forward by some of establishing the sea as the common heritage of humanity.\u201d", "36. The issue of environmental crime has also been debated for many years within the European Union.", "37. In its judgment, the Chamber referred to Directive 2005/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on ship-source pollution and on the introduction of penalties for infringements, which makes ship-source discharges in breach of Community law a criminal offence. The Directive further requires that both criminal and administrative penalties be imposed if the persons concerned are found to have committed or participated in the act with intent or as a result of negligent behaviour. The Directive, adopted in response to the sinking of the Erika and of the Prestige, specifically provides that the member States must implement it by 1 March 2007. It was therefore not intended to apply to events having occurred prior to that date.", "38. In any event, Directive 2005/35/EC applies to discharges occurring, inter alia, in the exclusive economic zone or equivalent zone of a Member State, from any ship with the exception of any warship, naval auxiliary or other ship owned or operated by a State and used at the material time only on government non-commercial service. The member States must take the necessary measures to ensure that infringements are subject to effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties, which may include criminal or administrative penalties.", "39. In its judgment of 3 June 2008 in Case C-308/06 Intertanko and Others, the Court of Justice of the European Communities (\u201cthe ECJ\u201d), having been called upon to examine a challenge to the validity of Directive 2005/35/EC, found that the concept of \u201cserious negligence\u201d provided for in many national legal systems could only refer to a patent breach of a duty of care (paragraph 76 of the judgment). The ECJ further held that \u201cserious negligence\u201d within the meaning of the Directive should be understood as entailing an unintentional act or omission by which the person responsible committed a patent breach of the duty of care which he should have and could have complied with in view of his attributes, knowledge, abilities and individual situation (paragraph 77).", "40. In the wake of the ECJ judgments of 13 September 2005 and 23 October 2007, which annulled respectively Council Framework Decision 2003/80/JHA of 27 January 2003 on the protection of the environment through criminal law and Council Framework Decision 2005/667/JHA of 12 July 2005 to strengthen the criminal-law framework for the enforcement of the law against ship-source pollution, which supplements Directive 2005/35/EC (referred to in the Chamber judgment), the Commission put forward a proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law. The European Union legislative process culminated in the adoption of Directive 2008/99/EC. Recital 3 in the preamble to the Directive states that the availability of criminal penalties demonstrates social disapproval of a qualitatively different nature compared to administrative penalties or a compensation mechanism under civil law. It also makes an explicit link between the need for criminal penalties and past experience in the field of environmental protection.", "41. The Directive in question requires Member States to treat as criminal offences certain activities that breach European Union environmental legislation, including:", "(i) unlawful shipment of waste;", "(ii) trade in endangered species or in ozone-depleting substances;", "(iii) conduct causing significant deterioration of a habitat within a protected site;", "(iv) significant damage to the environment caused by the treatment, disposal, storage, transport, export or import of hazardous waste (including oil and gas, waste oils, sewage sludge, metals or electrical or electronic waste); and", "(v) significant damage to the environment caused by the unlawful discharge of materials or ionising radiation.", "42. Member States are required to subject these offences to effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties and to ensure that companies can be held liable for offences carried out by individuals on their behalf.", "43. For its part, Directive 2004/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage is aimed at establishing a framework of environmental liability based on the \u201cpolluter pays\u201d principle, with a view to preventing and remedying environmental damage.", "44. The relevant Articles of this Convention, which was ratified by Spain on 15 January 1997, read as follows:", "\u201c...", "3. Where there are clear grounds for believing that a vessel navigating in the exclusive economic zone or the territorial sea of a State has, in the exclusive economic zone, committed a violation of applicable international rules and standards for the prevention, reduction and control of pollution from vessels or laws and regulations of that State conforming and giving effect to such rules and standards, that State may require the vessel to give information regarding its identity and port of registry, its last and its next port of call and other relevant information required to establish whether a violation has occurred.", "...", "6. Where there is clear objective evidence that a vessel navigating in the exclusive economic zone or the territorial sea of a State has, in the exclusive economic zone, committed a violation referred to in paragraph 3 resulting in a discharge causing major damage or threat of major damage to the coastline or related interests of the coastal State, or to any resources of its territorial sea or exclusive economic zone, that State may, subject to section 7, provided that the evidence so warrants, institute proceedings, including detention of the vessel, in accordance with its laws.", "7. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 6, whenever appropriate procedures have been established, either through the competent international organisation or as otherwise agreed, whereby compliance with requirements for bonding or other appropriate financial security has been assured, the coastal State if bound by such procedures shall allow the vessel to proceed.", "...\u201d", "\u201c1. Nothing in this Part shall prejudice the right of States, pursuant to international law, both customary and conventional, to take and enforce measures beyond the territorial sea proportionate to the actual or threatened damage to protect their coastline or related interests, including fishing, from pollution or threat of pollution following upon a maritime casualty or acts relating to such a casualty, which may reasonably be expected to result in major harmful consequences.", "2. For the purposes of this Article, \u2018maritime casualty\u2019 means a collision of vessels, stranding or other incident of navigation, or other occurrence on board a vessel or external to it resulting in material damage or imminent threat of material damage to a vessel or cargo.\u201d", "\u201cIn exercising their rights and performing their duties under this Part, States shall not discriminate in form or in fact against vessels of any other State.\u201d", "\u201c1. Monetary penalties only may be imposed with respect to violations of national laws and regulations or applicable international rules and standards for the prevention, reduction and control of pollution of the marine environment, committed by foreign vessels beyond the territorial sea.", "2. Monetary penalties only may be imposed with respect to violations of national laws and regulations or applicable international rules and standards for the prevention, reduction and control of pollution of the marine environment, committed by foreign vessels in the territorial sea, except in the case of a wilful and serious act of pollution in the territorial sea.", "3. In the conduct of proceedings in respect of such violations committed by a foreign vessel which may result in the imposition of penalties, recognised rights of the accused shall be observed.\u201d", "45. With regard to detention of seafarers and their release, UNCLOS provides:", "\u201c1. The coastal State may, in the exercise of its sovereign rights to explore, exploit, conserve and manage the living resources in the exclusive economic zone, take such measures, including boarding, inspection, arrest and judicial proceedings, as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations adopted by it in conformity with this Convention.", "2. Arrested vessels and their crews shall be promptly released upon the posting of reasonable bond or other security.", "3. Coastal State penalties for violations of fisheries laws and regulations in the exclusive economic zone may not include imprisonment, in the absence of agreements to the contrary by the States concerned, or any other form of corporal punishment.", "4. In cases of arrest or detention of foreign vessels the coastal State shall promptly notify the flag State, through appropriate channels, of the action taken and of any penalties subsequently imposed.\u201d", "\u201c1. Where the authorities of a State Party have detained a vessel flying the flag of another State Party and it is alleged that the detaining State has not complied with the provisions of this Convention for the prompt release of the vessel or its crew upon the posting of a reasonable bond or other financial security, the question of release from detention may be submitted to any court or tribunal agreed upon by the parties or, failing such agreement within 10 days from the time of detention, to a court or tribunal accepted by the detaining State under Article 287 or to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, unless the parties otherwise agree.", "2. The application for release may be made only by or on behalf of the flag State of the vessel.", "3. The court or tribunal shall deal without delay with the application for release and shall deal only with the question of release, without prejudice to the merits of any case before the appropriate domestic forum against the vessel, its owner or its crew. The authorities of the detaining State remain competent to release the vessel or its crew at any time.", "4. Upon the posting of the bond or other financial security determined by the court or tribunal, the authorities of the detaining State shall comply promptly with the decision of the court or tribunal concerning the release of the vessel or its crew.\u201d", "46. The provisions concerning detention and release of vessels and crews have been interpreted by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (\u201cthe Tribunal\u201d). In doing so, the Tribunal has laid down a number of criteria in order to determine what constitutes a reasonable bond within the meaning of Article 73 of UNCLOS taken in conjunction with Article 292 of that Convention. Hence, it is interesting to examine the approach taken by the Tribunal in cases relating to the detention of a foreign national by the coastal State and the fixing of the amount of bail. However, it should be borne in mind, firstly, that the Tribunal, unlike the Court, is tasked with striking a balance between the competing interests of two States rather than the interests of an individual and those of a State. Secondly, the issues brought before the Tribunal concern the detention and release of both crews and vessels. Thirdly, unlike the instant case, which is about an environmental disaster, the vast majority of cases before the Tribunal concern fisheries-related violations. In its judgment of 6 August 2007 in the case of Hoshinmaru (Japan v. the Russian Federation), the Tribunal summarised the principles it applies in deciding what constitutes a reasonable bond. The relevant extracts reads as follows:", "\u201c82. The Tribunal has expressed its views on the reasonableness of the bond in a number of its judgments. In the Camouco case it stated: \u2018the Tribunal considers that a number of factors are relevant in an assessment of the reasonableness of bonds or other financial security. They include the gravity of the alleged offences, the penalties imposed or imposable under the laws of the detaining State, the value of the detained vessel and of the cargo seized, the amount of the bond imposed by the detaining State and its form\u2019 (ITLOS Reports 2000, p. 10, at p. 31, para. 67). In the Monte Confurco case it added that: \u2018This is by no means a complete list of factors. Nor does the Tribunal intend to lay down rigid rules as to the exact weight to be attached to each of them\u2019 (ITLOS Reports 2000, p. 86, at p. 109, para. 76). In the Volga case it stated that: \u2018In assessing the reasonableness of the bond or other security, due account must be taken of the terms of the bond or security set by the detaining State, having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case\u2019 (ITLOS Reports 2002, p. 10, at p. 32, para. 65). In the Juno Trader case the Tribunal further declared: \u2018[t]he assessment of the relevant factors must be an objective one, taking into account all information provided to the Tribunal by the parties\u2019 (ITLOS Reports 2004, p. 17, at p. 41, para. 85).", "...", "89. The proceedings under Article 292 of [UNCLOS](Monte Confurco, ITLOS Reports 2000, p. 86, at pp. 108-109, para. 74). However, the Tribunal wishes to emphasise that in so doing it is by no means acting as a court of appeal (Monte Confurco, ITLOS Reports 2000, p. 86, at p. 108, para. 72).\u201d", "47. It is clear from the foregoing that, in assessing the reasonableness of the bond, the Tribunal takes three factors into consideration: (i) the gravity of the alleged offences; (ii) the penalties imposed or imposable under the laws of the detaining State in so far as they are reasonably proportionate to the gravity of the alleged offences; and (iii) the value of the detained vessel and of the cargo seized. In doing so, the Tribunal is mindful of its duty not to prejudice the merits of the case, which are decided domestically. However, the Tribunal considers that it is not prevented from making determinations bearing on the merits when these are necessary for the assessment of a reasonable bond.", "48. BIMCO is an independent shipping association with a membership composed of shipowners, managers, brokers, agents and many other stakeholders with vested interests in the shipping industry. BIMCO is one of the third-party interveners in the present case. On 23 March 2009 BIMCO published a report on the treatment of seafarers which is interesting in several respects.", "49. Firstly, the report identifies fourteen cases where sanctions were taken against the seafarers involved before any deliberate act or negligence had been admitted or proven in court. The period examined runs for eleven years from 1996 until 2007 and the cases dealt with \u2013 which include the Mangouras (or Prestige) case \u2013 involve twelve coastal States. The report concludes that: (i) the use of criminal sanctions against seafarers is a worldwide phenomenon, by no means restricted to particular countries or regions; (ii) although the rules are fair, their application is unjust, often flying in the face of the presumption of innocence; and (iii) while there are relatively few cases, the issues involved clearly illustrate that there are continuing problems with respect to the unfair treatment of seafarers.", "50. Secondly, the report examines a range of instruments in connection with the treatment of seafarers, including international conventions, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and a number of regional and national instruments. In the last category, particular attention is given to the European Union legal framework and to the law in France, the United States of America, Canada and the United Kingdom. In its conclusions, BIMCO observes that the test generally applied in those instruments is gross negligence, with punishment ranging from fines to imprisonment.", "51. Finally, this report was examined by the Legal Committee of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) at its 95th session from 30 March to 3 April 2009. As regards the fair treatment of seafarers, the minutes of the Legal Committee record the following:", "\u201cThe Committee agreed that the Guidelines on Fair Treatment of Seafarers in the event of a maritime accident, adopted by the Legal Committee, and the Code of International Standards and Recommended Practices for a Safety Investigation into a Marine Casualty or Marine Incident, adopted by IMO\u2019s Maritime Safety Committee, should be strictly applied by States so that a proper balance could be achieved between the need, on the one hand, for a thorough investigation of maritime accidents and, on the other hand, the protection of the rights of seafarers.", "Many delegates noted that the issue of fair treatment of seafarers was the direct responsibility of port, coastal and flag States, the State of the nationality of the seafarers, shipowners, and seafarers. States were obliged to treat seafarers fairly, pursuant to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and regional human rights instruments, as well as under national law. There was also a consensus that States should comply with the Guidelines on Fair Treatment of Seafarers adopted by the Legal Committee.\u201d", "52. The Guidelines on Fair Treatment of Seafarers are attached to the observations of the third-party interveners in the present case.", "53. This Convention which, together with the Protocol thereto, was ratified by Spain on 6 July 1984, has been amended on several occasions, most recently in July 2007 (entry into force December 2008). Annex I to the Convention relates to the prevention of pollution by oil following collision or stranding. The Convention, which is a combination of two treaties adopted in 1973 and 1978, constitutes the main instrument covering prevention of pollution of the marine environment by ships from operational or accidental causes.", "54. This Convention governs the liability of shipowners for oil pollution damage. It sets up a system of strict liability for shipowners and a system of compulsory liability insurance. The shipowner is normally entitled to limit his liability to an amount which is linked to the tonnage of his ship.", "\u201c1. Except as provided in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, the owner of a ship at the time of an incident, or, where the incident consists of a series of occurrences, at the time of the first such occurrence, shall be liable for any pollution damage caused by the ship as a result of the incident.", "...", "4. No claim for compensation for pollution damage may be made against the owner otherwise than in accordance with this Convention. Subject to paragraph 5 of this Article, no claim for compensation for pollution damage under this Convention or otherwise may be made against:", "(a) the servants or agents of the owner or the members of the crew;", "(b) the pilot or any other person who, without being a member of the crew, performs services for the ship;", "...", "unless the damage resulted from their personal act or omission, committed with the intent to cause such damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably result.", "...\u201d", "\u201c...", "2.
