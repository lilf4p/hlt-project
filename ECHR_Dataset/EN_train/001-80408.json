In letters of 22 February 2001, the Bailiffs informed the applicants that the judgments in their favour had not been executed because the 1999 State Budget did not preview the expenditure for teachers' social benefits. In the 2000 State Budget teaching programmes were funded only 2.8% of actual needs. The 2001 State Budget likewise did not provide funds for this purpose. The State Administration further stated that such payments could only be made after the adoption of relevant legislation by Parliament.", "9.

On 24 May 2002 the Velykomykhaylivsky Court left without consideration the first applicant's appeal against the decision of 30 July 2001 for failure to comply with the formalities as to its content and to pay the court fee and allowed her time until 26 June 2002 to rectify the mistakes. On 3 July 2002 the court returned the appeal without consideration for failure to rectify it.", "13. On 29 December 2001 the first applicant was paid UAH 160.", "14. On 14 August 2003 the Bailiffs returned the execution writs of 18 October 1999 to the applicants, stating that the judgments could not be enforced as the State Budget provided no funds for such payments.", "15. The judgments of 7 October 1999 remain unenforced until present.", "16. The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgments of Romashov v. Ukraine (no. 67534/01, \u00a7\u00a7 16-19) and Kechko v. Ukraine (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 16-18)."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
