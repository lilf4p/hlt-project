On 16 May 1994 the court ordered a psychiatric examination of the applicant. It considered that her behaviour in the course of the proceedings and the nature of her pleadings caused it to doubt whether she was capable of understanding the meaning of the criminal act allegedly committed by her and whether she was capable of taking part in the proceedings.", "15. On 23 May 1994 the court rejected the applicant\u2019s eight petitions concerning evidence.", "16. On 14 June 1994 the examination was carried out.

The applicant appealed that decision, pointing out that the psychiatrists\u2019 opinion of 14 June 1994 was of a poor quality and that the court had overlooked the fact that during her observation her child would be left without care.

The applicant failed to attend the examination scheduled for 9 October 1997.", "41. On 26 February 1998 the court refused her request that the proceedings be resumed. The court considered that a decision to resume the proceedings should be based on a psychiatric opinion confirming that the applicant\u2019s health was no longer an obstacle to her participation. It noted that the opinions available to it were not persuasive in this respect, and that the applicant kept failing to attend further examinations.", "42. On 11 June 1999 the court held a hearing concerning the applicant\u2019s motion for the resumption of the proceedings. It ordered another expert opinion on the state of her mental health.
