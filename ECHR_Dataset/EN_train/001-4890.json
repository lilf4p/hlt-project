THE CZECH REPUBLIC", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a Czech citizen born in 1950. He resides in Jablonec nad Nisou.", "A.", "On 27 February 1991 the Rychnov u Jablonce nad Nisou Town Board of Representatives (m\u011bstsk\u00e9 zastupitelstvo) (\uf041the Town Board of Representatives\uf040) accepted the mayor\u2019s proposal to appoint the applicant as the Secretary of the Rychnov u Jablonce nad Nisou Town Office (m\u011bstsk\u00fd \u00fa\u0159ad) (\"the Town Office\").", "On 1 March 1991 the applicant and the Town Office, represented by the mayor, signed a contract of employment. The applicant began to work on 4 March 1991.", "On 17 October 1991 the Town Board of Representatives decided to remove the applicant from his position. By letter of 18 October 1991 the mayor informed the applicant that the Town Office could not offer him an alternative employment and that he would be dismissed as of 31 January 1992.", "On 22 October and 18 December 1991 the applicant brought an action against the Town Office before the Jablonec nad Nisou District Court (okresn\u00ed soud) (\u201cthe District Court\u201d) claiming unfair dismissal. He challenged the validity of the dismissal as having been made by the Town of Rychnov u Jablonce nad Nisou (m\u011bsto) (\"the Town\") and not by the Town Office which signed his contract of employment, and having been pronounced without the previous consent of a trade union authority. The applicant also claimed that the dismissal could not be made in pursuance of Sections 46(1)(c) and 65(2) of the Labour Code (z\u00e1kon\u00edk pr\u00e1ce) as these provisions applied only to a termination of an employment relationship based on appointment [i.e. without a contract as such], which was not his case because his employment relationship was created by the contract signed on 1 March 1991 without any previous or subsequent appointment. The fact that on 27 February 1991 the Town Board of Representatives approved the mayor\u2019s proposal could not be considered as the applicant\u2019s appointment because at that time he had not yet been working for the defendant.", "On 13 May 1992 the District Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s action. The court stated inter alia that the applicant\u2019s employment relationship had been based on appointment and created on 4 March 1991, the date on which the applicant would start exercising his duties as agreed by the parties. It further considered that, bearing in mind that the Town Office and Town were identical legal persons, it could not be said that the applicant had not been employed by the Town. The court also examined the decision of the Town Council concerning the applicant\u2019s dismissal and found it valid. It finally stated that the dismissal notice contained a clause which read that the applicant\u2019s dismissal had been a matter of consultation with the trade union authority on 18 October 1991, and that the original of the notice had been signed by the applicant.", "On 7 August 1992 the applicant appealed against this judgment. He claimed inter alia that the District Court had not established the facts correctly and had not assessed evidence in accordance with the domestic law. He further objected to the legal assessment of the case by this court.", "By ruling of 24 August 1994 the \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem Regional Court (krajsk\u00fd soud) (\u201cRegional Court\u201d), after a public hearing held on 5 November 1992 in which the applicant had participated, quashed the judgment of the District Court and stayed the proceedings. It found that, in accordance with Section 4(1) of the Municipalities Act No. 367/1990 as amended (z\u00e1kon o obc\u00edch), a municipality (obec) had a legal personality. However, according to Section 58(1) and (4)(a) of this Act, a municipality office was an organ of the municipality without legal personality. Accordingly, the Town Office could not be a party to the proceedings. The ruling was not given in public.", "On 26 September 1994 the applicant filed an appeal on points of law (dovol\u00e1n\u00ed) challenging the legal opinion of the Regional Court. He further maintained that his appeal had been dealt with by judges who should have been excluded for bias because of their knowledge of another action brought by the applicant against some judges of the Regional Court. On 17 May 1995 a lawyer appointed by the applicant informed the High Court (Vrchn\u00ed soud) that he agreed with the content of the applicant\u2019s appeal.", "On 29 November 1995 the High Court, without a public hearing, rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal. The Court confirmed the finding of the Regional Court that the applicant\u2019s action had been brought against the Town Office which did not have legal personality and which, therefore, could not be a party to the proceedings. It found unsubstantiated the applicant\u2019s objection concerning the exclusion of the judges stating that by a decision of 19 July 1994, referred to by the applicant, the High Court had excluded all judges of the Regional Court because of their relation to two defendants in other proceedings brought by the applicant, who did not participate in the present proceedings.", "On 14 February 1996 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal alleging a violation of his right to judicial protection under Articles 90 and 95 of the Constitution and Articles 36, 37 and 38 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms (\uf041Charter\uf040). He claimed in particular that the courts had not complied with their duty under Section 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure to advise the applicant to change the defendant. He referred in this regard to the judgment of the Constitutional Court No. II \u00daS 79/94 concerning a similar problem. He also submitted that he was in a difficult financial situation, that the Czech Bar Association had refused to appoint for him a lawyer for the purposes of the constitutional appeal and that he did not have access to the court-file of the District Court because it had been sent to the High Court. On the same day, the applicant\u2019s constitutional appeal was submitted by a lawyer.", "On 11 July 1996 the Constitutional Court declared the applicant\u2019s appeal manifestly ill-founded. The Court held that the applicant was wrong in his opinion that the ordinary courts are generally and in any case obliged to advise a claimant on the legal capacity to be a party to the proceedings, and on who could or could not be the defendant in a particular case. The claimant is free to specify the defendant but must be sure that the defendant can be a party to the proceedings. The Court stated that the question who was authorised to dismiss the applicant and who, therefore, could be a party to the proceedings, was the subject-matter of those proceedings and that this question had been duly clarified in the course of the proceedings. Therefore, it was not explicitly included, as one of the court\u2019s obligations, to advise the applicant in this regard. In particular, the District Court had concluded that there was no reason to declare the dismissal void on the ground that the Town had no authority to do it. Accordingly, the applicant could have concluded that it was necessary to change the defendant in his appeal. The fact that he did not do so could not be considered as a violation of his right to judicial protection as provided for in Article 90 of the Constitution and in Section 36 of the Charter. The Constitutional Court finally stated that its judgment, referred to by the applicant, concerned matters of extra-judicial rehabilitation which were different from his case.", "B.
