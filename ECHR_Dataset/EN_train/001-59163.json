On 19 June 1991 the Criminal Department of the Salzburg Customs Office, in summary proceedings, issued a penal order (Strafverf\u00fcgung) against the applicant finding him guilty of attempted smuggling in that he had, on 17 May 1991, when crossing the border between Germany and Austria in his car, failed to declare various goods with a total value of Austrian schillings (ATS) 13,742.

On 14 January 1992 the applicant filed an appeal with the Salzburg Regional Directorate of Finance (Finanzlandesdirektion).

Section 73 of the General Administrative Procedure Act (Allgemeines Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz) deals with the administrative authorities\u2019 duty to decide.

The time-limit can be extended once if the administrative authority can show that there are relevant reasons why it is impossible to reach a decision within the prescribed time-limit. If a decision is made within the prescribed time-limit, the proceedings in respect of the application against the administration\u2019s failure to decide shall be stayed.\u201d", "\u201c(1) Subject to any contrary provision of this Federal Act, the Administrative Court shall give a judgment in all cases.", "...", "(4) In respect of applications under Article 132 of the Federal Constitution, the Administrative Court may initially limit its judgment to a decision on specific relevant points of law and order the authority to make a decision consistent with the determined points of law within a specified time-limit which must not exceed eight weeks. If the Administrative Court does not use that possibility or the authority in question fails to comply with the order, the Administrative Court shall rule on the application against the administration\u2019s failure to decide by giving a judgment on the merits, for which it shall have full discretion in the administrative authority\u2019s stead.\u201d", "20. According to the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment of 30 September 1989 (published in the official text collection VfSlg 12167/89) the Administrative Court can be seized with an application against the administration\u2019s failure to decide under Article 132 of the Federal Constitution, taken in conjunction with section 27 of the Administrative Court Act, also where an authority of first instance failed to give a decision within the statutory six month time-limit, provided that no other remedy (such as a request for a transfer of jurisdiction) lies against the failure to decide.", "21. According to statistical information provided by the Government, the Administrative Court dealt with a total of 825 applications against the administration\u2019s failure to decide between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 1999.", "22. In 67,2 % of the cases (555 of 825) the proceedings resulted in the respondent authority giving a decision within four months from the time when the Administrative Court was seized. The Administrative Court took about a month to issue the order to the respondent authority to give the decision within a three-months time-limit (section 36 \u00a7 2 of the Administrative Court Act). In these cases the proceedings before the Administrative Court were discontinued as the applicant\u2019s claim was satisfied (515 of 825 cases), or on the ground that the applicant, having achieved his aim, withdrew the action (40 of 825 cases).", "In 6,7 % of the cases (55 of 825 cases) the respondent authority failed to comply with the Administrative Court\u2019s order and the Administrative Court had itself to give a decision on the merits under section 42 \u00a7 4 of the Administrative Court Act. It did so after an average duration of the proceedings before it of two years and almost three months.", "The remaining 26,1 % of the cases (215 of 825) were rejected by the Administrative Court for lack of jurisdiction or for other grounds of inadmissibility."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
