On the same date the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor issued a decision not to prosecute in respect of the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment. In his decision, the public prosecutor noted that the applicant had been detained in police custody between 17 and 23 November 1998 and that the relevant medical reports did not reveal any sign of violence on the applicant\u2019s person.

On 26 February 2002 the applicant\u2019s lawyer lodged an objection with the Siverek Assize Court against the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor\u2019s decision of 1 February 2002. He requested that persons who had been in police custody at the same time as the applicant be summoned to make statements. He further requested that the doctors who had drawn up the report of 4 August 1999 and Mr A.O., the doctor who had examined the applicant along with 110 other persons on 25 November 1998, be heard. The lawyer also requested that the police officers who had been on duty during the applicant\u2019s detention in custody be determined and the photos of the applicant taken during his detention be included in the file, if there were any.", "24. On 14 March 2002 a single judge at the Siverek Assize Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s objection. In his decision, the judge noted that the applicant had been in police custody between 17 and 23 November 1998 and that the medical report of 23 November 1998, the date on which he was released, did not reveal any sign of violence on the applicant\u2019s person.
