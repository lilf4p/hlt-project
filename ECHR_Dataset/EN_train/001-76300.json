ESTONIA", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 5-3;Violation of Art. 5-5;Remainder inadmissible;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["4. The applicant was born in 1955 in Estonia and lives in Tartu.", "5. In 1995 or 1996 the applicant lodged an application with the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office in which he requested that criminal proceedings be initiated against four persons, including two police officers. The applicant had allegedly been beaten by these men. A prosecutor refused to initiate criminal proceedings.", "6. Subsequently, the same four persons made a report concerning an offence allegedly committed by the applicant. They argued that the applicant had submitted false accusations concerning the beating. On 8 October 1996 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant under Article 174 \u00a7 1 (submitting knowingly false accusations concerning the commission of a criminal offence by another person) of the Criminal Code (Kriminaalkoodeks).", "7. In the following years, the applicant repeatedly failed to appear at the police prefecture when summoned. On several occasions it proved to be impossible to compel him by force to appear (sundtoomine), as he was not present at the address he had indicated and his whereabouts were unknown. On some occasions, when the authorities found him, he refused to familiarise himself with the charges, to give statements or to sign an undertaking not to leave his place of residence (allkiri elukohast mittelahkumise kohta).", "8. According to a forensic psychiatric expert opinion given in 2000 on the request of an investigator, the applicant was not mentally unsound but had a paranoid personality disorder. He was considered to be able to give statements, attend court hearings and serve any punishment.", "9. Also in 2000 a new criminal case was instituted against the applicant, again under Article 174 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code. The case was joined with the case initiated in 1996.", "10. In 2000 and 2001 the period of the preliminary investigation was extended repeatedly due to the applicant\u2019s alleged ill-health. On 28 November 2001 he was compelled by the police to appear in the police prefecture. On the next day, he was presented with the formal charges under Article 174 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code. He refused to make any statements, to familiarise himself with any documents or to sign them.", "11. On 15 January 2002 the prosecutor approved the summary of charges and the criminal case file was sent to the Tartu County Court (Tartu Maakohus).", "12. On 17 January 2002 the County Court committed the applicant for trial and maintained the signed undertaking not to leave his residence as a preventive measure against him. The hearing was scheduled for 26 March 2002.", "By a letter of 24 March 2002 the applicant informed the court that he could not participate in the hearing due to his ill-health. He requested that the hearing be adjourned.", "On 26 March 2002 the hearing was adjourned due to the absence of the applicant and a new hearing was scheduled for 13 June 2002. The court decided that the applicant should be compelled by the police to appear before it on that date.", "As the police was unable to find the applicant and to secure his attendance at the court hearing on 13 June 2002, the hearing was adjourned until 30 September 2002. The court again decided that the applicant had to be compelled by the police to appear in court.", "13. On 30 September 2002 the applicant failed to appear in court. The police had been unable to secure his attendance, as during repeated checks no one had opened the door at his residence. The applicant\u2019s appointed lawyer, the prosecutor and one of the victims had appeared before the court. The County Court decided to adjourn the hearing and to declare the applicant a fugitive. It decided that when found he should be taken into custody (vahi alla v\u00f5tmine) and that a new hearing would be scheduled then. The court relied on Articles 66, 68, 73 \u00a7 1, 209, 218 and 223 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Kriminaalmenetluse koodeks).", "14. The applicant was taken into custody on 2 October 2002 in Tallinn.", "15. He subsequently lodged a complaint addressed to the Tartu Court of Appeal (Tartu Ringkonnakohus). As stated by the applicant in the complaint, \u201c[it was] handed over on 05.10.2002, in the presence of witnesses, to the officer in charge of the Arrest House of the Tallinn Police Prefecture to be transmitted to the Tartu Court of Appeal\u201d.", "A copy of the complaint submitted to the Court by the Government bears a handwritten note \u201cComplaint received. Tartu County Court. 10.10.02\u201d and a seal and signature of a judge of the County Court.", "According to the complaint, the deprivation of the applicant\u2019s liberty was unlawful, as he had not been presented with the decision of the County Court on the basis of which he had been arrested. Moreover, the decision had been taken by the County Court in his absence. He alleged that the registration of his residence at the address where the City Court had sent the summonses had been cancelled. He noted that, according to the Civil Code (General Principles) Act (Tsiviilseadustiku \u00fcldosa seadus), in case the residence of a person could not be determined, the place where he or she was actually staying should be deemed his or her residence. On 2 October 2002 he had stayed in Tallinn and prior to that in Tartu. However, he had not received the summonses. He requested that he be immediately released from custody and that the County Court\u2019s decision concerning his arrest be invalidated.", "16. The applicant was kept in custody until 17 October 2002. On that date the Tartu County Court held a hearing in the presence of the applicant, his appointed lawyer and the prosecutor. The court decided that, as the applicant and his lawyer had not familiarised themselves with the case file, the hearing had to be adjourned. As the applicant alleged that he had not received the summons for the hearing of 30 September 2002 and promised to appear before the court when invited in the future, he was released from custody. The court applied a more lenient preventive measure in respect of the applicant \u2013 a signed undertaking not to leave his place of residence.", "17. On 5 November 2002 the Tartu Court of Appeal adjourned the hearing concerning the applicant\u2019s appeal against the County Court\u2019s decision of 30 September 2002, since the applicant\u2019s lawyer had not appeared.", "On the same day the Court of Appeal received the applicant\u2019s amendments to his appeal. He alleged, inter alia, that he had never signed an undertaking not to leave his place of residence and claimed compensation for his unlawful detention.", "18. On 11 November 2002 the Court of Appeal held a hearing and dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal. It noted that, under Article 73 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, preventive custody could be applied in order to prevent a defendant at trial from evading the criminal proceedings or committing a new crime. It held that the County Court had had good grounds to believe that the applicant was evading the criminal proceedings and that he was in breach of a signed undertaking not to leave his place of residence. He had not reacted to summonses sent to his place of residence and had not answered phone calls. The fact that the applicant had been taken into custody had made it possible, on 17 October 2002, to conduct a hearing, after which the applicant had been released. In respect of the applicant\u2019s allegation that he had never signed an undertaking not to leave his place of residence, the Court of Appeal established, based on the case file, that the applicant had been presented with a decision according to which a prohibition to leave his place of residence had been applied as a preventive measure. The fact that the applicant had refused to sign it could not be interpreted to mean that the measure had not been applied. The preventive measure in the form of a signed undertaking not to leave one\u2019s place of residence was not meant to restrict one\u2019s freedom of movement; its purpose was rather to keep the court informed of the person\u2019s whereabouts so that the criminal proceedings could be conducted without delays. However, in the particular instance, the criminal case could not be conducted without delays, as the applicant had failed to comply with the preventive measure applied under Article 69 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The Court of Appeal noted that it was not possible in those proceedings concerning the appeal against the County Court\u2019s ruling to decide on the compensation claim for damage.", "Under the provisions of the applicable criminal procedure law, the decision of the Court of Appeal was final.", "19. In late 2003 and 2004 the hearings in the criminal case were repeatedly adjourned, mainly due to the applicant\u2019s failure to appear before the court and to comply with the court\u2019s orders concerning his forensic psychiatric expert examination. At the same time, the applicant lodged numerous complaints and appeals against various institutions.", "20. According to a forensic psychiatric examination\u2019s report of 3 August 2005, the state of the applicant\u2019s mind did not allow him to understand and control his acts. He was considered to be unable to give statements before a court or to serve punishment. His compulsory treatment was deemed to be unnecessary, as he presented no danger to himself or to society.", "21. By a decision of 21 September 2005, the County Court found it established that the applicant had committed the acts that he had been charged with. However, since his state of mind had deteriorated, as evidenced by the forensic psychiatric examination\u2019s report, and he was unable to give statements before a court and serve punishment, the criminal proceedings were discontinued. The decision could be appealed against within ten days.", "22. By a decision of 27 September 2005, the Supreme Court (Riigikohus) rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal against several decisions of lower courts, including the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision of 11 November 2002. It held that only a lawyer \u2013 and not the applicant himself \u2013 could appeal against a decision of an appellate court. Moreover, the above decision of the Court of Appeal had been final according to the applicable criminal procedure law.", "23. On 22 October 2005 the applicant lodged an appeal against the County Court\u2019s decision of 21 September 2005.", "24.
