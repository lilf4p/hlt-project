The Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica Regional Court quashed that judgment on 6 February 1996. Subsequently the District Court ordered two expert opinions and took further evidence. On 30 September 1999 the District Court delivered an interim judgment acknowledging that the applicant's claim for compensation for salary was justified as regards the period from 1 February to 31 August 1994.", "The defendant appealed and the file was submitted to the Tren\u010d\u00edn Regional Court on 27 September 1999.

On 27 January 2003 the applicant challenged the Regional Court judges. The objection was submitted to the Supreme Court on 10 February 2003 and, after the objection had been dismissed, the file was returned to the Regional Court on 18 February 2003.", "On 18 March 2003 the Tren\u010d\u00edn Regional Court quashed the first instance decision to discontinue the proceedings in respect of the claim relating to a specific period in 1994 and the relevant compensation.

It rejected the remainder of the applicant's constitutional complaint.", "As regards the complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 relating to the fact that the employer had not paid the salary due to the applicant, the Constitutional Court noted that the issue fell within the jurisdiction of the general courts. It further noted that the proceedings complained of were still pending before ordinary courts and held that it could not prejudge the outcome of those proceedings. In this respect the Constitutional Court also pointed out that it could not take the role of ordinary courts and that its task exclusively consisted of supervising whether the results of interpretation and implementation of law by ordinary courts were compatible with the Constitution or the relevant international treaty.", "The Constitutional Court further found that the applicant's complaint about alleged arbitrariness of the Tren\u010d\u00edn Regional Court's decision of 25 September 2001 had been filed after expiry of the statutory two months' time-limit.", "Finally, in its admissibility decision the Constitutional Court held that, despite certain delays, the period during which the Tren\u010d\u00edn Regional Court had dealt with the case was not excessively long.", "In a finding delivered on 5 May 2004 the Constitutional Court concluded that in the above proceedings the Prievidza District Court had violated the applicant's right to a hearing within a reasonable time.", "As regards the applicant's action of 1993, the Constitutional Court held that the proceedings were not complex and that the applicant by his conduct had caused no particular delays. It found that the District Court had failed to effectively proceed with the case for more than 8 years.", "As to the proceedings concerning the claim of 1994, the Constitutional Court held that the case was not complex and that the applicant, despite the fact that he had availed himself of his procedural rights, was not responsible for their overall length. It found several periods of inactivity imputable to the District Court and held that the overall length of the proceedings was excessive given the nature of the case.", "The Constitutional Court ordered the Prievidza District Court to proceed with the case without further delay. It also granted the applicant 120,000 Slovakian korunas (SKK) as just satisfaction."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
