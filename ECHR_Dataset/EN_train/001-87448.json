The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Ankara.", "8. In the parliamentary elections of 3 November 2002, as a member of the People's Republican Party (CHP), he was elected MP for the Konya constituency to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (\u201cthe National Assembly\u201d).", "9. Prior to his election he practised as a lawyer in Konya and, in the course of his professional activities, two sets of criminal proceedings were brought against him, one for insulting a lawyer and the other for insulting a public official.", "10. As an MP he enjoyed parliamentary immunity.", "11. On 23 December 2002 the Karap\u0131nar public prosecutor applied to the General Directorate of the Ministry of Justice to have the applicant's parliamentary immunity lifted for the purposes of the criminal proceedings against him for insulting a lawyer.", "12. On 17 January 2003 the General Directorate of the Ministry of Justice transmitted the request to the Prime Minister's Office.", "13. On 11 April 2003 the Konya Assize Court (\u201cthe Assize Court\u201d) adopted a decision suspending the criminal proceedings against the applicant for insulting a public official, by virtue of Article 83 of the Constitution (on parliamentary immunity) and Article 253 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.", "14. On 4 December 2003 the Assize Court transmitted the case file to the Ministry of Justice with a view to having the applicant's parliamentary immunity lifted.", "15. On 23 December 2003 the Department of Criminal Affairs of the Ministry of Justice referred the question to the Prime Minister.", "16. The Prime Minister's Office transmitted the case file to the National Assembly's joint committee (\u201cthe joint committee\u201d).", "17. On 28 May 2004, after noting that the applicant had requested the lifting of his immunity, the joint committee decided, in view of the nature of the charges, to stay the proceedings against him for insulting a public official until the end of his term of parliamentary office. It transmitted its decision to the plenary Assembly of the National Assembly (\u201cthe plenary Assembly\u201d).", "18. When the plenary Assembly met on 8 December 2004 the joint committee's report was read and appended to the minutes of the meeting.", "19. On 15 December 2004 the applicant challenged the joint committee's decision. In his pleadings he made the point that parliamentary immunity had not been introduced to render Members of Parliament unaccountable or immune from punishment, but to allow them to discharge their duties wholly independently and dispassionately. Unlike non-liability, he argued, immunity was by nature a relative and temporary privilege. However, the scope of the immunity, the procedure for lifting it and the shortcomings in its implementation had undermined due respect for the National Assembly. The applicant added that it was unacceptable, in a society governed by the rule of law, that an institution originally meant to help MPs to discharge their duties should be transformed into a personal privilege.", "20. On an unspecified date examination of the matter of the lifting of the applicant's parliamentary immunity in the proceedings concerning the insulting of a lawyer was referred to the joint committee under Rules 131 et seq. of the Rules of Procedure of the National Assembly.

His file was then sent before the plenary Assembly.", "23. On 7 February 2005 the Secretariat of the Speaker's Office informed the applicant that the files concerning him had been placed on the agenda of the plenary Assembly.", "24. At the meeting of the plenary Assembly on 16 February 2005 the applicant once again asked to be allowed to avail himself of his right to be judged in a fair trial and requested that the obstacles to his exercise of that right be removed.", "25. The applicant was re-elected as CHP party MP for the Konya constituency in the parliamentary elections of 22 July 2007.", "26.

On 21 March 1994 the Turkish Constitutional Court adopted a series of judgments in cases concerning the lifting of several MPs' parliamentary immunity. Those cases gave the Constitutional Court an opportunity to clarify the scope of parliamentary immunity. The relevant passages of the judgments read as follows:", "\u201ca) Meaning of non-liability and parliamentary immunity", "All democratic countries have granted the members of their legislative assemblies certain privileges and immunities in order to allow them to perform their legislative tasks properly. Quite evidently, the aim of granting the members of legislative assemblies a different status from that enjoyed by other citizens is not to make them a privileged group who are above the law.", "Parliamentary immunity is not an aim; it is a means of enabling MPs to fulfil the nation's wishes in full by perfectly reflecting the wishes of the people within the Assembly.", "Even though Article 83 of the Constitution is entitled \u201cParliamentary Immunity\u201d, it actually establishes two institutions: parliamentary non-liability and parliamentary immunity. The first paragraph of the Article explains that the members of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey are not liable for their votes and statements in the course of the Assembly's work, for the views they express before the Assembly or, unless the Assembly decides otherwise on the proposal of the Speaker, for repeating or revealing these outside the Assembly.", "The second paragraph of the Article stipulates that a Member who is alleged to have committed an offence before or after election may not be arrested, interrogated, detained or tried unless the Assembly decides otherwise. The only cases where this provision does not apply are those where a Member is caught in the act of committing a crime punishable by a heavy penalty, provided that proceedings were initiated before the election, and cases subject to Article 14 of the Constitution.", "Article 83 of the Constitution does not specify on what grounds immunity may be lifted, and the Rules of Procedure of the Assembly do not cover the subject. That does not mean that the legislature has a free hand in the matter. The rationale for immunity and the way in which it has developed over the years show that Parliament's powers concerning the lifting of immunity are not absolute but limited. Furthermore, the fact that immunity has a place in the Constitution means that the rules and aims of immunity must be defined in the light of the rules and aims of the Constitution. There is no doubt that the intention, when immunity was provided for in Article 83, was to allow those responsible for legislative duties to carry them out in the knowledge that they were safely sheltered, and rightly so, from all worry and pressure. In other words, the aim of parliamentary immunity is to ensure that MPs are not prevented from fulfilling their functions, even temporarily, by arbitrary criminal proceedings. So the powers of the legislature in the matter are limited by the purpose for which immunity was institutionalised in the Constitution. (...)", "In criminal proceedings an MP whose parliamentary immunity has been lifted is like any other citizen. He enjoys all the guarantees set out in the Constitution and laws of the Republic of Turkey. All the principles that apply to citizens likewise apply to him. He may, for example, be taken into police custody, questioned, detained and, to all intents and purposes, subjected like any other citizen to all the applicable procedural rules. (...)\u201d", "33. On 29 January 2008 the Secretariat of the National Assembly drew up a list of all the instances of lifting of parliamentary immunity since 1991. According to that list, between 1991 and 2008 the National Assembly lifted the immunity of seventeen MPs. In the course of the 22nd Parliament's life 299 files concerning immunity were forwarded to the joint committee. In 252 cases the committee decided to stay the proceedings until the end of the MP's term of office. In 226 cases that decision was challenged. The files corresponding to those cases were placed on the plenary Assembly's agenda but never examined.", "Since the beginning of the 23rd Parliament, 78 files concerning the lifting of immunity have been sent before the joint committee.

The execution of a criminal sentence imposed on a Member of Parliament either before or after his/her election is to be suspended until s/he ceases to be a member; the statute of limitations does not apply during the term of membership (Article 83(3)).

Political party groups in Parliament shall not hold discussions or take decisions regarding parliamentary immunity (Article 83(5)), nor concerning parliamentary investigations (Article 100(4)). (...)", "93. The GET [GRECO Evaluation Team] was concerned about the extensive list of officials who benefit from different types of immunity in Turkey. It should be noted that parliamentary immunity in the form of \u201cinviolability\u201d is substantially debated and challenged by civil society. The scope of parliamentary immunity has been identified as one of the problem areas in the context of corruption.", "94. The circle of high ranking officials who enjoy immunity (inviolability) stricto sensu under the Constitution is limited to the President of the Republic, members of Parliament, Prime Minister and ministers who in principle are also members of Parliament. (...)", "96. In the view of the GET, the regulation of the lifting of immunity of the members of Parliament (Article 83 of the Constitution and Articles 131-134 of the Regulation of the National Assembly) does not establish adequate conditions for objective considerations within the relevant parliamentary committees. A request by the prosecutor for the lifting of immunity is submitted to the Minister of Justice. After that, the request is transferred to the Office of the Prime Minister. The Office of the Prime Minister finally submits the request to the relevant parliamentary committee, which may delegate to sub-committees further consideration before the parliamentary committee brings the case to the Plenary for decision. No objective criteria have been established as regards the conditions for lifting immunity and the considerations would therefore appear to be political. Moreover, the GET was informed that the procedure may be lengthy, more than a month.", "97. Since 2002, 206 requests to lift the immunity of 115 Members of Parliament had been submitted; 50 of these cases had related to abuse of function. There was no case where the Parliamentary immunity had been lifted. It seems that the established system of Parliamentary immunity and its application in practice constitutes an insuperable obstacle to the investigation, prosecution and adjudication of corruption offences. Therefore, the GET recommends to reconsider the system of immunities of members of Parliament in such a way as to establish specific and objective criteria to be applied when deciding on requests for the lifting of immunities and to ensure that decisions concerning immunity are free from political considerations and are based on the merits of the request submitted by the prosecutor. (...) \u00bb", "41. Most European states recognise two categories of immunity for parliamentarians: firstly, the \"non-liability\" or \"freedom of speech\" of parliamentarians in respect of judicial proceedings over the opinions expressed and votes cast in the discharge of their parliamentary duties; secondly, their \"inviolability\" or \"immunity in the strict sense\", shielding them from all arrest, detention or prosecution without the consent of the chamber to which they belong.", "42. The precise scope of the immunity varies considerably from one country to another. This results in a wide array of legal approaches to its implementation. In some States there is no such institution (The Netherlands, San-Marino). In others its scope is very limited. For example, in the United Kingdom immunity covers civil matters only and MPs enjoy no particular protection in criminal matters and are treated like any other individual. In Ireland and Norway parliamentary immunity serves to prevent MPs from being arrested during sessions or on their way to or from Parliament. It therefore affords them minimal protection.", "43. That said, most of the States Parties to the Convention grant their MPs non-professional immunity from criminal prosecution during their term as MPs (Albania, Germany, Austria \u2013 if the act does not clearly fall outside the ambit of their political activities \u2013 and Cyprus, Spain, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Switzerland) and/or protection against imprisonment or deprivation of liberty (arrest or detention in all those countries which provide for immunity from prosecution, as well as Belgium, France, Georgia, Portugal and Romania). In certain cases MPs are protected from bodily searches, house searches and interception of their communications (Georgia, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Switzerland). Such proceedings or measures may be executed only with the consent of the assembly to which the MP belongs, Except in Cyprus, where such decisions lie with the courts.", "44. In several States the scope of immunity has been restricted, as witnessed by some recent constitutional reforms. In France, for example, since the constitutional reform of 1995, the Chamber's authorisation is no longer necessary for criminal proceedings to be brought, but only for detention, arrest and other judicial supervision measures. A similar change came about in Italy when Constitutional Law no. 3 of 29 October 1993 did away with the need for the prior authorisation of Parliament in order for criminal proceedings to be brought against an MP. In Romania, since the constitutional reform of 2003, senators may be placed under judicial investigation or criminal proceedings may be brought against them for acts not connected with votes cast or political opinions expressed in the course of their duties as senators.", "45. In Germany's Bundestag the practice is generally for a new parliament to lift immunity from prosecution for all offences (with the exception of political defamation) at the start of the session. The aim of this is to protect the reputation of each Member of Parliament, by ensuring that they attract less media attention if proceedings are brought against them. In 2006 the Venice Commission published an opinion concerning a draft decision of the Albanian Parliament on the limitation of parliamentary immunity and the conditions in which authorisation to initiate investigations into corruption offences and abuse of duty may be given. That draft decision is an illustration of the current trend to limit the scope of immunity in European parliaments, at least where immunity from prosecution is concerned.", "46. The duration of parliamentary immunity also varies from one country to another. Some countries extend parliamentary immunity to criminal proceedings brought prior to the MP's election (Germany, Belgium, Spain, Hungary, Italy, Portugal). In other countries, even if parliamentary authorisation is not required in order for proceedings initiated prior to the MP's election to be continued, Parliament may, of its own motion or at the request of the interested party, request the suspension of the proceedings or the waiving of restrictive measures during the MP's term of office (France, Poland, Switzerland).", "47. As to the scope of parliamentary immunity ratione materiae, that is to say the acts it covers, there is a general tendency in the States Parties to the Convention for cases of flagrante delicto to be excluded. In certain constitutions flagrante delicto does not suffice to justify the lifting of parliamentary immunity; the crime must be a particularly serious one (Cyprus, Switzerland, Greece, Portugal, Turkey), but even this does not necessarily prevent Parliament from examining the matter and subsequently requesting the suspension of the proceedings or the custodial measures. In Austria, for example, even if the MP is caught in the act, subsequent legal action may require the authorisation of the Chamber concerned. In some countries the law excludes certain types of act from immunity (the Irish Constitution excludes high treason, felony and breach of the peace, for example) or the criterion may be the severity of the penalty incurred (the Portuguese Constitution excludes, in certain circumstances, deliberate offences punishable with imprisonment for over three years).", "48. Parliamentary immunity may be lifted in most countries, except in those which afford very limited protection to MPs (the United Kingdom, Ireland and Norway).", "49. The procedure for lifting immunity is generally the same. It is usually provided for in the Chamber's Rules of Procedure. It is set in motion by a proposal or a request for authorisation by the competent public authority (in most cases the Principal State Prosecutor), the injured party or the parliamentarian concerned. The request is transmitted to the Speaker of the Parliament, either directly or in certain cases through another authority (Minister of Justice, Prime Minister), then examined by a special or ad hoc parliamentary committee, which gives an opinion after hearing the MP concerned. It is then for the full Chamber to decide, with or without a debate, in private or in public, whether or not to lift immunity. The possibility of appealing against a decision of the Chamber to lift immunity exists in very few countries (Austria, Germany).", "50. The possibility for MPs to waive their own parliamentary immunity is not widespread (Poland, Switzerland) and is sometimes limited to minor offences (summary offences in Hungary) or to specific offences (defamation, in Ireland). Under Poland's Constitution MPs have the right to consent to criminal proceedings. In Switzerland the Federal Assembly Act gives MPs the right to consent in writing to be prosecuted or arrested.", "51. In most of the Contracting States no provision is made for MPs to forgo their immunity of their own free will because immunity is a privilege granted not to MPs on an individual basis but to Parliament, to guarantee its smooth operation. In France provisions governing immunity are traditionally a matter of public policy and MPs cannot renounce it. Any act that violates parliamentary immunity is considered null and void. The question of immunity must be raised by a judge. A similar approach has been adopted in the European Parliament, where renunciation of immunity has no legal effect."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
