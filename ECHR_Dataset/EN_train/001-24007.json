FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant, Mr Siim Altosaar, is an Estonian national currently resident in Estonia. He is represented before the Court by Mr Kari Silvennoinen, a lawyer practising in Helsinki. The respondent Government are represented by their Agent, Mr Arto Kosonen, Director in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "On 29 November 2000 the District Court (k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus, tingsr\u00e4tten) of Helsinki convicted the applicant of an aggravated narcotics offence and sentenced him to imprisonment.", "On 7 February 2001 the Directorate of Immigration (ulkomaalaisvirasto, utl\u00e4nningsverket) ordered the applicant to be deported to Estonia.", "The applicant started to serve his prison sentence on 12 February 2001 in Finland.", "On 12 June 2001 the Court of Appeal (hovioikeus, hovr\u00e4tten) of Helsinki upheld the applicant\u2019s conviction and fixed his sentence at six years and ten months. This judgment was final.", "In a report dated 25 June 2001 the Deputy Governor of the Helsinki Central Prison took a position on the applicant\u2019s placement, noting that he was due to be released on 13 March 2004.", "On 4 September 2002 the Ministry of Justice decided that the applicant should be transferred to Estonia with a view to serving the rest of his sentence there. The Ministry relied on section 19, subsection 2 of Act no. 21/1987 on International Co-operation in the Enforcement of Certain Criminal Sanctions, as amended by Act no. 236/2001, as well as on the Additional Protocol to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons (European Treaty Series no. 167; Finnish Treaty Series no. 42/2001). The applicant\u2019s transfer was subject to the consent of the Estonian Government.", "The applicant appealed to the Administrative Court (hallinto-oikeus, f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen) of Helsinki, arguing that enforcing the transfer order would violate Articles 3 and 5. Firstly, he risked being placed in the same prison as other members of the gang in whose activities he had been involved, two of whom he had denounced during the criminal proceedings. Secondly, the general prison conditions in Estonia were worse. Thirdly, the applicant argued that in Finland he would, as a first-time offender being of good behaviour in prison, be entitled to release on parole after having served only half of his sentence. In Estonia release on parole would arise only when he had served two thirds of his sentence and even then on a more discretionary basis. By ordering that he should serve the rest of his sentence in Estonia the Finnish Ministry effectively prolonged his sentence beyond that which he would have served, had he been allowed to remain in Finland. This was said to be in violation of Article 5.", "In its opinion to the Administrative Court the Ministry of Justice stated the following (as transcribed by the court):", "\u201c... Altosaar has been sentenced to six years and ten months\u2019 imprisonment, of which he will, as a first-time offender, be serving three years and five months. According to the Department for Prison Administration of the Estonian Ministry of Justice as well as its international unit, it would be possible for Altosaar to obtain a conditional release in Estonia on having served two thirds of his sentence, that is to say four years, six months and 20 days. [His] possibility of being released conditionally in Estonia is therefore not significantly smaller than in Finland and the Estonian legislation does not in this respect differ significantly from our own. According to the Estonian authorities, the possibility for Altosaar to obtain a conditional release depends inter alia on factors which [he] himself may influence by his own deeds and behaviour. ... The conditions in which the sentence [would be] served in Estonia [would not] differ significantly from those prevailing in Finland. The prohibition of retroactive criminal law does not apply to the case. ...\u201d", "On 21 March 2003 the Administrative Court refused the applicant\u2019s appeal, finding that, even though he was likely to serve a significantly longer prison sentence in Estonia, this in itself did not constitute a violation of Article 3. Nor were the general prison conditions in the receiving country such as to subject him to a risk of treatment proscribed by Article 3. The risk that he might face on account of having denounced members of the drug gang had not been substantiated. In any event, there was no reason to believe that the Estonian prison authorities would be unable to curb, to the extent possible, any such violence. Nor did the Administrative Court find that Article 5 would be violated as a result of any transfer to Estonia as the sentence he would actually be serving there would not exceed the sentence imposed by the Finnish courts.", "On 7 April 2003 the Finnish Ministry of Justice requested its Estonian counterpart to consent to the applicant\u2019s transfer. On 10 June 2003 the Minister of Justice of Estonia gave consent for the transfer to Estonia. The applicant disputed the consent of the Minister of Justice in Tallinn Administrative Court and requested the annulment of the consent. On 15 October 2003 the Tallinn Administrative Court suspended the proceedings of the administrative case until the application at hand was examined.", "On 28 January 2004 the Governor of the Helsinki prison decided to release the applicant conditionally on 13 March 2004. On that day the applicant was immediately deported to Estonia pursuant to the decision of the Directorate of Immigration of 7 February 2001. According to the information provided by the applicant\u2019s representative on 8 April 2004 the applicant is currently at liberty in Estonia.", "Under Chapter 2, section 13 (580/2001) of the Enforcement of Sentences Act (laki rangaistusten t\u00e4yt\u00e4nt\u00f6\u00f6npanosta, lag om verkst\u00e4llighet av straff) a person sentenced to imprisonment may be conditionally released where he or she has served two thirds or, exceptionally, half of the sentence, in the latter case provided the prisoner has served no prison sentence during the three years preceding the offence.", "Under section 13, subsection 2 of the Act the factors to be taken into account in the decision to release a prisoner conditionally include, inter alia, the nature of and the motives for the offence, the prisoner\u2019s earlier life style and his behaviour in the prison, as well as the situation the prisoner would face on release.", "Pursuant to Chapter 7, section 1, subsection 2 (580/2001) of the Act a prisoner may appeal to a district court inter alia against the postponement of a conditional release on his or her having served two thirds or half of the sentence (whichever is applicable under Chapter 2, section 13).", "In its report of 2001 (no. 2001:6) the Committee on Prison Sentences noted the following (on p. 11):", "\u201c...In the 1990s [a conditional release] was almost never postponed. Following the instruction issued by the Department for Prison Administration of the Ministry of Justice in 1995 (no. 9/011/95) postponements have been very rare and almost exclusively based on the prisoner\u2019s consent. ...\u201d", "And further (on p. 245):", "\u201c[The proposals now made] would not change the existing legislation as regards the possibility of obtaining a conditional release on having served two thirds of a sentence. Nor would there be any change as regards those prisoners, who had served no prison term during the three years preceding their offence and who are [therefore] to be released on having served half of their sentence. ...\u201d", "The objectives of the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons (European Treaty Series no. 112; Finnish Treaty Series no. 13/1987; hereinafter \u201cthe Transfer Convention\u201d), including its Additional Protocol (European Treaty Series no. 167; Finnish Treaty Series no. 42/2001), are to develop international co-operation in the field of criminal law and to further the ends of justice and the social rehabilitation of sentenced persons. According to the Preamble, foreigners who are deprived of their liberty as a result of their commission of a criminal offence should be given the opportunity to serve their sentences within their own society.", "The Transfer Convention entered into force for Finland on 1 May 1987 and the Additional Protocol on 1 August 2001. Estonia ratified the Transfer Convention and the Additional Protocol on 28 April 1997 and 27 October 1999, respectively. They entered into force for Estonia on 1 August 1997 and 1 June 2000, respectively.", "Article 3 \u00a7 1 of the Transfer Convention enables the transfer of a sentenced person from \u201cthe sentencing State\u201d to \u201cthe administering State\u201d provided inter alia that the person in question is a national of the administering State; that he or she (or in some instances a legal representative) consents to the transfer; that the acts or omissions on account of which the sentence has been imposed constitute a criminal offence according to the law of the administering State or would constitute a criminal offence if committed on its territory; and provided that the sentencing and administering States both agree to the transfer.", "Article 9 (\u201cEffect of transfer for administering State\u201d) reads as follows:", "\u201c1.

If, however, this sentence is by its nature or duration incompatible with the law of the administering State, or its law so requires, that State may, by a court or administrative order, adapt the sanction to the punishment or measure prescribed by its own law for a similar offence. As to its nature, the punishment or measure shall, as far as possible, correspond with that imposed by the sentence to be enforced. It shall not aggravate, by its nature or duration, the sanction imposed in the sentencing State, nor exceed the maximum prescribed by the law of the administering State.\u201d", "Article 11 (\u201cConversion of sentence\u201d) reads as follows:", "\u201c1.
