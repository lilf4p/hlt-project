Municipal Court that he had made a further payment for the DNA test.", "34. At a hearing on 15 October 2008 the Z.

County Court about the manner in which the paternity proceedings and the DNA blood test had been conducted by the Z. Municipal Court. He pointed out that M. had refused to come to Croatia to have a sample of K.\u2019s DNA taken. He again requested the Z. County Court to order the Z. Municipal Court to adopt a partial judgment concerning the divorce.", "36. The Z. County Court accepted the applicant\u2019s complaint about the length of the proceedings on 31 October 2008. It found a violation of the applicant\u2019s right to a hearing within a reasonable time, awarded him HRK 5,000 in compensation and ordered the Z. Municipal Court to adopt a decision as soon as possible, and within six months at the latest. The relevant part of the decision reads:", "\u201c ... the overall length of these civil proceedings cannot be said to have complied with the reasonable time requirement. ... Everything suggests that the court has failed to conduct the proceedings in compliance with the principle of efficiency, since over a period of longer than four years the case has still not been decided by the first-instance court ...", "The applicant, as a plaintiff in the proceedings, has contributed to the length of the proceedings, since the court\u2019s summons to some hearings could not be served on him and he failed to appear at these hearings. His contribution to the length of the proceedings can also be observed through the fact that he has failed to comply with the court\u2019s orders in time (for example to pay for the DNA test).\u201d", "37.

Municipal Court that he was insisting on a DNA test, although in the meantime he had been informed by M. that she and K. would not attend to have a DNA sample taken.", "38.

On 23 April 2009 the Supreme Court awarded the applicant further compensation of HRK 3,000 in respect of the length of the proceedings. The relevant part of the decision reads:", "\u201c... This court considers that the conduct of the applicant had no influence on the length of the proceedings. On the contrary, the case file reveals that the applicant has demonstrated a strong resolve to have the proceedings concluded as soon as possible and within a reasonable time; this can be seen by his numerous requests that [the court] decide on his petition for divorce, to which the defendant also agreed at the hearing of 14 December 2004 ... Although the first-instance court pointed out that the applicant had contributed to the length of the proceedings by not complying with the summons to appear at the hearings, it is to be noted that it was only the hearing of 12 June 2007 at which he failed to appear despite having been properly summoned. As regards the hearing of 11 February 2008, the applicant was not properly summoned, since the court summons was returned with the notice \u201cinformed, did not collect\u201d. As to the applicant\u2019s failure to pay for the DNA test, it is to be noted that he requested that the time-limit for this payment be extended since it concerned a significant amount, given his income and his social circumstances, and the fact that he paid certain amounts in instalments on more than one occasion, in accordance with his financial means. This demonstrated his resolve to comply with the court order.\u201d", "42. The applicant further lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court on 22 May 2009 against the above decision of the Supreme Court.", "43. At a hearing on 7 July 2009 the Z.

On 10 September 2009 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint in respect of the length of the proceedings as ill-founded, on the ground that his complaints had been properly addressed by the lower courts.", "47. The Clinical Hospital \u0160. on 21 September 2009 informed the Z. Municipal Court that the parties had failed to appear to have DNA samples taken.", "48. The Z.

Municipal Court that he was withdrawing his action concerning his paternity of K., on the ground that the payment of the requested sum for the DNA test had created an intolerable financial burden for him since he was unemployed and without any source of income. He also asked that the marriage be dissolved as soon as possible since his social benefits depended on his marital status.", "55. At a hearing on 14 January 2010 the parties reached an agreement on child maintenance and contact between the applicant and K. On the same day the Z. Municipal Court dissolved the marriage of the applicant and M. and decided on the amount of the child maintenance and contact between the applicant and his child.
