She is represented before the Court by Ms Irmgard M\u00f6bus-Hohl, a lawyer practising in F\u00f6hren.", "A.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.", "On 24 July 1987 the applicant, who had been living and working in the Federal Republic of Germany, bought a house in Sumpetar (Omi\u0161), Croatia. At that time Croatia was one of the republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) and the applicant, as a citizen of that state, was legally entitled to buy property without restrictions in the whole territory of Yugoslavia. Although she lived in the Federal Republic of Germany, the applicant encountered no obstacles whatsoever to enter Croatia and use her property there.", "After the dissolution of Yugoslavia in 1991, the situation changed significantly for the applicant. As a citizen of Yugoslavia she is now a foreign citizen in Croatia and her entry and stay in the territory of Croatia are subject to some restrictions.", "On 24 June 1992 the applicant requested and on 29 June 1992 obtained a permission for an extended stay in Croatia until 29 June 1993 from the Split Police Department.", "Subsequently the applicant left Croatia and returned to Germany. In her absence the house was burgled and partly demolished.", "On 29 January 1996 the applicant lodged a request for permanent residence in Croatia with the General Consulate of Croatia in Frankfurt, Germany.

On 31 October 1996 the Croatian Ministry of Interior refused her request.", "On 10 January 1997 the applicant instituted administrative proceedings with the Administrative Court, contesting the decision of the Ministry of Interior. On 25 September 1998 that court ruled against the applicant.", "On 13 January 1999 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint arguing that her right to property was violated as she was denied by the Croatian authorities access to her property in Croatia.", "On 17 November 1999 the Constitutional Court rejected her complaint. It found that, although the applicant was the owner of a house in Croatia and despite the fact that she was in bad health, that she was single and with a residence in the Federal Republic of Germany where she had sufficient means for living, she did not satisfy conditions for a permanent residence in Croatia as set out in the Movement and Stay of Aliens Act (Zakon o kretanju i boravku stranaca).", "B.
