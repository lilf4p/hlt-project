FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Violation of Art. 8;Non-pecuniary damage - award", "JUDGES": "Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Jean-Paul Costa;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger", "TEXT": ["4. In their capacity as a lawyer and a law firm, the applicants had been retained by Clinique Les Roches Claires, a public limited company (soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme), to assist and represent it during audit operations conducted into its affairs for the period 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2000 as a result of an audit notice of 10 July 2000.", "5. On 12 June 2001, pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 16 B of the Code of Tax Procedure, the tax authorities applied to the President of the Marseilles tribunal de grande instance to authorise a search and seizure operation to be carried out in the context of the audit of Clinique Les Roches Claires, with a view to obtaining accounting, legal and corporate documents supporting certain declarations, on account of suspected fraudulent activities (price mark-ups and uninvoiced or fictitious transactions).", "6. By a warrant of the same date the President authorised the tax inspectors, assisted by senior police officers, to carry out the searches and seizures required in order to discover evidence of the alleged activities at certain sites where documents or data carriers connected with the suspected fraud might be found, in particular at the applicants\u2019 place of business, since they had been retained to assist and represent Clinique Les Roches Claires and were therefore assumed to be in possession of documents evidencing the suspected fraud on the part of their client.", "7. The judge authorised only one search, setting 20 June 2001 as the time limit for the search and 30 June 2001 as the time-limit for the submission of a report on the operations.", "8. On 13 June 2001, simultaneous searches were conducted at the locations indicated in the warrant issued by the President of the Marseilles tribunal de grande instance. The operations carried out at the applicants\u2019 place of business by four tax inspectors took place between 7.30 a.m. and 1.10 p.m., in the presence of the first applicant, the chairman of the Marseilles Bar Association and a senior police officer. On that occasion, the first applicant was given a copy of the warrant of 12 June 2001.", "9. A record of the search and seizure operations and an inventory were drawn up and signed by those present. Sixty-six documents were seized. They included handwritten notes and a document with a comment in the first applicant\u2019s handwriting, in respect of which the chairman of the Bar Association expressly pointed out that these were the lawyer\u2019s personal documents and were accordingly protected by the rule of absolute professional secrecy and could not be seized. The first applicant protested at the way in which the search had been carried out and made a number of observations which were logged in the record. He was given a copy of the record and the documents seized.", "10. The applicants appealed on points of law within the statutory time-limit of five days. In their pleadings in support of the appeal, they raised two grounds alleging that the searches and seizures had been unlawful. They stated in particular, relying on professional secrecy and the rights of the defence, that documents sent by a client to that client\u2019s lawyer and correspondence between them could not be seized where the search was not aimed at establishing proof that the lawyer in question had been involved in the offence. They also complained that the search warrant issued by the President of the tribunal de grande instance had failed to mention specifically that the presence of the chairman of the Bar Association or his or her representative was compulsory during the operations.", "11. In a judgment of 11 December 2002 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal. As to the failure to refer specifically to the presence of the chairman of the Bar Association, the court stated that the search warrant did not have to determine the measures required for professional secrecy to be observed, any breaches thereof being examined in the context of the review of the lawfulness of the operations and not the review of the lawfulness of the warrant. As regards the seizure of the documents at issue, the Court of Cassation considered that the professional secrecy of lawyers did not constitute an obstacle to searches of their premises and seizure of any documents in their possession being authorised, in so far as the judge had found that the information provided by the applicant authority contained sufficient evidence for the suspicion mentioned in the warrant.", "12. The relevant provisions of the Code of Tax Procedure, as applicable at the material time, read as follows:", "\u201cI. If the judicial authority, on an application by the tax authority, considers that presumptions exist that a taxpayer is avoiding the calculation or payment of taxes on revenue or profits or of value added tax by making purchases or sales without invoices, by using or issuing invoices or documents that do not correspond to genuine transactions or by knowingly omitting to make accounting entries or to cause accounting entries to be made or by knowingly making inaccurate or false entries or causing inaccurate or false entries to be made in the accounting records that are required to be kept by the General Tax Code, it may, in accordance with the conditions set out in II, authorise tax officials of at least inspector rank and holding authority from the Director-General of the Revenue to that end to seek proof of such acts by carrying out searches of all premises, including private premises, where evidence and documents relating thereto may be kept and to seize such evidence and documents.", "II. All searches must be authorised by an order of the liberties and detention judge of the tribunal de grande instance for the jurisdiction in which the premises to be searched are located.", "The judge shall verify whether there is concrete evidence that the application for authorisation which has been made to him or her is well-founded. The application must contain all the information in the possession of the authority that may serve to justify a search.", "The order shall include:", "(i) where appropriate, a statement that the president of the tribunal de grande instance has delegated the requisite power;", "(ii) the address of the premises to be searched;", "(iii) the name and capacity of the accredited civil servant who has sought and obtained authorisation to carry out the search.", "The judge shall give reasons for his or her decision by indicating the elements of fact and law on which he or she relies and which raise a presumption in the case before him or her of the existence of the fraudulent acts for which evidence is sought.", "If during the course of the search the accredited officials discover the existence of a safe-deposit box in a financial institution in the name of the person occupying the premises searched in which items of evidence and documents relating to the acts referred to in I are likely to be found, they may, with the permission \u2013 which may be given in any form \u2013 of the judge who made the order, immediately search the safe-deposit box. A reference to such permission shall be entered in the record referred to in IV.", "The search and seizure of documents shall be carried out under the authority and supervision of the judge who authorised them. To that end, he or she shall give all instructions to the officials engaged in the operations.", "He or she shall appoint a senior police officer to assist with the operations and to keep him or her informed of their progress.", "The judge may, if he or she considers it appropriate, attend the premises while the operations are under way.", "He or she may at any time decide to suspend or halt the search.", "The occupier of the premises or his or her representative shall be orally informed of the order on site when the search is carried out and shall receive a full copy of it, for which he or she shall either sign a receipt or initial the record referred to in IV. In the absence of the occupier of the premises or his or her representative, the order shall be served by registered letter with recorded delivery after the search has been performed. Service shall be deemed to have been effected at the date of receipt entered on the delivery form.", "If delivery of the order is not taken, it shall be served personally in accordance with the provisions of Articles 550 et seq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure.", "The time-limit and procedure for appealing shall be set out in the documents accompanying postal or personal service.", "The only remedy against the order referred to in the first sub-paragraph shall be an appeal on points of law in accordance with the rules set out in the Code of Criminal Procedure. Such appeals shall have no suspensive effect. For the purposes of an appeal on points of law, time shall start to run from the date of postal or personal service of the order.", "III. Searches, which may not be started before 6 a.m. or after 9 p.m., shall be conducted in the presence of the occupier of the premises or of his or her representative. If that is not possible, the senior police officer shall appoint two witnesses who shall not be from his or her department or the tax authority.", "The tax-authority officials referred to in I may be assisted by other tax-authority officials who have been accredited in the same conditions as the inspectors.", "The accredited tax officials, the occupier of the premises or his or her representative and the senior police officer are the only persons authorised to see the evidence and documents before their seizure.", "The senior police officer shall ensure that there is no breach of professional confidence and that the rights of the defence are complied with in accordance with the provisions of the third paragraph of Article 56 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Article 58 of that Code shall be applicable.", "IV. A record stating how the operation was organised and how it proceeded and logging any findings shall be compiled forthwith by the tax-authority officials. An inventory of the evidence and documents seized shall be appended to it, where necessary. The record and the inventory shall be signed by the tax-authority officials, a senior police officer and the persons mentioned in the first sub-paragraph of III. Any refusal to sign them shall be noted in the record.", "Should it prove impractical to take an inventory on site, the evidence and documents seized shall be placed under seal. The occupier of the premises or his or her representative shall be informed that he or she may be present when the seals are broken in the presence of the senior police officer. The inventory shall be taken at that time.", "V. The originals of the record and the inventory shall be sent to the judge who issued the search warrant as soon as they have been compiled. A copy of those documents shall be provided to the occupier of the premises or his or her representative.", "The evidence and documents seized shall be returned to the occupier of the premises within six months of the search; however, when criminal proceedings are brought, their return must be authorised by the competent court.", "VI. The tax authorities may not use any information obtained against the taxpayer until the seized items and documents have been returned or reproduced and until the review measures referred to in the first and second sub-paragraphs of Article L. 47 have been implemented.\u201d", "13. The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as applicable at the material time, read as follows:", "\u201cHowever, [the senior police officer] must first take all measures necessary to ensure that professional confidentiality and the rights of the defence are respected.\u201d", "\u201cA search of a lawyer\u2019s chambers or home may only be made by a judge and in the presence of the chairman of the Bar Association or a person delegated by him or her. Only the judge and the chairman of the Bar Association or the person delegated by him or her are entitled to inspect documents discovered during a search with a view to their possible seizure.", "The chairman of the Bar Association or the person delegated by him or her may object to the seizure of a document which the judge intends to carry out if he or she considers that it would be unlawful. The document must then be placed under official seal. These steps shall be noted in an official record indicating the objections of the chairman of the Bar Association or the person delegated by him or her, which shall not be added to the case file. Where other documents have been seized during the search without any objection, the official record shall be separate from that required by Article 57. The official record and the document placed under official seal shall be transmitted to the liberties and detention judge, along with the original or a copy of the case file.", "Within five days of receipt of the documents, the liberties and detention judge shall give a reasoned ruling on the objection, which shall not be open to appeal.", "To this end, he or she shall interview the judge who carried out the search and, where necessary, the public prosecutor and also the lawyer whose chambers or home has been searched and the chairman of the Bar Association or the person delegated by him or her. He or she may open the seal in the presence of these persons.", "Where he or she considers that it is not necessary to seize the document, the liberties and detention judge shall order its immediate return and the destruction of the official record of the operations and, where necessary, the deletion of any reference to that document or its contents in the official case file.", "Otherwise, he or she shall order the inclusion of the document and the official record in the case file. His or her decision shall not prevent the parties from subsequently applying to, the trial court or the investigation division, as appropriate, for the seizure to be declared null and void.\u201d", "14. Section 66-5 of Law no. 71-1130 of 31 December 1971 (amended by Law no. 2004-130 of 11 February 2004) provides:", "\u201cIn all matters, whether with regard to advice or defence, written opinions sent by a lawyer to his or her client or intended for the latter, correspondence between a client and a lawyer, between a lawyer and other lawyers, with the exception, in the latter case, of correspondence marked \u2018official\u2019, meeting notes and, more generally, all documents in a case file shall be covered by professional secrecy.\u201d", "15. The Court of Cassation has held that the seizure of correspondence between a person under investigation and that person\u2019s lawyer may only be ordered and pursued if the documents seized are capable of establishing proof of the lawyer\u2019s participation in an offence (see in particular Court of Cassation (Criminal Division), 12 March 1992, Bulletin criminel no. 112; 20 January 1993, Bulletin criminel no. 29; Court of Cassation (Commercial Division), 5 May 1998, Bulletin IV, no. 147; Court of Cassation (Criminal Division), 5 Oct. 1999, Bulletin criminel no. 206; 27 June 2001, Bulletin criminel no. 163). Observance of the principle of the confidentiality of exchanges between a lawyer and his or her client is not limited to seizures, but extends to other measures that might affect it (for example, a measure such as the tapping of a lawyer\u2019s private and/or personal telephone line must be preceded by a specific finding that credible evidence exists of the lawyer\u2019s participation in an offence: Court of Cassation (Criminal Division), 15 January 1997, Bulletin criminel no. 14; 8 November 2000, Bulletin criminel no. 335; Court of Cassation (Criminal Division), 18 January 2006, appeal no. 05-86.447).", "\u201c18. Community law, which derives from not only the economic but also the legal interpenetration of the Member States, must take into account the principles and concepts common to the laws of those States concerning the observance of confidentiality, in particular, as regards certain communications between lawyer and client. That confidentiality serves the requirements, the importance of which is recognised in all of the Member States, that any person must be able, without constraint, to consult a lawyer whose profession entails the giving of independent legal advice to all those in need of it.", "19. As far as the protection of written communications between lawyer and client is concerned, it is apparent from the legal systems of the Member States that, although the principle of such protection is generally recognised, its scope and the criteria for applying it vary ...", "21. Apart from these differences, however, there are to be found in the national laws of the Member States common criteria inasmuch as those laws protect, in similar circumstances, the confidentiality of written communications between lawyer and client provided that, on the one hand, such communications are made for the purpose and in the interests of the client\u2019s rights of defence and, on the other hand, they emanate from independent lawyers , that is to say, lawyers who are not bound to the client by a relationship of employment ...", "23. As far as the first of those two conditions is concerned, in Regulation ... care is taken to ensure that the rights of the defence may be exercised to the full, and the protection of the confidentiality of written communications between lawyer and client is an essential corollary to those rights.", "24. As regards the second condition, it should be stated that the requirement as to the position and status as an independent lawyer, which must be fulfilled by the legal adviser from whom the written communications which may be protected emanate, is based on a conception of the lawyer\u2019s role as collaborating in the administration of justice by the courts and as being required to provide, in full independence, and in the over-riding interests of that cause, such legal assistance as the client needs. The counterpart of that protection lies in the rules of professional ethics and discipline ... Such a conception reflects the legal traditions common to the Member States and is also to be found in legal order of the Community ...\u201d", "16. In this case the CJEC recognised the specific nature of the profession of lawyer. In his submissions presented on 10 July 2001, the Advocate-General Philippe L\u00e9ger considered, in particular, as follows:", "\u201c182. Professional secrecy forms the basis of the relationship of trust between lawyer and client. It requires the lawyer not to divulge any information imparted by the client and extends ratione temporis to the period after the lawyer has ceased to act for the client and ratione personae to third parties. Professional secrecy also constitutes an \u2018essential guarantee of the freedom of the individual and of the proper working of justice\u2019, so that in most Member States it is a matter of public policy.\u201d", "17. Directive 91/308/EEC states that lawyers are obliged to inform the competent authorities of any fact which could be an indication of money laundering. The particular protection to be afforded to lawyers and the possible exceptions thereto are the subject of debate in the context of a dispute before the CJEC, in relation to Directive 91/308/EEC and the obligation on lawyers to inform and co-operate with the authorities responsible for the fight against money laundering.", "18. In its judgment of 26 June 2007 (Ordre des barreaux francophones et germanophones, Ordre fran\u00e7ais des avocats du barreau de Bruxelles, Ordre des barreaux flamands, Ordre n\u00e9erlandais des avocats du barreau de Bruxelles against Conseil des ministres, Case C-305/05), the ECJ ruled that the obligations of information and cooperation with the authorities responsible for combating money laundering did not infringe Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention for the following reasons:", "\u2013 these obligations \u201capply to lawyers only insofar as they advise their client in the preparation or execution of certain transactions, essentially those of a financial nature or concerning real estate\u201d, that is, in a context with no link to judicial proceedings;", "\u2013 furthermore, again in the context of these transactions, as soon as the lawyer is called upon for assistance in defending the client or in representing him before the courts, or for advice as to the manner of instituting or avoiding proceedings, that lawyer is exempt from the obligations of information and cooperation (regardless of when the information was received).", "19.
