She was given seven medical examinations:", "(a) In a report of 19 February 1996, a forensic doctor said that he had found no marks on Mrs \u00d6ktem's body that were consistent with assault.

They also lodged a complaint against O.T. (the Istanbul police commissioner) and R.A. (the deputy director of the Istanbul anti-terrorist branch). They argued that these two senior police officers were the hierarchical superiors of the police officers who had subjected them to torture.

On 21 February 1997 the Istanbul public prosecutor's office decided not to take any action on the complaint. However, the applicants say that on 5 December 1997 the President of the Beyo\u011flu Assize Court set aside that decision following an appeal by the applicants' representative.", "77. By an indictment that was lodged on 4 March 1997, the public prosecutor instituted criminal proceedings in the Istanbul Assize Court against five police officers (Mustafa Taner Payla\u015fan, Ahmet Bereket, Fatih Berkup, Mehmet A. \u00c7avdar and Yakup Do\u011fan) for an offence under Article 243 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 96 below).", "78. The first hearing in the case took place on 26 May 1997 in the Istanbul Assize Court, in the absence of the five police officers. The Assize Court heard the applicants, who complained in particular of the decision not to prosecute Mustafa Sara. In addition, Mrs \u00d6ktem testified that she had suffered a miscarriage after being assaulted and subjected to repeated blows to the abdomen while in custody. With the exception of \u0130zzet Tokur, Ebru Karahanc\u0131, \u00d6zg\u00fcr \u00d6ktem and \u013asmail Altun, the applicants applied to be joined to the criminal proceedings as civil parties under Article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 98 below). That application was granted.", "79. On 7 July 1997 a brawl broke out between the applicants and members of the security forces as nine of the applicants (Z\u00fclcihan \u015eahin, Sinan Kaya, \u0130smail Altun, M\u00fc\u015ftak Erhan \u0130l, Arzu Kemano\u011flu, Okan Kablan, Devrim \u00d6ktem, \u00d6zg\u00fcr \u00d6ktem and B\u00fclent Gedik) were being taken to the hearing room in the Istanbul court-house. The Istanbul Assize Court proceeded with the hearing, which it began by hearing evidence from the four defendant police officers who were present, namely Mustafa Taner Payla\u015fan, Fatih Berkup, Mehmet A. \u00c7avdar and Yakup Do\u011fan.", "80. At the hearing the applicants formally identified those police officers. The Assize Court decided that it was unnecessary to remand the accused in custody and adjourned the question of whether Mustafa Sara should be prosecuted to a later date.", "81. At a hearing on 20 October 1997, Mr \u00d6ktem (the father of Mrs \u00d6ktem and Mr \u00d6ktem) and Miss Karahanc\u0131 gave evidence. The latter said that she was unable to identify anyone, as she had been kept blindfolded throughout her time in police custody.", "82. The testimony of one of the accused, Ahmet Bereket, was obtained on commission and placed in the case file of the Assize Court on 29 July 1997.", "83. At a hearing on 25 December 1997, the Assize Court sought to establish the addresses of two of the victims, A. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 and Ay. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7, so that their testimony, which was not on the case file, could be obtained.", "84. At a hearing on 11 March 1998, Mr A. Tunga gave evidence.", "85. On 7 January 1998 a supplementary indictment was lodged by the public prosecutor, accusing police officer Mustafa Sara of ill-treatment with a view to extracting confessions.", "86. On 14 April 1998 evidence was taken from Mustafa Sara on commission and placed in the case file.", "87. Between 21 May 1998 and 25 December 2002 the Assize Court held approximately thirty hearings, at which it sought, inter alia, to establish the addresses of a witness and of a victim with a view to serving them with witness summonses. Although the applicants' representatives urged the Assize Court on 24 June 1999, 20 November 2001 and 23 December 2001 to dispense with the evidence of the two people concerned, it did not accede to their request until 13 February 2002.", "88. At a hearing on 17 July 2002, the representative acting for Mustafa Taner Payla\u015fan, Fatih Berkup and Yakup Do\u011fan informed the Assize Court that he was withdrawing from the case. The court was also informed that Mehmet A. \u00c7avdar had died.", "89. On 1 October 2002 the applicants' representatives asked the Assize Court to expedite the proceedings, as there was a danger that the prosecution of the offences would become statute-barred.", "90. At a hearing on 20 November 2002, Yakup Do\u011fan sought an adjournment to enable him to obtain legal representation. Mustafa Sara lodged a medical certificate excusing his absence. The Assize Court granted the defendants an extension of time. From the case file it would seem that Mustafa Sara never in fact appeared before the Assize Court.", "91. At a hearing on 25 December 2002, the public prosecutor made his submissions. He sought an order dismissing the criminal proceedings against Mehmet A. \u00c7avdar, who had died, and against Mustafa Taner Payla\u015fan, Ahmet Bereket, Fatih Berkup and Yakup Do\u011fan under the statute of limitations. As regards Mustafa Sara, he sought a conviction only on the count of torturing B\u00fclent Gedik. He submitted that Mustafa Sara should be acquitted on the other charges.", "92. In a judgment of 5 February 2003, the Assize Court decided to discontinue the proceedings against the defendants Mustafa Taner Payla\u015fan, Ahmet Bereket, Fatih Berkup and Yakup Do\u011fan by virtue of the statute of limitations and against Mehmet A. \u00c7avdar on the ground of intervening death. It found Mustafa Sara guilty of torturing Mr Gedik and Mrs \u00d6ktem and sentenced him to two years' imprisonment. It also made an order prohibiting him from holding public office for a period of six months. However, it acquitted him on the other charges.", "...", "94. The case is currently pending before the Court of Cassation.", "95. At the material time section 16 of Law no. 2845 on procedure in the national security courts provided that any person arrested in connection with an offence within the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts had to be brought before a judge within forty-eight hours at the latest or, if the offence was a joint one committed outside the region under emergency rule, within fifteen days, not including the time needed to convey the detainee to the judge.", "96. Under the Turkish Criminal Code, it is an offence for a public official to subject a person to torture or ill-treatment (Article 243 in relation to torture and Article 245 in relation to ill-treatment). The authorities' obligations in respect of conducting a preliminary investigation into acts or omissions capable of constituting such offences that have been brought to their attention are governed by Articles 151 to 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Offences may be reported to the authorities and the security forces as well as to the public prosecutor's office. Complaints may be made orally or in writing. If a complaint is made orally, the authority must keep a record (Article 151).", "By Article 235 of the Criminal Code, any public official who fails to report to the police or a public prosecutor's office an offence of which he has become aware in the course of his duties is liable to imprisonment. A public prosecutor who is informed by any means whatsoever of a situation that gives rise to suspicion that an offence has been committed is obliged to investigate the facts in order to decide whether or not there should be a prosecution (Article 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).", "97. Under Article 102 of the Criminal Code, taken in conjunction with Articles 243 and 245, a prosecution for an offence of ill-treatment or torture by a public official must be brought within five years.", "98. Article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure also contains a provision allowing victims of crime to join the proceedings as \u201cintervening parties\u201d alongside the prosecution. As a direct victim, an intervening party may also claim reparation for any loss sustained as a result of the offence provided that he or she has not previously brought an action in the civil courts. The admissibility of applications to join the proceedings as an intervening party is determined by the judge, after hearing representations from the public prosecutor's office (Article 366 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).

Under the Code of Obligations, anyone who suffers damage as a result of an illegal or tortious act may bring an action for damages for pecuniary loss (Articles 41 to 46) and non-pecuniary loss (Article 47).

This is not an absolute rule, however. When an act is found to be illegal or tortious and, consequently, is no longer an \u201cadministrative act\u201d or deed, the civil courts may allow a claim for damages to be made against the official concerned, without prejudice to the victim's right to bring an action against the authority on the basis of its joint liability as the official's employer (Article 50 of the Code of Obligations).", "100.
