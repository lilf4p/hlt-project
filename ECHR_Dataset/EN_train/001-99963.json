Lazareska Gerovska.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "On 15 November 2000 the applicant was appointed as a bishop (\u0415\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0410\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0458 \u043d\u0430 \u041f\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0415\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0458\u0430) in the Macedonian Orthodox Church (\u201cthe Church\u201d). By a decision of 11 April 2001, he designated the monastery \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a Dimitrij in Veles as his residence.

On 26 June 2002 considerable number of people (according to the Government 1,500 and according to the applicant, less than 100 people) gathered at the main square in Veles protesting against his decision and requesting his dismissal from the Church. By a decision of 28 June 2002, which was made public through the media, the Holy Synod of the Church (\u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0410\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0458\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0421\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0434) invited the applicant to reunite with the Church within seven days. When he refused, on 3 July 2002 another public protest was organised at the main square in the city of Kavadarci.", "At an extraordinary meeting of 5 July 2002, the Holy Synod of the Church, by unanimous decision, dismissed the applicant from his office on the ground that, by his unilateral accession to the Serbian Orthodox Church, he had violated the oath (\u0415\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0441\u043a\u043e \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435/ \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0432\u0430) by which he had bound himself to safeguard the Church\u2019s unity and Constitution. It designated the monastery \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0403\u043e\u0440\u0453\u0438 in Negotino (\u201cthe monastery\u201d) as his new place of residence and work. It further invited the applicant to reunite with the Church within thirty days, failing which other measures would be taken in accordance with its rules. It was also decided that the Holy Synod would run the Eparchy building with effect from 6 July 2002 (\u201cthe dismissal decision\u201d).", "By a decision of 6 July 2002, a Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) was set up to take the Eparchy building, furniture and funds from the applicant. The media were also informed about the above decisions.", "On the same day the Church requested the Ministry of the Interior (\u201cthe Ministry\u201d) to assist with the implementation of its decisions. The request stated, inter alia:", "\u201c...Due to the possible obstruction of the enforcement of this decision by the Archbishop Jovan [the applicant] or someone else, we request the Veles office of the Ministry of the Interior to take any necessary measures for its implementation...\u201d", "On 6 July 2002 police officers were deployed around the Eparchy building. At around noon, representatives of the Commission (\u201cthe archbishops\u201d, \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0438) arrived in order to hand over the dismissal decision to the applicant and to take the Eparchy building. They were greeted by a group of people that have gathered in front of the entrance. The door of the Eparchy building was locked. The archbishops waited for the applicant and the other staff, who were at that moment inside the Eparchy building, to open the door. In the meantime, the number of people gathered in front of the Eparchy building increased considerably. Due to the increased tension and indications of security risks for the public order, the life and health of the applicant and other personnel in the Eparchy building, the Ministry sent a group of fifteen police officers. After an hour, the archbishops took measures to break in the Eparchy building. In this connection they instructed a locksmith to break the lock. In view of the security risks, several police officers, with the consent of the archbishops, entered the Eparchy building. After having entered, the archbishops discussed with the applicant. The police secured the Eparchy building in order to prevent the crowd from breaking in. The police assessed the situation as critical and advised the applicant that his further stay in the Eparchy building, without protection, would not be safe. In such circumstances, the applicant agreed to leave by the back door. Then, the applicant and the personnel got into a car of the Church and escorted by the police went to the monastery.", "The Government submitted a DVD containing video and audio material (3, 38 min.) regarding the applicant\u2019s eviction. According to it, when the archbishops arrived on the scene, there were people gathered in front of the Eparchy building and media representatives. At that moment, no policeman could be seen. Then a locksmith opened the door. According to an explanation given by a journalist, the lock was broken on the request of one of the archbishops. After forty-five minutes waiting, the archbishops entered the Eparchy building first. After four hours, the applicant left the Eparchy building with a car of the Church. At that moment, several policemen can be seen making a passage for the applicant\u2019s car to leave the scene. At that moment, many more people were gathered in front of the Eparchy building.", "The applicant contested the Government\u2019s version of events. He referred to the facts as established by the first-instance court in the civil proceedings described below, which the Ministry had not contested at that time. He argued in particular that the police had accompanied the archbishops on their arrival in the Eparchy building and that the locksmith had arrived with a car secured by the police.", "In July 2002 the applicant, who was represented by counsel, brought a civil action against the State and the Ministry for interference with and deprivation of possession (\u0441\u043c\u0435\u045c\u0430\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435) of the Eparchy building. He also sought restoration in the previous state (\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0458\u0431\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0432\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u043e \u0431\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0432\u043e \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043c\u0435\u045c\u0435\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435\u0442\u043e \u0438 \u043e\u0434\u0437\u0435\u043c\u0430\u045a\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0442\u043e). He claimed that at around 1 p.m. on 6 July 2002 the Ministry had interfered with his right of peaceful enjoyment of the Eparchy building which had also served as his home. He alleged that fifteen fully-equipped police officers had broken the lock, with the assistance of a locksmith, and entered the building, despite the fact that there had been no decision of a State body authorising the police forcibly to enforce the dismissal decision. After the break-in, Mr T. and Mr A., the archbishops, had served the dismissal decision on him, with which he had refused to comply. He further alleged that he had been searched and insulted by police officers. He requested that the court take oral evidence from him, Mr P.T., Mr K.G., Mr S.I., Ms C.B., personnel in the Eparchy building who had eye-witnessed the event, Mr T. and Mr A.", "The applicant based his claim, inter alia, on Articles 19 \u00a7 3, 26 and 50 of the Constitution (see \u201cRelevant domestic law and practice\u201d below).", "The Ministry replied, inter alia, that it had acted on the Church\u2019s request to enforce the dismissal decision with the aim of securing the place and preventing the disorder which had reasonably been expected to occur. Its purpose had been to protect not only the personal safety and property of the persons who had gathered, but those of the applicant as well.", "On 17 February 2003 the Veles Court of First Instance, relying on section 181(3) of the Ownership and other Property Rights Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim. Relying inter alia on the statements given by the applicant, Mr P.T., Mr K.G., Mr S.I. and Ms C.B. it established the following: that the Eparchy building had been the applicant\u2019s permanent residence, namely, that the upper floor had served as a place of residence for him and the other personnel and that the working premises of the Eparchy had been on the lower floor; that at around noon on 6 July 2002, media representatives and a group of people had gathered in front of the Eparchy building. As the applicant and other members of the staff had refused to open the door, the police, assisted by a locksmith, had broken in and searched the applicant, staff and premises. The applicant had had a discussion with the archbishops and after he had refused to cooperate, the police coordinator had ordered the applicant and the personnel to leave the Eparchy building by the back door. The applicant and the personnel had then got into a car and, escorted by the police, gone to the monastery.", "The court held that:", "\u201c...it is undisputed that the plaintiff [the applicant] had possession of the Povardarska Eparchy, which had served not only as the plaintiff\u2019s [the applicant\u2019s] place of work for his duties as a bishop, but also as his home... having regard to the anticipated obstruction by the plaintiff [applicant] or others and on the basis of the decision of 6 July 2002, the President of the Holy Synod of the Church requested [the Ministry] to enforce its decision ... As the plaintiff [the applicant] had refused to [repudiate his previous conduct], it appears that the Holy Synod\u2019s anticipated doubts concerning enforcement of the decision and the request for police intervention were reasonable... The plaintiff [the applicant] and the personnel were taken out by the back door of the Eparchy building in order to avoid any contact with the people and any possible assault ...\u201d", "The applicant appealed on the grounds, inter alia, that the lower court had dismissed his claim despite having established that he had had possession of the Eparchy building, which had also served as his place of residence, and that that possession had been forcibly appropriated by the police. He complained that the court had wrongly applied section 181(3) of the Act, as the Church\u2019s decision could not be considered \u201ca decision of another body given in accordance with law\u201d. He also complained that the Ministry had acted as an executive body of the Church by enforcing the dismissal decision with the use of force. He again invoked Articles 19 \u00a7 3 and 26 of the Constitution.", "On 29 May 2003 the Skopje Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal, finding it undisputed that the Ministry had acted at the Church\u2019s request.", "On the facts established by the first-instance court, it held that the latter\u2019s decision should have been based on section 168 and not section 181(3) of the Act. The Court of Appeal found that:", "\u201c...the plaintiff [the applicant] had only occupied (\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430) the apartment situated in the Eparchy building on the basis of his position as a bishop. His dismissal from this position and the assignment by the Holy Synod of the Church of the monastery as his permanent place of residence and work entailed the loss of that occupancy. As the plaintiff [the applicant] did not have possession within the meaning of section 167 of the Act, he could not claim protection of the possession under section 184 of the Act.\u201d", "\u201cArticle 19 \u00a7 3", "...The Macedonian Orthodox Church, as well as the Islamic Religious Community in Macedonia, the Catholic Church, Evangelic Methodist Church, Jewish Community and other religious communities and groups are separate from the State and equal before the law.", "Article 26", "The inviolability of the home is guaranteed.", "The right to the inviolability of the home may be restricted only by a court decision for the investigation or prevention of criminal offences or protection of people\u2019s health.", "Article 50", "Every citizen may invoke protection of the freedoms and rights set forth in the Constitution before the courts, including before the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia, in proceedings based on the principles of priority and urgency ...\u201d", "Section 156(1) and (2) of the Act provide that a property owner can bring a civil claim for restitution against the occupier (\u0434\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0442) of an individually specified property.
