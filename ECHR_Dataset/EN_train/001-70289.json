On 20 October 1995 the applicants brought an action in trespass against their neighbours before the Miskolc District Court. The court held nine hearings between 14 February 1996 and 5 January 1998 and obtained an expert opinion. On 15 June 1998 the court partly accepted the applicants' claims.", "6. On appeal, on 4 February 1999 the Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n County Regional Court gave a partial decision. It upheld part of the first-instance decision, but quashed the remainder and remitted the case to the District Court. It appears that the applicants' repeated efforts to have the Regional Court's decision enforced were to no avail.", "7. In the resumed proceedings before the District Court, hearings took place on 12 July, 6 September, 4 October, 14 December 1999, 19 January and 9 March 2000.

In the pending proceedings before the District Court, the applicants were repeatedly requested to clarify their claims at the hearings of 2 and 9 May 2001.", "11. At the applicants' request, on 10 July 2001 the District Court appointed a legal-aid lawyer.", "12.

On appeal, on 1 March 2002 the Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n County Regional Court quashed the first-instance order and remitted the file to the District Court.", "13. In the resumed proceedings, the applicants requested the District Court to hold a hearing in their absence because they felt that their presence at the previous hearings had been useless.", "14. At the hearing on 24 September 2003 the District Court dismissed the applicants' claims. In the absence of an appeal, this decision became final on 25 November 2003.", "15.
