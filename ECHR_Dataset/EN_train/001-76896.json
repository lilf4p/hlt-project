The applicant was born in 1976 and is currently serving a prison sentence.", "5. On 7 May 2003 the applicant was arrested and remanded in custody by an investigating judge of the Novi Sad District Court on suspicion of fraud and murder.", "6. On 4 November 2003 the district public prosecutor\u2019s office in Novi Sad issued an indictment against the applicant on charges of fraud and incitement to commit murder.", "7. On 2 April 2004 the three-judge panel of the Novi Sad District Court extended the applicant\u2019s detention on remand for another two months. In its reasoning, justifying this decision, the panel relied on the applicant\u2019s prior convictions as well as his persistent anti-social behaviour. In addition, the panel expressly stated that the applicant had \u201ccommitted the criminal offences which are the subject of this prosecution\u201d (\u201cpo\u010dinio kriv. dela koja su predmet ove optu\u017ebe\u201d) and concluded that the applicant, if released, would be likely to commit further offences.", "8. On 16 April 2004 the applicant appealed to the Supreme Court of Serbia, requesting that his detention be terminated or, alternatively, that the remand decision be quashed and the case remitted to the Novi Sad District Court for reconsideration. He argued, inter alia, that, since the impugned decision had prejudged the outcome of the pending criminal case, it had blatantly breached his fundamental right to be presumed innocent as \u201cguaranteed in the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia and, indeed, Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\u201d.", "9. On 22 April 2004 the Supreme Court of Serbia dismissed the appeal, focusing exclusively on the applicant\u2019s prior criminal convictions and the alleged danger that he would commit further offences if released. It did not refer to the applicant\u2019s submission concerning the presumption of innocence.", "10. On 27 May 2004 the Novi Sad District Court found the applicant guilty of incitement to murder and sentenced him to eight years in prison.", "11. On 23 September 2004 the Supreme Court of Serbia upheld the judgment of the Novi Sad District Court. As stated by the applicant in a separate case currently pending before this Court (no. 31617/05), his lawyer received that decision on 7 March 2005.", "12.

Article 23 \u00a7 3 of this Constitution provides as follows:", "\u201cNo one shall be considered guilty of a criminal offence until so proved in a final decision of a court of law.\u201d", "15. Articles 199 and 200 of the Obligations Act provided, inter alia, that anyone who had suffered fear, physical pain or, indeed, mental anguish as a consequence of a breach of personal rights (prava li\u010dnosti) was entitled, depending on their duration and intensity, to sue for financial compensation in the civil courts and, in addition, to request other forms of redress \u201cwhich might be capable\u201d of affording adequate non-pecuniary satisfaction.", "16. The relevant provisions of this legislation were as follows:", "\u201cA citizen\u2019s complaint may be filed by anyone who considers that an individual act or action of an institution of Serbia and Montenegro, or a member-State body or organisation exercising public powers, has violated his human or minority rights, if no other avenue of legal redress is available or if redress has not been secured within a member State.\u201d", "\u201cA citizen\u2019s complaint may be lodged within three months from the date of receipt of the individual decision or the commission or cessation of an action in violation of a human or minority right guaranteed by the Constitutional Charter.\u201d", "\u201cIf the Court finds that an individual decision or action is in violation of a human or minority right guaranteed by the Constitutional Charter, it may annul the individual decision in question, prohibit the continuation of such actions or order the implementation of other specific measures and, in view of the circumstances of each case, order the removal of all consequences stemming from such decisions and/or actions.", "The decision of the Court accepting a citizen\u2019s complaint shall constitute a legal basis for requesting compensation, or the removal of other adverse consequences, from a competent body, in accordance with the law.\u201d", "17. In a Council of Europe report on the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro of 30 April 2004, it was stated that the Court of Serbia and Montenegro had still not been established and that the setting-up of such a court had not been considered a priority by the State Union authorities since accession to the Convention (Serbia and Montenegro: Compliance with obligations and commitments and implementation of the post-accession cooperation programme, document presented by the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, fourth report, February-April 2004, \u00a7 27).", "18. In a subsequent report of 13 July 2005, the Council of Europe found that the Court of Serbia and Montenegro had finally started operating in January 2005. The court\u2019s financing, however, had not been fully secured. Lastly, 200 individual human rights complaints had been registered as cases, but no decisions had yet been rendered (Serbia and Montenegro: Compliance with obligations and commitments and implementation of the post-accession cooperation programme, document presented by the Secretary General, eighth report, March-June 2005, \u00a7\u00a7 14 and 44).", "19. In a reservation contained in their instrument of ratification of the Convention and its Protocols, deposited with the Council of Europe on 3 March 2004, the Government of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro stated that \u201cthe provisions of Article 13 shall not apply in relation to the legal remedies within the jurisdiction of the Court of Serbia and Montenegro, until the said Court becomes operational in accordance with Articles 46 to 50 of the Constitutional Charter of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro (Slu\u017ebeni list Srbije i Crne Gore, no. 1/03)\u201d.", "20. This reservation was withdrawn by a letter dated 11 July 2005 from the Permanent Representation of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, which was registered at the Secretariat General on 15 July 2005.", "21. In a letter of 16 January 2006, the Court of Serbia and Montenegro clarified that it was yet to rule in respect of a single \u201ccitizen\u2019s appeal\u201d. It further pointed out that the reason for this was the proposed amendment to the relevant legislation regulating the court\u2019s work which, at the time, was still pending (Statement no. 20/60, provided in the context of a separate application pending before this Court (no. 2361/05)).", "22.
