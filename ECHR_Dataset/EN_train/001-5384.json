In the meantime, the prison officers had allegedly informed other prisoners that he had been convicted of sexual offences against children and that his complaint to the Wadowice District Prosecutor about distribution of pornography had resulted in restrictions on the other prisoners\u2019 access to films and television programmes. This led to a hostile attitude of inmates to the applicant. As from 23 March 1996 the applicant\u2019s inmate beat, kicked and insulted him. On 8 April 1996 a fight broke out between the two of them. It resulted in injuries to the applicant\u2019s head, a broken nose and bruises on his body. During the incident, three or four warders opened the cell door and laughed but they did not intervene.
