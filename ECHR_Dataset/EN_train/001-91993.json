The first applicant (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), was born in 1974 and lives in Budapest. The second and the third applicant, D\u00e1niel Weller and M\u00e1t\u00e9 Weller, the applicant\u2019s twin sons, were born in 2005 and live in Budapest.", "6. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "7. In 2000 the first applicant married a Romanian citizen, who currently lives in Hungary. The couple are raising four children from the previous marriage of the wife and they have successfully claimed numerous allowances on their behalf. On 30 June 2005 the wife gave birth to the second and third applicants. Both of them acquired Hungarian nationality by birth, through their father. At the material time, the mother held a residence permit (tart\u00f3zkod\u00e1si enged\u00e9ly). She was granted a settlement permit (leteleped\u00e9si enged\u00e9ly) in May 2007.", "8. On 7 September 2005 the first applicant requested maternity benefit (anyas\u00e1gi t\u00e1mogat\u00e1s) amounting to 148,000 Hungarian forints (HUF) from the Budapest and Pest County Regional Directorate of the Hungarian Treasury in his own name and on behalf of his children.", "9. On 8 September 2005 the Regional Directorate refused the applicant\u2019s claim. It pointed out that, in the light of the relevant provisions of Act no. 84 of 1998 on Family Support (\u201cthe Act\u201d), only mothers, adoptive parents and guardians were entitled to the benefit in question. It also noted that the natural father might only apply for such an allowance if the mother were deceased. The first applicant appealed.", "10. On 20 January 2006 the Hungarian Treasury dismissed his appeal. The Treasury established that, pursuant to the Act, only mothers with Hungarian citizenship might apply for maternity benefit. It further observed that the Act applies only to those non-Hungarian citizens who have obtained settlement permits (leteleped\u00e9si enged\u00e9ly), being either refugees or citizens of another Member State of the European Union. It concluded that, since the applicant\u2019s wife did not fall into either of these categories, the claim had to be rejected, since the natural father was not entitled to such benefits.", "11. On 6 March 2006 the first applicant sought judicial review before the Pest County Regional Court. He argued that the legal background of the institution of maternity benefit, as well as the decisions of the competent Hungarian authorities, were discriminatory and contravened the Hungarian Constitution and Article 14 of the Convention.", "12. On 5 July 2005 the Regional Court, finding that the administrative authorities\u2019 decisions had been in compliance with the law, dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim. It held, inter alia, that the purpose of maternity benefit was to support the mother and not the entire family or the children, therefore the latter could not be considered to have suffered discrimination.", "13. On 7 August 2006 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court. These proceedings are apparently still pending.", "\u201cThe Act shall be applied \u2013 unless an international treaty regulates otherwise \u2013 to those living on the territory of the Republic of Hungary, who", "a) are Hungarian nationals,", "b) have obtained an immigration or settlement permit, and to those who have been recognised as refugees by the Hungarian authorities,", "c) fall under the scope of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of the Council of 15 October 1968 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community and \u2013 with the exception of the maternity benefit (Chapter IV of the Act) \u2013 of the Regulation (EEC) No. 140//71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community, provided that such persons \u2013 with the exception of frontier workers \u2013 at the time of requesting the allowance have obtained a valid residence permit.\u201d", "\u201c(1) Persons entitled to maternity benefit after giving birth are:", "a) women who, during pregnancy, attended at least four times \u2013 in case of premature birth, once \u2013 prenatal care;", "b) adoptive parents, if the adoption was finally authorised within 180 days of the birth;", "c) the guardian, if the child \u2013 based on a final decision \u2013 was taken into his/her custody within 180 days of the birth.\u201d", "\u201cIf the woman entitled to maternity benefit dies before it is paid, then it shall be paid to the father living under the same roof or, in the absence of such a person, to the guardian of the child.\u201d", "\u201cA request for maternity benefit may be submitted within 180 days of giving birth.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
