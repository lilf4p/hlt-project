The applicant was born in 1970 and lives in the village of Kra\u0161t\u0173, Pasvalys district.", "6. On 31 January 2001 the biggest Lithuanian daily newspaper, Lietuvos Rytas, published a front page article entitled \u201cPasvalys villages paralysed by the fear of death: residents of a remote Lithuanian area shackled by the AIDS threat\u201d (Pasvalio kaimus paraly\u017eavo mirties baim\u0117: nuo\u0161alios Lietuvos vietov\u0117s gyventojai atsid\u016br\u0117 AIDS gr\u0117sm\u0117s gniau\u017etuose). The following statements of particular concern to the applicant were made in the article:", "\u201cNotoriously promiscuous thirty-year old Gitana Biriuk is already sick with this fatal disease ...", "An HIV-positive person lives in a village in Pajie\u0161menys area. This [is] G. Biriuk, an unmarried mother of two children ...", "G. Biriuk was infected with HIV by drug users who come to visit her from Bir\u017eai ...", "A man who had wandered in from somewhere lived in Gitana\u2019s house for a few years. After some time he went away and left \u201ca present\u201d [reference to HIV] for the woman...", "Why is there a great demand for condoms \u2013 in the Kra\u0161t\u0173 village there lives an HIV-positive person. It is an unmarried mother of two children, G. Biriuk... the women in nearby villages are afraid that their husbands will bring the deadly virus home...", "Gitana was very promiscuous. She was always looking for men and used to find them easily...", "Medics at the Pasvalys hospital confirmed that G. Biriuk is HIV-positive. The woman was taken to hospital with tuberculosis. Blood tests revealed that she was HIV-positive ...", "P. Janu\u0161kevi\u010dius, former partner of G. Biriuk... did not hide the fact that he had lived with Gitana for a whole year and they had had intercourse without condoms...", "When [G. Biriuk] was placed in hospital, people said that she looked scary, that she was wizened and therefore was going to die. But the woman recovered...", "The woman [G. Biriuk] has already been diagnosed with AIDS - this is the last stage of the infection. The disease can last from a year up to ten years but finally ends with death.\u201d", "7. The applicant instituted proceedings in the Vilnius City Third District Court, suing the newspaper for non-pecuniary damages in the amount of 50,000 Lithuanian litai (LTL, or about 14,460 euro (EUR)) for a breach of her right to privacy. She referred, inter alia, to Article 8 of the Convention.", "8. On 15 April 2002 the court ruled in favour of the applicant. The court found that the information about the applicant\u2019s private life had been collected and published without her consent. The data about her private life did not correspond to any legitimate public interest. The article had been published on the front page of the newspaper as the sensation of the day, with the aim of increasing sales. The Vilnius City Third District Court noted that publication had humiliated her and caused her significant non-pecuniary damage. The court concluded that, by printing the article and doing so in a humiliating manner, the newspaper had deliberately sought the negative consequences or had intentionally allowed for such consequences. Taking into account the above considerations, the court applied Article 54 \u00a7 1 of the Law on the Provision of Information to the Public, multiplied the statutory sum of LTL 10,000 (about EUR 2,896) by three, and awarded the applicant LTL 30,000 (about EUR 8,676) in compensation for non-pecuniary damage.", "9. The applicant appealed to the Vilnius Regional Court, requesting the maximum award under Article 54 \u00a7 1 of the said Law, namely LTL 50,000. On 17 June 2002 the appellate court reduced the award to LTL 10,000 (about EUR 2,892). It reasoned that the applicant had not proved that the newspaper had published the information about her intentionally and that the first-instance court had had no grounds to triple the statutory sum.", "10. On 15 January 2003 the Supreme Court upheld the appellate court\u2019s decision. It stated that an award in excess of LTL 10,000 under Article 54 \u00a7 1 of the Law on the Provision of Information to the Public could only be granted if it had been established that the information had been published intentionally. The court agreed with the reasoning of the appellate court that, for a breach of privacy, intent was to be regarded as proven if the facts about someone\u2019s private life were disseminated with the purpose of degrading that person (siekant j\u012f sumenkinti). The Supreme Court held, inter alia, as follows:", "\u201cIt is to be stressed that the problem of the interaction between persons who are sick with AIDS and the others is relevant and should be discussed. The relations of the sick with the persons who live nearby are based on the knowledge about the disease we have today and on the understanding of the related dangers. The nature of the disease and the known data about it reasonably raise concern on the part of the people who live in close proximity, to many of whom this question becomes pertinent not from curiosity, but from concern for their personal safety. These are significant arguments, which demonstrate great concern in society, and which attest to the relevance of the question. It should be taken into account that persons who live in proximity [to the applicant] have expressed concern for their safety, which is endangered by the [applicant\u2019s] behaviour, which does not always meet moral standards. In such circumstances the publication of data which breaches a [person\u2019s] privacy, even though such publication violates the [legal] norms which protect privacy, cannot be regarded as an end in itself or intentional, which would be a basis for the application of much stricter liability. [Therefore] the amount of LTL 10,000 as compensation for non-pecuniary damage is considered sufficient\u201d.", "11. Relying on the foregoing considerations, the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal.", "12. Article 22 of the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania provides as relevant:", "\u201cThe private life of a human being shall be inviolable... The law and the courts shall protect everyone from arbitrary or unlawful interference in his private and family life, or from encroachment upon his honour and dignity.\u201c", "13.

Non-pecuniary damage shall be compensated only in cases provided for by laws. Non-pecuniary damage shall be compensated in all cases where it has been incurred due to crime, health impairment or deprivation of life, as well as in other cases provided for by laws. The courts, in assessing the amount of non-pecuniary damage, shall take into consideration the consequences of the damage sustained, the gravity of the fault of the person by whom the damage is caused, his financial status, the amount of pecuniary damage sustained by the aggrieved person, and any other circumstances of importance for the case, as well as the criteria of good faith, justice and reasonableness.\u201d", "16.

In producing and disseminating public information, it is mandatory to ensure a person\u2019s right to have his personal and family life respected.", "2.

The amount of the compensation for non-pecuniary damage may not be in excess of LTL 10,000, except for cases when the court establishes that false information degrading the honour and dignity of a person has been published intentionally. In such cases the amount may, by a decision of a court, be increased, but not more than fivefold. In each case the amount awarded to the plaintiff may not be in excess of five percent of the annual income of the publisher and (or) disseminator of public information. ...", "4. In determining the amount of monetary compensation for non-pecuniary damage, the courts shall take into account the financial circumstances of the person who caused the damage, the gravity of the offence, its consequences and other significant circumstances. ...\u201d", "17.

Privacy of the person should be protected when it is established that information about a person\u2019s private life has been disseminated without his or her consent and in the absence of lawful public interest. Lawful public interest is to be understood as the right of society to receive information about the private life of a person ... where it is necessary to protect the rights and freedoms of others from negative impact. The rights of the person are protected irrespective of whether the disseminated information degrades his or her honour and dignity.\u201d", "19. The Ruling further stipulated that the producer or disseminator of public information who publishes information about an individual\u2019s private life without his or her consent must compensate for the non-pecuniary damage caused. When assessing the monetary compensation for such damage, the courts should take into consideration the guilt of the defendant, his or her behaviour after the dissemination of the information, the negative impact on the plaintiff\u2019s professional or social life and the form and manner in which the information was disseminated, as well as its content and other relevant circumstances.
