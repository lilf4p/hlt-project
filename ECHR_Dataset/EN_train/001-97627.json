The applicant was born in 1968 and is currently in detention.", "5. According to the applicant, on 26 October 1998 he found a small-bore rifle and cartridges. He checked whether the rifle worked and then practised shooting. While doing this he was accompanied by his friend T. At one moment the applicant needed to go to the toilet and went over to some bushes near the road. Behind the bushes he came face to face with two strangers, later identified as E. and D., who allegedly behaved aggressively towards him. According to the applicant, one of the strangers was holding an object in his hand which the applicant took for a gun. Fearing for his life, he fired at one of them in self-defence and left.

The court noted that the prosecutor did have power to conduct the investigation, and that the investigators had searched for the breechblock of the rifle but that after three years it was not possible to remedy the situation with regard to the missing item. The court further noted that the first-instance court should have verified the circumstances of the applicant's confession in the trial proceedings. The court maintained, lastly, that the issue as to whether there was sufficient evidence on which to convict the applicant should be decided by the first-instance court during the examination of the case on the merits.", "25. On 15 April 2002 the applicant was committed for trial. The Donetsk Court also continued to remand the applicant in custody without indicating any grounds.", "26.

On 24 September 2002 the Donetsk Court found the applicant guilty of two murders motivated by hooliganism and sentenced him to fifteen years' imprisonment. The court found that both victims had been killed by the same weapon, which could have been the rifle used by the applicant (conclusive identification was not possible without the missing breechblock). The court established, inter alia, that no other gun had been found at the site of the crime or elsewhere in the neighbourhood, that T. had heard several shots while the applicant had been behind the bushes and that the applicant had behaved normally immediately after the incident and had not shown any signs of agitation. The court further examined the procedural shortcomings of the pre-trial investigation and disregarded the pieces of evidence, including the videotaped reconstruction of events of 31 October 1998, which had been obtained in violation of the applicant's right to defence.", "28. The applicant appealed against the judgment of 24 September 2002 challenging, among other things, the testimonies of witness K. and interpretation of evidence by the court.", "29.

On 16 January 2004 the Debaltsevo Prosecutor's Office refused to institute criminal proceedings against prosecutors Z. and N. following a complaint by the applicant that his right to defence on 31 October 1998 had been violated and that the prosecutors had claimed bribes from him in return for closing the case against him.
