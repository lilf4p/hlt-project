The applicant was declared bankrupt on 2 September 1993 by the District Court (kihlakunnanoikeus, h\u00e4radsr\u00e4tten) of Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4. J., a lawyer practising in Helsinki, was appointed by a court order to act as the official receiver to his estate.", "9. By a written notice, dated 16 September 1993, J. requested the postal service to send all the mail addressed to the applicant to the law office of J. The day before, on 15 September 1993, a meeting was held between the debtor, i.e. the applicant, and the official receiver in the law office of J. According to the Government, it was agreed that the applicant\u2019s mail be transferred to the office and handled so that the official mail was opened, whereas the private mail was put aside to be further transmitted to the applicant. According to the applicant, no such agreement was reached.", "10.

Apparently the letter concerned a valuation of an apartment owned by the applicant\u2019s ex-wife.", "12. On 4 June 1996, the applicant requested the police to investigate the matter. During the police investigation J. said that the applicant had sent him a message after the meeting of 15 September 1993, withdrawing his consent to the transfer of mail and that on 22 or 23 September 1993 the applicant requested the postal service to transfer the mail back to his own address as he considered that the transfer of mail to the law office had been unlawful.", "13.

The applicant was ordered to pay FIM 27,487 (approximately EUR 4,620) in compensation for J.\u2019s legal expenses. The District Court reasoned its decision, inter alia, as follows:", "\u201cThe District Court agrees with the view of [J.] in that the official receiver has, in accordance with Section 50, subsection 2, of the Bankruptcy Act, a right to request that the debtor\u2019s mail be received by the official receiver, excluding the debtor\u2019s personal mail.", "...", "[J.] denied that the estate was in the possession of any other mail addressed to [the applicant], excluding a letter from the insurance company [P.].

The estate was not obliged to return any of the material which belonged to it.", "...", "In the light of the evidence, [J.] has acted in accordance with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act.", "The [applicant\u2019s] claims are rejected as a whole.\u201d", "17. The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal (hovioikeus, hovr\u00e4tten) of Helsinki which, on 15 January 1998, upheld the District Court\u2019s decision. The applicant was ordered to pay J.\u2019s costs of FIM 2,500 (approximately EUR 420).

The relevant sections of the Bankruptcy Act (konkurssis\u00e4\u00e4nt\u00f6, konkursstadga) provided at the relevant time as follows:", "\u201cChapter 4 \u2013 Property belonging to the bankrupt\u2019s estate (759/1991)", "Section 45", "(1) The property belonging to a bankrupt\u2019s estate shall consist of any property which was in the debtor\u2019s possession at the time of lodging a request for the transfer of property with a court of law, or at the time of issue of a court decision on the transfer of property upon a creditor\u2019s request, or which the debtor was to get in his possession before the termination of the bankruptcy proceedings, and which may be lawfully seized, as well as of any property which may be recovered for the estate by virtue of the Act on the Recovery of Property for the Estate of a Bankrupt Person.

If the trustees refuse to account for the assets and debts, the court shall place them under an obligation to do so. Should a person who is appointed executor have previously acted as trustee, he or she shall also give such account to the creditors.\u201d", "21. As the Bankruptcy Act was rather old, a well-established interpretation of its provisions developed. According to literature concerning bankruptcy in Finland (Erkki Havansi, Finnish Bankruptcy Law, 3rd revised edition, Helsinki 1992; in Finnish), the normal duties of temporary bankruptcy trustees during the temporary administration of the bankrupt\u2019s estate included the following: (A) taking over the possession of the property, including (a) collecting information on property, (b) taking into possession, and (c) preservation of property by means of protective measures, and (B) listing of assets and liabilities with the cooperation of the debtor.
