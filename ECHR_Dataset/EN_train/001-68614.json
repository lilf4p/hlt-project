On 27 November 1998 the Tsentralniy District Court of Krasnoyarsk convicted Mr Yevseyev and the applicant's husband, Mr Frizen, of large-scale fraud. The applicant was a witness at the trial. It was established that the accused, while holding managerial positions in the State telecommunication company MTTS, had founded the TMS company that acted as a broker in the procurement of telecommunication equipment for MTTS. They used the MTTS's funds to make advance payments under the contracts for the purchase of telephones signed by TMS and then sold these telephones to MTTS at inflated prices. The court found:", "\u201cBeing managers of MTTS, Frizen and Yevseyev... used their position... to take advantage of the cash flow of [the MTTS] for their personal gain. Moreover, relatives of the defendants were simultaneously employees of the TMS and MTTS and they received a salary from both companies. It was established by the court... that the salary of the TMS employees, loans and dividends were paid out of money that had been taken from [the MTTS]\u201d.", "14.

It is true that, according to the sale certificate of 9 July 1996 and a copy of the vehicle registration card, the car at issue was registered in [the applicant's] name. However, the court considers that the plaintiff's arguments to the effect that she is the legal owner of the car... are unsubstantiated because the judgment of the Tsentralniy District Court of Krasnoyarsk of 27 November 1998... had established that the loan for the purchase of that car had been granted unlawfully and, accordingly, the car had been forfeited as compensation for damage.\u201d", "19. On 6 October 1999 the Civil Division of the Krasnoyarsk Regional Court, on an appeal by the applicant, upheld the judgment of 23 August 1999. The court justified the seizure of the car in the following terms:", "\u201cThe [first-instance] court correctly refused [the applicant's] claim... because the circumstances showing that [the applicant] had purchased the car from her own (borrowed) money had not been confirmed... [T]here is no evidence that the borrowed funds were used for the purchase of the car, the loan was only reimbursed from [the applicant's] salary and the last instalment was paid on 1 January 1997\u201d.", "20.
