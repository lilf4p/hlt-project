The applicant was born in 1975 and is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment.", "6. On 10 June 1998 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking.", "7. On 11 June 1998 the applicant was charged under Article 228 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code with the unlawful purchase and possession of 0.26 grams of opium. On the same day the Prosecutor of the Voroshilovskiy District of Rostov-on-Don remanded the applicant in custody. The Prosecutor referred to the applicant\u2019s criminal record and the risk of his committing other crimes.", "8. On 6 August 1998 the applicant was also charged under Articles 126 \u00a7 2, 139 \u00a7 1, and 163 \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code with kidnapping, unlawful entry into a home and extortion. The case was joined to the case concerning drug trafficking.", "9. On 10 August, 9 September and 5 November 1998 the applicant\u2019s detention was extended until 10 September, 10 November and 10 December 1998 respectively, in accordance with Article 97 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure. Consideration had been given to the gravity of the charges against the applicant and information about his personality, including his criminal record.", "10. On 1 December 1998 the prosecution dropped the charges of kidnapping, unlawful entry into a home and extortion for lack of proof.", "11. On 10 December 1998 the supervising prosecutor approved the bill of indictment and the case against the applicant was sent to the Voroshilovskiy District Court of Rostov-on-Don for trial.", "12. On 10 January 1999 the Voroshilovskiy District Court of Rostov-on-Don convicted the applicant under Article 228 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code and sentenced him to one year\u2019s imprisonment. On an unspecified date the conviction became final. The case file contains no further information as to when the applicant completed his sentence.", "13. On 22 March 1999 the Prosecutor of the Rostov Region quashed the decision of 1 December 1998, and on 24 March 1999 the charges under Articles 126 \u00a7 2, 139 \u00a7 1, and 163 \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code were again brought against the applicant. The prosecutor, having considered the applicant\u2019s criminal record and the gravity of the charges, decided that he should be detained pending trial.", "14. On 12 April, 18 June, 21 September and 3 December 1999 the applicant\u2019s detention was extended until 18 June, 24 September and 18 December 1999 and 24 March 2000 respectively. Each time, consideration was given to the applicant\u2019s criminal record, the gravity of the charges against him and his active role in a gang.", "15. On 20 March 2000 the case against the applicant was sent to the Rostov Regional Court for trial.", "16. On 29 March 2000 the Rostov Regional Court scheduled the opening date of the trial and ordered that the preventive measure \u201cshould remain unchanged\u201d in accordance with Articles 222, 223 and 230 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure.", "17. On 13 June 2000 the Rostov Regional Court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to ten years six months\u2019 imprisonment taking into account that he had not fully served a sentence handed down by the judgment of 10 January 1999. On 2 November 2000, however, the Supreme Court of Russia quashed the judgment on appeal and remitted the case for a retrial. The Supreme Court held that the preventive measure applied to the applicant \u201cshould remain unchanged\u201d.", "18. On 1 December 2000 the Rostov Regional Court scheduled the opening date of the trial and ordered that the preventive measure \u201cshould remain unchanged\u201d.", "19. On 14 May 2001 the Rostov Regional Court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to thirteen years\u2019 imprisonment, but on 16 January 2002 the Supreme Court of Russia quashed the conviction on appeal and remitted the case for a retrial. The Supreme Court held that the preventive measure applied to the applicant \u201cshould remain unchanged\u201d.", "20. On 12 February 2002 the Rostov Regional Court listed the new trial hearing for 27 February 2002 and ordered that the preventive measure applied to the applicant \u201cshould remain unchanged\u201d.", "21. On 1 July 2002 the Rostov Regional Court extended the applicant\u2019s detention until 1 October 2002. It found as follows:", "\u201cThe defendants [the applicant and four other persons] are charged with kidnapping, illegal deprivation of liberty, burglary and other crimes.", "They have been in custody: ..., [the applicant] \u2013 since 10 June 1998, ...", "The Prosecutor requested that the defendants\u2019 detention be extended by 3 months.", "Having examined the Prosecutor\u2019s request, having heard the parties to the proceedings, the court considers it necessary to extend the defendants\u2019 detention by 3 months, that is, until 1 October 2002 inclusive, because they are charged with serious and particularly serious criminal offences.", "Under Articles 255, 256 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, the defendants\u2019 detention on remand is extended by 3 (three) months, that is, from 1 July 2002 to 1 October 2002.\u201d", "22. On 6 November 2002 the Supreme Court of Russia upheld the extension order, finding that it was sufficiently justified.", "23. On 1 October and 31 December 2002 and 31 March, 26 June, 25 September and 15 December 2003 the Rostov Regional Court extended the applicant\u2019s detention until 1 January, 31 March, 30 June, 26 September, 25 December 2003 and 15 March 2004 respectively. The wording of the above decisions was identical to that applied in the decision of 1 July 2002.", "24. The applicant appealed against each of the above extension orders to the Supreme Court arguing that the extension orders were not sufficiently reasoned and that the court had not taken into consideration his individual situation. On 12 February, 14 May, 16 July, 16 October and 24 December 2003 and 31 March 2004 respectively, the Supreme Court of Russia upheld the above decisions on appeal.", "25. In the meantime, on 19 February 2004 the Rostov Regional Court, composed of presiding judge Mr Zh. and lay judges Ms S. and Ms M., extended the applicant\u2019s detention until 19 May 2004. The court used the same stereotyped wording and referred to the seriousness of the charges against the applicant. The applicant again appealed against the extension to the Supreme Court.", "26. On 10 March 2005, that is after the applicant\u2019s conviction by the Regional Court (see paragraph 31 below), the Supreme Court of Russia discontinued the examination of the applicant\u2019s appeal because he had been convicted in the meantime by the Regional Court.", "27. In addition to appealing against the detention extension orders the applicant on a number of occasions in 2003-2004 applied to have the preventive measure changed to a written undertaking not to leave the town. Among his arguments were the rather extended period of time he had spent in detention, his family ties (two minor children and a disabled mother) and his poor health.", "28. On 17 February, 21 June, 25 December 2003 and 2 February and 5 February 2004 the Rostov Regional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s requests. The court\u2019s reasoning was the gravity of the charges against him. The applicant appealed against all of these decisions to the Supreme Court.", "29. In one decision of 10 March 2005, that is after the applicant\u2019s conviction by the Regional Court (see paragraph 31 below), the Supreme Court of Russia rejected all the appeals as follows:", "\u201cThe defendants [the applicant and four other persons] are charged with various crimes, including particularly serious crimes.", "In the course of the proceedings the court dismissed the above requests.", "In their appeals the defendants and lawyers ask for the above decisions to be quashed.", "Having examined the material and the arguments put forward in the appeals, the court finds that the appeal proceedings are to be discontinued, since at the present time the examination of the case has been completed by the pronouncement of the sentence ...\u201d", "30. As regards the trial proceedings in the period from 27 February 2002 to 25 February 2004, the case was adjourned on forty-two occasions. In particular, five hearings were adjourned at the request of the applicant and his co-defendants, who wished to study the case file or the records of the hearings; fourteen hearings were adjourned due to requests by the applicant and his co-defendants for the replacement of their representatives and the need for the newly appointed representatives to study the case file; fifteen hearings were adjourned due to the illness of the representatives and their failure to appear before the court, and eight hearings were adjourned due to the illness of the co-defendants or following their complaints concerning their health.", "31. On 17 May 2004 the Rostov Regional Court, composed of presiding judge Mr Zh. and lay judges Ms S. and Ms M., convicted the applicant of fraud, kidnapping, extortion, robbery, deprivation of liberty, unlawful entry into a home and stealing official documents, and sentenced him to eleven years and six months\u2019 imprisonment.", "32. On 10 March 2005 the Supreme Court of Russia comprising three judges upheld the judgment on appeal, but reduced the applicant\u2019s sentence to eleven years\u2019 imprisonment. One of the judges of the Supreme Court had previously examined the applicant\u2019s case on appeal on 2 November 2000 (see paragraph 17 above) and had also examined, on 16 October 2003, the appeal against the decision of 26 June 2003 to extend the applicant\u2019s detention until 26 September 2003 (see paragraphs 23-24 above). One other judge had previously examined the applicant\u2019s case on appeal on 16 January 2002 (see paragraph 19 above).", "33. As indicated above the applicant was arrested on 10 June 1998. From 15 June 1998 to 25 April 2005 the applicant was held in detention facility IZ-61/1 of Rostov-on-Don (\u0423\u0447\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0418\u0417-61/1 \u0433. \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430-\u043d\u0430-\u0414\u043e\u043d\u0443 \u0423\u0418\u041d \u041c\u042e \u0420\u0424). Throughout this period the applicant was held in twenty-three different cells.", "34. According to the Government\u2019s observations of 12 December 2007, the cells where the applicant was held measured from 6.6 square metres (the punishment cell) to 61.2 square metres, and provided an average space of between three and four square metres per person. The design capacity of the cells was not exceeded.", "35. Windows in the cells, measuring 1-1.2 by 1.1-1.3 m., were covered with white-painted metal screens, which were removed in December 2002. The cells were illuminated with 60-75 watt filament lamps.", "36. All cells were ventilated by a system of exhaust ventilation. In the summertime the window panes were removed in order to provide better access to fresh air. The cells were equipped with a heating system providing an adequate temperature in line with sanitary norms. The average temperature during the summer was maintained at 22 degrees Celsius, and during winter at 18 degrees Celsius.", "37. The cells were equipped with wash basins, hot and cold water taps and lavatory pans elevated 35 cm above the floor and separated from the main area by a two-metre-high brick partition. The arrangement of lavatory pans assured the detainees privacy when using them.", "38. The cells were equipped with potable water tanks. The quality of the drinking water was regularly checked by the facility\u2019s medical staff. Besides, the detainees were allowed to use electric kettles.", "39. In each cell the applicant had an individual bed and was provided with bedding (a mattress, a blanket, a pillow, two bed sheets and a pillow slip).", "40. The cells were also equipped with cupboards for food storage, tables and benches.", "41. The applicant could take a fifteen-minute shower once a week. After each shower, he received fresh bedding. He was given food three times a day in accordance with the established legal norms. The quality of the food was monitored on a regular basis by the medical staff of the detention facility. On the days when the applicant was taken to court, hot food was delivered to the courthouse.", "42. The applicant was allowed a daily one-hour outside walk. The exercise yards were equipped with benches and shelters.", "43. The authorities ensured that regular and additional one-off disinfections and disinfestations were carried out in the detention facility.", "44. Upon admission to the detention facility the applicant was examined by a general practitioner, psychiatrist and surgeon, who found his health to be satisfactory. During the detention period the applicant made requests for medical assistance on several occasions, complaining of headaches and general weakness. Following the medical check-ups he always received appropriate treatment. In January 2001 the applicant complained of an earache and was diagnosed with left-side exudative pleurisy. From 23 January to 22 February 2001 he received treatment in the prison hospital.", "45. In support of their observations the Government provided several certificates issued by the director of IZ-61/1 on 22 October and 26 October 2007, 26 May and 27 May 2008, an uncertified and undated table on the number of persons detained in different cells at the same time as the applicant in March 2002\u2013April 2005, the results of a laboratory examination of the microclimate of the cells (illumination, temperature, relative air humidity and air circulation), the results of bacteriological tests following water and sanitary inspections of the detention facility conducted in 20012005, statements by wardens (although not dated) and persons currently detained in IZ-61/1, a copy of the applicant\u2019s prison card stating that he had been provided with bed sheets, cutlery and clothes, as well as a number of certificates concerning the food ration during the relevant period.", "46. The applicant did not dispute the size of the cells as submitted by the Government. He claimed, however, that the number of detainees considerably exceeded the design capacity of the cells and that the detainees had to sleep in shifts.", "47. The windows in the cells were either heavily barred (cells nos. 44, 48, 43, 42, 50, 76 and 52), or covered with metal screens (cells nos. 39 and 124), or entirely absent (cells nos. 8, 76 and 74). The metal screens were still in place in 2003.", "48. The arrangement of the bunks in two or three tiers left the detainees very limited space and access to daylight. The artificial light in the cells was on around the clock, and disturbed the applicant\u2019s sleep.", "49. The lavatory in the corner of the cell, which had no flush system, was elevated above the floor and separated by a 1.1-metre partition from the wash basin, but not from the living area. The latter two standards had been set by the \u201cDirectives on Planning and Constructing Pre-Trial Detention Facilities of the USSR Ministry of the Interior\u201d, approved on 25 January 1971.", "50. The applicant was never provided with any toiletries.", "51. On the days when the applicant was taken to the courthouse he received no food, since he was taken from his cell before breakfast and brought back after dinner. No food (hot meal or dry ration) was served to the applicant in the courthouse. On such days the applicant was also deprived of outside walks and showers.", "52. The exercise yard was very small and unequipped for physical exercise. The walls of the yard were covered with \u201cshuba\u201d, a sort of abrasive concrete lining designed to prevent detainees from leaning against them.", "53. The cells swarmed with cockroaches and bedbugs. Occasionally the detainees were taken to the \u201cblind\u201d cell no. 106 (with no windows, lavatory or water taps) except for two or three of them who stayed behind and treated the cell against bedbugs using a heating lamp or a torch made of newspapers, and against cockroaches using cockroach poison sent to the detainees by their relatives.", "54. In support of his statements the applicant produced written depositions by three former cellmates, Mr A.R., Mr Y.T. and Mr Y.R. They stated, in particular, that in 2001-2004 cell no. 41, measuring approximately 30 square meters, had housed 45 to 50 inmates at any one time (Mr A.R.\u2019s deposition), and that in 2002-2004 cell no. 46, measuring approximately 40 square meters, had housed over 30 inmates (Mr Y.T.\u2019s deposition) or as many as 85 (Mr Y.R.\u2019s deposition). They also testified that they and the other detainees had slept in shifts.", "55. The Government did not contest that the applicant\u2019s former cellmates were held in the same detention facility as the applicant.", "56. Until 1 July 2002 criminal-law matters were governed by the Code of Criminal Procedure of the RSFSR (Law of 27 October 1960, \u201cthe old CCrP\u201d). From 1 July 2002 the old CCrP was replaced by the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation (Law no. 174-FZ of 18 December 2001, \u201cthe new CCrP\u201d).", "57. \u201cPreventive measures\u201d (\u043c\u0435\u0440\u044b \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f) include an undertaking not to leave a town or region, personal security, bail and detention (Article 89 of the old CCrP, Article 98 of the new CCrP).", "58. The Russian Constitution of 12 December 1993 establishes that a judicial decision is required before a defendant can be detained or his or her detention extended (Article 22).", "Under the old CCrP, a decision ordering detention could be taken by a prosecutor or a court (Articles 11, 89 and 96).", "The new CCrP requires a judicial decision by a district or town court on a reasoned request by a prosecutor supported by appropriate evidence (Article 108 \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3-6).", "59. When deciding whether to remand an accused in custody, the competent authority is required to consider whether there are \u201csufficient grounds to believe\u201d that he or she would abscond during the investigation or trial or obstruct the establishment of the truth or reoffend (Article 89 of the old CCrP). It must also take into account the gravity of the charge, information on the accused\u2019s character, his or her profession, age, state of health, family status and other circumstances (Article 91 of the old CCrP, Article 99 of the new CCrP).", "60. Before 14 March 2001, detention was authorised if the accused was charged with a criminal offence carrying a sentence of at least one year\u2019s imprisonment or if there were \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d in the case (Article 96). On 14 March 2001 the old CCrP was amended to permit defendants to be remanded in custody if the charge carried a sentence of at least two years\u2019 imprisonment or if they had previously defaulted or had no permanent residence in Russia or if their identity could not be ascertained. The amendments of 14 March 2001 also repealed the provision that permitted defendants to be remanded in custody on the sole ground of the dangerous nature of the criminal offence they had committed. The new CCrP reproduced the amended provisions (Articles 97 \u00a7 1 and 108 \u00a7 1) and added that a defendant should not be remanded in custody if a less severe preventive measure was available.", "61. The Codes distinguished between two types of detention: the first being \u201cpending the investigation\u201d, that is while a competent agency \u2013 the police or a prosecutor\u2019s office \u2013 investigated the case, and the second \u201cbefore the court\u201d (or \u201cduring the trial\u201d), that is, while the case was being tried in court. Although there was no difference in practice between them (the detainee was held in the same detention facility), the calculation of the time-limits was different.", "62. After arrest the suspect is placed in custody \u201cpending the investigation\u201d. The maximum permitted period of detention \u201cpending the investigation\u201d is two months but can be extended for up to eighteen months in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d. Extensions were authorised by prosecutors of ascending hierarchical levels (under the old CCrP) but must now be authorised by judicial decisions taken by courts of ascending levels (under the new CCrP). No extension of detention \u201cpending the investigation\u201d beyond eighteen months is possible (Article 97 of the old CCrP, Article 109 \u00a7 4 of the new CCrP).", "63. The period of detention \u201cpending the investigation\u201d is calculated to the day when the prosecutor sent the case to the trial court (Article 97 of the old CCrP, Article 109 \u00a7 9 of the new CCrP).", "64. Access to the case file materials is to be granted no later than one month before the expiry of the authorised detention period (Article 97 of the old CCrP, Article 109 \u00a7 5 of the new CCrP). If the defendant needs more time to study the case file, a judge, on a request by a prosecutor, may grant an extension of detention until such time as the file has been read in full and the case sent for trial (Article 97 of the old CCrP, Article 109 \u00a7 8 (1) of the new CCrP). Under the old CCrP, such an extension could not be granted for longer than six months.", "65. Under the old CCrP, the trial court had the right to remit the case for an \u201cadditional investigation\u201d if it established that procedural defects existed that could not be remedied at the trial. In such cases the defendant\u2019s detention was again classified as \u201cpending the investigation\u201d and the relevant time-limit continued to apply. If, however, the case was remitted for an additional investigation, but the investigators had already used up all the time authorised for detention \u201cpending the investigation\u201d, a supervising prosecutor could nevertheless extend the detention period for one additional month starting from the date he received the case. Subsequent extensions could only be granted if the detention \u201cpending the investigation\u201d had not exceeded eighteen months (Article 97).", "66. From the date the prosecutor forwards the case to the trial court, the defendant\u2019s detention is \u201cbefore the court\u201d (or \u201cduring the trial\u201d).", "67. Before 14 March 2001 the old CCrP set no time-limit for detention \u201cduring the trial\u201d. On 14 March 2001 a new Article 239-1 was inserted which established that the period of detention \u201cduring the trial\u201d could not generally exceed six months from the date the court received the file. However, if there was evidence to show that the defendant\u2019s release might impede a thorough, complete and objective examination of the case, a court could \u2013 of its own motion or on a request by a prosecutor \u2013 extend the detention by no longer than three months. These provisions did not apply to defendants charged with a particularly serious criminal offence.", "68. The new CCrP establishes that the term of detention \u201cduring the trial\u201d is calculated from the date the court received the file and to the date the judgment is given. The period of detention \u201cduring the trial\u201d may not normally exceed six months, but if the case concerns serious or particularly serious criminal offences, the trial court may approve one or more extensions of no longer than three months each (Article 255 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3).", "69. Under the old CCrP, the detainee or his or her counsel or representative could challenge a detention order issued by a prosecutor, and any subsequent extension order, before a court. The judge was required to review the lawfulness of and justification for a detention or extension order no later than three days after receipt of the relevant papers. The review was to be conducted in camera in the presence of a prosecutor and the detainee\u2019s counsel or representative. The detainee was to be summoned and a review in his absence was only permissible in exceptional circumstances if the detainee waived his right to be present of his own free will. The judge could either dismiss the challenge or revoke the pre-trial detention and order the detainee\u2019s release (Article 220-1).", "An appeal to a higher court lay against the judge\u2019s decision. It had to be examined within the same time-limit as appeals against a judgment on the merits (see paragraph 76 below) (Article 331 in fine).", "70. Under the new CCrP, an appeal may be lodged with a higher court within three days against a judicial decision ordering or extending detention on remand. The appeal court must decide the appeal within three days of its receipt (Article 108 \u00a7 10).", "71. Upon receipt of the case file, the judge must determine, in particular, whether the defendant should remain in custody or be released pending trial (Articles 222 \u00a7 5 and 230 of the old CCrP, Articles 228 (3) and 231 \u00a7 2 (6) of the new CCrP) and rule on any application by the defendant for release (Article 223 of the old CCrP). If the application was refused, a fresh application could be made once the trial had commenced (Article 223 of the old CCrP).", "72. At any time during the trial the court may order, vary or revoke any preventive measure, including detention (Article 260 of the old CCrP, Article 255 \u00a7 1 of the new CCrP). Any such decision must be given in the deliberations room and signed by all the judges of the bench (Article 261 of the old CCrP, Article 256 of the new CCrP).", "73. An appeal against such a decision lies to the higher court. It must be lodged within ten days and examined within the same time-limit as an appeal against the judgment on the merits (Article 331 of the old CCrP, Article 255 \u00a7 4 of the new CCrP \u2013 see paragraph 76 below).", "74. Under the old CCrP, within fourteen days of receipt of the case file (if the defendant was in custody), the judge was required either: (1) to fix the trial date; (2) to return the case for an additional investigation; (3) to stay or discontinue the proceedings; or (4) to refer the case to a court with jurisdiction to hear it (Article 221). The new CCrP empowers the judge, within the same time-limit, (1) to refer the case to a competent court; (2) to fix a date for a preliminary hearing (\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435); or (3) to fix a date for trial (Article 227). The trial must begin no later than fourteen days after the judge has fixed the trial date (Article 239 of the old CCrP, Article 233 \u00a7 1 of the new CCrP). There are no restrictions on fixing the date of a preliminary hearing.", "75. The duration of the trial is not limited.", "76. Under the old CCrP, the appeal court was required to examine an appeal against the first-instance judgment within ten days of its receipt. In exceptional circumstances or in complex cases or in proceedings before the Supreme Court this time-limit could be extended by up to two months (Article 333). No further extensions were possible. The new CCrP establishes that the appeal court must start the examination of the appeal no later than one month after its receipt (Article 374).", "77. The old CCrP provided that hearings in first-instance courts dealing with criminal cases were, subject to certain exceptions, to be conducted by a single professional judge or by one professional and two lay judges. In their judicial capacity, lay judges enjoyed the same rights as the professional judge (Article 15).", "78. The new CCrP does not provide for participation of non-professional judges in administration of justice in criminal matters. It provides that serious crimes should be dealt with by a single professional judge or by three professional judges provided that the accused has submitted such a request prior to the scheduling of a trial hearing (Article 30 \u00a7 2 (3)).", "It further provides that the composition of the court examining the case should remain unchanged throughout the trial (Article 242 \u00a7 1).", "79. The Federal Law enacting the new CCrP (Law no. 177-FZ of 18 December 2001) provides as follows:", "Section 2.1 provides that the Federal Law on the Lay Judges of the Federal Courts of General Jurisdiction is ineffective as of 1 January 2004.", "Section 7 provides that Article 30 \u00a7 2 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in so far as it concerns the examination of serious crimes by three professional judges, is effective as of 1 January 2004. Before that date serious crimes were to be dealt with by a single professional judge or by one professional and two lay judges if an accused filed such a request prior to the scheduling of a trial hearing.", "80. Section 22 of the Detention of Suspects Act (Federal Law no. 103FZ of 15 July 1995) provides that detainees should be given free food sufficient to maintain them in good health according to the standards established by the Government of the Russian Federation. Section 23 provides that detainees should be kept in conditions which satisfy sanitary and hygienic requirements. They should be provided with an individual sleeping place and given bedding, tableware and toiletries. Each inmate should have no less than four square metres of personal space in his or her cell.", "81. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCPT\u201d) visited the Russian Federation from 2 to 17 December 2001. The section of its Report to the Russian Government (CPT/Inf (2003) 30) dealing with the conditions of detention in temporary holding facilities and remand establishments and the complaints procedure read as follows:", "\u201cb. temporary holding facilities for criminal suspects (IVS)", "26. According to the 1996 Regulations establishing the internal rules of Internal Affairs temporary holding facilities for suspects and accused persons, the living space per person should be 4 m\u00b2. It is also provided in these regulations that detained persons should be supplied with mattresses and bedding, soap, toilet paper, newspapers, games, food, etc. Further, the regulations make provision for outdoor exercise of at least one hour per day.", "The actual conditions of detention in the IVS establishments visited in 2001 varied considerably.", "...", "45. It should be stressed at the outset that the CPT was pleased to note the progress being made on an issue of great concern for the Russian penitentiary system: overcrowding.", "When the CPT first visited the Russian Federation in November 1998, overcrowding was identified as the most important and urgent challenge facing the prison system. At the beginning of the 2001 visit, the delegation was informed that the remand prison population had decreased by 30,000 since 1 January 2000. An example of that trend was SIZO No 1 in Vladivostok, which had registered a 30% decrease in the remand prison population over a period of three years.", "...", "The CPT welcomes the measures taken in recent years by the Russian authorities to address the problem of overcrowding, including instructions issued by the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, aimed at a more selective use of the preventive measure of remand in custody. Nevertheless, the information gathered by the Committee\u2019s delegation shows that much remains to be done. In particular, overcrowding is still rampant and regime activities are underdeveloped. In this respect, the CPT reiterates the recommendations made in its previous reports (cf. paragraphs 25 and 30 of the report on the 1998 visit, CPT (99) 26; paragraphs 48 and 50 of the report on the 1999 visit, CPT (2000) 7; paragraph 52 of the report on the 2000 visit, CPT (2001) 2).", "...", "125. As during previous visits, many prisoners expressed scepticism about the operation of the complaints procedure. In particular, the view was expressed that it was not possible to complain in a confidential manner to an outside authority. In fact, all complaints, regardless of the addressee, were registered by staff in a special book which also contained references to the nature of the complaint. At Colony No 8, the supervising prosecutor indicated that, during his inspections, he was usually accompanied by senior staff members and prisoners would normally not request to meet him in private \u2018because they know that all complaints usually pass through the colony\u2019s administration\u2019.", "In the light of the above, the CPT reiterates its recommendation that the Russian authorities review the application of complaints procedures, with a view to ensuring that they are operating effectively. If necessary, the existing arrangements should be modified in order to guarantee that prisoners can make complaints to outside bodies on a truly confidential basis.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3", "5", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-3", "5-4", "6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
