The applicant applied for legal aid to pursue this complaint.", "13. On 28 June 1993 the Legal Aid Office at the N\u00eemes tribunal de grande instance refused the application on the ground that although the applicant\u2019s means had been assessed at nil, the application was inadmissible because the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law against the Youth Assize Court\u2019s judgment of 11 December 1992 was still pending.", "14.

In an order of 29 December 1993 the senior investigating judge ruled that the applicant\u2019s complaint was inadmissible on the following grounds:", "\u201cBy Articles 88 and R. 236 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a party who has not obtained legal aid is required to pay into court a sum to cover the costs of the proceedings where he has not joined existing proceedings brought by the public prosecutor, failing which his criminal complaint will be inadmissible.", "As the civil party has not paid within the time allowed the sum specified in the aforementioned order and the public prosecutor does not consider it necessary to institute criminal proceedings,", "I declare Mr Areski A\u00eft-Mouhoub\u2019s application to become a civil party to criminal proceedings inadmissible.\u201d", "The applicant did not appeal against that order.", "21.

The presiding judge of the Assize Court publicly issued a warrant for him to be brought before the court. This person boasts that it was \u2018bogus\u2019, that he had immediately been told by a senior gendarme to be absent, that he was no longer at the address indicated, whereas he had never left home. I lodged a complaint a year ago, on which no action has been taken, thanks to a judicial intervention of which he likewise boasts.", "I have at your disposal all the evidence in support of my accusations, which I will summarise for you in a pleading as soon as the judicial investigation has been opened.", "Jacky Eut, living at Saint-Florent-sur-Auzonet.", "Theft, blackmail, threatening behaviour.", "This individual, who claims to be the brother-in-law of a gendarmerie sergeant against whom I have also lodged a criminal complaint in respect of malfeasance, forgery and uttering, on the basis of irrefutable evidence, paid a visit to my home, with a gendarme, at the time of my arrest and took away all the furniture from my bar and restaurant. Subsequently, he took away all the furniture belonging to my under-age daughter.

In an order of 24 August 1993 the senior investigating judge, noting that the applicant had not obtained legal aid, set the security payable in respect of the complaint against Mr Dumas and Mr Eut likewise at FRF 80,000, on the ground that \u201cthe evidence and \u2026 the existence of another complaint justify applying Articles 88-1 and 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure [see paragraph 32 below]\u201d.
