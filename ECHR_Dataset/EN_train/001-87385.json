Consequently, on 23 April 2003 police officer AD, accompanied by two other officers, SP and AR, carried out a \u201ctest purchase\u201d (kontrolinis pirkimas) of drinks at the bar. He posed as a regular private customer, in order to establish whether it was serving the correct quantities of alcohol offered by its menu.
