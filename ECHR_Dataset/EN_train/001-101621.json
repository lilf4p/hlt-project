They are represented before the Court by Mrs I. Boji\u0107, a lawyer practising in Zagreb. The Croatian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) are represented by their Agent, Mrs \u0160. Sta\u017enik.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "On 19 March 2005 the first applicant was placed in pre-trial detention in Z. Prison, charged with the murder of her husband, who had been killed on the same day. In a judgment of the Z. County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Z.) of 11 September 2006 the first applicant was convicted of murdering her husband in imperfect self-defence and sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. The sentence was reduced to five years' imprisonment by the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) on 25 January 2007. After her conviction the first applicant had, in October 2005, been sent to serve the remainder of her sentence in Po\u017eega Penitentiary (Kaznionica u Po\u017eegi).", "Meanwhile, on 19 March 2005, following the first applicant's arrest, her son, E, born in 1996, was placed in the care of his paternal grandmother by a decision of the Z. Welfare Centre (Centar za socijalnu skrb Z.). This decision was upheld by the same Centre on 4 July 2005.", "In 2008 the President of Croatia reduced the first applicant's sentence to three and a half years' imprisonment. The applicant was released on 27 June 2008.", "On 13 April 2005 the first applicant asked the Z. Welfare Centre to allow her access rights in respect of E. By a decision of 6 July 2005 the Z. Welfare Centre granted the first applicant visiting rights in respect of E every Wednesday from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. at the Z. County Court, if necessary in the presence of a psychologist. E's guardian was instructed to bring him to these premises. The relevant parts of the decision read as follows:", "\u201cThe report drawn up by the psychologist ... on 1 June 2005 recommended that it was in the best interests of the child to continue contact with his mother in order both to treat his trauma and to establish a natural relationship between the mother and the child, which was seen as a precondition for the latter's further proper mental and physical development.", "...", "In adopting the above decision the Centre's expert team has been guided primarily by the best interests of the child and the [need for the] protection of his rights since he has recently been left without the direct parental care of both of his parents. He has been receiving psychotherapy owing to the consequences he is suffering. He has shown a wish and readiness for contact with his mother and the psychologist considers this [contact] necessary for his treatment in order to avoid ... permanent [negative] consequences for his mental and physical development.\u201d", "It appears that the visits took place and that the last one was in September 2005. The child's paternal grandmother, as his guardian, lodged an appeal against the above decision and on 30 December 2005 the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (Ministarstvo zdravstva i socijalne skrbi) quashed the impugned decision and remitted the case to the Z. Welfare Centre for fresh consideration.", "On an unspecified date the case was transferred to the Z. Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Z.). The hearings were held on 30 March, 12 and 29 May and 8 June 2006. On 9 June 2006 the Municipal Court granted the first applicant visiting rights every Thursday from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. at the Z. Welfare Centre. She was also granted the right to telephone E every Monday and Friday between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. This decision was quashed by the Z. County Court on 13 September 2006 on appeals lodged by the first applicant and on behalf of E; it remitted the case to the first-instance court for fresh consideration. The hearings before the latter court were held on 30 November and 22 December 2006 and 2 February and 2 March 2007.", "On 10 April 2007 the court ordered psychological and psychiatric reports on the first applicant and E. The expert concluded that contact between the first applicant and E would not be possible because the child had categorically refused to see the first applicant. In order to overcome that difficulty, it was recommended that E undergo psychotherapy once a week for six months, after which it would have to be established whether his psychological condition allowed for contact with the first applicant. It was stressed that the therapy was needed to come to terms with the tragic event and prepare E for contact with his mother.", "As to the first applicant, the expert opinion recommended psychotherapy in order to come to terms with the tragic event and create conditions in which that issue could be discussed by the first applicant and E.", "Further hearings before the Z. Municipal Court were held on 5 and 27 September and 6 November 2007. On 12 November 2007 a decision was adopted refusing the first applicant's request for access rights in respect of E.", "Meanwhile, on 4 July 2007, the first applicant complained to the Z. County Court about the length of the proceedings. The complaint was dismissed by the Z. County Court on 19 November 2007.", "The first-instance decision of 12 November 2007 was upheld by the Z. County Court on 28 March 2008.", "The applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint arguing that her rights under Article 35 of the Constitution and Article 8 of the Convention had been violated.", "On 20 May 2009 the Constitutional Court accepted the complaint, quashed the decisions of the Z. Municipal and Z. County Courts and ordered the Z. Welfare Centre to take all necessary steps to ensure effective meetings and contact between the first applicant and E. The relevant part of the Constitutional Court's decision reads:", "\u201c7. ...", "As regards the present case, the Constitutional Court endorses the principle that the incarceration of a parent does not break the tie of family life between that parent and a child. Moreover, in such circumstances the State has a special obligation to encourage the preservation of family ties between the prisoner and his or her family members.", "...", "8. ...", "Positive obligations include a duty on the part of the State to be proactive in order to ensure that its citizens' family life is respected and efficiently protected, even when that requires regulation of their private relations. These obligations are expressed in the following Articles of the Constitution which refer to social rights:", "Article 61(1)", "The family is under special State protection.", "Article 62", "The State protects maternity, children and young persons and creates social, cultural, educational, economic and other conditions in order to promote the right to dignified life.", "...", "9. ...", "In the case at issue, the competent administrative and judicial bodies determined the access rights of the mother (the applicant) in respect of her son, a minor, during her incarceration in Po\u017eega Penitentiary.", "...", "In the opinion of the Constitutional Court the proceedings concerning the appointment of a legal guardian to the child as well as proceedings concerning the access rights of parents ... are both relevant ... These proceedings are both judicial and administrative ...", "Therefore, the Constitutional Court finds that possible infringements of the right to respect for one's family life under Article 35 of the Constitution and ... under Article 8 of the Convention require that all proceedings prior to a decision of the Constitutional Court be viewed as a whole, irrespective of the nature of these proceedings (administrative, judicial) or the bodies which conducted them ...", "11. ...", "The applicant's detention made contact between the mother and her child impossible and it therefore amounts to an interference of the State with the applicant's right to respect for her family life within the meaning of Article 35 of the Constitution and Article 8 of the Convention. ...", "...", "13. The Constitutional Court finds that the delays in the proceedings concerning the protection of the child's well-being, such as proceedings on appointing his legal guardian, access and visiting rights of parents... might run contrary to the procedural requirements of Article 35 of the Constitution and Article 8 of the Convention. ...", "In the case at issue the length of the administrative and judicial proceedings concerning the applicant's visiting and access rights in respect of her child exceeded three years and ended with a judicial decision denying such rights so that the last time the applicant saw her child was on 13 September 2005.", "...", "'s father (19 March 2005); the failure of the judicial authorities to commission the necessary expert report in time; the failure to consider the possibility of appointing a special guardian for the child during his psychotherapy, irrespective of the fact that his paternal grandmother had been appointed his legal guardian, in order to 'work out' the event, which had tragic consequences both for the child and his paternal grandmother; the fact that the additional expert report recommended by court experts was not compiled; and the delays in the proceedings concerning the visiting and access rights, which opened the possibility of influencing and changing the child's attitude towards his mother, resulting in his categorical refusal to see her \u2013 indicate that the Constitutional Court cannot but find that the conduct of the competent authorities amounted to a violation of the applicant's right to respect for her family life guaranteed under Article 35 of the Constitution and Article 8 of the Convention ...\u201d", "In a letter of 8 June 2009 the Z. Welfare Centre invited the first applicant to attend a meeting scheduled for 19 June 2009 at 12.30 p.m. in order to \u201cparticipate in the proceedings on consultation and assistance in overcoming special difficulties\u201d, all according to the above decision of the Constitutional Court. In the case the first applicant was prevented to attend, the Centre invited her to inform it within twenty-four hours following the receipt of the letter.", "The letter was served on the first applicant on 11 June 2009. On 19 June 2009 the first applicant wrote a letter to the Centre informing it that she would not attend the meeting scheduled for the same day and invited the Centre to inform her of any steps envisaged by the Centre in order to ensure her contact with her child. However, she did attend the meeting and insisted that the Centre organise a meeting between her and the child. She also said that she would not attend any further meetings unless her child was present.", "In June 2009 the Centre also devised an action plan in order to comply with the Constitutional Court's decision. The action plan was to be implemented by a team of experts, composed of a social worker, five psychologists and two lawyers, established for that purpose. The action plan was concentrated on three main purposes: establishing contacts with the first applicant and her son; work with the family members; and mediation between the two families.", "In July 2009 the first applicant accepted employment on a cruise ship.", "In a telephone conversation on 13 July 2009 E. told a psychologist of the Centre that he did not wish to see the first applicant.", "On 16 July 2009 the second applicant informed the Centre that the first applicant was expected to come back to Zadar in October 2009.", "On 21 July 2009 the first applicant lodged a request for compensation with the competent State Attorney's Office.
