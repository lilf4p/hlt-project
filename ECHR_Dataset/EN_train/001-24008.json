He was represented before the Court by Mr A. Fuchs, a lawyer practising in Ko\u0161ice. The respondent Government were represented by Mr P.

From 15 July 1988 until 1989 he continued to serve this sentence in the Ko\u0161ice\u0160aca prison. Letters which he sent from the prison to his parents were opened, read and censored by the prison authorities.", "From 5 July 1990 to 31 December 1991 the applicant was detained on remand in the Ko\u0161ice detention centre. Letters which he sent from the detention centre to his parents were monitored by the detention centre authorities and opened and read by the police investigator in charge of his case.", "The applicant further served other prison sentences in the Ko\u0161ice\u0160aca prison (from 1992 until 1994), in the Ru\u017eomberok prison (from 1994 until 1995) and in the Ko\u0161ice\u0160aca prison (from 1995 until 1997).", "On 28 July 1997 the applicant addressed a petition (podnet) to the Constitutional Court in which he complained about interference with his correspondence in the period between January and 24 July 1997 while serving a prison sentence. On 27 August 1997 the Constitutional Court declared the petition admissible.

He noted that all the letters which the applicant had submitted and all the official stamps showing that the prison authorities had read these letters dated back to the period prior to the establishment of the Constitutional Court on 15 February 1993.", "In the late 1998 and early 1999 the applicant addressed the Dubnica nad V\u00e1hom prison administration, the public prosecution service, the Ko\u0161ice\u0160aca prison administration and the Ru\u017eomberok prison administration with complaints about interference with prisoners\u2019 correspondence.", "In their respective letters of 30 November 1998, 8 January, 14 April and 15 April 1999 the director of the Dubnica nad V\u00e1hom prison, the Ko\u0161ice I District Office of Public Prosecution, the director of the Ko\u0161ice\u0160aca prison and the director of the Ru\u017eomberok prison informed the applicant about the relevant provisions of the Prison Sentences Execution Act and the Prison Sentences Execution Orders governing monitoring of prisoners\u2019 correspondence.

He sought protection of his personal integrity and compensation for moral damage in connection with the alleged violation of the secrecy of his correspondence while in detention and serving his prison sentences.", "On 11 February 2002 the Ko\u0161ice II District Court (Okresn\u00fd s\u00fad) dismissed the applicant\u2019s request for an exemption from the obligation to pay the court fee and for legal aid. On 31 May 2002 the Ko\u0161ice Regional Court (Krajsk\u00fd s\u00fad) upheld this decision.", "On 28 April 2003 the District Court discontinued the proceedings as, despite its five previous requests and warnings, the applicant had failed to pay the court fee.

It found that the applicant had raised his new complaint about the interference with his correspondence outside the two months\u2019 timelimit pursuant to Article 53 (3) of the Constitutional Court Act. The Constitutional Court further found that the applicant had failed to exhaust legal remedies as regards his complaint about the discontinuance of his civil proceedings in that he had not lodged an appeal on points of law against the decision of the Regional Court of 31 July 2003.", "Article 22 provides as follows:", "\u201c1.
