On the same date, 2 July 2004, the applicant was questioned by the investigators. According to a partial copy of his witness statement furnished by the Government, in the late afternoon of 1 June 2004 he had been at home with his relatives. His son Sarali was in the house while his daughter, the second applicant, was in the yard. At about 5 p.m. a masked man in camouflage uniform armed with an automatic weapon had entered the room where the first applicant was resting. The man asked the applicant in Russian whether any other men were in the house. The applicant responded that his children were on the second floor of the house and then followed the man outside. In the yard he saw a group of about eight masked men in camouflage uniforms, armed with automatic weapons; the second applicant was showing her brother's documents to them. One of the men sprayed the second applicant's face with a liquid from a spray can and took Sarali Seriyev to a VAZ-21099 car which was parked in the street. The applicant did not see how many cars were in the street. He further stated that his son had a first-degree disability owing to the amputation of his hand.", "53. On 5 July 2004 the investigators questioned the second applicant. According to a partial copy of her witness statement furnished by the Government, she stated that Sarali Seriyev had a disability: he had lost his hand as a result of a mine explosion. On 1 June 2004 she had been at home when she had heard from the hallway an order to put her hands up. She saw a man in camouflage uniform holding a machine gun, and her brother Sarali next to him.

The applicant explained that a mine had exploded in his hands and that there were medical documents certifying it. Several more men entered the house and asked her to fetch the documents. After the applicant returned with the papers, they sprayed her in the eyes with tear gas, pushed her into a room and dragged her brother downstairs. She attempted to follow them, but one of the abductors pointed his gun at her and ordered her to get back in the room. Then the applicant decided to call for help from the window; from there she saw several more armed men in camouflage uniforms in the yard and five or six VAZ-21099 cars. All the vehicles were silver-coloured, except for one, which was white. The intruders put Sarali into one of the cars and drove away.", "54. On 5 July 2004 the investigators questioned the applicants' neighbour, Mr V.S. According to a partial copy of his witness statement furnished by the Government, he stated that on 1 June 2004 he had been at home when he had heard screams coming from the applicants' house. He went outside and heard the second applicant screaming. Then the witness went to the applicants' house. On the way there he saw a boy who told him that Sarali Seriyev was being taken away. A silver VAZ-21099 with tinted windows was in the street; its registration number was 516, region 95. Four masked men in camouflage uniforms, armed with 5.45 mm machine guns and APS pistols (\u201cautomatic Stechkin pistol\u201d) walked towards the car from the vegetable garden. Judging by the way the men moved, the witness concluded that they were about twenty to twenty-five years old; they were wearing white training shoes. Three men got in the VAZ-21099 car, whereas the fourth one pointed his gun at the witness and said in Russian: \u201cStop or I will shoot\u201d.

According to the response from the authorities, four persons, Mr I.B., Mr S.M., Mr L.Yu. and Mr Kh.V., owned cars with the numbers 516-95 on the plates.", "57. In response to the investigators' request, in July 2004 the Shali district department of the Federal Security Service (the FSB) submitted that they had not conducted special operations on 1 June 2004 in Belgatoy and had no information which discredited Sarali Seriyev. A similar response was received in August 2004 from the Security Service of the Chechen President.", "58.

In February 2005 the investigators forwarded requests to the Achkhoy-Martan district prosecutor's office and the Shelkovskoy district prosecutor's office asking the authorities to question the owners of the four vehicles. According to their responses, it was impossible to question Mr I.B. as his whereabouts had not been established; a neighbour of Mr Kh.V. had stated that the latter had moved to the Shatoi district of Chechnya and therefore could not be questioned. Mr S.M. stated that for three months in 2002 he had owned a dark red 1976 VAZ-21099 with the registration number X516 AX-95, which he had sold to Mr A. from the Samashki village, Chechnya. As for Mr L.Yu., he stated that in December 2003 he had purchased a silver 2003 VAZ-21099 with the registration number T 516 PC95.

On an unspecified date the head of the criminal search division of the Shelkovskoy ROVD informed the investigators that they could not establish the identity of the new owner of the car which had belonged to Mr L.Yu.", "61. The investigators forwarded a number of requests to various detention centres and the district prosecutors' offices in Chechnya asking whether these authorities had detained Sarali Seriyev and whether they had opened criminal proceedings against him. According to the replies received by the investigation, the applicants' relative had not been detained and no criminal proceedings had been opened against him.", "62. On an unspecified date the investigation received a letter from the Special Group of the Ministry of the Interior (the MVD) which stated that Sarali Seriyev was listed by the criminal search police as a member of an illegal armed group.", "63.

The investigating authorities sent requests for information to the competent State agencies and took other steps to have the crime resolved. The investigation found no evidence to support the involvement of Russian military servicemen in the crime, nor did they find any evidence that the applicants' relative was dead.", "64. The Government further submitted that the investigation had been suspended and resumed on a number of occasions and that the applicants had been duly informed of all decisions taken during the investigation.", "65. Despite specific requests by the Court the Government did not disclose most of the contents of the investigation file in criminal case no. 36076. They provided copies of only a few documents, including only partial copies of the applicants' witness statements to the investigators, and requested the Court to apply Rule 33 \u00a7 3 of the Rules of Court concerning confidentiality of the submitted documents and to restrict public access to the submitted documentation. In their request the Government stated that the criminal investigation was still in progress and that public disclosure of the documents could be detrimental to the interests of participants in the criminal proceedings.", "66. The Government further stated that a copy of the entire investigation file could not be submitted to the Court owing to the absence of any guarantees on the part of the Court of non-disclosure of the secret data contained in the investigation file. In this respect the Government referred to Article 161 of the Criminal Procedure Code, since the file contained information concerning participants in criminal proceedings. They also cited, by way of comparison, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court of 17 July 1998 (Articles 70 and 72) and the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (Articles 15 and 22) and argued that these instruments provided for personal responsibility for a breach of the rules of confidentiality.", "67.
