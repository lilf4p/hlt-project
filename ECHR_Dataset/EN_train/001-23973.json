He was represented before the Court by Mr A. \u00c7ift\u00e7i, a lawyer practising in Ankara.", "A report about the applicant, the leader of Tarikat Aczmendi (a community describing itself as an Islamic sect), entitled \u201cThey came with bombs, they will leave with bombs\u201d (\u201cBombayla geldiler, bombayla gidecekler\u201d) was published in the 17 and 24 June 1994 issues of Haftal\u0131k Taraf (\u201cWeekly Viewpoint\u201d), a weekly newspaper with radical Islamic leanings.", "On 9 November 1994 the public prosecutor at the Fatih Criminal Court charged the applicant with incitement to commit an offence, within the meaning of Article 311 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code, and with insulting the memory of Atat\u00fcrk, under Law no. 5816, which protects the memory of Atat\u00fcrk.", "In a judgment of 19 January 1998, the Criminal Court acquitted the applicant of insulting the memory of Atat\u00fcrk, holding that his comments on Kemalism in the report in question amounted to criticism that could not be treated as an insult to the memory of Atat\u00fcrk.", "However, it sentenced him to four years' imprisonment for incitement to commit an offence. In support of that decision, it cited the following comments by the applicant that had appeared in the report:", "\u201cThese people [moderate Islamic intellectuals] have no strength left ... Now they have come up with I.N. [an Islamic intellectual known for his moderate views]... Allah has blocked their water supply ... Only a fraction of Muslims, among those not engaged in the struggle, regard I.N. as someone important ... Now their teeth and nails have been ripped out, their hair has fallen out, they have been dethroned. They are still trying, but in vain, to preserve their greatness and, in doing so, provide a rather comic image of a monster ... like a hollow statue ... which, as soon as it is touched or set in motion (in the event of an attack), will show that it no longer has the strength to do anything ... Indeed, this has already been seen ... All that is needed now is for one brave man among the Muslims to plant a dagger in their soft underbelly and run them through twice with a bayonet to show just how empty they are. They no longer have anything else to sustain them. There is nothing else left ...\u201d", "The court held that the applicant's statement \u201cAll that is needed now is for one brave man among the Muslims to plant a dagger in their soft underbelly and run them through twice with a bayonet to show just how empty they are ... There is nothing else left ...\u201d in the account of his opinions about I.N. amounted to public incitement to commit an offence. It considered that in the instant case the right to impart information and to engage in criticism could not be relied on and that publication of the statements in question had not served any public interest. In conclusion, it held that the legal rules governing the exercise of the right to impart information had not been complied with.", "The applicant, submitting that his conviction had infringed his freedom of thought and expression, appealed on points of law on 24 April 1998.", "On 29 December 1998 the Court of Cassation dismissed his appeal and upheld the judgment at first instance.", "In the meantime, on 20 May 1997, the Istanbul National Security Court had sentenced the applicant to two years' imprisonment and a fine of 520,000 Turkish liras, holding that the comments made by him in the report in question (reference was made to other passages in the report, in which he had asserted that secularists and Kemalists were infidels and enemies of Islam and should do penance to save their lives) amounted to incitement to religious hatred.
