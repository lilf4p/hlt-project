On 27 March 2005 the applicant appealed.", "18. On 17 August 2005 the Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski District Court upheld the contested decision. In its reasons for its decision the court stressed that the \u201ccensored\u201d note had been written only on envelopes and not on letters and thus no evidence had been adduced that the applicant\u2019s correspondence had been censored. In consequence, it found that J.W. had not committed an offence of unlawful access to confidential information.", "19. The relevant domestic law concerning the censorship of prisoners\u2019 correspondence is set out in the Court\u2019s judgments in the cases of Michta v.
