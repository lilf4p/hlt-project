THE CZECH REPUBLIC", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant, Mr Milan \u0158eh\u00e1k, is a Czech national, who was born in 1954 and lives in Olomouc.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.", "The applicant was an anti-communist dissident. On 25 April 1980 he was charged with parasitism (p\u0159\u00ed\u017eivnictv\u00ed) and detained on remand. On 13 May 1980 he was released. On 2 June 1980 the criminal proceedings were discontinued under the presidential amnesty of 8 May 1980, the criminal offence being re-qualified as a minor offence (p\u0159e\u010din). The decision was served on the applicant's lawyer on 1 February 1995. On 24 February 1995 the Olomouc District Prosecutor (okresn\u00ed st\u00e1tn\u00ed z\u00e1stupce) discontinued the criminal proceedings on the ground that the act imputed to the applicant did not constitute an offence.", "On 16 December 1991 the applicant sued the Olomouc District Police Directorate (okresn\u00ed \u0159editelstv\u00ed policie) for damages under the State Liability Act. He claimed that, in the criminal proceedings instituted against him, the police officers had acted unlawfully. These proceedings were still pending in February 2004, after being examined at several instances, with discontinuances due to the applicant's failure to specify his claims fully, decisions being quashed on three occasions and the case being re-considered accordingly.", "In a letter of 7 October 2002 addressed to Czech Telecom (\u010cesk\u00fd telecom), the applicant complained that his name and address had been included in the telephone directory, contrary to an amendment to his contract with this company on 1st November 2001, and that his telephone had been intercepted. He claimed damages of CZE 200,000.", "On 15 November 2002 Czech Telecom apologized for the administrative mistake concerning the publication of the applicant's name and address, assuring the applicant that the mistake had been rectified in the meantime. They informed him that the telecom network connected to his telephone line had been controlled and that any unlawful interception had been excluded.", "On 1st January 2003 the applicant requested the Olomouc District Police Directorate to institute criminal proceedings against the Security and Information Service of the Czech Republic (Bezpe\u010dnostn\u00ed a informa\u010dn\u00ed slu\u017eba \u010cR) and Czech Telecom on the ground that they had illegally intercepted his telephone and had handled his personal data. On 16 January 2003 the applicant was heard in this connection at the police station. His request was examined but no criminal proceedings were brought.", "In a letter of 17 March 2003, the applicant alleged that he and certain lawyers had agreed that \u201cthe genocide of fundamental human rights in the Czech Republic is so vast that it extends to the Czech Registry of the European Court\u201d. He asked the Court to send its decision, which he expected to be negative given his view as to the partiality of Czech Court staff, in a registered letter. He insisted that the decision be fully reasoned. In connection with his previous case [Application no. 55376/00 was declared inadmissible by a committee of three judges on 21 May 2002. The applicant was informed of this by the Registry's letter of 7 June 2002, pursuant to Rule 53 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court, which provides that \u201cIn accordance with Article 28 of the Convention, the Committee may, by a unanimous vote, declare inadmissible an application or strike it out of the Court's list of cases where such a decision can be taken without further examination. This decision shall be final. The applicant shall be informed of the Committee's decision by letter.\u201d], the applicant noted:", "[Translation]", "\u201c... not even criminal communist tribunals sent their decisions without reasoning .... What you have done is tantamount to approval of theft and, therefore, amounts to a crime from the position of a sort of 'terrestrial God'. The proof of this is not only the Czech [part of the Registry]'s ignorant reaction to my justified request to be provided with the 'preparatory' materials on the basis of which 'decision was taken'.\u201d I do not consider the decision of a sort of section, assisted by your Bulgarian colleagues, to be a decision of the Court as such.\u201d", "[Original]", "\u201c... ani zlo\u010dinn\u00e9 komunistick\u00e9 soudy nezas\u00edlaly sv\u00e1 rozhodnut\u00ed bez zd\u016fvodn\u011bn\u00ed ...

I have my own former experience when the Court prevented me from freely using [my] property and left it at the mercy and for the benefit of the communist thieves, without any reasoning whatsoever!
