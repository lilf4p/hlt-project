During the initial phase, consisting usually of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol, the tubercle bacilli are killed rapidly. Infectious patients quickly become non-infectious (within approximately two weeks). Symptoms abate. The vast majority of patients with sputum smear-positive TB become smear-negative within two months. During the continuation phase, fewer drugs are necessary but for a longer time. The sterilizing effect of the drugs eliminates the remaining bacilli and prevents subsequent relapse.\u201d", "39.

Provision in terms of medical, nursing and technical staff, as well as premises, installations and equipment, should be geared accordingly.", "There should be appropriate supervision of the pharmacy and of the distribution of medicines.

In the event of a transfer, the file should be forwarded to the doctors in the receiving establishment.", "Further, daily registers should be kept by health care teams, in which particular incidents relating to the patients should be mentioned. Such registers are useful in that they provide an overall view of the health care situation in the prison, at the same time as highlighting specific problems which may arise.", "40. The smooth operation of a health care service presupposes that doctors and nursing staff are able to meet regularly and to form a working team under the authority of a senior doctor in charge of the service.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
