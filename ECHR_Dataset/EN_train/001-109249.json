The applicant was born in 1954. She resides in the village of Goyty, the Chechen Republic. The applicant is the mother of Mr Abdula Edilov, born in 1976.", "6. At the time of the events described below Abdula Edilov resided with the applicant at 2, Nekrasova Street in the village of Goyty. According to the applicant, her son had participated in illegal armed groups during the first round of hostilities in the Chechen Republic, but was then amnestied and did not take part in the second round of hostilities which started in 1999.", "7. The following account of the events is based on a written statement by the applicant dated 16 January 2007; a written statement by R.Z. dated 10 July 2006; a written statement by Z.D. dated 5 September 2006 and a written statement by L.D. dated 7 September 2006.", "8. On 26 August 2001 the applicant agreed with Abdula Edilov that she would go to the local market and that he would join her there later. The applicant left for the market while Abdula Edilov stayed at home.", "9. Between 5 and 6 p.m. on the same day a light coloured UAZ vehicle (\u201c\u0442\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043a\u0430\u201d) arrived at the applicant\u2019s house. About ten armed men in camouflage uniforms and masks emerged from the vehicle. The applicant\u2019s neighbours R.Z., Z.D. and L.D., who witnessed the arrival of the vehicle, inferred that those men were servicemen. Two servicemen stayed by the UAZ vehicle and the others rushed inside the applicant\u2019s house. Shortly thereafter the servicemen came outside, leading Abdula Edilov with them. He was wearing a T-shirt, black trousers and house slippers and was holding his hands behind his back. The servicemen threw the applicant\u2019s son inside the UAZ vehicle and drove in the direction of the checkpoint manned by Russian federal forces located on the bridge over the Argun River, on the eastern outskirts of Goyty. At the checkpoint the vehicle stopped for a while and then took the motorway in the direction of Grozny. According to Z.D., the windows in the UAZ vehicle were not blacked out and when it drove away from the checkpoint there were only three to four servicemen in it. Z.D. inferred from that that several servicemen must have stayed at the checkpoint. Z.D., R.Z. and L.D. could clearly see the route taken by the UAZ vehicle because the motorway leading to Grozny was separated from Nekrasova Street only by the Argunskiy canal.", "10. The applicant learnt about the abduction shortly after it had occurred. She immediately returned home and realised that her house had been searched because everything had been turned upside down.", "11. The applicant then went to the checkpoint of the federal forces located at the bridge over the Argun River. According to her, the checkpoint was guarded by servicemen from the Special Forces unit of the Ministry of the Interior (\u201cthe OMON\u201d). She told them that her son had been apprehended and that his abductors had passed through the checkpoint. The servicemen replied that their commander was absent and that her son would come back \u201cthree days later if he was innocent\u201d or \u201cthree months later if he was guilty\u201d.", "12. On 26 August 2001 the applicant complained in person about the abduction of her son to the local police. A police officer named \u201cYusup\u201d advised her to complain about the apprehension of Abdula Edilov to various authorities and promised her that he would search for her son and find out who had arrested him and for what reason.", "13. On 27 August 2001 the applicant stayed at home in case the authorities came to question her about the circumstances of the abduction of her son, whilst her sister Z.Ts. went to Grozny to complain about his abduction to various State authorities.", "14. According to a written statement by Z.Ts. dated 1 February 2010, on 29 or 30 August 2001 Z.Ts. and her husband heard over the radio that \u201cAbdula Muslanovich Edilov\u201d had been arrested on suspicion of having committed a terrorist attack in the Urus-Martanovskiy District of Chechnya and two days later she saw the same information on the federal news, accompanied by video footage of a man being led by two servicemen. The video being very short, Z.Ts. was unable to discern whether the man was Abdula Edilov, but she clearly heard his name being pronounced by the newsreader.", "15. On an unspecified date in autumn 2001 the applicant learnt from a certain Mr R. that her son was allegedly being held at the military base in Khankala and in the winter of 2002 a certain Ms T. told the applicant\u2019s daughter-in-law that Abdula Edilov was being held at the Operational and Search Bureau no. 2 (\u201cthe ORB-2\u201d) in Grozny. The applicant went to Grozny to meet the head of the ORB-2, but the latter denied having detained her son.", "16. In 2005 an officer of a prison located in Khasavyurt, in the Dagestan Republic, allegedly recognised Abdula Edilov in a picture shown to him by the applicant and told her that her son had been detained in that prison two to three years before and that he had then been taken away by officers of the Federal Security Service (\u201cthe FSB\u201d).", "17. The Government stated that at about 5 p.m. on 26 August 2001 a group of armed men in camouflage uniforms and masks, driving a UAZ vehicle, had abducted Abdula Edilov from his home in Goyty, the Chechen Republic, and had taken him to an unknown destination.", "18.

However, that decision had been set aside as premature and unfounded and the district prosecutor\u2019s office had been instructed to take unspecified additional investigative steps aimed at identifying those responsible and locating the applicant\u2019s son.", "23. By a letter of 22 July 2002 the republican prosecutor\u2019s office replied to the applicant\u2019s repeated requests for information, specifying that the investigation in case no.25482 had been suspended on 4 February 2002 because of the failure to identify those responsible for the abduction.

Together they had gone to the applicant\u2019s house, where everything had been turned upside down. The eyewitnesses had told them that armed persons wearing masks and camouflage uniforms and driving a UAZ vehicle without licence plates had searched the house, loaded Abdula Edilov into their car and had left in the direction of Grozny after having passed through the checkpoint located at the exit from Goyty. After a while there had been rumours that the applicant\u2019s son was detained in the 6th department of the Main Intelligence Service but Z.T. herself was not aware of the source of those rumours.", "48. On 15 July 2004 the investigators interviewed A.T. as a witness. He submitted that in September 2000 in the village of Goyty he had been involved in a car accident with a man he had not met before.

According to the ROVD report of 15 July 2005, VOVD officers orally interviewed unspecified residents of Goyty and were unable to identify further witnesses to the abduction.", "58. By their report of 17 July 2005 the ROVD informed the district prosecutor\u2019s office that it was unable to identify the servicemen of the checkpoint on duty on the day of Abdula Edilov\u2019s abduction \u201cbecause the servicemen worked in half-hour shifts\u201d.", "59. On 29 and 30 March 2006 the district prosecutor\u2019s office requested a number of law-enforcement authorities, including the Grozny Department of the Federal Security Service, to inform it as to whether they had information on the whereabouts of Abdula Edilov, whether they had arrested him or had any \u201ccompromising material\u201d (\u201c\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u201d) concerning him.", "60. On 25 and 26 April 2006 the district prosecutor\u2019s office requested a number of hospitals in the Chechen Republic to inform it as to whether Abdula Edilov had applied to them for medical assistance.

On 4 February 2002 the district prosecutor\u2019s office suspended the investigation into the abduction of Abdula Edilov owing to the failure to identify the perpetrators.

Subsequently, the district prosecutor\u2019s office suspended the investigation in case no. 25482 for failure to identify those responsible for the abduction on the following dates: 3 April 2003, 18 July 2004, 1 July 2005, 28 April 2006 and 14 August 2006.", "66. The documents submitted by the Government show that higher-ranking prosecutors set aside the decisions to suspend the investigation on the following dates: 18 June 2004, 1 June 2005, 28 March 2006 and 14 July 2006.", "67. In setting aside the decisions to suspend the investigation, the higher-ranking prosecutors indicated that their examination of the case file had revealed that the district prosecutor\u2019s office had conducted the investigation in a superficial manner and in breach of the relevant legislation, referring, among other things, to the fact that the investigators had failed to identify and interview the servicemen who had been on duty at the checkpoint through which the abductors had passed with Abdula Edilov; to identify all eyewitnesses to the abduction; to identify and question the persons with whom Abdula Edilov had been in contact and who could have information on the reasons for his abduction; to check the unidentified victims database and to verify the applicant\u2019s and Z.T.\u2019s submissions that Abdula Edilov may have been detained at the RUBOP and that Chechen TV and radio channels had disseminated information concerning his arrest. In that connection, on 18 June 2004, 5 May 2005 and 4 July 2006 higher-ranking prosecutors specifically issued \u201cwritten instructions\u201d (\u201c\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0443\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f\u201d), requesting that the district prosecutor\u2019s office take the investigative steps in question.", "68. On an unspecified date the investigation in case no. 25482 was entrusted to the investigating department of the Investigating Committee with the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of the Russian Federation in the Chechen Republic (\u201cthe investigating department\u201d).", "69. On 2 November 2009 the deputy head of the investigating department issued \u201cwritten instructions\u201d concerning case no. 25482. The document stated, in particular, that the investigating department was to resume the investigation into the abduction of Abdula Edilov without delay and to carry out, among others, the following investigative steps:", "- identify and interview the servicemen on duty at the checkpoint on 26 August 2001;", "- add to the case file information from registration logbooks concerning vehicles which passed through the checkpoint on 26 August 2001;", "- identify the detachments of security forces stationed at the material time in the Urus-Martanovskiy District and in the vicinity of the village of Goyty and obtain information on the special operations carried out by them;", "- carry out a crime-scene inspection and compile a detailed sketch showing the location of the applicant\u2019s house and the checkpoint of the federal forces;", "- re-interview witnesses to the abduction in detail on the events of 26 August 2001, and;", "- interview the applicant on the source of her information concerning her son\u2019s alleged detention in the SIZO in Khasavyurt.", "70. In the Government\u2019s submission, the investigation of the disappearance of Abdula Edilov is ongoing.", "71. On 1 May 2006 the applicant complained to the Urus-Martanovskiy District Court (\u201cthe District Court\u201d) about the ineffectiveness of the investigation into the abduction of her son and the investigator\u2019s refusal to grant her access to the case file and to allow her to make copies from it. In particular, she submitted that the circumstances of Abdula Edilov\u2019s abduction left no doubt that he had been apprehended by servicemen of the Russian military forces. However, the investigating authorities had not only delayed the investigation but also refused to provide her access to the case file. The applicant averred that the lack of information about the investigation prevented her from effectively challenging the decisions to suspend the investigation.", "72. On 6 July 2006 the District Court found partly for the applicant. It found that the investigator\u2019s refusal to provide her with access to the case file was unlawful. The court noted at the same time that the applicant would only be entitled to make copies from the case file after the completion of the investigation. As regards the request for the investigation to be resumed, the court found that the investigators had questioned several witnesses and obtained information on Abdula Edilov\u2019s eventual arrest and detention from a number of law-enforcement authorities, including the FSB department in the Urus-Martanovskiy District. The investigation had not established who was responsible for the abduction of Abdula Edilov and it had been suspended on numerous occasions on that ground, the latest such decision being dated 28 April 2006. The court stressed, however, that the investigation had not taken all possible steps to establish Abdula Edilov\u2019s whereabouts and identify his abductors. In particular, the investigators had failed to identify and question the officers of the federal forces who had been on duty at the checkpoint over the Argunskiy canal on the eastern outskirts of Goyty in August 2001. The court thus granted the applicant\u2019s request and ordered that the investigation be resumed.", "73. By a letter of 14 July 2006 the district prosecutor\u2019s office informed the applicant that it had resumed the investigation in case no. 25482.", "74.
