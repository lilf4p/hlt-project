According to the applicants, from 6 to 11 March 2002 federal military officers, under the command of General Borisov, conducted a sweeping operation (\u0437\u0430\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043a\u0430) in the village of Stariye Atagi involving around 10,000 servicemen, 50 armoured personnel carriers (\u201cAPCs\u201d) and several military helicopters.", "7. Throughout the said period the military besieged Stariye Atagi and restricted freedom of movement in the village. They organised a filtering point at the poultry-yard and the mill on the outskirts of Stariye Atagi where they kept the residents detained during the operation.", "8. In total fifteen men residing in Stariye Atagi were apprehended between 6 and 11 March 2002. Whilst some of them were subsequently released, eleven residents disappeared. Relatives of ten of those who disappeared applied to the Court (see Arzu Akhmadova and Others v. Russia, no. 13670/03).", "9. According to the applicants, Mr Ismail Dzhamayev was apprehended in the following circumstances. In the morning of 6 March 2002 the first applicant asked him to go and see his uncle who lived in the same village and buy something for him in the village shop. When Mr Ismail Dzhamayev was in the street apparently on the way from the shop to his uncle\u2019s house, he saw two APCs approaching. He got frightened, turned around the corner to Bezymyannaya Street and dropped in at Mr B.\u2019s, his acquaintance. Mr B.\u2019s mother let him in. As soon as he entered, servicemen ran into the yard after him. They said that there was a sweeping operation in the village and that they would check the house. They searched the house. After the search they took Mr B. and Mr Ismail Dzhamayev with them. Mr B.\u2019s mother asked them not to take the children away since they had all their documents with them. The servicemen checked the documents and then put Mr B. and Mr Ismail Dzhamayev in an APC. When Mr B.\u2019s mother tried to intervene, however, the servicemen pushed her aside, hit her against the wall and left her lying on the ground.", "10. The next day Mr B. was released. He said that after they had been apprehended, the servicemen took them around the village in the APC for approximately two or three hours while they checked other houses. They were thrown on the floor of the APC and the servicemen put their feet on them. Then they were taken to the filtration point. Mr B. said that he had heard Mr Dzhamayev\u2019s voice when the latter had been questioned. They had asked him what he had been doing at B.\u2019s house, and Mr Dzhamayev had explained that he had gone to the shop and had just dropped by. When Mr B. heard that Mr Ismail Dzhamayev had not returned home he was surprised because he had heard nothing during the night and thought that Mr Dzhamayev had been released.", "11. Upon his release Mr B. was barely alive because of the beating he had received from the servicemen. He died six months later.", "12. On 7 March 2002 the residents of Stariye Atagi found several bodies in an abandoned house in the village. The applicants heard others saying that the people had first been blown up and then burned. It was impossible to identify them. However, somebody said that the bodies of some of the persons apprehended on 6 March 2002 had been seen.", "13. The applicants also heard that a car had been burned on 9 March 2002.", "14. On 10 March 2002 Mr T. Kh., Mr R. D. and Mr V. D. were apprehended and then held at a mill. They were put in a pit where they saw an inscription on the wall \u201cMaka and Amir were here\u201d. Although Mr Dzhamayev\u2019s name was Ismail, everybody had called him Maka since his childhood. One of the servicemen confirmed that Mr Dzhamayev and Mr Amir Pokayev had been held there and said that they had been released in the afternoon the previous day, 9 March 2002.", "15. The applicants concluded that Mr Dzhamayev could not have been one of the persons whose burnt bodies had been found in the burnt house on 7 March 2002 or in the car burnt on 9 March 2002.

On 7 March 2002, at around 2 p.m., a fight broke out between members of the illegal armed groups and federal servicemen in a house at 81 Nagornaya Street.

Since the house was set on fire, bodies were severely burnt; after an inspection by law-enforcement officers they were handed over to the local administration for burial.", "18. On 9 March 2002 a group of servicemen of military unit no. 3228 at a checkpoint situated within three kilometres from Stariye Atagi was fired at from a car that approached the checkpoint.
