The following incidents occurred on 28 February 2002. The detailed accounts of events by the parties and those involved are at variance at times. In this section, therefore, the incidents are described only briefly. Differing details, if any, are pointed out in the subsequent sections.", "8. In the evening of 28 February 2002, at around 7.30 p.m., an argument started in a bar in the village of G\u00e1novce-Filice, when a non-Romani waitress, I.S., refused to serve a drink to a person of Roma ethnic origin, M.K.", "9. The argument developed with the tipping of a drink over M.K., in response to which he slapped or attempted to slap Ms I.S. in the face, accidentally knocking glasses over, which fell and broke.", "10. Subsequently I.S. telephoned one of her three sons, P.S., who came to the bar soon afterwards. After he had left, another of her sons, M.S., who was the owner of the bar, came to the bar and remained there, assisting I.S. in serving customers, until closing time. Around that time, the girlfriend of P.S., E.N., also came to the bar and then accompanied I.S. home.", "11. Later that evening, at around 9.45 p.m., a group of at least twelve people went into the Roma settlement in the village where the applicants lived. Some of them were wearing balaclavas and they were armed with baseball bats and iron bars.", "12. Allegedly shouting racist language, they forcibly entered houses nos. 61, 67 and 69, damaging the interior and breaking the windows.", "13. On entering house no. 67, the attackers physically assaulted applicant Mr J\u00e1n Koky. Some of the other applicants and another person, who were also present at the house during the attack, witnessed the attack but managed to avoid it by hiding (see paragraph 16 below).", "14. Once the attackers understood that the police had been called, they made their escape. When they had gone approximately 200 metres from the settlement, they met applicants Mr Martin Ko\u010dko and Mr Rastislav Koky and physically assaulted them, causing them the injuries described below. Racist language is alleged to have been used during this part of the attack too.", "15. House 61 was inhabited by applicant Ms Ren\u00e1ta \u010conkov\u00e1 and her partner, Z.K. They were both at home during the attack.", "16. House 67 was inhabited by applicants Mr J\u00e1n Koky, Ms \u017daneta Kokyov\u00e1, Mr Rastislav Koky, Ms Ren\u00e1ta Kokyov\u00e1, Ms Ru\u017eena Kokyov\u00e1 and Mr J\u00e1n Koky Jr and by a certain J.K.", "Apart from applicant Rastislav Koky, they were all present at the house during the incident, and so were applicants Mr Milan Bal\u00e1\u017e and a certain H.B.", "17. When the attack took place in his house, applicant Mr J\u00e1n Koky sustained no physical injuries.", "18. House 69 was owned and inhabited by applicant Ms Just\u00edna Lackov\u00e1.", "19. The overall damage to the applicants\u2019 property was estimated at the equivalent of at least 310 euros (EUR).", "20. The parties are not united over the extent of the physical injuries sustained by Mr Martin Ko\u010dko and Mr Rastislav Koky (see paragraph 14 above).", "21. The applicants claim that Mr Rastislav Koky suffered a skull fracture, a cut to the left side of the back of the head, a crushed left arm, a pressure injury to the left side of the back and bruises to the left knee, which required him to stay in hospital for ten to fourteen days.", "22. As regards Mr Martin Ko\u010dko, the applicants claim that he had sustained a scraped elbow and a crushed arm, which required a recovery time of seven to ten days. In that respect the applicants relied on the decisions of 26 April and 22 May 2002 (see paragraphs 73 and 81 below).", "23. In contrast, the Government submit that Mr Martin Ko\u010dko\u2019s injuries necessitated no stay in hospital, while those of Mr Rastislav Koky only required him to stay in hospital for four days.", "24. After I.S. had come home from her shift, an unknown person broke the window of her house by throwing a stone at it and also broke the windows of a car parked in her yard.", "25. It is not entirely clear what relation this attack bore to the argument at the bar and the attack at the settlement, both in terms of time and of cause.", "26. It appears that those present during the attack at I.S.\u2019s house included I.S., P.S., E.N., her brother: M.N., and a certain M.L.", "27. The police arrived at the Roma settlement about half an hour after the incident. That night and in the early hours of the following day, that is to say 1 March 2002, the police carried out inspections and interviews, as summarised below on the basis of official records.", "28. Between 10.30 and 11 p.m. house no. 67 was inspected in connection with a suspected offence, which was referred to as \u201cdamage to family house\u201d. Applicant Mr J\u00e1n Koky, who lived in the house, was present.", "Broken windows were found in various parts of the house, and two biological traces were identified (bloodstains on a door and on a baseball bat) and sent for further analysis.", "29. Between 0.15 and 1.00 a.m. house no. 61 was inspected in connection with a suspected offence, which was referred to as \u201cdamage to windows and door of a house\u201d. Z.K., whose house it was, was present.", "Damage to the latch and casing of the front door were identified, as well as broken panes in two of the windows. Inside the house, on the floor in the kitchen and a room where the windows had been broken, two stones of 8 and 20 cm diameter were found.", "30. Between 1 a.m. and 1.30 a.m. the following day house no 69 was inspected in connection with a suspected offence, which was referred to as \u201cdamage to a window pane of a house\u201d. Applicant Ms Just\u00edna Lackov\u00e1, whose house it was, was present.", "Broken panes in three windows were identified, and one biological trace was sampled for further analysis.", "31. Applicant Mr J\u00e1n Koky, Z.K. and applicant Ms Just\u00edna Lackov\u00e1 were interviewed: the interviews started at 2.25 a.m., 3.45 a.m. and 4.30 a.m. respectively.", "32. Mr J\u00e1n Koky submitted, inter alia, that earlier that evening a group of approximately five attackers had entered his house, no. 67. They had been armed with batons and had tried to hit him. He managed to fend them off and other occupants of his house had managed to hide, so the attackers had mainly been hitting the kitchen furnishings. Four of the attackers were wearing balaclavas to conceal their faces. The remaining one, whom he did not know, had no balaclava. They had not uttered a word.", "33. Z.K. described how the attackers had broken windows in his house, no. 61, had forcibly entered and had made their escape after learning that the police were on their way. According to the transcript, the interview ended at 4.20 a.m. Z.K. then added that when they entered his house the attackers were shouting: \u201cGypsies, we\u2019re going to strike you down today\u201d.", "34. Ms Just\u00edna Lackov\u00e1 submitted that she had been at home with her three minor children during the attack and that her husband had not been there. She had witnessed the turmoil outside her house through a window. Two of her house windows had subsequently been broken, probably with sticks, because no stones or other foreign objects had been found inside. In her submission, the attackers had pounded at her entrance door but had not succeeded in getting in. Ms Lackov\u00e1 assessed the damage to her house and submitted a claim for compensation to the proceedings. The interview was concluded at 5.15 a.m. and then reopened to pose a direct question to the applicant, in response to which she retorted that, on the part of the attackers, she had only heard indistinct shouting. The interview was finally concluded at 5.30 a.m.", "35. On 1 March 2002 the Poprad District Police Investigator (\u201cthe DPI\u201d) initiated a criminal investigation into the offences of causing bodily harm, violating the privacy of a home and criminal damage within the meaning of Articles 221 \u00a7 1, 238 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 and 257 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code (Law no. 140/1961 Coll., as applicable at that time) respectively.", "36. It was suspected that a group of at least twelve individuals had unlawfully entered houses nos. 61, 67 and 69, and that they had damaged these houses, as well as house no. 69. It was also suspected that while at his house the attackers had tried to hit applicant Mr J\u00e1n Koky with baseball bats and that while making their escape from the scene of crime, they had assaulted applicants Mr Martin Ko\u010dko and Mr Rastislav Koky by hitting them with baseball bats and kicking them, thus causing them bodily injuries on account of which, according to a preliminary estimate, they would need recovery time and would be unfit for work for seven to ten days and ten to fourteen days respectively.", "37. The injuries to the applicants Mr Martin Ko\u010dko and Mr Rastislav Koky were also assessed in an expert medical report procured by the DPI, in which their recovery time was assessed at four weeks and thirteen days respectively.", "38. On 1 and 4 March 2002 respectively, an official note was made in the investigation file summarising the applicants\u2019 submissions and a document was included in it outlining the investigation strategy.", "39. On 5 March 2002 at 10.00 and 10.50 a.m. respectively, the DPI interviewed I.S. and P.S. They described their involvement in the incident at the pub and the subsequent attack which took place at I.S.\u2019s house and on his car. I.S. submitted, inter alia, that she had closed the bar and had gone home at around 9.50 p.m. P.S. submitted that the closing time of the bar was 10 p.m. and that his mother had arrived home after that time.", "40. On 7 March 2002 the DPI reported to the Ministry of the Interior on the status of the investigation. It was mentioned, inter alia, that the applicants\u2019 legal representative had been obstructing the investigation, in that he had instructed the applicants not to accept summonses to interviews if handed to them in person, and not to take part in any interviews unless he was present. The qualification of the representative to appear on the applicants\u2019 behalf in criminal proceedings in Slovakia was also called into question.", "41. In the morning of 12 March 2002, the DPI interviewed applicant Mr Rastislav Koky, T.K. and M.K. and applicants Mr J\u00e1n Koky Jr. and Mr Martin Ko\u010dko. These interviews started at 8.20, 9.15, 9.45, 10.10 and 10.40 respectively.", "42. Mr Rastislav Koky described the pub incident between I.S. and M.K. According to him, following the altercation I.S. had called P.S., who had arrived within five minutes, and who had warned Mr Koky that another son of I.S. would come round and there would be trouble. He also submitted that, later that evening, about thirty men had caught and beaten him, that he had subsequently had to be taken to hospital by ambulance, that he had been hospitalised for three to four days and that due to his injuries he was still unfit for work. In response to a direct question, Mr Rastislav Koky submitted that \u201cduring the attack, none of the attackers uttered a word\u201d.", "43. T.K. and M.K. submitted that on the evening of the incident they had seen I.S. with a group of forty to fifty men approaching the Roma settlement.", "44. Mr J\u00e1n Koky Jr. described the pub incident, including the remark that P.S. had told him and others to go away because his brother would come and there would be trouble. Mr J\u00e1n Koky Jr. also submitted that, after he had seen his brother, applicant Mr Rastislav Koky, and his injuries, he had been convinced that P.S. was responsible. He had therefore gone to I.S.\u2019s house, where he had had a verbal exchange with E.N. and M.N. However, he had gone away after the latter had produced a handgun and threatened to shoot him.", "45. Mr Martin Ko\u010dko described the pub incident, the arrival of P.S. in the pub, the departure of about forty-five men and the assault on him by four individuals wearing balaclavas to conceal their faces and two without, accompanied with a cry \u201cNegroes, gypsies, we\u2019re going to kill you\u201d.

On 10 April 2002 the DPI held an identity exercise, in the course of which the participants were to identify presumed perpetrators from photographs in albums. It produced the following results:", "- applicant Mr J\u00e1n Koky identified one person, with a subjectively perceived probability of seventy to eighty percent, as one of the people who had been attacking him in his house;", "- applicant Mr Martin Ko\u010dko recognised one individual, who had been present at the pub during the argument, but had not been among those who had beaten him.

On 26 April 2002 the DPI suspended the above-mentioned criminal investigations. The decision stated that the police had taken several investigative measures and had carried out a search with a view to establishing the identity of the perpetrators of the assault of 28 February 2002. Until then, however, no evidence could be established which would have made it possible to bring charges against a specific person.", "72. The decision of 26 April 2002 also stated that it was established that the incident at the Roma settlement \u201chad been preceded by an assault on a waitress, I.S., by a Roma, M.K., and subsequent damage to the property of the family of I.S. by a hitherto unidentified Roma and so the actions of the unidentified perpetrators [could] not be considered or qualified as a criminal offence with a racial motive, because it [had come] down only to an act of retribution\u201d.", "73. As to the injuries sustained by applicants Mr Rastislav Koky and Mr Martin Ko\u010dko, the decision refers to the decision of 1 March 2002 and its contents (see paragraph 36 above).", "74. On 3 May 2002 applicants Mr J\u00e1n Koky and Mr Rastislav Koky lodged an interlocutory appeal (s\u0165a\u017enos\u0165) against the decision to suspend the investigation. Referring to the facts of the case, they submitted that the assault had been racially motivated and that it had been organised by people who were close to the family of the waitress concerned. Citing, inter alia, Articles 5 and 13 of the Convention, they sought resumption of the investigation.", "75. On the same day, namely 3 May 2002, the Poprad District Prosecutor (Okresn\u00e1 prokurat\u00fara) (\u201cthe District Prosecutor\u201d) issued a written instruction to the DPI specifying the measures to be taken and lines of inquiry to be pursued in order to establish the identity of the perpetrators and highlight the alleged racial motive.", "76. Still on 3 May 2002, the DPI took a decision to resume the investigation. That decision contains a summary of the previous procedural developments, followed by a plain statement, without further elucidation, that \u201cduring further investigation it [had been] established that a racially motivated criminal offence [was] implicated and therefore it [was] necessary to take further investigative steps and resume the investigation ...\u201d.", "77. On 14 May 2002 the Police Forensic Analysis Institute filed a report with the DPI concluding that, having examined the biological material of B.B., V.P. and E.K. (see paragraph 70 above) and having compared it with the material taken from the crime scene, no link could be established.", "78. In the morning of 20 May 2002, at 8.40, 8.50, 9 and 9.15 respectively, the DPI commenced interviewing M.S., P.S. and F.S., as well as M.N.

The following day the DPI again requested the Police Forensic Analysis Institute to analyse and compare biological material obtained from the three sons of I.S., M.N. and M.L. with the material taken from the scene of crime.", "81. On 22 May 2002 the District Prosecutor declared the interlocutory appeal of applicants Mr J\u00e1n Koky and Mr Rastislav Koky of 3 May 2002 (see paragraph 74 above) inadmissible, replying on Articles 43, 124 \u00a7 1, 148 \u00a7 1 (b) and 173 \u00a7 4 of the CCP, and holding that as victims of the alleged offences the appellants had no standing to challenge the decision in question.", "82. In its concluding part, which under the applicable procedural rules (see paragraph 125 below) contains information concerning available remedies, the decision provided that: \u201cAn interlocutory appeal against this decision is not permissible.\u201d", "83. However, in a letter of the same date, namely 22 May 2002, the District Prosecutor informed the applicants that she had reviewed the matter on her own authority, that on 3 May 2002 (see paragraph 75 above) she had quashed the decision, and that she had instructed the DPI to carry on the investigation so as to clarify the events without leaving any doubt as to the identity and motive of the alleged perpetrators.", "84. At 8 a.m. on 23 May 2002 the DPI commenced interviewing E.K. During the morning of 4 June 2002 they interviewed R.S. (at 8.30), I.K. (8.45), J.H. (9.00) and M.K. (9.10).

On 26 June 2002 the DPI again suspended the investigation, relying on Article 173 \u00a7 1 (e) of the CCP, and referring to similar considerations to those in the decision of 26 April 2002. It summarised previous procedural developments and observed that, despite additional information taken from H.B., T.K., M.K. and applicants Mr J\u00e1n Koky, Mr Martin Ko\u010dko, Ms \u017daneta Kokyov\u00e1, Mr Milan Bal\u00e1\u017e, Mr Rastislav Koky, Ms Ru\u017eena Koky and Mr J\u00e1n Koky Jr., it had not been possible to establish any evidence allowing charges to be brought against any specific person.

The appellants relied on Articles 5, 6, 8, 13 and 14 of the Convention, 1 of Protocol No. 1 and 15 and 21 of the Constitution and referred to the results of the identity exercise on 10 April 2002. In particular, they emphasised that, on that occasion, applicant Mr Martin Ko\u010dko had recognised one person; applicant Mr Rastislav Koky had recognised F.S. and submitted that the organisation of the attack had had a connection with the family of I.S.; and applicants Mr J\u00e1n Koky and Ms \u017daneta Kokyov\u00e1 had recognised one person each.", "98.

According to the letter, it was true that applicant Mr Rastislav Koky had recognised P.S., F.S. and M.N., but he had submitted either that they had not beaten him or that he was not sure whether they had beaten him. Applicant Mr J\u00e1n Koky had recognised F.S. and had submitted that it was the latter who had beaten him in his house. This submission however contradicted a previous submission by applicant Mr J\u00e1n Koky (see paragraph 32 above) to the effect that, of the five attackers in his house, four were wearing balaclavas and one, whom he did not know, was not. It was also observed that Ms \u017daneta Kokyov\u00e1 had not recognised any of the attackers.", "104. The letter further states that additional action had been taken with a view to identifying those responsible, such as a comparison of the traces found at the scene of the incident with buccal mucus samples from the suspects, but the available evidence did not permit the bringing of charges against any particular person.", "105.

Represented by a lawyer, they contended that the events of 28 February 2002 had not been sufficiently thoroughly and efficiently investigated to ensure that those responsible were identified and punished. In particular, they submitted that the authorities had failed to draw adequate conclusions from the oral evidence and from the information concerning the identity of the alleged perpetrators, as obtained from the identity exercise of 10 April 2002. In addition, the authorities should have taken and assessed further evidence, such as records of mobile telephone communications between those involved, but had not done so.
