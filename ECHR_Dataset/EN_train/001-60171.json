AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 10;Pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses award - domestic proceedings;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["9. The first applicant, an Austrian citizen born in 1921 and residing in Vienna, is the chief editor and publisher of the newspaper \u201cNeue KronenZeitung\u201d. The second applicant, a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) is the owner of this newspaper. The third applicant is a limited company, the general partner (Komplement\u00e4r) of the second applicant. The second and third applicants have their places of business in Vienna.", "10. The applicants belong to a large media group which at the relevant time was in strong competition with another media group represented by Mr Michael Graff, a lawyer practising in Vienna. Besides his profession as a lawyer, Mr Graff was from 1982 to 1987 secretary general of the Austrian People\u2019s Party (\u00d6sterreichische Volkspartei) and, from 1983 to 1995, a Member of Parliament for that party. Between 1987 and 1995 he was the Chairman of the Parliament\u2019s Legislative Committee (Justizausschu\u00df). From 1989 to July 1995 he represented the applicants\u2019 competitor in several proceedings concerning unfair competition against companies belonging to the applicants\u2019 media group.", "11. In 1989 several Austrian laws were amended by the Extended Pecuniary Limits Amendment Act (Erweiterte Wertgrenzen-Novelle). The Government Bill (Regierungsvorlage) had also provided for an amendment to Section 359 \u00a7 1 of the Enforcement Act (Exekutionsordnung), a section which is of particular relevance for the enforcement of injunctions. The Government Bill had envisaged raising the fines that could be imposed for non-compliance with injunctions from ATS 50,000 per enforcement order to ATS 80,000 per enforcement order.", "12. Under the chairmanship of Mr Graff, the Legislative Committee dealing with the Government Bill proposed a different version, namely that a maximum fine of AS 80,000 could be imposed for each request for enforcement (Exekutionsantrag) instead of for each enforcement order issued by the Enforcement Court. In its report of June 1989, the Legislative Committee pointed out that the fine had to be multiplied by the number of requests for enforcement, if only one decision combining several requests was taken. This proposal was adopted by Parliament on 29 June 1989 and published as Article XI of the Extended Pecuniary Limits Amendment Act, Federal Law Gazette 1989/343 (Erweiterte Wertgrenzen-Novelle 1989, BGBl. 1989/343).", "13. Four years later, in June 1993, the following article written by the first applicant under the pseudonym \u201cCato\u201d was published in the \u201cNeue Kronen-Zeitung\u201d:", "\u201cMoral 93", "Before Roland Dumas became the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, he was one of Europe\u2019s most famous and most successful lawyers. He administered the gigantic estate of Picasso; he represented Kreisky and an Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs when the latter found himself in a bad situation. Dumas took it for granted that he had to give up his law firm when he became a member of the government. In every democracy of the world this course of action is followed. Only Mr Graff, who is obviously thick-skinned, does not intend to comply with these moral concepts.", "It so happened that at the time when Mr Graff was presiding Parliament\u2019s Legislative Committee, a law was amended which brought about big advantages for the newspaper publishers whom Mr Graff represented as a lawyer. In order to ensure that in such cases no suspicion, not even one that has no objective justification, can arise, there exists the wise rule of incompatibility; a lawyer is not allowed to take part in the adoption of laws which lead to advantages for his clients.", "Also the Austrian People\u2019s Party thought that way and they decided to appeal to Mr Graff\u2019s conscience. In vain! It is very telling for the present situation of the Austrian People\u2019s Party that it cannot convince Mr Graff. The other parties will be only too pleased, when it becomes so flagrantly evident how powerless the Austrian People\u2019s Party is vis-a-vis one of their officials who has his own moral concepts. Mr Graff was even allowed to present his disreputable attitude on our monopoly-television. Mr Graff thought that it would be a sign of fear to the \u2018Kronen Zeitung\u2019 if he had to resign from the Legislative Committee.", "The People\u2019s Party does not have to fear the \u2018Krone\u2019 but its voters, who will continue turning away from it if the party shows itself incapable of establishing order within its own ranks; how could one then possibly trust that it would succeed in doing this in the State ... Cato.\u201d", "<German>", "\u201cMoral 93", "Roland Dumas war, bevor er Frankreich\u2019s Au\u00dfenminister wurde, einer der bekanntesten und erfolgreichsten Rechtsanw\u00e4lte Europas. Er verwaltete zum Beispiel das gigantische Erbe Picassos, vertrat Kreisky und einen \u00f6sterreichischen Au\u00dfenminister, als dieser in eine arge Aff\u00e4re geraten war. F\u00fcr Dumas war es ganz selbstverst\u00e4ndlich, da\u00df er sein Rechtsanwaltsb\u00fcro aufgeben mu\u00dfte, als er in die Regierung eintrat. \u00dcberall in der Welt wird dies in Demokratien so gehalten. Nur der offenbar mit einer B\u00fcffelhaut ausgestattete Rechtsanwalt Dr. Graff denkt nicht daran, sich nach solchen Moralbegriffen zu richten.", "So kam es, w\u00e4hrend er im Justizausschu\u00df des Parlaments den Vorsitz hatte, zur Ver\u00e4nderung eines Gesetzes, wodurch der Zeitungsverlag, den Graff rechtsanwaltlich vertritt, gro\u00dfe Vorteile hatte. Damit in solchen F\u00e4llen nicht ein bestimmter Verdacht entstehen kann, der keineswegs begr\u00fcndet sein mu\u00df, gibt es eben die weise Regel der Unvereinbarkeit; ein Anwalt darf nicht an der Entstehung von Gesetzen beteiligt sein, die seinen Mandanten Vorteile bringen.", "Das dachte man auch in der \u00d6VP, und man entschlo\u00df sich, Graff ins Gewissen zu reden. Vergeblich! Es sagt einiges \u00fcber den Zustand der \u00d6VP aus, da\u00df sie sich gegen Graff nicht durchsetzen konnte. Den anderen Parteien kann es nur recht sein, wenn sich in so brutaler Offenheit zeigt, wie ohnm\u00e4chtig die Volkspartei gegen\u00fcber einem Funktion\u00e4r ist, der seine eigene Moral hat. Sogar in unserem Monopol-Fernsehen durfte er seine anr\u00fcchige Haltung vertreten. Graff meinte, es w\u00fcrde nur Angst vor der \u2018Kronen Zeitung\u2019 signalisieren, berufe man ihn im Justizausschu\u00df ab.", "Nicht vor der \u2018Krone\u2019 braucht die \u00d6VP Angst zu haben, sondern vor ihren W\u00e4hlern, die sich weiter von ihr abwenden werden, wenn sie sich als unf\u00e4hig erweist, in der eigenen Partei Ordnung zu machen; wie sollte man da das Vertrauen haben, es k\u00f6nne ihr im Staat gelingen ... Cato.\u201d", "14. On 7 June 1993 Mr Graff brought injunction proceedings under Section 1330 of the Austrian Civil Code (Allgemeines B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch) against the three applicants before the Vienna Commercial Court (Handelsgericht). He requested that the applicants be prohibited from stating or repeating that he \u201cdoes not intend to comply with moral concepts existing in democracies all over the world, namely that one has to give up one\u2019s law firm if one becomes a member of the government, (M.G. had never been a member of the government), and/or that he has taken part in the adoption of laws which have brought about advantages for his clients, and/or that he has been allowed to present his disreputable opinion on television\u201d. He also requested that the statement be retracted and that this retraction be published in the \u201cNeue Kronen-Zeitung\u201d.", "15. On 9 July 1993 the Vienna Commercial Court issued a preliminary injunction (einstweilige Verf\u00fcgung) against the applicants prohibiting them from reiterating the impugned statements. The applicants\u2019 appeal against this decision was to no avail.", "16. On 9 September 1994 the Vienna Commercial Court granted a permanent injunction. It ordered the applicants not to repeat the impugned statements and to retract the statements in one edition of the \u201cNeue KronenZeitung\u201d. It found that the applicants\u2019 statements amounted to an insult and therefore fell to be considered not only under Section 1330 \u00a7 2 of the Austrian Civil Code, but also under the first paragraph of Section 1330. In that case the onus of proof shifted to the applicants who had to prove the truth of the impugned statements. The court pointed out that all the statements contained in the article were statements of fact which the applicants had failed to prove.", "17. The court found that the statement contained in the first paragraph of the newspaper article was an insult, within the meaning of Section 1330 \u00a7 1 of the Civil Code, because Mr Graff was accused of ignoring or neglecting moral, democratic standards and had therefore acted immorally. This statement contained the implicit allegation that Mr Graff had become a member of the government. However, the allegation was untrue because Mr Graff had never been a member of the government.", "18. The court further considered that the statement in the second paragraph of the newspaper article expressed the suspicion that Mr Graff had abused his position as a Member of Parliament. The proposed evidence that should prove the truth of this allegation, namely the amendment of Section 359 \u00a7 1 of the Enforcement Act, was insufficient because the applicants had not even contended before the court that the amendment served the exclusive interest of Mr Graff\u2019s client. In fact this amendment had an objective basis, concerned both competing media groups and had no distorting effect on competition.", "19. In respect of the third statement according to which Mr Graff\u2019s attitude was disreputable, the court found that this statement again contained the allegation that Mr Graff had acted immorally because he had exercised two incompatible activities. The court therefore concluded that the applicants could not successfully rely on Article 10 of the Convention, because the interference with the applicants\u2019 rights under this provision was justified in order to protect Mr Graff\u2019s good reputation, which could be prejudiced by such untruthful statements.", "20. On 20 October 1994 the applicants appealed. They submitted that the Commercial Court had not sufficiently taken into account a written statement by E.S., an employee of the second applicant, which the applicants had submitted. According to this written statement, Mr Graff had requested the amendment to the Enforcement Act in order to impose a fine for each request for execution, thus exploiting one of the applicants\u2019 weak points. The applicants were the owners of several monthly magazines. Unlike daily newspapers, these magazines were therefore usually on the market longer. If one of the applicants\u2019 magazines, for instance, had violated the Unfair Competition Act (Bundesgesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb), Mr Graff, as the legal representative of the competitors, had immediately obtained a preliminary injunction and had filed almost daily requests for enforcement. He had counted on the fact that the applicants could, in the long run, not afford to pay the fines, or that they could not afford the cost of withdrawing the relevant issue of the monthly magazine from distribution. Under the previous legal situation, several requests for enforcement would be combined in one decision, and the applicants had only had to pay one fine of AS 50,000 for them. Under Section 359 \u00a7 1 of the Enforcement Act in its amended form, however, the fines were multiplied by the number of requests and, consequently, increased dramatically.", "21. Furthermore, the applicants complained that the Commercial Court had failed to take sufficient account of a written statement by their lawyer, S.R., and had refused to hear this person as a witness. He would have given evidence of a telephone conversation on 12 June 1989 between himself and Mr Graff in which the latter had complained that his requests for enforcement had not been successful and had not reaped the expected fines. He continued that this would require changes in the pecuniary limits and the system of fines. The applicants also submitted that the impugned article constituted a criticism of Mr Graff\u2019s behaviour as a politician and was therefore protected by the freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention.", "22. On 15 December 1994 the Vienna Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht) dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal. It found that the Commercial Court had correctly taken the necessary evidence and assessed the relevant facts. The applicants had not even argued before the Commercial Court that Mr Graff had been a member of the government or that the amendment of the Enforcement Act had served the exclusive interests of Mr Graff\u2019s client. Instead they had merely argued that Mr Graff, in his function as Chairman of the Legislative Committee, had been involved in the making of laws which created advantages for his client. The applicants therefore should have proved that Mr Graff had been a member of the government and that he had manipulated the enactment of laws to the exclusive advantage of his client. The evidence proposed by the applicants, however, had been insufficient to prove such allegations. Moreover, the contested statements were not value judgments, but (political) criticism based on alleged facts. Such criticism was only acceptable if the underlying facts were true. Since the applicants had failed to prove the truth of these facts, they could not rely on Article 10 of the Convention.", "23. On 9 March 1995 the Supreme Court rejected as inadmissible the applicants\u2019 extraordinary appeal on points of law (au\u00dferordentliche Revision). Referring to its previous case-law, the court pointed out that disparagement by means of untrue statements, even if made in the course of political debate, went beyond acceptable (political) criticism and could not be justified by a weighing of interests or by invoking the right to freedom of expression. This decision was served on the applicants on 10 April 1995.", "24. Section 1330 of the Austrian Civil Code (Allgemeines B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch) provides as follows:", "\u201c(1) Everyone who has suffered material damage or loss of profit because of an insult may claim compensation.", "(2) The same applies if anyone disseminates statements of fact which jeopardise another person\u2019s credit, gain or livelihood and if the untruth of the statement was known or must have been known to him. In such a case the retraction of the statement and the publication thereof may also be requested ....\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
