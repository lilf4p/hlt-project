Valticos", "TEXT": ["9. Mr \u0130brahim Incal, a Turkish national born in 1953, lives in \u0130zmir. A lawyer by profession, he was at the material time a member of the executive committee of the \u0130zmir section of the People\u2019s Labour Party (\u201cthe HEP\u201d). That party, which was represented in the National Assembly, was dissolved by the Constitutional Court on 14 July 1993.", "10. On 1 July 1992 the executive committee decided to distribute in the \u0130zmir constituency a leaflet criticising the measures taken by the local authorities, in particular against small-scale illegal trading and the sprawl of squatters\u2019 camps around the city.", "The title of the leaflet, of which ten thousand copies were printed, was \u201cTo all democratic patriots!\u201d, and the text read as follows:", "\u201cIn the last few days a campaign aimed at \u2018DRIVING THE KURDS OUT OF THE CITIES\u2019 has been launched in \u0130zmir against the Kurdish population by a combination of prefecture, security police and town hall. In this campaign \u0130zmir has been designated a pilot-city. The first stage was the operation [against] street traders, stallkeepers and mussel sellers, whom they tried to hide away on the ground that it was necessary to smarten up the city and ease traffic congestion. The purpose of this operation was to impose an \u2018economic blockade\u2019 on our, mainly Kurdish, fellow citizens who make their living through these activities, condemning them to destitution and starvation. In this way the masses were to be frightened, oppressed and compelled to return to their province of origin.", "Before the \u2018DRIVING THE KURDS OUT\u2019 campaign began the organisational and psychological ground had already been prepared by leaflets signed by \u2018Patriotic inhabitants of \u0130zmir\u2019 and handed out in large numbers for weeks by \u2018obscure forces\u2019. These leaflets incited hostility against the Kurdish population in particular and stirred up anti-Kurdish feelings. This led to racist and chauvinistic anti-Kurdish attitudes through propaganda saying: \u2018Don\u2019t give employment or housing to the Kurds. Don\u2019t speak to them, don\u2019t let your daughters marry them and don\u2019t marry one yourself. Smash the Kurds.\u2019 That is how the psychological foundations were laid down, the preparations for the future offensives. Although these leaflets were handed out in broad daylight, those responsible \u2013 and nobody knows why \u2013 were never arrested.", "But the campaign was by no means limited to the operation against street traders, stallkeepers and mussel sellers. The second prong was \u2018Operation shantytown\u2019. The same combination of prefecture, security police and town hall launched the demolition of the squatters\u2019 camps. It began in Yamanlar and \u015eemikler and continued in Gaziemir, [all] shantytown districts inhabited mainly by Kurds, who, before the elections, were regarded by the parties in favour of the status quo as a source of votes. Those who had encouraged the mushrooming of the shantytowns by dishonestly promising freedom to build in exchange for votes and those who, with the local mafia, had appropriated public land this time set about the ferocious destruction of these huts to oppress and intimidate the Kurds and force them to go back home.", "The Kurdish and Turkish proletarian people suddenly and without any warning saw the huts they had run into debt to build, with so many sacrifices made by cutting down on their children\u2019s food, collapsing about their ears. That is how they are trying to oppress the Kurdish and Turkish people and drive them into distress and despair.", "IT\u2019S STATE TERROR AGAINST TURKISH AND KURDISH PROLETARIANS!", "It is certain that these demolitions, which began in Yamanlar and are still continuing in Gaziemir, will soon spread to \u0130zmir\u2019s other shantytowns. The State is testing the people\u2019s reactions and will to resist by causing various kinds of destruction. Passivity as a form of defence against this devastation has encouraged the State to commit further kinds of destruction.", "In conclusion: The \u2018Driving-the-Kurds-Out policy\u2019 forms part of the SPECIAL WAR being conducted in the country at present against the Kurdish people. It is one of the mechanisms of that war, the way it impinges on the cities. Because the methods used are the same, namely enslavement, violence, terror and oppression through compulsion. It is a psychological war.", "While, in the country, they are trying to oppress and silence the people through counter-insurgency tactics, special patrols, village guards, the SS decree and every [other] form of State terror, in \u0130zmir they want to achieve the same aim by depriving our fellow citizens of their means of subsistence and in the end by knocking their houses down about their ears. The methods used, although different in form, are in the final analysis mechanisms serving the purposes of the special war. It is the urban form of the special war.", "TO ALL DEMOCRATIC PATRIOTS!", "The way to nullify these insults to the cities is to set up NEIGHBOURHOOD COMMITTEES BASED ON THE PEOPLE\u2019S OWN STRENGTH.", "We call on all Kurdish and Turkish democratic patriots to assume their responsibilities and oppose this special war being waged against the proletarian people.", "LONG LIVE THE BROTHERHOOD OF NATIONS!", "STOP THE SPECIAL WAR BEING SPREAD INTO THE CITIES!\u201d", "11. By a letter of 2 July 1992, accompanied by a copy of the leaflet in question, the president of the HEP informed the \u0130zmir prefecture of the executive committee\u2019s decision (see paragraph 10 above) and asked for permission to implement it.", "12. The \u0130zmir security police, to whom this request had been referred, considered that the leaflet contained separatist propaganda capable of inciting the people to resist the government and commit criminal offences.", "On 3 July 1992 they asked the Principal Public Prosecutor attached to the \u0130zmir National Security Court (\u201cthe public prosecutor\u201d, \u201cthe National Security Court\u201d) to state his opinion as to whether the contents of the leaflet contravened the law.", "13. On the same day, at the request of the public prosecutor\u2019s office, a substitute judge of the National Security Court issued an injunction ordering the seizure of the leaflets and prohibiting their distribution.", "The police searched the HEP\u2019s premises in \u0130zmir, first at the headquarters, where the party leaders handed over, without demur, nine thousand copies of the leaflet which were still parcelled up, and then at the Buca district office, where the thousand remaining copies were seized.", "14. Still on 3 July 1992 the public prosecutor\u2019s office opened a criminal investigation against the HEP\u2019s local leaders and the members of its executive committee, including the applicant.", "15. On 27 July 1992 the public prosecutor instituted criminal proceedings in the National Security Court against the applicant and the other eight members of the HEP committee who had taken part in the decision of 1 July 1992 (see paragraph 10 above). Citing the text of the leaflet, he accused them of attempting to incite hatred and hostility through racist words and asked the court to apply Articles 312 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code, section 5 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713) and additional section 4 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680) (see paragraphs 21, 23 and 24 below). He also asked the court to order confiscation of the leaflets.", "16. On 9 February 1993 the National Security Court, composed of three judges, one of whom was a member of the Military Legal Service, found the applicant guilty of the offences charged and sentenced him to six months and twenty days\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of 55,555 Turkish liras. It also ordered the confiscation of the leaflets and disqualified him from driving for fifteen days.", "In its interpretation of the wording of the leaflet, the National Security Court accepted the public prosecutor\u2019s oral submissions entirely, except for that part which related to the applicability of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713). It noted in particular that the leaflet suggested recourse to resistance against the police and the establishment of \u201cneighbourhood committees\u201d, which it held to be illegal forms of protest. It further held that the offence had been intentionally committed, since the accused had not contested either the existence or wording of the text on which the charge was based.", "With regard to the severity of the sentence, it observed that although commission of the offence through the medium of print was an aggravating circumstance, it was necessary to take into account the accused\u2019s good faith and the fact that the authorities had been able to lay hands on the leaflets before they had been distributed.", "17. On 9 March 1993 the applicant and the other convicted persons appealed to the Court of Cassation. In their notice of appeal they asked for a public hearing to be held and challenged the National Security Court\u2019s interpretation of the leaflet and its refusal to commute the prison sentence to a fine.", "18. On 20 May the Principal Public Prosecutor attached to the Court of Cassation forwarded the case file together with an opinion couched in a standard form of words \u2013 which was not communicated to Mr Incal \u2013 asking the court to uphold the judgment.", "19. In a judgment of 6 July 1993 the Court of Cassation upheld all the operative provisions of the impugned judgment, after observing that, regard being had to the nature and length of the sentence imposed at first instance, it was not necessary to hold a hearing.", "20. On 23 August 1993 the prosecuting authorities decided, at the applicant\u2019s request, to stay execution of the prison sentence for four months.", "21. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code read as follows:", "\u201cPublic incitement to commit an offence", "Where the incitement [to commit an offence] is done by means of mass communication, of whatever type, by tape recordings, gramophone records, newspapers, press publications or other published material, by the circulation or distribution of printed papers or by the placing of placards or posters in public places, the terms of imprisonment to which convicted persons are liable shall be doubled\u2026\u201d", "\u201cNon-public incitement to commit an offence", "Whosoever expressly praises or condones an act punishable by law as an offence or incites the population to break the law shall be sentenced to between six months\u2019 and two years\u2019 imprisonment and a \u2026 fine of between six thousand and thirty thousand liras.", "Whosoever expressly arouses hatred and hostility in society on the basis of a distinction between social classes, races or religions, or one based on allegiance to a particular denomination or region, shall be sentenced to between one and three years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of between nine thousand and thirty-six thousand liras. If this incitement is done in a manner likely to endanger public safety, the sentence shall be increased [by one third to one half].", "The penalties to be imposed on those who have committed the above-mentioned offences by the means listed in Article 311 \u00a7 2 shall be doubled.\u201d", "22. A conviction under Article 312 \u00a7 2 entails further consequences, particularly with regard to the exercise of certain activities governed by special legislation. For example, persons convicted of an offence under that section may not found associations (Law no. 2908, section 4(2)(b)) or trade unions, nor may they be members of the executive committee of a trade union (Law no. 2929, section 5). They are also forbidden to found or join political parties (Law no. 2820, section 11(5)) and may not stand for election to Parliament (Law no. 2839, section 11(f3)). In addition, if the sentence imposed exceeds six months\u2019 imprisonment, the convicted person is debarred from entering the civil service, provided that the offence has been committed intentionally (Law no. 657, section 48(5)).", "23. Additional section 4(1) of the Press Act (Law no. 5680) provides:", "\u201cWhere distribution [of the printed matter whose distribution constitutes the offence] is prevented \u2026 by a court injunction or, in an emergency, by order of the Principal Public Prosecutor, to be confirmed by a court, \u2026 the penalty imposed shall be one-third of that laid down by law for the offence concerned.\u201d", "24. Law no. 3713 of 12 April 1991, promulgated with a view to preventing acts of terrorism, refers to a number of offences defined in the Criminal Code which it describes as \u201cacts of terrorism\u201d or \u201cacts perpetrated for the purposes of terrorism\u201d (sections 3 and 4) and to which it applies. However, the act punishable pursuant to Article 312 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 21 above) is not among them.", "25. Article 318 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the holding of a public hearing in proceedings before the Court of Cassation only where the impugned judgment concerns offences classified as \u201cserious\u201d, such as those punishable by the death penalty or a term of imprisonment of more than ten years. The Court of Cassation\u2019s jurisdiction, according to Article 307 of the Code, is limited to questions concerning the lawfulness and procedural regularity of the first-instance judgment.", "26. The National Security Courts were created by Law no. 1773 of 11 July 1973, in accordance with Article 136 of the 1961 Constitution. That Law was annulled by the Constitutional Court on 15 June 1976. The courts in question were later reintroduced into the Turkish judicial system by the 1982 Constitution. The relevant part of the statement of reasons contains the following passage:", "\u201cThere may be acts affecting the existence and stability of a State such that when they are committed special jurisdiction is required in order to give judgment expeditiously and appropriately. For such cases it is necessary to set up National Security Courts. According to a principle inherent in our Constitution, it is forbidden to create a special court to [give judgment on] a specific act after it has been committed. For that reason the National Security Courts have been provided for in our Constitution to try cases involving the above-mentioned offences. Given that the special provisions laying down their powers have [thus] been enacted in advance and that the courts have been created before the commission of any offence \u2026, they may not be described as courts set up to deal with this or that offence after the commission of such an offence.\u201d", "The composition and functioning of the National Security Courts are subject to the following rules.", "27. The constitutional provisions governing judicial organisation are worded as follows:", "\u201cIn the performance of their duties, judges shall be independent; they shall give judgment, according to their personal conviction, in accordance with the Constitution, statute and the law.", "No organ, authority, officer or other person may give orders or instructions to courts or judges in the exercise of their judicial powers, or send them circulars or make recommendations or suggestions to them.\u201d", "\u201cJudges \u2026 shall not be removed from office or compelled to retire without their consent before the age prescribed by the Constitution\u2026\u201d", "\u201cPresidents, regular members and substitute judges of the National Security Courts shall be appointed for a renewable period of four years.\u201d", "\u201cThe personal rights and obligations of military judges \u2026 shall be regulated by law in accordance with the principles of the independence of the courts, the safeguards enjoyed by the judiciary and the requirements of military service.

In connection with assessment reports, failure to state reasons or a lack of objectivity on the part of the immediate superior was taken into account. Lastly, in connection with a disciplinary sanction, against which in principle no appeal lies, the First Division held that the acts of which the person concerned stood accused had been incorrectly established and that the sanction was accordingly null and void.", "33.
