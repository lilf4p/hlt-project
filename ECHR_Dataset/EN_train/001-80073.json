The applicant was born in 1940 and lives in Velingrad.", "5. On 11 November 1999 the applicant was arrested and brought before an investigator who decided to remand him in custody on charges of sexual assault allegedly committed against a minor on 20 October 1999, an offence punishable with up to five years' imprisonment under Article 149 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code. The investigator's decision was confirmed by a prosecutor.", "6. On 18 November 1999 the investigator conducted searches in the applicant's home.", "7.

On 5 February 2001 the investigator submitted his conclusions to the prosecutor, proposing that the applicant should be indicted for sexual assault.", "10. On 10 April 2001 the District Prosecutor's Office referred the case back to the investigator instructing him to undertake further investigation as to whether the applicant had raped the same girl on 9 November 1999, as alleged by her.", "11. Since the alleged victim had changed her address and could not be located, the investigation could not proceed and was suspended on 1 October 2003.", "12. In October 2003 the case file was transmitted to the district police in Velingrad with instruction to continue seeking the alleged victim's address. It appears that as of September 2006, the date of the latest communication received from the parties, the investigation remained suspended.", "13. The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (\u201cCCP\u201d) concerning decisions on pre-trial detention and the Bulgarian authorities' practice at the relevant time are summarised in the Court's judgments in several similar cases (see, among others, the Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, \u00a7\u00a7 25-36, ECHR 1999-II; Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 55-62, 26 July 2001; and Yankov v.

In accordance with section 140 of the transitory provisions to the 2003 amendment, that possibility applies with immediate effect in respect of investigations opened before June 2003.
