Subsequently, the applicant was to deliver the chickens to the company against a payment of an agreed price.

On an unspecified date the applicant increased her claim.", "7. The first hearing was fixed for 2 June 1995, but the Regional Court adjourned it due to the applicant\u2019s absence.

On 2 October 2001 and 8 January 2002 the applicant requested the Suwa\u0142ki Regional Court to amend the execution warrant due to the change of the defendant company\u2019s name. That warrant was issued on 9 April 2002. On 14 May 2002 the Regional Court\u2019s judgment of 31 March 1998 was successfully enforced.", "15.
