TURKEY [Extracts]", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The first applicant, Mrs Ethel Teri Eskinazi, who has French and Turkish nationality and was born in 1963, lodged the application with the Court on her own behalf and on behalf of her daughter, Caroline Ruth Chelouche (the second applicant), who has French, Turkish and Israeli nationality and was born in January 2000 in Tel Aviv (Israel). The applicants are currently living in Istanbul.", "They were represented before the Court by Mr D. Bollecker, Mr J. Paillot, Mr H.C. Kr\u00fcger and Ms E. Schwab-Gyrs, of the Strasbourg Bar, and assisted at the hearing by Mr M. Ulu\u00e7, of the Istanbul Bar, and Ms R. Halperin-Kaddari, a lawyer practising in Israel.", "The third-party intervener in the case, Mr Jacques Gabriel Chelouche, of Franco-Israeli nationality and father of the second applicant, was born in 1959 and lives in Tel Aviv.", "He was represented before the Court by Mr F. Ruhlmann, of the Strasbourg Bar, assisted at the hearing by Ms M. Lemarchand, a lawyer practising in Paris, and Mr S. Moran, a lawyer practising in Israel.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by those appearing before the Court, may be summarised as follows.", "On 20 April 1997 Mrs Eskinazi married Mr Chelouche. The civil wedding took place before the French consular authorities in Tel Aviv. A Jewish wedding ceremony also took place in the same city.", "The couple apparently intended to settle permanently in Paris, although Mr Chelouche\u2019s professional activities often kept him in Israel and Mrs Eskinazi often went to Turkey, either for work purposes or to visit her family.", "As she never sought to acquire Israeli nationality, the first applicant used to stay in Israel on three-month tourist visas issued by the Israeli consulate in Turkey.", "On 27 January 2000 the second applicant was born in Tel Aviv. The couple continued travelling between the three countries, however. The child was always accompanied by her mother.", "As time went by the couple\u2019s relationship deteriorated.", "On 8 April 2004 the applicants went to Turkey for Passover. The plan was that they would stay there for ten days. Mrs Eskinazi put off the return date a number of times, however, and ultimately decided to remain in Turkey.", "On 29 April 2004 the first applicant filed a divorce petition (case no. 2004-375) with the single judge of the Sar\u0131yer Family Affairs Court in Istanbul (\u201cthe Sar\u0131yer Court\u201d).", "On 30 April 2004 the Sar\u0131yer Court awarded Mrs Eskinazi interim custody of her daughter. Up until then Mrs Eskinazi and Mr Chelouche had had joint custody of their daughter.", "On 16 May 2004, having been informed of the situation, Mr Chelouche in turn petitioned for divorce in the Tel Aviv Rabbinical Court (Batei Had\u00een Harabaniim Haezorim \u2013 \u201cthe Rabbinical Court\u201d), composed of three religious judges (dayanim). Mr Chelouche asked for the issue of custody of his daughter to be determined at the same time as that of the religious dissolution of the marriage. That request conferred full jurisdiction ipso jure on the Rabbinical Court to rule on the issue of custody rights.", "In his pleadings Mr Chelouche expressed the fear that his daughter would emigrate from Israel, which, judging by his wife\u2019s conduct, would sever all his ties with his daughter.", "...", "On the same day the Rabbinical Court made two orders.", "In the first one it ordered Mrs Eskinazi to bring her daughter back to Israel within seven days, failing which her action would be deemed \u201cwrongful removal of the child\u201d within the meaning of Article 15 of the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (\u201cthe Hague Convention\u201d). The first applicant was informed of the order by telephone, and subsequently by fax and mail, and was given three days in which to reply.", "Before giving its ruling, the Rabbinical Court found it to be established that after their marriage the couple had elected Israel as the family\u2019s fixed place of residence, and that Mrs Eskinazi, although a Turkish national, had continually lived in Israel, had obtained a driving licence and work permit in that country and had opened a bank account there. Pointing out that the child was a minor, of Israeli nationality and resident in Israel, the Rabbinical Court noted that the mother had taken the child to Turkey on 8 April 2004 supposedly for ten days, but had never returned.", "The order in question authorised the father to confiscate the child\u2019s passport, once she crossed the Israeli border, and to \u201cuse all means\u201d to safeguard his parental rights.", "In the second order the Rabbinical Court also imposed a prohibition on Mrs Eskinazi and her daughter leaving Israeli territory. That measure, which was initially valid until 17 May 2005, was lifted on 12 January 2005.", "On 10 February 2005 the Rabbinical Court decided to adjourn its hearing in the divorce proceedings, which are still pending. Mrs Eskinazi is represented in those proceedings by two members of the Tel Aviv Bar.", "As a first step, Mr Chelouche lodged a criminal complaint in Turkey against his wife for child abduction. The Sar\u0131yer public prosecutor\u2019s office took no action, however, on the ground that the case fell to be dealt with under the Hague Convention and should be brought before the bodies having jurisdiction to deal with it.", "Mr Chelouche therefore applied to the Ministry of Justice of his country, designated as the Central Authority (\u201cIsrael\u2019s Central Authority\u201d), for assistance in securing his daughter\u2019s return to Israel, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Articles 8 and 9 of the Hague Convention.", "On 10 June 2004, for the purposes of those proceedings, Israel\u2019s Central Authority sent the two aforementioned orders of the Rabbinical Court to its Turkish counterpart, namely, the General Directorate of International Law and Foreign Relations at the Ministry of Justice (\u201cTurkey\u2019s Central Authority\u201d).", "On 23 June 2004 Turkey\u2019s Central Authority instructed the Sar\u0131yer public prosecutor (\u201cthe public prosecutor\u201d) to ascertain the child\u2019s current address, apply to the Sar\u0131yer Court for an order prohibiting her from leaving Turkish territory, and to summon Mrs Eskinazi in order to obtain a statement from her about the alleged abduction.", "On 1 July 2004 the Sar\u0131yer Court decided, in case no. 2004-375, to issue the order requested by the public prosecutor, and gave instructions for the border posts to be informed accordingly.", "On 6 July 2004 Turkey\u2019s Central Authority was sent two further applications by the Israeli authorities claiming that, under Article 16 of the Hague Convention, custody rights should be withdrawn from Mrs Eskinazi as the Rabbinical Court had found her liable for \u201cchild abduction\u201d.", "Turkey\u2019s Central Authority then instructed the public prosecutor to raise a preliminary question in case no. 2004-375 pending before the Sar\u0131yer Court, requesting the court not to rule on the custody of the child pending the outcome of the dispute regarding her return to Israel. On 9 July 2004 the Sar\u0131yer Court followed the public prosecutor\u2019s advice and withdrew Mrs Eskinazi\u2019s custody of her daughter.", "On 19 July 2004 friendly-settlement negotiations, conducted at the request of Turkey\u2019s Central Authority and under the aegis of the Sar\u0131yer Court, failed after Mr Chelouche insisted on his daughter\u2019s repatriation.", "On 23 July 2004 Turkey\u2019s Central Authority sent Mrs Eskinazi\u2019s lawyer a request from the Israeli authorities regarding the arrangements proposed by Mr Chelouche for visiting his daughter in Istanbul.", "On 16 August 2004 the public prosecutor brought proceedings in the Sar\u0131yer Court for the return of the child to her father (case no. 2004-683).", "The Sar\u0131yer Court held two hearings in the case.", "At the hearing on 17 September 2004 the parties submitted their preliminary observations. Counsel for Mrs Eskinazi argued that the Hague Convention was inapplicable in a number of respects to the case in hand and produced in support of that submission private legal opinions by Turkish professors of private international law and French lawyers.", "With a view to proving that the child was socially integrated in Turkey and had ties there, Mrs Eskinazi also relied on numerous documents and witness statements, and asserted that the girl had gone with her to Turkey with the father\u2019s consent and could not therefore be regarded as having been abducted.", "Mr Chelouche, for his part, disputed those submissions and called two witnesses: his uncle and mother.", "At the end of the hearing the court fixed the father\u2019s visiting days. The visits were to take place at the mother\u2019s home in the presence of a social worker, but without the mother being present.", "At the following hearing, on 25 October 2004, which was the last one, the Sar\u0131yer Court first took formal note of the documents produced by Turkey\u2019s Central Authority in support of Mr Chelouche\u2019s application. These were statements from nurseries and paediatricians in Israel. Also produced in the proceedings was an official record of the dates on which the child had gone in and out of Israel during the period 2000-04, drawn up by the Tel Aviv city authorities and the Israeli and Turkish border police.", "During the proceedings Mr Chelouche, referring in particular to the information provided by the Central Authorities, claimed that his daughter had spent 76% of her life in Israel. He submitted that his right was established and that a ruling had to be made expeditiously, since Article 11 of the Hague Convention required proceedings to be disposed of within six weeks.", "The court then heard evidence from Mr Chelouche\u2019s mother and uncle and from the defendant\u2019s eight witnesses. According to the latter, the child and her mother had mainly spent their time in Turkey, with the father\u2019s knowledge. The first applicant also produced a written statement to that effect by Mr S. Levi, an Israeli importer known to the couple.", "Mrs Eskinazi relied further on photocopies of her passport, declaring that she had never stayed in Israel for more than 132 days out of 365 and had always had her daughter with her. She also submitted several psychologists\u2019 opinions questioning Mr Chelouche\u2019s ability to assume custody of his daughter.", "In addition, Mrs Eskinazi challenged the participation of a public prosecutor in the proceedings and complained that the plaintiff was attempting to influence the court by referring to observations of the Turkish Central Authority that were not based on any final judicial and binding decision awarding custody of the child to the father, that right having previously been exercised jointly by the parents in Israel.", "Lastly, Mrs Eskinazi submitted a list of further witnesses. The public prosecutor opposed her application to call them, arguing that the case was ready for decision and that, in the light of the evidence, the court should find in favour of Mr Chelouche.", "In accordance with Article 13 (b), second paragraph, of the Hague Convention, the Sar\u0131yer Court did not hear the second applicant on account of her young age.", "At the end of the proceedings the Sar\u0131yer Court decided that the child should be returned to her father in Israel, and maintained the prohibition on her leaving Turkey until the judgment became final.", "The court found that, whilst the parties to the dispute had joint custody of their daughter, Mrs Eskinazi had assured Mr Chelouche that she would go to Turkey on 8 April 2004, as usual, and return on 18 April, which she had not done in the end, contrary to the father\u2019s wishes. Having regard in particular to the official record provided by Israel\u2019s Central Authority, the court found that, during the period 2000-04, that is, until Miss Chelouche was removed, she had spent only 455 days outside Israel.", "The other relevant passages from the judgment read as follows:", "\u201c... The Court cannot accept the argument submitted by the defendant and her representative that the child\u2019s habitual place of residence is not Israel. In the light of the two-page official document issued by the Israeli Ministry of the Interior ... setting out the dates of the child\u2019s entry into and exit from Israel between 2000 and 2004 ... and the other documents ..., it is established that, from her birth onwards, the child spent most of her life in Israel. The assertion regarding the habitual place of residence is therefore inadmissible, particularly when regard is had to the fact that the defendant declared on 15 July 2004 before the Sar\u0131yer public prosecutor that she had lived in Israel for the six years that elapsed following the marriage. The child\u2019s habitual place of residence, prior to her removal, was therefore Israel, notwithstanding the contrary statements by the defendant\u2019s witnesses, which are not based on established facts and are contradicted by the official documents filed in the proceedings.", "Nor can the Court accept the final submission of the defendant\u2019s representative, based on Article 13 (b) of the Hague Convention, according to which the conditions for ordering the child\u2019s return are not satisfied on account of the state of war affecting Israel. It would appear that life in Israel pursues its normal course regarding, among other things, teaching, education, business, tourism, etc., and that the conflict and disorder in the country are confined to certain specific regions. Moreover, the conflict, which is not new and has been going on for many years, did not stop the parties from continuing to live in Israel. Furthermore, the existence of a grave risk, within the meaning of Article 13 (b) of the Hague Convention, that her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place her in an intolerable situation has not been established. Thus, the conditions for refusing to return the child, as specified in the said Article, have not been made out.\u201d", "The judge of the Sar\u0131yer Court concluded as follows:", "\u201c... After hearing the parties\u2019 submissions, I consider it established that Caroline Ruth Chelouche was taken to Turkey by her mother and subsequently removed ... from her father, contrary to the latter\u2019s wishes, in breach of Article 3 of the Hague Convention ... I also consider it established that the requirements regarding the time-limit stipulated in Article 12 \u00a7 1 of [that convention] are satisfied, but that the conditions capable of justifying a refusal to return the child in the light of Articles 13 and 20 are not.\u201d", "On 1 November 2005, following the divorce proceedings instituted by her husband, Mrs Eskinazi applied to the Tel Aviv Civil Family Court (Batei Mishpath Lelnyanei Hamishpa\u2019ha), using an Israeli lawyer. The application, which was lodged on Caroline Chelouche\u2019s behalf, sought to challenge the jurisdiction of the religious courts on the ground that the mother was not an Israeli national and did not reside in Israel.", "However, after a thorough examination of the case another lawyer convinced the first applicant that the application \u201cstood no chance of success\u201d, and she withdrew it on 23 November 2005.", "On 11 February 2005 Mrs Eskinazi\u2019s final application for reinstatement of custody of her daughter, in case no. 2004-375, was dismissed by the Sar\u0131yer Court, having regard to the order for the child\u2019s return in case no. 2004-683.", "On 18 February 2005 Mrs Eskinazi appealed on points of law against the decision to return the child to her father. Relying on the concept of the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d, she maintained that her daughter\u2019s habitual residence was in Turkey. In her submission, a child could have several places of residence, under the rules of international law, and, in any event, the Hague Convention could not be applied merely by calculating the number of days the child had spent in Israel.", "The first applicant argued that the child could not therefore be considered to have been abducted, especially as the father had knowingly agreed to the child gradually settling in Turkey; Mr Chelouche had neither a fixed place of residence nor regular work commitments in Israel, and had himself been keen to settle elsewhere.", "According to Mrs Eskinazi, he had in fact acted in bad faith in order to have the child\u2019s habitual residence established arbitrarily, deliberately referring the matter to a rabbinical court, which \u2013 despite having no jurisdiction \u2013 had ruled in the absence of the mother on the basis of religious tenets and with total disregard for the principles of equality of arms and adversarial process.", "Lastly, Mrs Eskinazi\u2019s lawyer referred to the prosecution\u2019s participation in the proceedings before the Sar\u0131yer Court, alleging that this had considerably swayed the mind of the single judge of the Sar\u0131yer Court.", "...", "On 22 March 2005 the Court of Cassation held a hearing at which it heard submissions from both parties\u2019 representatives. On 29 March 2005 it upheld all the provisions of the impugned judgment.", "The applicant then lodged an application for rectification of a judgment.", "On 25 April 2005, at the request of its Israeli counterpart, Turkey\u2019s Central Authority instructed the public prosecutor to take the necessary measures to prevent Mrs Eskinazi from leaving with the child.", "On 22 September 2005 Mrs Eskinazi\u2019s application for rectification was refused and the judgment ordering the child\u2019s return thus became final.", "On 10 October 2005 Mr Chelouche brought enforcement proceedings for the return of his daughter.", "Enforcement of the judgment was stayed, however, in accordance with the interim measure indicated in the case by the European Court under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.", "A report drawn up on 22 October 2004 by the social worker responsible for overseeing the parental visits noted that Mrs Eskinazi had made efforts to ensure that the child\u2019s meetings with her father were conducted smoothly and in a warm atmosphere. A second report, filed in the proceedings on 25 October 2004, on the date when the judgment at first instance was delivered, still referred to a harmonious relationship between the child and her father.", "However, the many further reports drawn up by social workers after that judgment were increasingly critical of the father.", "On 27 February 2005, when visiting the child at Mrs Eskinazi\u2019s flat, Mr Chelouche allegedly attacked the social worker present, insisting that he wanted to talk to his daughter alone. He allegedly also caused damage in the flat. A complaint lodged in connection with those events led to the institution of criminal proceedings, which are still pending.", "It appears that relations deteriorated still further after that incident, and on 7 May 2005, at Mrs Eskinazi\u2019s request, a second indictment was filed against Mr Chelouche.", "Following a series of psychiatric examinations carried out in September and October 2005, in the appropriate departments of two university hospitals, the second applicant was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. She has been taking medication ever since.", "For some of the provisions of this convention, see, for example, Iglesias Gil and A.U.I. v. Spain (no. 56673/00, \u00a7 29, ECHR 2003-V). The following Articles are also relevant:", "\u201cIf the Central Authority which receives an application referred to in Article 8 has reason to believe that the child is in another Contracting State, it shall directly and without delay transmit the application to the Central Authority of that Contracting State and inform the requesting Central Authority, or the applicant, as the case may be.\u201d", "...", "\u201cIn ascertaining whether there has been a wrongful removal or retention within the meaning of Article 3, the judicial or administrative authorities of the requested State may take notice directly of the law of, and of judicial or administrative decisions, formally recognised or not in the State of the habitual residence of the child, without recourse to the specific procedures for the proof of that law or for the recognition of foreign decisions which would otherwise be applicable.\u201d", "\u201cThe judicial or administrative authorities of a Contracting State may, prior to the making of an order for the return of the child, request that the applicant obtain from the authorities of the State of the habitual residence of the child a decision or other determination that the removal or retention was wrongful within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention, where such a decision or determination may be obtained in that State.

The religious courts are governed by the Rabbinical Courts (Marriage and Divorce) Act (Law no. 5713/1953). The laws applicable to Israeli Jews in the sphere of personal status are generally based on the Torah and the Halacha.", "For parties of the Jewish faith, the regional rabbinical courts (Batei Had\u00een Harabaniim) have exclusive jurisdiction in the areas of, among other things, divorce, marriage and diet of the members of their community. They also have jurisdiction in any other sphere relating to the personal status of Jews (such as custody and contact rights in respect of children, maintenance payments, filiation, etc.). Moreover, in respect of those matters, the regional rabbinical courts and the civil family courts (Batei Mishpath Lelnyanei Hamishpa\u2019ha) \u2013 which are governed by the Family Courts Act (Law no. 5755/1995) \u2013 are vested with concurrent jurisdiction, which, in practice, becomes exclusive for the court before which the case is first brought.", "Decisions of the rabbinical courts delivered at first instance are subject to review by the Grand Rabbinical Court (Beith Had\u00een Harabani Hagadol), which is the appeal court.", "Whether a case is tried by the rabbinical or the civil courts, the final court of appeal is the Supreme Court. According to the information in the Court\u2019s possession, however, in respect of the rabbinical courts the Supreme Court acts as High Court of Justice, under section 15(c) of the above-mentioned Law of 1984, and, accordingly, the object and scope of its power of review are more limited. In practice, it would appear that this power of review is often exercised in respect of disputes relating to the jurisdiction of the rabbinical courts and, more rarely, in cases of denial of natural rights and non-application of the mandatory provisions of civil law. It is accepted that, in cases of conflict of jurisdiction, the Supreme Court can set aside the decision of the rabbinical court and refer the case to a civil court, but that, where errors of law with regard to the Halacha are concerned, it will merely remit the case to the original rabbinical court for it alone to amend its decision.", "...", "Many Israeli writers point to the inequality between the sexes in the rabbinical courts, particularly in connection with the get institution, which is often criticised by Israeli society.
