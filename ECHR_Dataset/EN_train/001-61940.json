The witness, who is the second applicant, stated that on 22 November 1993 police officers had come to their house at about 1 a.m. He saw Feyzi Tatl\u0131, a distant relative, with the police officers. The police officers carried out a quick search in the house and asked for his brother Mehmet \u015eah. His father, Abdurrazak, told them that Mehmet \u015eah was staying at his uncle's house. Accordingly, the witness accepted to accompany the three police officers to his uncle's house. When they arrived, the witness knocked on the door.

The witness did not see anyone in this third place but heard the voices of his uncle, Feyzi Tatl\u0131, and Mehmet \u015eah. Mehmet \u015eah was screaming in pain. The witness was kept there for thirteen days and he was allegedly ill-treated. The officers told him that his brother had escaped to the mountains. He was forced to sign a statement without reading its content. When he was released from custody, the witness went to the public prosecutor with his father to discover the fate of Mehmet \u015eah. The witness stated that when Mehmet \u015eah's body was identified from the photographs, they were told that he had been buried. An officer showed them two graves and informed them that he did not know which one was Mehmet \u015eah's.", "47. The witness, who is the first applicant's nephew, stated that on the night of 22 November 1993, he was at his father's house. His father (Abd\u00fclkadir \u0130kincisoy), his mother (Adile), his wife (Sabriye), his children, his brother (Muhlis), and his brother's children were also at home. He recalled that his uncle's son, Mehmet \u015eah and his two friends had spent the night with them. The witness maintained that at about 1 a.m. two plain-clothes police officers had come to their house, together with his cousin Halil, searching for Mehmet \u015eah. At that time Mehmet \u015eah was sleeping in the guest room, together with his two friends and the brother of the witness, Muhlis. The police officers carried out an identity check and then told Mehmet \u015eah and his two friends that they had to come to the police station for interrogation. One of the officers held Mehmet \u015eah by the arm. At that moment they heard a gun shot. The police officer who was holding Mehmet \u015eah also started shooting. Mehmet \u015eah tried to prevent the police officer from shooting but the same police officer dragged him down the stairs. The witness further recalled that the family members fled to their neighbour's to protect themselves. After some time, more police officers arrived and arrested everyone. While they were being taken to the police station, the witness saw that one of the persons who had come with Mehmet \u015eah had been shot dead. The witness was put in a car and taken to the Rapid Intervention Headquarters. He remembered standing in a long corridor. Despite the fact that he was blindfolded, the witness was able to see around. He saw that his mother, his wife, the daughter of Muhlis and his uncle were also there. He also saw Feyzi Tatl\u0131, a distant cousin. The witness said that he was taken to a room which was wet, where he saw Mehmet \u015eah, who was being tortured. Mehmet \u015eah was lying on the floor. He said to the witness \u201cOur family is ruined. They will kill us all. What is this we are going through?\u201d. The witness stated that this was the last time he saw Mehmet \u015eah.", "48. The witness, who is the daughter of the first applicant and the sister of the second, was at her father's house on the night of the incident. She said that while they were sleeping at home, some police officers came to their house and asked about her brother Mehmet \u015eah. When her father explained to the police officers that Mehmet \u015eah was staying at his uncle's house, the police officers left the house, taking Halil with them. Some time after, the police officers came back and arrested everyone in the house, including the witness. They were first taken to \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131 Police Station and then to the police headquarters. The witness explained that she had not seen Mehmet \u015eah in the \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131 Station but she had seen him at the police headquarters. When they arrived at the police headquarters, they walked upstairs and were taken into a hall. Their eyes were not covered but they were forced to hold their hands behind the back of their necks. They were made to stand facing the wall. When the witness glanced over her shoulder, she saw that Mehmet \u015eah was standing next to her. This was the last time she saw him. However she recalled hearing his voice at the Rapid Intervention Force, which was the third place they were taken to. He was moaning. She was kept in a cell, together with Makbule, Nefise, Adile, Bilge and Sabriye \u0130kincisoy. At some point, Sabriye and Makbule were taken out of the cell and when they came back they were shivering. They therefore requested a blanket from the guardians and the guardians gave them a brown leather jacket which belonged to Mehmet \u015eah.", "49. The witness affirmed that he was a police officer at the Anti-Terrorism Branch of Diyarbak\u0131r Security Directorate at the time of the events. He recalled that after receiving information from Feyzi Tatl\u0131, a person who was under custody, that Mehmet \u015eah had been aiding and abetting the PKK, an operation was prepared. Feyzi Tatl\u0131 was asked to point out the house of Mehmet \u015eah to a group of five police officers, including the witness. On 22 November 1993 at about 1 a.m. they arrived at the apartment of Abdurrazak, the father of Mehmet \u015eah. Abdurrazak1 told them that his son was staying at his uncle's house. Accordingly, taking a young person with them to show them the way, and leaving one police officer in the house of Abdurrazak1, they left. When they arrived at Mehmet \u015eah's uncle's house, one police officer remained near the patrol car, and the witness stayed outside the building. Two police officers went upstairs. A few minutes later the witness heard gun shots from upstairs. One of the police officers, Mustafa H\u00fcnerlit\u00fcrko\u011flu, came downstairs, holding someone by the wrist. He told the witness that the third police officer, Ali\u015fan, had been shot. The witness entered the building to help his colleague. At that time Mustafa went outside, still holding the detainee by the wrist. The witness then heard footsteps and he hid under the stairs. A person fired a Kalashnikov rifle at the witness and wounded him in the abdomen. The witness fired back and killed the person who had fired at him. He then went out of the building to get help. When officer Mustafa saw that the witness was wounded, he left the detainee and ran towards him. The person who had been in custody ran away. The witness was subsequently taken to hospital, where he underwent an operation. When he regained consciousness in the hospital, his colleagues asked him to sign the incident report they had prepared. The public prosecutor further took his statement while he was still in intensive care. The witness accepted that there had been a mistake in the names that appeared in the incident report. He agreed that instead of Hanefi \u0130kincisoy, the name should have read Mehmet \u015eah \u0130kincisoy. The witness further explained that he had not been involved in the arrests or interrogations of the people who had been in the house at the time of the incident.", "50. The witness confirmed that he was one of the five police officers who had gone to Mehmet \u015eah's apartment on 22 November 1993 at about 1 a.m. He recalled that after Feyzi Tatl\u0131, a detainee, confessed during a police interrogation that Mehmet \u015eah was aiding and abetting the PKK, an operation was conducted to apprehend this person. Feyzi Tatl\u0131 showed them where Mehmet \u015eah lived. When they set off to arrest Mehmet \u015eah, the officers did not know what he looked like. One of the police officers stayed in the car, and the other four went into the house. Feyzi Tatl\u0131 was sent back to the police station in another vehicle. An elderly person opened the door, and informed them that Mehmet \u015eah was staying at his uncle's house that night. A young person accompanied the officers to the house in question. One of the police officers stayed behind in the house to ensure that no one could call Mehmet \u015eah to warn him. Accordingly, the three police officers and the young person went to the house of Mehmet \u015eah's uncle. A middle aged lady opened the door. The witness stated that they told the lady they would carry out an identity check and they entered the apartment. The witness went inside the room that was on the opposite side of the entrance. In that room, there were women and children. In the meantime, his colleague Ali\u015fan went inside another room from which an old man and a younger man had come out. The officers found a third room, in which four persons were sleeping. The witness made them stand in the corridor, while Ali\u015fan stayed in the room and called them in one by one for an identity check. A few minutes later, the witness heard noises coming from the third room and when he went in, he saw that a man was struggling with officer Ali\u015fan. The witness tried to help however the other persons interfered. One of the men had a Kalashnikov rifle and he fired at Ali\u015fan. When the witness saw that Ali\u015fan was shot, he grabbed one of the men, who did not have a gun, to use him as a shield. The witness ran downstairs to get help, still holding that man by his wrist. Downstairs, he met the third officer, \u015eerif, and told him that an armed clash had broken out upstairs and that Ali\u015fan had been shot. The witness then went outside the building to go to the car to use the radio. At that time, he heard \u015eerif ordering someone to surrender and subsequently he heard gun shots. The witness ran back to the building, letting go off the person he was holding. When he entered the building he saw that \u015eerif had been shot and the person who had shot at him had been killed. They called for reinforcements. 15 to 20 minutes after the incident, they were able to send \u015eerif to the hospital and thereafter he drafted the incident report by hand. The witness further explained that he had given the incident report to his colleagues who had arrived at the scene of incident and they had typed it up. He remembered signing the typed incident report at the hospital. When asked about the names indicated in the incident report, the witness admitted that there was a mistake. He had written Mehmet \u015eah's name as Hanefi \u0130kincisoy. The witness further maintained that he had given a statement to the public prosecutor in the hospital. The witness also stated that he had not seen the photos of the two terrorists who were killed in a clash, the day after the incident.", "51. The witness confirmed that he had signed the autopsy report of Mehmet \u015eah \u0130kincisoy. He is a doctor specialised in forensic medicine and pathology. He has been a forensic doctor since 1991. The witness did not recall the autopsy of Mehmet \u015eah however by looking at the documents he explained that the estimated time of death was 36 hours before the autopsy was carried out. There were no bruises on the body. There were certain discoloured spots but these were not signs of beating or force. The cause of death was the two bullets that had entered from the upper back region. There was an exit hole around the left breast, and another exit hole on the upper right side of the chest. Dr E\u011filmez concluded that the entry and exit holes made it clear that the person had not been shot at close range.", "52. The witness affirmed that he was the head of Diyarbak\u0131r Anti-Terrorism Department at the time of the incident. He recalled that on the basis of information received from a detainee, Feyzi Tatl\u0131, an operation was carried out to apprehend certain people. The witness was the head of the Central Branch however the interrogation office was located in the Rapid Intervention Force Building, which was also known as the police school. Officer S\u00fcr\u00fcc\u00fc stated that as a general rule, the detainees were taken directly to the police school for interrogation. When asked about the armed clash, during which Mehmet \u015eah had allegedly been killed, the witness stated that he had not been directly involved in the operation. Although his name appeared on the incident report, he explained that these reports were usually signed by the officers who were replacing him and who had the power to sign for him. He remembered however that, on the day of the clash, they had received an anonymous call indicating that the two terrorists, who had escaped the day before, were hiding in a hut.", "53. The witness further confirmed that he had never been interrogated concerning the allegation that Mehmet \u015eah had died under torture.", "54. The witness, who is a police officer, stated that he was serving at the interrogation office of the Anti-Terrorism Department of Diyarbak\u0131r police headquarters in November 1993. He was police superintendent. The witness explained that, at that time, there were three interrogation teams and he was in charge of the first team. When asked about the general procedure that was followed after a person was arrested, he explained that before being brought for interrogation, all arrested persons were first sent for a medical examination. He emphasized the fact that the detainees were not blindfolded during the interrogation and that no one had been ill-treated. The interrogation office command was located in the headquarters of the Rapid Intervention Force in Diyarbak\u0131r. All the interrogations were conducted there. He refused the suggestion that the detainees could first be taken to the \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131 Police Station. When a detainee was interrogated, the officers first asked about his past, and then certain questions were put to him. There was no standard form of procedure for interrogation.", "55. The witness affirmed that he had been involved in the interrogation of Feyzi Tatl\u0131 as well as the \u0130kincisoy family members. However he could not remember the interrogation of the \u0130kincisoy family members very clearly as it was almost six years ago. He recalled that upon receipt of intelligence to the effect that the two persons who had escaped the day before had been seen in a hut, an operation was conducted to apprehend them. The witness further took part in the operation together with 14 police officers. They were all wearing bullet proof vests. Before the armed clash, the officers asked the two persons to surrender but the two men started shooting at the officers. The clash lasted for about twenty minutes. They were about 15 metres away from the hut. No officer was wounded. When no-one returned their fire, the officers entered the hut and found two bodies. The hut was about ten square metres, it had a wooden door and a small window. Shortly after the armed clash, another team arrived and took photographs in the hut. The witness explained that he had never referred to this incident or showed the photographs to the \u0130kincisoy family members during their interrogation.", "56. The witness affirmed that he had been the Diyarbak\u0131r Public Prosecutor from December 1993 to September 1995. He recalled that he had taken a statement from the first applicant concerning his application to the European Commission of Human Rights on 6 June 1995. The witness explained that, by a letter dated 24 May 1995 from the International Law and Foreign Affairs Directorate of the Ministry of Justice, he was instructed to take the applicant's statement concerning his application to Strasbourg and to verify certain signatures on some documents. Accordingly, he had written to the Diyarbak\u0131r Security Department to notify the applicant that he was called to the office of the public prosecutor. The public prosecutor stated that the applicant had come to his office alone, of his own free will. No police officer had accompanied him to the public prosecutor's office. His statement was taken in the office of the clerks and not in the interrogation room. While they were in the office, the applicant seemed relaxed. The public prosecutor showed him certain documents, which were annexed to the letter from the Ministry. While accepting that these signatures belonged to him, the applicant stated that he did not remember signing these documents. The public prosecutor further recalled that the applicant had clearly stated that he did not want any foreign lawyers to make any applications before international bodies. The public prosecutor wrote down everything the applicant told him and read it out. The applicant accordingly signed his statement. The public prosecutor further admitted that he had not taken any steps to investigate the complaint, mentioned in the applicant's statement, that he had been ill-treated in custody and that his ribs had been broken.", "57.
