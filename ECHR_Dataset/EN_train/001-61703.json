The investigations in order to apprehend the co-activists of Cevat \u00d6zalp are still ongoing.

Cavit guided the soldiers to the shelter near the \u015eedat road in the Kamberli village. While protecting themselves in a secure distance, the soldiers asked him to open the cover of the shelter. As he opened the cover, the soldiers witnessed a big explosion, which tore Cavit's body into pieces.

However, as the public prosecutor did not have the jurisdiction to bring proceedings against the non-commissioned officer, he declared lack of jurisdiction and transferred the case file to the Bismil District Administrative Council.", "24. Subsequently, the District Administrative Council appointed a major as a rapporteur to conduct further investigations into the killing of Cavit \u00d6zalp. On 15 January 1996 the major took statements from the non-commissioned officers, Mr \u0130lhan Y\u00fccel, Mr Y\u0131lmaz \u00d6ztiryaki and Mr \u00d6mer Karaba\u015f, who had been on site during the incident of 26 August 1995. The officers stated that Cavit \u00d6zalp had been taken into custody on suspicion of membership of the PKK and had confessed that he had been aiding and abetting the terrorists, providing them with food, clothes, weapons and medical equipment.

The soldiers explained that Cavit was asked to open the shelter, however he had died as a result of the explosion. The officers finally stated that medical equipment and clothes had been found in the shelter.", "25. Basing himself on the statements of the three accused non-commissioned soldiers, the incident and the body examination reports, on 23 January 1996 the rapporteur submitted his report to the District Administrative Council.

The report further stated:", "\u201cHaving regard to the fact that Cavit \u00d6zalp had confessed that he had dug a shelter [with the other terrorists] it was presumed that he could have known the place of the shelter and that he could have safely opened its cover himself. After the necessary safety measures had been taken, he had been asked to open the cover. However, he had died in an explosion. The explosives had been previously placed there by the terrorists. Neither the security forces nor Cavit \u00d6zalp had noticed the explosives.\u201d", "26.
