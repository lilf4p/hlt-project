The defendant's flat was subject to a charging order.", "On 18 August 1999 the bailiff seized the defendant's car and lifted the charging order on the flat.", "On 20 August 1999 the bailiff suspended the enforcement proceedings until 26 August 1999 due to the defendant's husband's request to separate his property from that of his wife to preserve his share.", "Following the lifting of the charging order the applicant learned that the defendant had sold the flat and bought another one. The applicant alleges that the defendant sold the flat at the price RUR 180,000 and paid RUR 112,000 for the new one.", "The applicant brought two sets of proceedings against the bailiff.

It found that the bailiff's unlawful act allowed the defendant to dispose of the flat, which impeded the enforcement proceedings.", "On 1 June 2000 the Sovetskiy District Court of Omsk defined the property shares between the defendant and her husband.", "The applicant brought an action against the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation (\u041c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0444\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0420\u0424) and the Department of Justice of the Omsk Region (\u0423\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u044e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0430\u0434\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u041e\u043c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438).

She sought a total sum of RUR 82,838.00, representing the principal debt and the outstanding interest.", "On 14 February 2001 the Central District Court of Omsk dismissed her claim. It stated that \u201cneither the fact that the lifting of the charging order had been declared unlawful nor the undue delay of enforcement proceedings, although they resulted in a failure to execute the judgment, justifies an action for damages against the [authorities] because it was the [debtor under the loan] who had caused the damage to the applicant and who was liable pursuant to the judgment.\u201d The court found \u201cneither a fault on the part of the bailiff, nor a causal link between the bailiff's act and the damage caused\u201d.", "On 11 April 2001 the Omsk Regional Court acting on appeal upheld the judgment of 14 February 2001.
