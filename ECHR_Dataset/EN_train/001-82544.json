Before 2000 she was a resident of Grozny, Chechnya, which she left for Ingushetia. She currently resides in Norway.", "7. The submissions of the parties with regard to the facts concerning the circumstances of the events of 19 January 2000 and the ensuing investigation are set out in Part A below. A description of the documents submitted to the Court is contained in Part B.", "8. In July 2004 the applicant produced a detailed account of the attack on her. She submitted that prior to 1999 she and her family lived at 10 Skvoznoy Lane in the Katayama settlement in the Staropromyslovskiy district in Grozny. The applicant has a daughter who was born in 1982. They lived in Kazakhstan until 1990 and then moved to her parents' flat in Grozny. In 1993 the applicant removed her daughter from Chechnya after the school which she attended came under attack.", "9. In October 1999 hostilities resumed in Chechnya between the Russian forces and the Chechen fighters. Grozny and its suburbs came under heavy bombardment. Staropromyslovskiy district, situated in the northern and central parts of the town, was bombarded from the air and by artillery. The applicant submitted that most residents of the district left for safer areas. The applicant, who stayed because of her poor health, spent the winter of 1999-2000 hiding from bombardments in the cellars, along with the few other remaining residents of the district. Following heavy fighting, as of December 1999 the Russian forces started to regain control over the city from the north, and by the end of January 2000 the central parts of the city were finally taken.", "10. On 19 January 2000 a massive attack by the federal forces on their district began. The applicant and five other persons were hiding in a garage located in 4th Neftyanoy Lane and when the shelling intensified they ran to a nearby cellar. While running, the applicant was wounded in her leg. When the shelling subsided, several military servicemen appeared and ordered everyone out of the cellar. The applicant and others walked out, with their hands on their heads. The soldiers told them that they had an order to kill everyone and that those who remained in the city had assisted the fighters (\u201cboyeviki\u201d).", "11. The applicant submitted that the soldiers had not listened to their explanations and refused to look at their identity documents. They had ordered the inhabitants to return to the cellar and, once the residents went downstairs, threw tear-gas grenades into it. The people in the cellar wept and asked them to stop, and finally the soldiers ordered them to come out again, one by one. The applicant, who was wounded, could not walk by herself and was assisted by a Chechen man. Two Russian women and another Chechen man walked out first and were shot at the entrance to the garage by machine-gun fire. The soldiers then shot at the third woman and at the applicant and her helper, whose body eventually covered hers.", "12. The applicant lost consciousness and, when she awoke, she realised that the others were dead. She was wounded in the chest and was bleeding from the mouth. When night fell, the applicant walked over to a neighbouring street where the Khashiyev family lived (see Khashiyev and Akayeva v. Russia, nos. 57942/00 and 57945/00, 24 February 2005). They gave her first aid and allowed her to stay in their shed. They said that they were expecting a second check [by security forces] and were afraid to let her into the house.", "13. The applicant, who was bleeding and afraid to remain in Grozny, changed clothes and walked to the roadblock with a white flag. There the soldiers checked her documents and let her through. The applicant did not tell them about the attack on her. On the morning of the following day the applicant was taken to Ingushetia by Petimat Goygova (the applicant in the case of Goygova v. Russia, no. 74240/01) who had been looking for her relatives in the Staropromyslovskiy district (they were later found killed).", "14. The applicant remained in the Ordzhonikidze village (Sunzhenskiy district) hospital until 7 February 2000.

It was also related in several publications.", "16. After being discharged from hospital, the applicant stayed in Ingushetia, in the premises of an old pig farm used by other refugees from Chechnya. In summer 2000 the applicant went to Grozny to find out about the state of her flat and property. Her neighbours told her that unknown persons had been looking for her.", "17. The applicant did not seek any direct contacts with law-enforcement bodies in the aftermath of the attack. Nevertheless the events in the Staropromyslovskiy district, including the attack on the applicant, became known to the authorities shortly afterwards due to NGO and media reports.", "18. Several human-rights NGOs contacted the law-enforcement authorities in relation to the events in the Staropromyslovskiy district of Grozny in January 2000, when several dozen local residents were allegedly executed by unidentified detachments of the Russian military.", "19. In February 2000 Human Rights Watch issued a report entitled \u201cCivilian Killings in Staropromyslovskiy District of Grozny\u201d in which it accused the Russian forces of deliberately murdering at least 38 civilians between late December and mid-January. Human Rights Watch interviewed survivors, eyewitnesses and relatives of the dead.

In her letter she submitted that on 9 February 2000 she had seen five bodies (three women and two men) in a garage at 4th Neftyanoy Lane. She gave the applicant's full name, referred to her as a witness of the killings committed on that day and stated that she had talked to her in the hospital in Ingushetia (see Khashiyev and Akayeva v. Russia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 61-62).", "22. In February 2001 Human Rights Watch issued a document entitled \u201cMemorandum on Domestic Prosecutions for Violations of International Human Rights and Humanitarian Law in Chechnya\u201d, in which it reported a lack of progress in the investigation into the attack on the applicant and into other killings committed in the Staropromyslovskiy district at the same time.", "23.

She submitted that, between 2001 and 2004, her father in Kazakhstan, a friend in Ingushetia, her former boyfriend and her sister in the Stavropol region had been contacted by persons asking about her whereabouts. Her former boyfriend had been beaten and told to \u201ckeep away\u201d from her. The applicant, who still suffered from the consequences of her wounds, was afraid of approaching the authorities for fear that her whereabouts might become known to her persecutors. She submitted that in July 2004 she had received medical treatment in Moscow for neurological problems resulting from the attack.", "24. The Government submitted that the applicant had failed to apply to the authorities with a complaint, as a result of which the circumstances of the attack had become known to them only after the communication of the present application. On 26 April 2005 the Chechnya Prosecutor's Office initiated criminal investigation file no. 43037 under Article 111 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code (infliction of serious injuries). The investigation confirmed the attack on the applicant. It also confirmed that the applicant had spent time in hospital in Ingushetia suffering from gunshot wounds. More than 25 witnesses were questioned. However, the investigation could not question the applicant because she did not make her whereabouts known to the authorities. In October 2005 the Government forwarded to the Court a request by the Chechnya Prosecutor's Office seeking assistance in finding the applicant, and a copy of the decision to grant her victim status in the proceedings of criminal investigation no. 43037, to be countersigned by her.", "25. In August 2006 the investigation concerning the attack upon the applicant was joined with another investigation, pending since 2003, concerning the discovery of five bodies with gunshot wounds at 4th Neftyanoy Lane.

In September 2005 the investigation requested the criminal police of Chechnya to assist in finding the applicant and to investigate her complaint about harassment by unknown persons in retribution for her complaint.
