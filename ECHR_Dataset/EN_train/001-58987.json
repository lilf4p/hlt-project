The gendarmes ordered him and the other inhabitants of Yukar\u0131g\u00f6ren to remove the harvested tobacco leaves from their houses and to pile them up in front of the houses. The gendarmes then set fire to the tobacco. On that day the gendarmes apprehended 11 or 12 persons in G\u00fczderesi, including the two sons of H\u00fcsn\u00fc Eraslan and a son of Mehmet Salih Eraslan, and placed them in detention.", "15.

It was concluded that the applicant\u2019s claims were unfounded and that the applicant had not made any application to the security forces.", "51. On 9 August 1995, the \u00c7atakk\u00f6pr\u00fc gendarme station Commander, who had replaced H\u00fcdaverdi Tun\u00e7 in the meantime, took a statement from Mehmet Selim O\u011furlu, a former G\u00fczderesi resident. Mehmet Selim O\u011furlu stated that in September or October 1993, early in the morning, the applicant\u2019s house had been burned by unknown persons. After having woken up, he had gone to the applicant\u2019s house that had still been burning. The applicant had been unable to take any of his belongings from his house and they were totally burned together with the house. The applicant had not received any financial aid from the State for his losses. Insofar as he knew, the applicant was in no way involved with illegal organisations. He and other villagers suspected the terrorists of the arson attack on the applicant\u2019s house.", "52. Also on 9 August 1995 a statement was taken from the applicant at the \u00c7atakk\u00f6pr\u00fc gendarmerie station (see \u00a7 22 above).", "53. On 25 October 1995, after several unsuccessful attempts to locate his new place of duty, a statement was taken by the Han\u00f6n\u00fc public prosecutor from H\u00fcdaverdi Tun\u00e7, the commanding officer of the \u00c7atakk\u00f6pr\u00fc gendarme station at the material time. Mr Tun\u00e7 declared that the gendarmes used to carry out joint operations with the Silvan Station Command and that they had gone to G\u00fczderesi several times. In the autumn of 1993, terrorist incidents had been at their peak and gendarmes continually went on operations. The gendarme forces used to search villages on the basis of gathered intelligence. Such searches were perceived as ambushes by villagers. He did not remember the applicant. He had gone to the applicant\u2019s village several times but could not recall exact dates. He confirmed that the gendarmes had been searching for a person named Faysal Alpan, who was wanted for PKK membership, and that they had searched houses in the village. During searches, gendarmes would also verify the identities of other persons. They had apprehended 12 persons, including the Muhtar\u2019s son, who had been handed over to the prosecution authorities. After the search he and his men had returned to their base. It was not true that the gendarmes had assembled the villagers in the village square, had ill-treated them, had burned their tobacco or damaged their possessions. He denied that he or soldiers under his command had burned the applicant\u2019s village. He did not know whether or not it had been burned and if it had, the PKK must have done it. As stated by the village muhtar Abdulkerim U\u011furlu, he had attended both village searches.", "54. The Silvan public prosecutor took a further statement from the applicant on 6 November 1995. According to this statement, the applicant provided the public prosecutor with information about his financial situation. He further stated that, some days after the burning of his house, a van with seven or eight persons arrived in Yukar\u0131g\u00f6ren who questioned him about the incident. He had thought that they were journalists and informed them of the incident. His application had been written by them and he had signed it. After this, he had gone to the <Human Rights> Association in Diyarbak\u0131r from time to time.", "55. On 15 November 1995, the Silvan public prosecutor, issued a decision of lack of jurisdiction. The decision named the applicant and H\u00fcsn\u00fc Eraslan as the complainants, Mehmet Salih Eraslan and Mehmet Emin Tanr\u0131kulu as injured parties and Abdulkadir Toptemi\u015f and Abdulkerim U\u011furlu as witnesses. The defendants named were \u0130brahim Akt\u00fcrk, Hakan Temel Aksel and H\u00fcdaverdi Tun\u00e7. The offences were described as arson, damage to property, intimidation and ill-treatment committed on 28 September 1993, 13 October 1993 and 23 November 1993.", "The decision noted that the applicant had filed an application with the European Commission of Human Rights via representatives and that the applicant claimed that on 28 September 1993 armed forces had carried out a raid on Yukar\u0131g\u00f6ren and had destroyed the complainants\u2019 household goods. It further stated that the applicant had extended his allegations by adding that his house and tobacco stock had also been burned by the security forces. It was further found established that H\u00fcsn\u00fc Eraslan had also filed a complaint about the destruction of his household goods and burning of his tobacco by the security forces.", "The decision noted that Abdulkadir Toptemi\u015f had confirmed the incident in part, that Mehmet Emin Tanr\u0131kulu claimed that his household goods had also been destroyed by the military and his tobacco burned, and that Mehmet Salih Eraslan had also claimed that his belongings had been destroyed by the military. The then muhtar of G\u00fczderesi, Abdulkerim U\u011furlu, had confirmed the incidents in part but had also stated that the incidents stemmed from the fact that certain illiterate persons in the hamlet had been supporting the PKK.", "Since the alleged offences had been committed in the course of the defendants\u2019 exercise of duties, the public prosecutor decided, pursuant to Article 2 of the Act on Proceedings for the Prosecution of Public Servants, to transfer the case to the Silvan District Administrative Council.", "56. On 4 December 1995, the Silvan public prosecutor took two further statements from Abdulkadir Toptemi\u015f, who maintained his previous statement (see \u00a7 45 above). He stated, inter alia, that after the incident in the village, persons from the Human Rights Association had arrived in a jeep. They had taken pictures and statements from villagers. He had not been in the village at that time. He had heard about it later. The applicant had moved some of his household goods to Batman prior to the military operation in the village. The applicant had become frightened after his brother Mehmet \u015eah Bilgin had been apprehended. The applicant had only kept basic essentials for his daily needs. He did not remember whether the applicant had been in the village or in Batman during the incident.", "57. On 14 November 1996 the commanding officer of the Silvan District gendarme station between 1992 and 1994, \u0130brahim Akt\u00fcrk, gave a statement to the Ad\u0131yaman public prosecutor. He stated that in the period 1992-1994 there had been terrorist incidents in the Silvan region and that various operations had been carried out. He had no clear recollection of an operation carried out in G\u00fczderesi. He doubted the veracity of the applicant\u2019s allegations.", "58. On 23 March 1998, Hakan Temel Aksel, the Commander of a commando unit of the Silvan Gendarmerie at the relevant time, gave a statement to a superior gendarmerie officer. Insofar as he remembered, the inhabitants of G\u00fczderesi supported the PKK. The village fell within the jurisdiction of \u00c7atakk\u00f6pr\u00fc gendarme station. G\u00fczderesi was used by PKK frontliners and held an important position in supplying food, personnel and money to the PKK. The PKK used it as a meeting point, particularly for the robberies that had taken place between Silvan and \u00c7atakk\u00f6pr\u00fc. At the end of 1993 or the beginning of 1994, a female PKK commander in the area between Bismil and Silvan had given herself up to the security forces. On the basis of information provided by her, a number of PKK activists and fighters had been captured by the gendarme forces. Among these PKK supporters were a large number of G\u00fczderesi residents. He denied that the gendarme forces or he himself, as Commander of a commando team, had ill-treated persons or had damaged any property. In his view, the applicant\u2019s complaint had been arranged by PKK activists in order to denigrate the gendarme forces\u2019 work and to take revenge.", "59. In its decision of 4 June 1998, the Diyarbak\u0131r Provincial Administrative Council \u2013 to which the case had been referred by order of the Provincial Governor of 11 March 1997 \u2013 found that there was insufficient evidence in support of the allegations made against the defendants \u0130brahim Akt\u00fcrk, Hakan Temel Aksel and H\u00fcdaverdi Tun\u00e7 about offences allegedly committed on 28 September, 13 October and 23 November 1993 and that, therefore, the case did not warrant the institution of criminal proceedings.", "60. On instructions dated 23 November 1998 issued by the Silvan public prosecutor, an inspection team went to Yukar\u0131g\u00f6ren. This team consisted of a gendarme of the Silvan District Gendarme Command, an official of the District Finance Office, an official of the Municipal Real Property Division, an official of the District Agricultural Office and two inhabitants of the village of Dutveren. Their joint report dated 24 November 1998 states, inter alia, that the surface of the applicant\u2019s collapsed house was 100 square metres, that it was in ruins, that it had not been burned or destroyed by the use of force but that the cause of the collapse was neglect and natural forces, that the applicant\u2019s barn measured 150 square metres and, like the house, had collapsed as a result of neglect and natural forces, and that the applicant\u2019s sheepfold measured 30 square metres and was in the same condition as the barn.", "61. The facts of the case being in dispute between the parties, the Commission conducted an investigation, with the assistance of the parties, and accepted documentary evidence, including written statements and oral evidence taken on 13 and 14 March 1997 by three Delegates of the Commission from seven witnesses: the applicant; H\u00fcsn\u00fc Eraslan; Mahmut Soner; Mehmet Emin Tanr\u0131kulu; H\u00fcdaverdi Tun\u00e7; Mustafa D\u00fczg\u00fcn, public prosecutor at Silvan from 1993-1995; and B\u00fclent Elver, senior public prosecutor at Silvan from 1993-1995.", "A further five witnesses had been summoned but did not appear: the villagers Abdulkadir Toptemi\u015f and Abdulkerim U\u011furlu had died, two other villagers were said to be too scared to give evidence and one villager could not attend for reasons of ill-health.", "62. In his testimony to the Commission\u2019s Delegates, the applicant stated that, although he could not read, he was able to recognise his signature. Although he was unable to give any precise indication of the dates of the alleged events, he maintained that, in the end of the summer of 1993, soldiers had burned his tobacco and household goods and that, about one year later, soldiers had burned his house. He further stated that he had gone to the HRA to complain and that he wished to pursue his application to the Commission. The Commission\u2019s Delegates found the applicant a modest, simple and sincere man, whose world appeared to be mainly confined to his agricultural activities, his wife and children, and the need to provide for them. Despite his stout appearance, he struck the Delegates as a vulnerable man deeply affected by the loss of his house and material possessions, which was all he was concerned about in his life as this had secured his family\u2019s livelihood. Although his testimony was confused and lacked precision as to particular dates, times and number of incidents, the general tenure of his account was found to be sincere, convincing and supported by the evidence given by other villagers both in the domestic investigation and before the Delegates.", "63. The general tenure of the applicant\u2019s account was confirmed by the testimonies of the villager witnesses H\u00fcsn\u00fc Eraslan, Mehmet Emin Tanr\u0131kulu and Mahmut Soner. The Commission\u2019s Delegates found H\u00fcsn\u00fc Eraslan and Mehmet Emin Tanr\u0131kulu to be credible witnesses, but considered that Mahmut Soner\u2019s evidence was to be treated with caution.", "64. H\u00fcdaverdi Tun\u00e7 confirmed that the gendarmes under his command had gone to G\u00fczderesi regularly on village patrol duty, i.e. to carry out routine duties of a military, civil and judicial nature. Such duties would be recorded in the gendarmerie station\u2019s duty ledgers. In gendarme terminology an \u201coperation\u201d might consist of a substantial number of gendarmes, possibly from more than one gendarmerie station, going to a village for a search, the gathering of intelligence and apprehending suspects.", "He recalled that gendarmes had conducted a search in G\u00fczderesi in the autumn of 1993 and that they had apprehended twelve persons there, but denied that on that occasion gendarmes had burned tobacco of villagers or had damaged household goods. He had never heard of allegations of widespread destruction of villages in the region and no such thing had happened during his term of office there. He had heard about the allegations against him in relation with the burning of G\u00fczderesi for the first time on 25 October 1995, when he gave his statement to the public prosecutor.", "The Commission\u2019s Delegates found his evidence on general issues credible, but considered that his evidence on specific events was to be assessed with caution. They were further not convinced by his unconditional denial that gendarmes had ever caused any damage, even when conducting house searches.", "65. The Silvan public prosecutors B\u00fclent Elver and Mustafa D\u00fczg\u00fcn gave evidence in relation to their investigation of the applicant\u2019s allegations, which respective accounts the Commission\u2019s Delegates considered credible. The Delegates were, however, not convinced by their evidence that they had never, or only once, been confronted with allegations that security forces had damaged private property.", "66. In relation to the oral evidence, the Commission was aware of the difficulties attached to assessing evidence obtained orally through interpreters. It therefore paid careful attention to the meaning and significance which should be attributed to the statements made by witnesses appearing before its delegates.", "In a case where there were contradictory and conflicting factual accounts of events, the Commission particularly regretted the absence of a thorough domestic judicial examination. It was aware of its own limitations as a first-instance tribunal of fact. In addition to the problem of language adverted to above, there was also an inevitable lack of detailed and direct familiarity with the conditions pertaining in the region. The Commission\u2019s findings may be summarised as follows.", "67. Between September 1993 and December 1994, gendarme forces regularly patrolled G\u00fczderesi and its hamlets. On 3 and 13 October 1993 and on 8 October 1994, more important gendarme operations took place in G\u00fczderesi and/or Yukar\u0131g\u00f6ren. Although \u2013 apart from the gendarme operation carried out on 13 October 1993 \u2013 the documents submitted in relation to activities by the gendarmes of the \u00c7atakk\u00f6pr\u00fc station did not explicitly mention Yukar\u0131g\u00f6ren, the Commission considered it likely, on the basis of the testimony given by the witnesses, that when an important gendarme operation took place in the main village of G\u00fczderesi involving gendarmes from other stations than \u00c7atakk\u00f6pr\u00fc, such an operation also embraced the Yukar\u0131g\u00f6ren hamlet attached to G\u00fczderesi.", "68. The Commission accepted that the inconsistencies in the evidence submitted as to the date or dates on which the belongings of the applicant and other villagers had allegedly been damaged by security forces could be explained by the regularity of gendarme village patrols and more important operations during the relevant period and by witnesses\u2019 problems in recalling events having taken place a number of years ago. Noting the Delegates\u2019 impressions of the witnesses heard, it did not find that this materially undermined the credibility and reliability of the applicant and the other villager witnesses.", "69. On the basis of the evidence submitted, the Commission found it established that on 13 October 1993 gendarme forces from \u00c7atakk\u00f6pr\u00fc and Silvan had apprehended a number of persons from G\u00fczderesi and Yukar\u0131g\u00f6ren and that, on or around that date, gendarme forces from \u00c7atakk\u00f6pr\u00fc and Silvan had damaged the fittings, furniture and household goods in the applicant\u2019s home, including a refrigerator, television, cassette player, washing machine, kitchenware, stove, household goods, furniture, bedding, curtains, doors and windows. It further accepted that on or around 13 October 1993, and in any event in the fall of 1993, the applicant\u2019s tobacco produce had been burned by gendarmes.", "70. In the light of the evidence before it, the Commission further found no grounds for doubting the veracity of the evidence given that on or around 8 October 1994, and in any event in the autumn of 1994, gendarme forces from \u00c7atakk\u00f6pr\u00fc and Silvan were responsible for the deliberate burning of the applicant\u2019s house, thus forcing him and his family to leave Yukar\u0131g\u00f6ren.", "71. On 15 May 2000, the Government submitted a number of further documents not submitted previously. These included various judgments of Turkish administrative courts in unrelated cases in which compensation was granted to individuals for damage incurred as a result of acts of terrorism. The other judicial decisions submitted were convictions by Turkish criminal courts in unrelated cases of soldiers and police officers for manslaughter, torture and assault. The further submission also contained the daily duty ledger of the \u00c7atakk\u00f6pr\u00fc gendarmerie station for Monday <date and month illegible> 1993; five reports of the \u00c7atakk\u00f6pr\u00fc gendarmerie station and further reports of the Silvan gendarmerie station reporting five incidents having taken place in the area on 26 September 1993, 6 February 1994, 5 and 16 March 1994 and 27 April 1994 respectively; a letter dated 9 August 1994 by the Silvan Magistrate Court to the Silvan public prosecutor concerning the applicant\u2019s whereabouts, and a letter of 7 September 1994 from the Silvan Provincial Gendarmerie to the Silvan public prosecutor stating that the applicant had moved to Batman three months earlier and that his new address could not be established.", "72. In their memorial, the Government also mentioned statements taken by the authorities from Abdulkerim O\u011furlu (8 November 1994), \u0130hsan O\u011furlu (9 August 1995), Mehmet \u015eirin Eraslan (30 November 1995) and the applicant (4 December 1995). These statements have, however, not been submitted to either the Commission or the Court.", "73. The Court refers to the overview of domestic law derived from previous submissions in other cases, in particular the Akdivar and Others v. Turkey judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV, \u00a7\u00a7 28-43, the Mente\u015f and Others v. Turkey judgment of 28 November 1997, Reports 1997-VIII, \u00a7\u00a7 36-51; the Sel\u00e7uk and Asker v. Turkey judgment of 24 April 1998, Reports 1998-II, \u00a7\u00a7 33-45; and the G\u00fcndem v. Turkey judgment of 25 May 1998, Reports 1998-III, \u00a7\u00a7 32-45.", "74. Since approximately 1985, serious disturbances have raged in the south-east of Turkey between the security forces and the members of the PKK (Workers\u2019 Party of Kurdistan). This confrontation has claimed the lives of thousands of civilians and members of the security forces.", "75. Two principal decrees relating to the south-eastern region have been made under the Law on the State of Emergency (Law no. 2935, 25 October 1983). The first, Decree no. 285 (10 July 1987), established a regional governorship of the state of emergency in ten of the eleven provinces of south-eastern Turkey. Under Article 4 (b) and (d) of the decree, all private and public security forces and the Gendarmerie Public Peace Command are at the disposal of the regional governor.", "76. The second, Decree no. 430 (16 December 1990), reinforced the powers of the regional governor, for example to order transfers out of the region of public officials and employees, including judges and prosecutors, and provided in Article 8:", "\u201cNo criminal, financial or legal responsibility may be claimed against the state of emergency regional governor or a provincial governor within a state of emergency region in respect of their decisions or acts connected with the exercise of the powers entrusted to them by this Decree, and no application shall be made to any judicial authority to this end. This is without prejudice to the rights of individuals to claim indemnity from the State for damage suffered by them without justification.\u201d", "77. Article 125 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 7 of the Turkish Constitution provides as follows:", "\u201cAll acts or decisions of the authorities are subject to judicial review...", "The authorities shall be liable to make reparation for all damage caused by their acts or measures.\u201d", "78. This provision is not subject to any restrictions even in a state of emergency or war. The latter requirement of the provision does not necessarily require proof of the existence of any fault on the part of the administration, whose liability is of an absolute, objective nature, based on the theory of \u201csocial risk\u201d. Thus, the administration may indemnify people who have suffered damage from acts committed by unknown or terrorist authors when the State may be said to have failed in its duty to maintain public order and safety, or in its duty to safeguard individual life and property.", "79. Proceedings against the administration may be brought before the administrative courts, whose proceedings are in writing.", "80. The Turkish Criminal Code makes it a criminal offence:", "\u2013 to oblige an individual through force or threats to commit or not to commit an act (Article 188);", "\u2013 to issue threats (Article 191);", "- to make an unlawful search of an individual\u2019s home (Articles 193 and 194)", "\u2013 to subject an individual to torture or ill-treatment (Articles 243 in respect of torture, and Article 245 in respect of ill-treatment, inflicted by civil servants); and", "\u2013 to damage another\u2019s property intentionally (Articles 526 et seq.).", "81. For all these offences complaints may be lodged, pursuant to Articles 151 and 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, with the public prosecutor or the local administrative authorities. A public prosecutor who is informed by any means whatsoever of a situation that gives rise to the suspicion that an offence has been committed is obliged to investigate the facts in order to decide whether or not to bring a prosecution (Article 153). Complaints may be made in writing or orally. A complainant may appeal against the decision of the public prosecutor not to institute criminal proceedings.", "82. If the suspected authors of the contested acts are military personnel, they may also be prosecuted for causing extensive damage, endangering human lives or damaging property, if they have not followed orders in conformity with Articles 86 and 87 of the Military Code. In these circumstances proceedings may be initiated by the (non-military) persons concerned before the competent authority under the Code of Criminal Procedure, or before the suspected persons' hierarchical superior (Articles 93 and 95 of Law 353 on the Constitution and the Procedure of Military Courts).", "83. If, at the relevant time, the alleged author of a crime is a State official or civil servant, permission to prosecute must be obtained from local administrative councils (the Executive Committee of the Provincial Assembly). The local council decisions may be appealed to the Council of State; a refusal to prosecute is subject to an automatic appeal of this kind.", "84. Any illegal act by civil servants, be it a crime or a tort, which causes material or moral damage may be the subject of a claim for compensation before the ordinary civil courts. Pursuant to Article 41 of the Code of Obligations, an injured person may file a claim for compensation against an alleged perpetrator who has caused damage in an unlawful manner whether wilfully, negligently or imprudently. Pecuniary loss may be compensated by the civil courts pursuant to Article 46 of the Code of Obligations and non-pecuniary or moral damages awarded under Article 47. Damage caused by terrorist violence may be compensated out of the Aid and Social Solidarity Fund.", "85. In the case of alleged terrorist offences, the public prosecutor is deprived of jurisdiction in favour of a separate system of State security prosecutors and courts established throughout Turkey.", "86. The public prosecutor is also deprived of jurisdiction with regard to offences allegedly committed by members of the security forces in the state of emergency region. Decree no. 285, Article 4 \u00a7 1, provides that all security forces under the command of the regional governor (see paragraph 50 above) shall be subject, in respect of acts performed in the course of their duties, to the Law of 1914 on the prosecution of civil servants. The Law of 1914 has been replaced by another law in the meantime. Thus, any prosecutor who receives a complaint alleging a criminal act by a member of the security forces must make a decision of non-jurisdiction and transfer the file to the Administrative Council. These councils are made up of civil servants, chaired by the governor. A decision by the Council not to prosecute is subject to an automatic appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court. Once a decision to prosecute has been taken, it is for the public prosecutor to investigate the case."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3", "8", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
