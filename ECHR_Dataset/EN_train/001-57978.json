Following its nationalisation in 1975, Sacor was absorbed into Petrogal-Petr\u00f3leos de Portugal, EP (\"Petrogal\"), a State-owned concern. On 4 April 1989 Petrogal became a public limited company, in which the State is still the majority shareholder. In the meantime, on 1 January 1980, the applicant had retired.", "11. On 5 February 1986 Mr Lobo Machado brought proceedings against Petrogal in the Lisbon industrial tribunal; the company was represented by a lawyer appointed by the chairman of its board of directors. Mr Lobo Machado sought recognition of the occupational grade of \"director-general\" instead of that of \"director\" which had been assigned to him by his employer. As that classification had an effect on the amount of his retirement pension, he also sought payment of the sums that, under the collective labour agreement (acordo colectivo de trabalho), should have been paid him since 1980.", "12. The Lisbon industrial tribunal dismissed his claims in a judgment of 7 October 1987. That decision was upheld by the Lisbon Court of Appeal in a judgment of 1 June 1988.", "13.

The appellant reiterates the arguments already presented to the Court of Appeal and seeks to have that court\u2019s judgment and the one of the court of first instance set aside and to have his action allowed. Those arguments, however, were duly considered in the judgment appealed against, which is sufficient in itself as regards the reasons given for it. No further consideration is therefore necessary.", "3. I am consequently of the opinion that the appeal must be dismissed.\"", "15. On 19 May 1989 the Supreme Court, sitting in private, considered the appeal. Three judges, a registrar and the member of the Attorney-General\u2019s department were present at the deliberations.
