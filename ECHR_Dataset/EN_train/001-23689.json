They relied on Sections 2 \u00a7 1 and 6 \u00a7 2 of this Act and claimed that real property which formed a part of their late parents\u2019 estate and which was in the possession of two individuals should be restored to them.", "On 17 March 1992 the District Court delivered a copy of the action to the defendants.", "On 21 March 1992 the applicants authorised an advocate to represent them in the proceedings.", "On 23 March 1992 the applicants filed a motion to the District Court to secure evidence by hearing two witnesses. They drew the court\u2019s attention to the fact that the two witnesses were aged and in a poor state of health which did not permit them to appear in court. At the same time, they informed the court of the appointment of their lawyer and submitted additional documentary evidence.", "On 27 March 1992 the defendants requested an extension of the timelimit for filing their observations in reply to the action.", "On 4 April 1992 the defendants authorised a lawyer to represent them in the proceedings and, on 8 April 1992, they submitted their observations.", "By a letter of 27 April 1992 the defendants requested that a hearing scheduled for 20 May 1992 be adjourned as their lawyer was unable to attend on that date.", "On 21 May 1992 the applicants\u2019 lawyer requested that a hearing scheduled for 3 June 1992 be adjourned at least until 20 June 1992 due to health problems of one of the applicants.", "In consequence of a certificate issued by a doctor on 8 June 1992, the participation of one of the defendants in the lawsuit was judged inappropriate as it could bring about deterioration in her health.", "On 13 July 1992 the District Court held a hearing. Two applicants and one defendant were not present. Their lawyers however excused their absence and took part in the hearing. The defendants\u2019 lawyer proposed that, having regard to the medical condition of his absent client, it might be appropriate to hear her at her home.", "On 16 July 1992 one of the applicants requested that the District Court hear eleven witnesses. She pointed out that two of the witnesses were aged and were in poor health.", "On 28 July 1992 the District Court held the second hearing.

He further informed them that the progress of case would be under supervision in order to avoid further delays.", "In July and August 1994 the applicants requested that the District Court promptly hear S., another witness. They pointed out that S. was elderly and in a poor state of health which prevented him from appearing in court. On 6 September 1994 a trainee judge (pr\u00e1vna \u010dakate\u013eka) of the District Court heard S. at his home. The witness maintained that he could only take part in a court hearing after the completion of medical treatment that was to commence on 12 September 1994. No party to the proceedings took part in that hearing. On 8 September 1994 the District Court sent a copy of the record of the hearing to the parties.", "On 27 September 1994 the defendants challenged the truthfulness of the testimony of S. and requested that he be reheard in a courtroom.", "At the end of 1994, the case was assigned to another judge (the third judge) in accordance with the general annual reallocation of cases for the judicial year 1995.", "On 23 January 1995 the District Court held the fourth hearing.

However, the hearing could not take place and had to be postponed as, by that time, the postal service had not provided a report showing that the invitations had been served on the parties in time. The hearing took place at the defendant\u2019s home on 30 May 1995.", "On 1 June 1995 one of the applicants requested the District Court not to schedule a hearing before 24 June 1995 as she would be on a business trip until that date.", "The hearing called for 26 June 1995 was adjourned and the District Court ordered the applicants to submit further documentary evidence.

It found, inter alia, that the applicants had failed to prove that their legal predecessors had formally owned the property in question. It further found that it had not been established that the State had taken over the property and that the defendants had acquired the property from the State contrary to the rules then in force which were the prerequisites for granting the claim. The decision was served on the legal representatives of the parties on 28 December 1995.", "On 12 January 1996 the applicants appealed. They argued inter alia that their title to the property was based on hereditary succession and that, in the past, the State has actually prevented them from using the property at issue.", "On 8 February 1996 the defendants filed their comments on the appeal.", "On 12 September 1996, following a hearing, the Bratislava Regional Court upheld the first instance judgment. It found that the evidence available indicated that the property in question had never been formally transferred to the State. The fact that the State had actually disposed of the property had no bearing on this conclusion. The defendants had acquired the property by succession and by donation inter vivos within their family. The Regional Court therefore concluded that the requirements for the restitution of the property were not met.", "On 7 March 1997 the applicants filed an appeal on points of law to the Supreme Court. The latter declared it inadmissible on 26 February 1998 having found no shortcomings in the proceedings which would justify quashing the Regional Court\u2019s judgment."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
