Following the Batman public prosecutor's order, the applicant's detention period was extended.", "8. On 15 April 1997 police officers took statements from the applicant.

Between 5 May 1997 and 18 April 2000, the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court held nineteen hearings and heard a number of witnesses.
