Six other applicants, whose names appear in the annex, are members of the school council of the \u201cVilnius Region Lavori\u0161k\u0117s Secondary School\u201d.", "On 9 February 2007 the Council of Vilnius District Municipality (a territorial public law entity, hereinafter \u201cthe municipality\u201d) allowed a public school that was mostly attended by members of a Polish minority to be named after a famous historical figure and named it \u201cVilnius Region Lavori\u0161k\u0117s Emilii Plater Secondary School\u201d.", "Subsequently the Government\u2019s Representative in the Vilnius Region brought an action against the municipality for the annulment of the decision, maintaining that the Polish spelling of the name as \u201cEmilii Plater\u201d contravened the Law on State Language and grammar rules of Lithuanian language, which is the only official language in the country. For official names the Lithuanian spelling \u201cEmilijos Pliateryt\u0117s\u201d should have been used instead.", "On 22 June 2007 the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court allowed the Government\u2019s Representative\u2019s action. Even if the spelling \u201cEmilii Plater\u201d was preferred by the Polish minorities living in the area, this did not remove the municipality\u2019s obligation to comply with the legal requirements for the official naming of the public school.", "On 15 April 2008, by a final decision, the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the municipality\u2019s appeal. The court concluded that in a case where the name of a historical figure was being used in the official name of a school (organisation/company), the rules of Lithuanian grammar applied.", "Ms Cytacka, who was a staff member of the municipality, participated in the court hearing as a representative of this public institution before the courts.", "As for the remaining six applicants, they have not brought any claims at the domestic level. Besides, no application signed by these applicants in their own name has been lodged with the Court, nor has any authority empowering Ms Cytacka to represent them before the Court been submitted. Their names were notified to the Court in a letter of 28 August 2009.", "Article 22 of the Law on Administrative Proceedings (LAP) provides that persons who consider that their rights or interests protected by law have been infringed have a right to lodge a complaint with the administrative court.", "Under Article 48 of the LAP, parties to the administrative proceedings shall also be the interested third parties, that is, those persons whose rights and obligations may be affected by a court\u2019s decision in the case.", "According to Articles 53 and 82 of the LAP, the parties to the proceedings (including the interested third parties) have a right, inter alia, to submit their observations, to oppose to the observations of the other parties, to submit requests, to present their statements at the hearing without a timelimit as to the length of their speeches."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
