He requested it to be published that the statements about him published on 12 November 2004 and 8 July 2005 were defamatory.

The applicant later amended his claims and requested publication of a correction.", "On 3 July 2006 the court found in part for the applicant. It held that in his speech of 9 November 2004 the applicant had requested that a decision be urgently adopted on the legal status of a nature reserve and tried to warn the members of the Verkhovna Rada about the possible consequences of not doing so. Therefore, the court found that the expressions \u201cAn MP threatens the Crimean Tatars\u201d and \u201cHe threatened that a group of inhabitants of south-east Crimea was going to punish the \u201coffenders\u201d were defamatory.
