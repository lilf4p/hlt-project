At the beginning of 1999 the State passed the State Funds (Contributions) Laws which obliged notaries and some other categories of taxpayers to pay contributions to the State Pension Fund at a rate considerably higher than that applicable to the others. Those thus affected by the laws, including the applicant amongst 2057 notaries, alleged that the rate was discriminatory. They applied to the Constitutional Court to impugn the laws as incompatible with the Constitution. The applicant's complaint was lodged on 17 May 1999. Since all the applications concerned the same subject the court joined them.", "On 23 December 1999 the Constitutional Court held a public oral hearing. The President of the Moscow City Notarial Chamber was present at the hearing. The court declared the relevant provisions of the laws unconstitutional but maintained them in force until a new law was adopted.

In the latter case, pursuant to procedural codes in force at the material time, an application may be made to a court which applied the unconstitutional law or to a court which is hierarchically superior. The respective court may then re-open the proceedings and order a fresh examination of the case on the basis of the findings of the Constitutional Court.
