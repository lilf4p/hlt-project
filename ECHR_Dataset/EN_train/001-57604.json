In his observations, the Commission\u2019s Delegate submitted that just satisfaction should be afforded in the form of payments by the Government to the applicants, on the terms which he mentioned, of the same total amount as that offered by the Government during the negotiations, namely \u00a3145,917 less certain sums already received by the applicants from the Government by way of payments on account in respect of pecuniary losses and from the Commission by way of legal aid.", "For ease of reference, further particulars concerning the applicants\u2019 claims and the Government\u2019s offer are set out below in the section \"As to the law\".", "6.
