SLOVAKIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant, Mr J\u00falius Goga, was a Slovakian national who was born in 1954 and lived in Bratislava. In 2003 the applicant died. By a letter of 5 January 2005 the late applicant\u2019s wife Mrs Jana Gogov\u00e1 and his children Mr J\u00falius Goga and Ms Jana Gogov\u00e1 informed the Court that they wished to pursue the application in his stead. The applicant is represented before the Court by Mrs E. \u013dal\u00edkov\u00e1, a lawyer practising in Bratislava. The respondent Government are represented by Mrs A. Pol\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1, their Agent.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "The applicant\u2019s family owned real estate located in Topo\u013e\u010dany which comprised a house and the land around it.", "In 1975 two contracts were made relating to the transfer of the property to the State. The first of these contracts was concluded on 1 October and the second at some unspecified point in November. The existence and validity of these contracts were later in dispute (see below).", "The State subsequently took over the property and, since then, it has been used by a college of agriculture in Topo\u013e\u010dany. The title to the property was formally vested in a special legal entity (\u0161kolsk\u00fd majetok or, later, \u0161kolsk\u00e9 hospod\u00e1rstvo) which was attached to the college.", "On 18 May 1994 the applicant and two of his relatives, who were all jointly represented by a lawyer, brought a civil action against the above entity which possessed the property and against the Bratislava IV District Education Authority (\u0161kolsk\u00e1 spr\u00e1va) in the Topo\u013e\u010dany District Court (Okresn\u00fd s\u00fad). They originally sought an order for possession of the house, but later extended the action by also seeking a ruling declaring that the defendants were not bona fides possessors of the property.", "On 15 December 1995 the District Court dismissed the action but, on the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, the Bratislava Regional Court (Krajsk\u00fd s\u00fad) quashed the judgment on 17 October 1996.", "On 16 September 1998 the District Court found in favour of the plaintiffs but, on the defendants\u2019 appeal, the Nitra Regional Court overturned the judgment and dismissed the action on 24 November 1999.", "The plaintiffs appealed on points of law to the Supreme Court.", "On 27 February 2001 the Supreme Court quashed the judgment of 24 November 1999 and remitted the case to the Regional Court for reexamination of the defendants\u2019 appeal against the judgment of 16 September 1998.", "On 11 July 2002 the Regional Court examined the defendants\u2019 appeal against the judgment of 16 September 1998 afresh. It again reversed the latter judgment and dismissed the action. The Regional Court examined complex documentary and other evidence, including the pleadings of the parties. It found that the contract of November 1975 had been validly concluded and approved by the competent authorities. It had lawfully conveyed the house in question to the State. As a consequence, under the laws which applied at the time, the title of the applicant\u2019s family to the land underneath the house had been automatically extinguished. The applicant and the other plaintiffs had therefore no legal title to the property and, consequently, no right of action in the case.", "The plaintiffs again appealed on points of law. They contested the Regional Court\u2019s factual conclusion as to the existence of the contract of November 1975. They maintained that the judgment was not properly reasoned, that the facts had not been established adequately and that the court\u2019s legal assessment of the case was flawed.", "On 27 May 2004 the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal. Following the applicant\u2019s death, it dealt in his stead with his surviving wife and children, being his heirs. The Supreme Court found that the facts of the case had been established adequately, the reasons given by the Regional Court were comprehensive and convincing and its conclusion was correct.", "On 12 October 2004 the District Court issued an order for costs against the plaintiffs.", "The wife and children of the applicant, who were represented by a lawyer, challenged the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment by a complaint to the Constitutional Court under Article 127 of the Constitution. They complained that the judgment was onesided, unfair and wrong, contrary to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and Article 46 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.", "On 27 October 2004 the Constitutional Court declared the complaint inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded. It found that the Supreme Court had adequately examined the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments, its findings were not manifestly arbitrary or wrong and its conclusions had been adequately reasoned."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
