She is represented before the Court by Mr T. Koshevaliski and Mr J. Madzunarov, lawyers practising in Stip, in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.", "In or about August 1994 Mr P.S., the applicant\u2019s brother, instituted civil proceedings before the then Strumica Municipal Court (\u041e\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0421\u0443\u0434 \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043c\u0438\u0446\u0430) for termination of a care agreement (\u201cthe agreement\u201d) that he had concluded on 16 October 1975 with Mr G.P. Mr P.S. claimed that Mr G.P. had not provided him with a regular financial assistance, as specified by the agreement. Under the agreement, Mr G.P. was authorised to collect the rent obtained from Mr P.S.\u2019s movable and immovable property, which would then have been transferred in his possession after Mr P.S.\u2019s death.", "On 8 May 1995 the Strumica Municipal Court granted Mr P.S.\u2019s application and terminated the 1975 agreement. After examining considerable evidence, namely several witnesses, the parties to the proceedings and the correspondence between them, the court found that the agreement had not been carried out, as Mr P.S. had sufficient financial means and it had been he who had actually given money to Mr G.P, contrary to what had been agreed.", "On 14 February 1996 the then Stip District Court upheld Mr G.P.\u2019s appeal and quashed the lower court\u2019s decision, as it had not properly established whether the latter had fulfilled his obligations under the agreement.", "On 25 June 1996 the Strumica Municipal Court upheld Mr P.S.\u2019s claim and terminated the agreement. After examining other witnesses and additional correspondence between the parties, the court held that Mr G.P. had not provided Mr P.S. with a regular financial maintenance as agreed.", "On 11 January 1997 the Stip Court of Appeal upheld Mr G.P.\u2019s appeal and remitted the case for a fresh consideration. It held that the trial court had not been established by law, as the case had been tried by a single judge instead of by a panel of judges.", "On an unspecified date in January 1997 Mr P.S. passed away. The latter\u2019s heirs, including the applicant, instituted inheritance proceedings concerning his property. By a court decision of 24 April 1997, they were instructed to institute separate civil proceedings to determine the ownership of the property at stake and to take over Mr P.S.\u2019s case. It appears that this decision was subsequently overturned by the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision of 26 August 1997, by which the inheritance proceedings had been stayed. Mr P.S.\u2019s heirs, including the applicant, took over the case and joined the proceedings complained of.", "On 17 September 1999 the Strumica Court of First Instance upheld Mr P.S.\u2019s claim and terminated the agreement. The court held that the number of contacts between Mr G.P. and Mr P.S. had diminished over time and stopped some years before the latter\u2019s death; that Mr G.P. had not given the monthly financial support to Mr P.S. as agreed and that it was the applicant who had started caring for him instead. It established that the applicant, despite prior misunderstandings with her late brother, had endeavoured to improve their personal relationships. The court also found that Mr P.S., as recognition of the applicant\u2019s efforts, had vowed that after his death all his property should be transferred in her possession.", "On 31 August 2000 the Stip Court of Appeal dismissed Mr G.P.\u2019s appeal and upheld the lower court\u2019s decision. It overturned it in part concerning the trial costs entitling the applicant and the other heirs of Mr P.S. to collect the reduced award.", "On 13 October 2000 Mr G.P. submitted to the Supreme Court an appeal on points of law (\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0458\u0430).", "On 8 March 2001 the applicant states that she was provided with a copy of it.", "On 7 March 2001 Mr G.P. lodged with the Strumica Court of First Instance a request for re-opening of the proceedings (\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043b\u043e\u0433 \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442a\u043f\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430). He claimed that the courts had wrongly accepted the applicant and the others as claimants in the instant proceedings, as there had been no court decision ascertaining them as Mr P.S.\u2019s heirs. He further claimed that the courts had wrongly considered Mr P.S. as a party to the proceedings after his death. He also referred to another care agreement of 1969 concluded between the same parties and to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 17 January 2001, adopted in different set of proceedings, by which he had been allegedly recognised as an owner of the property on the basis of the 1969 agreement.", "On 14 September 2001 the Strumica Court of First Instance dismissed Mr G.P.\u2019s request for re-opening of the proceedings. It found that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 17 January 2001 had been made in administrative contentious proceedings (\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043d \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440) concerning administrative decisions for payment of personal income tax related to Mr P.S.\u2019s property. The Supreme Court had referred in this decision to the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision of 1997 by which the inheritance proceedings concerning Mr P.S.\u2019s property had been stayed, as it had already been transferred into Mr G.P.\u2019s ownership by virtue of the 1969 and 1975 agreements. The court held that the facts, which the Supreme Court had referred to in its decision of January 2001, could not be regarded as a new evidence that had been unknown to Mr G.P. during the proceedings and that consequently, they could not be considered as a proper ground for re-opening of the proceedings. The court used the same reasoning to dismiss the other arguments for re-opening of the proceedings.", "On 10 December 2001 the Stip Court of Appeal upheld Mr G.P.\u2019s appeal and overturned the lower court\u2019s decision. It granted his request for re-opening of the proceedings and quashed the decisions of 17 September 1999 and 31 August 2000, respectively, by which the 1975 agreement had been terminated. It held that the evidence provided by Mr G.P. had been new and that he could not have used it in the previous proceedings.", "On 10 April 2002 the public prosecutor lodged with the Supreme Court a request for the protection of legality (\u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0448\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430) against the appeal court\u2019s decision, as it had been incoherent and had lacked sufficient reasoning as to how the newly discovered evidence could have been beneficial for the party concerned if admitted in the previous proceedings.", "On 26 December 2002 the Supreme Court upheld the public prosecutor\u2019s request and quashed the Appeal Court\u2019s decision of 10 December 2001.", "On 21 February 2003 the Stip Court of Appeal dismissed Mr G.P.\u2019s appeal against the court\u2019s decision of 14 September 2001. It reiterated the lower court\u2019s reasoning to dismiss Mr G.P.\u2019s request for re-opening of the proceedings.", "On 24 March 2004 the Supreme Court rejected (\u043e\u0442\u0444\u0440\u043b\u0430) the appeal on points of law of 13 October 2000 submitted against the Appeal Court\u2019s decision of 31 August 2000. The court considered it as inadmissible as the value of the dispute fell below the statutory threshold. It accordingly rejected Mr G.P.\u2019s appeal on points of law filed against the Appeal Court\u2019s decision of 21 February 2003."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
