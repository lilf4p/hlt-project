The applicants were born in 1957 and 1958 respectively and live in the village of Goyty, the Urus-Martan District, the Chechen Republic.", "6. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "7. The applicants and their two sons, Lecha Betayev, born in 1981, and Ibragim Betayev, born in 1983, lived together in their three-room family house at 52 Kagermanova Street in the village of Goyty.", "8. On the night of 25 to 26 April 2003 the applicants and both their sons were at home. The applicants were sleeping in one room and their sons in separate rooms.", "9. At about 1.30 a.m. a group of around twenty armed men in camouflage uniforms arrived at the Betayevs\u2019 house. Some of them stayed outside, while others forcibly entered the house. All but three of them were wearing balaclava masks. They did not identify themselves and offered no explanation for their visit. Their commander had no mask on, and the applicants observed that he had fair hair, blue eyes, a straight nose and Slavic features. The applicants inferred that the armed men were federal military or security servicemen because they spoke Russian without an accent and their uniform was similar to that of the federal armed forces.", "10. The servicemen went to all rooms at once and three of them entered the room where the applicants were sleeping. They turned on the light and shouted at the applicants while pointing their machine guns at them. The first applicant tried to get up, but one serviceman hit him on the shoulder with the butt of his machine gun to push him down. Then he grabbed the first applicant by the collar of the shirt, pulled him down and ordered him to lie face down on the floor. The first applicant obeyed. The second applicant was told to face the wall and stand still without turning her head.", "11. The applicants could hear from the next room that Ibragim Betayev was asked his full name and replied. The first applicant could also see that Lecha Betayev was woken up, ordered to get out of bed and then taken outside by two servicemen. The applicants and their sons were not requested to show their identity papers.", "12. One of the servicemen, who appeared to be in charge of the others, told the first applicant that one of his fellow Chechen villagers had reported that the first applicant had had a machine gun and a radio station at home. The first applicant replied that he had not had any weapon. The servicemen started searching the house; the applicants were not presented with a search warrant and no witnesses were asked to observe the scene.", "13. During the search the first applicant was permitted to sit on the bed, but was ordered not to turn his head and not to follow the search.", "14. The servicemen searched the house, including the attic, the courtyard and the sheds outside, turning everything upside down. They were going to take up the floor of the house, but the first applicant asked them not to do so because, given the poor condition of the house, it might have been problematic, and the commander decided not to. The search took about one hour; after that the applicants heard the noise of an armoured personnel carrier (\u201cAPC\u201d) revving up outside. Two or three minutes later the man who was in charge of the other servicemen told them that they were leaving. He ordered the applicants to remain in the house, threatening to shoot if they went outside before the servicemen had left.", "15. Only then did the applicants discover that Lecha and Ibragim Betayev had been taken away.", "16. The second applicant went into the courtyard and saw five military vehicles. When the vehicles started driving off the APC went first, followed by two UAZ vehicles and then two Ural vehicles. The applicants could hear that the vehicles were moving in the direction of the village centre of Goyty and then towards Grozny without stopping or slowing down at the military checkpoint on the bridge across Argun channel, although they could not avoid it driving in that direction.", "17. Having looked around, the applicants discovered that the servicemen had taken away some of their belongings, such as mechanical tools, an electric battery charger and some other domestic hardware. According to the written statements by Ms M. and Ms D., villagers of Goyty, in the morning of 26 April 2003, the applicants\u2019 house was in chaos after the search and the marks of military boots could be seen everywhere.", "18. The applicants waited until the dawn and then inspected the traces of the military vehicles. They found that all the vehicles, apart from the APC, had been parked some thirty or fifty metres away from their house, while the APC must have been parked right in the river bed of Goytinka, which flows about twenty metres from the applicants\u2019 house. They could see the traces clearly because it had drizzled that night. According to the written statement by Ms M., she saw the APC traces at the same spot as well. She also discovered that her fence had been broken through on that same night, so as to allow access into the courtyard of the Betayevs\u2019 house.", "19. The Government submitted that, according to the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, on 26 April 2003 the first applicant had reported to the Urus-Martan District Department of the Interior (\u201cROVD\u201d) that at about 2.30 a.m. unidentified persons armed with machine guns had broken into his house and taken away his sons, Lecha and Ibragim Betayev.", "20. On 26 April 2003 the applicants started searching for Lecha and Ibragim Betayev. Both in person and in writing, they applied to various official bodies trying to find out the whereabouts and the fate of their sons. It was the first applicant who made all the written submissions to various authorities on behalf of both applicants because the second applicant was illiterate. The applicants retained copies of some of the letters to the authorities and their answers, which they submitted to the Court.", "21. The applicants also kept up a constant search for traces of their sons through informal channels, by contacting officials and other people. They took part in the identification of numerous dead bodies found in all parts of Chechnya, but in vain.", "22. Their attempts to find out the whereabouts of Lecha and Ibragim Betayev and the criminal proceedings can be summarised as follows.", "23. In the morning of 26 April 2003 the first applicant went to the local police station in Goyty and asked Mr Kh., the officer on duty, about the abduction of his sons. Mr Kh. told the applicant that at about 1.30 a.m. on 26 April 2003 he had seen two UAZ vehicles and an APC with men wearing camouflage uniforms sitting on it. The vehicles had been heading towards the applicants\u2019 house. Mr Kh. and his colleague had unsuccessfully tried to stop them. Mr Kh. had informed the ROVD of this, but received an order from the latter not to intervene. The applicants provided Mr Kh.\u2019s detailed written testimony of those events.", "24. After going to the police station in Goyty, the first applicant went to the district centre, the town of Urus-Martan. There he visited the prosecutor\u2019s office of the Urus-Martan District (\u201cthe district prosecutor\u2019s office\u201d), the ROVD and the local administration. With all of them he lodged complaints concerning the abduction of his sons, in which he also mentioned that the perpetrators had broken his furniture and wrecked the floors and the ceiling. An investigator from the district prosecutor\u2019s office interviewed him and the first applicant related in detail the circumstances of his sons\u2019 abduction.", "25. On the following days the applicants regularly went to Urus-Martan to visit all district authorities and find out whether there had been any news of their sons. However, no authority acknowledged any involvement in the abduction of Lecha and Ibragim Betayev and all of them denied knowledge of their whereabouts.", "26.

On 21 July 2003 the latter wrote to the Prosecutor General of Russia describing the circumstances of the search of the applicants\u2019 house and of Lecha and Ibragim Betayev\u2019s abduction and asking for information about the measures taken to investigate the unlawful arrest of the Betayev brothers.", "31.
