LATVIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of P1-1;No violation of Art. 14+P1-1", "JUDGES": "Alvina Gyulumyan;Corneliu B\u00eersan;Egbert Myjer;Ineta Ziemele;Josep Casadevall;Lech Garlicki;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra", "TEXT": ["6. By contracts signed in 1994, in respect of donations inter vivos, the applicants became the owners of a number of plots of land on the island of Kundzi\u0146sala. This island, situated close to the mouth of the Daugava River, is part of the city of Riga, to which it is connected by a road-bridge and a railway line. It mainly consists of port facilities, with a small residential area in its southern part.", "7. The donors were the heirs of the legitimate owners of the land in question, which had been unlawfully expropriated by the Soviet Union after 1940. They had recovered ownership in the context of the \u201cdenationalisation\u201d process in the early 1990s. According to the applicants\u2019 explanations, not contested by the Government, all the donations had been made in return for certain personal services that the applicants had rendered to the donors. Thus, the second applicant became the owner of four plots of land measuring 18,620, 11,000, 10,970 and 7,150 sq.m respectively. The donor of the first plot of land gave it to him by way of remuneration for having helped her to complete the formalities to obtain restitution of her nineteen properties located throughout Latvia. The donor of the second plot had apparently been a longstanding friend of the second applicant, whilst the other two plots were given to him as a token of gratitude because he had covered the cost of expensive heart surgery for the donor. As to the first applicant, he obtained a plot of land measuring 17,998 sq.m. in return for undisclosed services rendered.", "8. Each of the above-mentioned contracts stipulated the value of the land in question. The parties agree that the said value was not the cadastral value (that is to say the reference value for the calculation of land tax), but merely an indicative sum solely for the purposes of calculating the registration tax, which at the time represented 10% of the property\u2019s value. The contracting parties thus valued each plot of land at 500 Latvian lati (LVL; about 705 euros (EUR)), except for that of 10,970 sq.m., which was valued at LVL 1,000 (about EUR 1,410). In addition, the applicants paid LVL 0.25 in notary\u2019s tax. However, they were not obliged to pay income tax, as gifts between individuals were not liable for such tax.", "9. Shortly afterwards, in 1994, the Land Registry Division of the city of Riga (R\u012bgas pils\u0113tas Zemesgr\u0101matu noda\u013ca) entered the applicants in the land register as owners of the plots of land in question. In addition, in accordance with the law applicable at the time (see paragraph 49 below), they were exempted from the payment of land tax (zemes nodoklis) for a period of six months following the acquisition, that is to say until the end of 1994.", "10. On 15 August 1995 the Council of Ministers adopted Regulation no. 278 fixing the perimeter of the Port of Riga (Noteikumi par R\u012bgas ostas robe\u017eu noteik\u0161anu). In accordance with that Regulation, all the plots of land owned by the applicants were included within the port\u2019s perimeter. That inclusion was confirmed by the Free Commercial Port of Riga Act (R\u012bgas tirdzniec\u012bbas br\u012bvostas likums), enacted on 6 November 1996. Under that Act, all the privately-owned land situated within the port\u2019s boundaries became subject to a servitude for the benefit of the public corporation responsible for the port\u2019s management. In return, the corporation was to pay the owners an annual compensation of not more than 5% of the cadastral value of the plots of land.", "11. In January 1996 the applicants requested the Real Estate Valuation Centre of the State Land Authority (Valsts Zemes dienesta Nekustam\u0101 \u012bpa\u0161uma v\u0113rt\u0113\u0161anas centrs) to determine the current cadastral value of their respective plots of land. In five letters of 15 January 1996, the Centre certified that the value amounted to LVL 564,410 (about EUR 900,000) for Mr Visti\u0146\u0161; as for Mr Perepjolkins, the cadastral value of his plots of land amounted to LVL 285,830, 767,724, 769,824 and 1,303,102 respectively, representing a total of LVL 3,126,480 (about EUR 5,010,000).", "12. On 11 June 1997 the administration of the Free Commercial Port of Riga applied, in turn, to the Valuation Centre, requesting it to calculate the amount of compensation that would have to be paid to the applicants in the event of expropriation of their land, in accordance with Article 2 of the Supreme Council\u2019s decision on the arrangements for the entry into force of the law on the expropriation of real estate in the public interest (the \u201cGeneral Expropriation Act\u201d, enacted in 1923). That Article \u2013 which was applicable inter alia to the applicants \u2013 limited the amount of the compensation to be paid to the owners of certain land that was to be expropriated; the compensation would not exceed the cadastral value of the land as fixed on 22 July 1940, multiplied by a conversion coefficient.", "13. On 12 June 1997 the Centre issued two certificates stating that the first applicant would receive LVL 548.26 (about EUR 850) for his 17,998 sq.m. of land, and the second LVL 8,616.87 (about EUR 13,500) for his land, of which the total surface area came to 47,740 sq.m.", "14. By Regulation no. 273 of 5 August 1997, which was adopted in the context of delegated legislative authority (see paragraph 31 below) and which entered into force on 9 September 1997, the Council of Ministers ordered the expropriation of all the land in question for the benefit of the State. On 30 October 1997 that measure was confirmed by Parliament, which enacted a special law for that purpose (see paragraph 42 below). Under that law Mr Visti\u0146\u0161 and Mr Perepjolkins were to be paid compensation for the expropriation, which would be deemed completed once the sums had been paid into their current accounts.", "15. On 8 May 1998 the Latvian Land and Mortgage Bank (Latvijas Hipot\u0113ku un zemes banka) opened current accounts in the names of each of the applicants. On 14 October 1998 that bank officially certified that the above-mentioned sums of LVL 548.26 and LVL 8,616.87, awarded to the applicants by way of compensation, had actually been paid into the two accounts. The applicants, however, refused to make use of those sums in any way. Following the payment, by two orders of 17 and 20 November 1998 the Riga Land Registry Court (zemesgr\u0101matu tiesnesis) ordered that the title to the expropriated land be registered in the name of the State. No tax was levied on the above-mentioned sums.", "16. In 1998 the second applicant brought two sets of proceedings to obtain rent arrears for the use of his land. In the first proceedings, against the Riga Port Authority and the Free Commercial Port of Riga, he requested the payment of sums due under the lease for the period from 21 April 1994 to 31 March 1996. In a judgment of 15 October 1998, upheld in cassation proceedings on 6 January 1999, the Regional Court of Riga ordered the Free Port to pay the second applicant LVL 278,175 (about EUR 448,150) for the use of his land during the period in question.", "17. The second applicant subsequently filed a new claim against the Free Port seeking the payment of rent arrears for the period after 1 April 1996, together with compensation for a servitude imposed on his property. On 18 March 1999 the Civil Division of the Supreme Court partly upheld his claim, awarding the applicant the sum of LVL 90,146.84 (about EUR 145,000 ) on that basis, as the rent represented 2% of the current cadastral value of the land. In fixing that amount the Civil Division particularly took into account the fact that the second applicant had not invested in any development of the land in question. It further indicated that the applicant\u2019s title to the property had ceased on 9 September 1997, when the expropriation had become effective. In a judgment of 12 May 1999 the Senate of the Supreme Court upheld the judgment of the Civil Division.", "18. The first applicant, Mr Visti\u0146\u0161, brought similar proceedings. In a judgment of 9 June 1999 the Civil Division ordered the Free Port to pay him LVL 53,036 (about EUR 85,000) in rent arrears for the period from 1994 to 1997.", "19. In January 1999 the applicants sued the Transport Ministry (Satiksmes ministrija) before the Regional Court of Riga. In their pleadings they requested the annulment of the cadastral registration of the State\u2019s title, and the restoration, in the land registers, of the previous entries attesting to their ownership of the land in question.", "20. In support of that claim, the applicants alleged that the General Expropriation Act provided for a uniform procedure: after the enactment of the special law of 30 October 1997, the Transport Ministry was required first to start negotiations with them with a view to reaching a friendly settlement as to the amount of the compensation (section 5 of the General Expropriation Act); if those negotiations failed, the Ministry would have to refer the matter to the court of competent jurisdiction for settlement of the dispute (section 9). That procedure had not been followed in the present case. The applicants particularly emphasised the fact that they were not satisfied about the sums paid by way of compensation and that they were deprived of their right to challenge those sums before a court. In this connection, the applicants pointed out that the orders of the Land Registry Court had been made in the absence of any prior final judgment concerning the amount of the compensation; they thus argued that the orders did not comply with section 18 of the General Expropriation Act. The applicants submitted that the expropriation in general and the transfer of title in particular had been carried out in breach of that Act, thus directly entailing a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.", "21. In a judgment of 29 March 2000 the Regional Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 claims. According to the judgment, the expropriation was not based on the General Expropriation Act, as the applicants had claimed: since the measure in question had been decreed in the context of the Latvian land reform, the special law of 30 October 1997 was to be applied. Section 4 of that special law provided for two elements \u2013 the law itself and the payment of the compensation \u2013 which, taken together, formed a statutory basis for the transfer of title to the State. As the corresponding sums had been paid into the applicants\u2019 accounts, both of those elements were present, and by registering the State as the new owner of the land in question, the Land Registry Court had acted in accordance with the law.", "22. Moreover, the Regional Court pointed out that section 3(1) of the Law of 30 October 1997 on the calculation of compensation referred to Article 2 of the Supreme Council\u2019s decision on the arrangements for the entry into force of the General Expropriation Act; that decision had been declared compliant with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 by the Constitutional Court.", "23. The applicants appealed before the Civil Division of the Supreme Court. In their appeal, they emphasised at the outset that they did not object to the expropriation as such, provided that the statutory formalities were observed and the amount of the compensation was reasonable. This had not been the case, however; in particular, no expert\u2019s report had been ordered for the purpose of determining the actual value of the disputed land (section 16 of the General Expropriation Act). The applicants did not challenge the Regional Court\u2019s finding that the Law of 30 October 1997 constituted a lex specialis in relation to the general law; they argued, however, that the said law could not be interpreted as derogating from the normal expropriation procedure. Consequently, by recognising the State\u2019s title without having received a copy of a judgment determining the amount of the compensation, the Land Registry Court had acted illegally.", "24. In a judgment of 28 September 2000 the Civil Division dismissed the appeal, essentially endorsing the reasoning and findings of the judgment appealed against. Since the applicants had criticised the compensation awarded, it pointed out that the sums had been determined in accordance with Article 2 of the above-mentioned Supreme Council decision. If the applicants had considered that the calculation by the State\u2019s Land Authority had been erroneous and that the relevant coefficients had been incorrectly applied, they could have challenged the calculation in separate proceedings, but had not done so.", "25. The applicants lodged a cassation appeal before the Senate of the Supreme Court. In their appeal, they submitted that the direct and immediate object of their claim was not to challenge the calculation of the compensation as such, but rather the fact that they had not been able to have the sum fixed through fair judicial proceedings, as required by the General Expropriation Act. If such proceedings had taken place, they would have been able to provide the court with evidence of their investments in respect of the land in question. Moreover, the applicants pointed out that they were not entitled to initiate such proceedings themselves, as section 9 of that Act reserved that right for the authorities.", "26. In a judgment of 20 December 2000 the Senate dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal on the same grounds as the Civil Division.", "27. In the meantime, on 17 August 2000, the State had granted the use of all the plots of land in question to a private transport company, B., from which it has been receiving rent to date.", "28. On 9 December 1999 the Finance Department of the Municipal Council of Riga notified the first applicant of a tax re-assessment, requesting him to pay the sum of LVL 18,891 in land tax in respect of the land in question, plus penalties, for the period from 1 January 1997 to 30 October 1997, the date of the expropriation. The first applicant challenged this before the Court of First Instance for the district of Zieme\u013cu, which upheld his claim and annulled the re-assessment. The Municipal Council appealed before the Regional Court of Riga, which, in a judgment of 10 January 2003, upheld the annulment of the re-assessment. According to that judgment, the land tax was attached to a plot of land and not to a specific individual; therefore, it could be paid by someone other than the owner. In that case, to the extent that it was the first applicant\u2019s land, the tax had already been paid by the public corporation that was responsible for the port\u2019s management and was using the land on the basis of a servitude. The Municipal Council lodged a cassation appeal with the Senate of the Supreme Court, which dismissed it in a judgment of 19 March 2003.", "29. As to the second applicant, on 22 January 1999 the Finance Department of the Municipal Council of Riga notified him of a tax re-assessment for LVL 78,382, penalties included, for the year 1997. The applicant brought annulment proceedings before the court of competent jurisdiction, which upheld his claim. The Municipal Council appealed and on 26 February 2002 the Regional Court of Riga annulled the judgment of the Court of First Instance, finding that the second applicant\u2019s land was not part of that for which the public corporation had paid land tax. That judgment was upheld at cassation level. However, in September 2003 the Senate of the Supreme Court re-opened the proceedings on account of newly discovered facts. The case file was sent to the Administrative Court of Appeal, which, in a judgment of 15 July 2005, upheld the second applicant\u2019s claim and annulled the disputed re-assessment on the ground that the port management company had already paid land tax for the land in question. On 7 February 2006 the Senate of the Supreme Court, ruling on a cassation appeal, upheld that judgment. The second applicant was therefore not obliged to pay any supplementary tax on his land.", "30. Article 105 of the Latvian Constitution (Satversme) provides as follows:", "\u201cEveryone has a right of property. Property may not be used for purposes contrary to the interests of society. Property rights may be restricted only as provided by law. Forced deprivation of property for the need of society shall be authorised only in exceptional cases, on the basis of a special law and in return for fair compensation.\u201d", "31. Article 81 of the Constitution (repealed in 2007) entrusted the Council of Ministers with delegated and limited legislative power. At the time of the expropriation of the land in question, this provision read as follows:", "\u201cBetween two legislative sessions, the Council of Ministers shall be entitled, in cases of pressing need, to adopt regulations with statutory force. Such regulations may not amend either the law on parliamentary elections, the laws on judicial organisation and procedure, the Budget Act or budgetary law, or laws enacted by the sitting legislature; nor may they regulate amnesty, the issuance of Treasury bills, taxes levied by the State, Customs, railway fares and loans, and they lapse if they are not submitted to Parliament no later than three days after the opening of the following legislative session.\u201d", "32. The first paragraph of section 12 of the Law of 20 November 1991 on land reform in the cities of the Republic of Latvia (Likums \u201cPar zemes reformu Latvijas Republikas pils\u0113t\u0101s\u201d) originally read as follows:", "\u201cIn all ... cases, where the original owner\u2019s land has [in the meantime] been built upon, or where, in accordance with urban planning and construction projects it is intended to erect thereon constructions necessary to satisfy the needs of society, the former owners of the land or their heirs shall be entitled, as they choose:", "to claim restitution of their property title and to obtain from the owner of the building or construction ... the payment of rent, of which the maximum amount shall be fixed by the Council of Ministers ...; or", "to request that they be granted the right of ownership or use of another plot of land of the same value, situated within the administrative boundaries of the same town, depending on the type of use projected for the said land; or", "to receive compensation in accordance with the statutory conditions.\u201d", "33. A law of 31 March 1994 imposed restrictions on the restitution of land on which certain constructions or facilities have been erected. It thus amended the above-mentioned wording as follows:", "\u201cFormer property owners or their heirs shall recover their title to land that previously belonged to them, except:", "...", "(3) Where, on the land of the former owners, there can be found ... facilities or infrastructures of civil engineering and transport ..., [for example] of ports.

A law of 24 November 1994 amended that provision as follows:", "\u201cFormer property owners or their heirs shall recover their title to land that previously belonged to them, except:", "...", "(3) Where, on the land of the former owners, there can be found ... facilities or infrastructures of civil engineering and transport ..., [for example] of ports. The title to the land is then registered in the name of the State or the local authority concerned, after the former owners or their heirs have, as they choose, and in accordance with the statutory conditions, received land of the same value situated elsewhere ... or [monetary] compensation. If it is impossible to reach an agreement with the former owner of the land, or his or her heir, as to the compensation or to the allocation of another plot of land of the same value, the land shall then be expropriated in accordance with the conditions laid down in the law on the expropriation of real estate on public interest grounds.\u201d", "35. The law of 12 October 1995 reformulated the above-mentioned provision, deleting the last sentence concerning the expropriation of land. The next law, which was enacted on 8 May 1997 and which entered into force on 6 June 1997, added to the said paragraph a note that read as follows (having the same statutory force as the provision itself):", "\u201cNote: Where the former owners of the land or their heirs possess dwellings on the territory of a port, they are entitled to recovery title to that land to the extent that they have the lawful use thereof; [the surface area of such land] must not, however, exceed 1,200 square metres, except for the residential area of Kundzi\u0146sala Island which forms part of the territory of the Free Commercial Port of Riga and where the former owners and their heirs are granted restitution of their title in respect of the entire surface area of the land that belonged to them in the past.\u201d", "36. At the same time a new paragraph was inserted into section 12. It reads as follows:", "\u201cWhere the former owners of the land or their heirs have recovered title to land on which are erected any facilities referred to in point 3 of the first paragraph of the [present] section ..., the annual amount of the rent for the land shall not exceed five per cent of the land\u2019s cadastral value\u201d.", "37. Section 19(5) of the Ports Act of 22 June 1994 (Likums par ost\u0101m) reads as follows:", "\u201cRestrictions on the restitution of property title, as established by section 12 of the law on land reform in the cities of the Republic of Latvia, shall not apply to land incorporated within the territory of the Port de Riga after 20 April 1994 ...

The use of the term \u201ca special law\u201d in Article 105 of the Constitution and in section 1 of the 1923 Act indicates that each individual expropriation measure falls within the exclusive remit of the legislature, that is to say Parliament. As the Constitutional Court observed in its judgment of 16 December 2005, this is a specific feature of the Latvian legal system in comparison with that of other countries (see paragraph 48 below). In other words, there are always two legislative instruments: the general law, determining the rules of expropriation in general, and a special targeted law by which Parliament orders the expropriation of designated property in a specific case. As to the sum to be paid in compensation, it is fixed by friendly agreement or, failing that, by the courts (section 9 of the General Expropriation Act of 1923).", "41.
