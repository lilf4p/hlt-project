Since the end of March 2004, a series of protests have been organised by the opposition forces in Armenia, calling for a \u2018referendum of confidence\u2019 in President Kocharian. The possibility of such a referendum was first mentioned by the Armenian Constitutional Court following the presidential elections in February and March 2003. The Constitutional Court later clarified its proposal and the authorities are calling the opposition demands and protests an attempt to seize power by force.", "2. The demonstrations, although announced, were not authorised by the authorities, who have threatened the organisers with criminal prosecution. Following the demonstrations on 5 April, the General Prosecutor opened criminal investigations against several members of the opposition and arrested many more, in connection with the opposition parties\u2019 rally. On the same occasion, several journalists and politicians were beaten up by unknown persons while the police stood by and took no action.", "3. New demonstrations took place on 9, 10 and 12 April in Yerevan. In the early morning of 13 April, the security forces violently dispersed some 2,000 to 3,000 protesters who were attempting to march towards the presidential palace, calling for President Kocharian\u2019s resignation. The police reportedly used truncheons, water cannons and tear gas, causing dozens of injuries. A number of protesters were arrested, including members of parliament, some of whom are members of the Assembly, and some were allegedly mistreated by the police while in custody. The security forces also assaulted and arrested several journalists who were covering the opposition rally.", "4. Tensions in Armenia continue to run high; new protests are planned for the week of 26 April. For the time-being there seems to be little room for dialogue between the authorities and the opposition, even if some offers have been made and some members of the ruling majority \u2013 for example, the Speaker of the Armenian Parliament \u2013 have begun criticising the heavy-handed crackdown on demonstrations.", "5.

The relevant extracts from the explanatory memorandum provide:", "\u201cSince the end of March, opposition forces in Armenia decided to jointly organise mass protests to force a \u2018referendum of confidence\u2019 in President Kocharian. The possibility of such a referendum was first mentioned by the Armenian Constitutional Court following the presidential elections in February and March last year, which were strongly criticised by the international community. ...", "The Armenian authorities reacted to the opposition call for protests with a campaign of political intimidation and administrative and judicial harassment. Once the protests started, the reaction was even more ruthless. Demonstrations were violently dispersed, journalists were beaten up, a large number of opposition supporters were arrested and premises of the opposition parties were raided by the police.", "...", "In January 2004 the Assembly adopted its second monitoring report since the accession of Armenia to the Council of Europe in January 2001. Resolution 1361, adopted on this occasion, takes note of some encouraging developments that took place in the last two years...", "However, the Resolution ... sharply criticised the [presidential and parliamentary] elections carried out in 2003. Moreover, it listed a number of serious concerns with regard to the democratic and human rights conduct of the Armenian authorities and expressed its expectations that these issues will be speedily dealt with in accordance with Council of Europe standards and principles.", "Regrettably, the reaction of the Armenian authorities in the events of March and April [2004] demonstrate that the Assembly\u2019s request for further progress was ignored and that, with regard to some of the Assembly\u2019s key concerns, the situation has even worsened.", "Administrative detention", "With regard to the scandalous and continued use of administrative detention, Resolution 1361 urged the authorities to amend the Administrative Code to put an end to this practice which is incompatible with the organisation\u2019s standards. The Assembly also asked the authorities to submit this new draft to Council of Europe expertise by April 2004.", "Instead of immediately ending this practice and preparing the necessary legislative drafts to this effect, the Armenian authorities resorted to a wide use of administrative detentions during the recent events. While it is difficult to verify the exact number of persons who were arrested and the legal basis used for their detention, most reports indicate that their number was between two and three hundred.", "The Assembly repeats its demand for an immediate end to the practice of administrative detention. The Administrative Code must be revised without any further delay. ...\u201d", "66.

In response, the Armenian government embarked on a campaign to break the popular support for the political opposition with mass arrests, violent dispersal of demonstrations, raids on political party headquarters, repression of journalists, and restrictions on travel to prevent people from participating in demonstrations. Hundreds of people were detained, many for up to fifteen days; some were tortured or ill-treated in custody...", "The origin of the opposition\u2019s demands was the government\u2019s failure to date to redress the deeply flawed 2003 presidential election, which Kocharian, the incumbent, won. Disturbingly, the government is now repeating, with increasing violence, a pattern of repression that surrounded last year\u2019s election. At that time, the international community warned the Armenian government that its intimidation of the opposition through the use of arrests and administrative detentions must stop. However, in March and April 2004, the Armenian government not only began a fresh campaign of detentions, but added to the intimidation with security force violence. ...", "At the end of March 2004, two of the main opposition groups, the Artarutiun (Justice) Alliance, which consists of nine parties \u2013 including the Republic Party, the People\u2019s Party, and the National Unity Party \u2013 joined forces and announced its campaign of action. Following this move, the opposition intensified its efforts, making further announcements and mobilising in Armenia\u2019s provinces.
