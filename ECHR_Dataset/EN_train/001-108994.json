BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-1 - Lawful arrest or detention);No violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-1 - Lawful arrest or detention)", "JUDGES": "Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Neboj\u0161a Vu\u010dini\u0107;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Vincent A. De Gaetano;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["6. It would appear from the case file that the salient fact in the domestic proceedings was the applicant\u2019s association with the mujahedin in Bosnia and Herzegovina (\u201cBH\u201d). The term mujahedin has been widely used to refer to foreigners \u2013 mainly from the Arab world \u2013 who came to BH during the war in support of Bosnian Muslims. However, the same term has been used to describe local Muslims who joined the foreign mujahedin, endorsed their ideology and adjusted to their way of dressing. The phenomenon has been explained by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (\u201cICTY\u201d) in Had\u017eihasanovi\u0107 and Kubura, IT-01-47-T, \u00a7\u00a7 41118, 15 March 2006, and Deli\u0107, IT-04-83-T, \u00a7\u00a7 166-199, 15 September 2008, as follows.", "7. The first foreign mujahedin arrived in BH in the summer of 1992 via Croatia and with the assistance of the Croatian authorities. It would appear that their arrival was welcomed by the BH authorities. While the presence of at least some foreign mujahedin seems to have been motivated by a desire to provide humanitarian assistance to the Bosnian Muslim population, most of them actively supported the military struggle against the Bosnian Muslims\u2019 adversaries, ready to conduct a jihad or \u201choly war\u201d. As stated by Ali Hamad, an ICTY witness of Bahraini origin who came to BH in 1992, some of the mujahedin were members of al-Qaeda who had the aim of \u201ccreating a base that would allow them to increase their area of operations\u201d. Some of them also came to perform missionary work.", "8. Upon arrival, foreign mujahedin settled in various locations and did not form a homogeneous entity. Towards the end of 1992, Bosnian Muslims started to join the foreign mujahedin. The locals were provided with military training and participated in combat action. They were also given religious instruction. A number of groups comprising foreign and/or local mujahedin were active. Notwithstanding instances of participation in combat alongside each other, it appears that these groups were anxious to maintain their distinct identities. There were religious and ideological differences between them, which resulted in occasional violent clashes.", "9. On 13 August 1993 the foreign mujahedin were organised into a unit within the local ARBH (Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina) forces. The unit, named \u201cEl Mujahedin\u201d, was based in Zenica. Following its establishment, the unit significantly grew in size. By 1995, it consisted of around 1,000 fighters. Although the original idea had been to replenish the unit with foreign mujahedin only, locals soon outnumbered its foreign members. The factors that motivated locals to join it included: its stricter regimental discipline; a better degree of organisation; superior equipment and combat morale; its religious dedication; and material benefits. The unit received funds and assistance from many organisations and individuals from the Islamic world, including the Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation and the Benevolence International Foundation. The Islamic Cultural Institute in Milan provided logistical support.", "10. El Mujahedin had a number of features setting it apart from regular ARBH units. It was led by foreign mujahedin who were not appointed by the ARBH. At the top of the hierarchy was an emir, who has been described as the highest-ranking person within the unit. Abu Haris, a Libyan, was its first emir. In December 1993, he was succeeded by an Algerian, Abu Maali, who remained in that position until the end of the war. A different person from the emir, the military commander, headed the military council and was responsible for the conduct of combat operations. In 1993, this post was held by an Egyptian named Vahidin or Wahiuddin. After his death in October 1993, another Egyptian, Muatez, succeeded him. Muatez was killed in September 1995. The unit had a religious council, the shura, which was its supreme decision-making body. It consisted of approximately twenty prominent members of the unit, mostly of Arab origin. The emir was elected by and answerable to the shura. At the end of 1994, Sheikh Shaban joined the leadership of the unit. He was the head of the Islamic Cultural Institute in Milan and known to be an extremist who was well-connected with Islamic fundamentalists all over the world (the ICTY relied in that regard on a judgment of the Milan Criminal Court of 1 January 2006). He facilitated the recruitment of volunteers from Arab countries for the struggle in BH. Although Sheikh Shaban did not hold an official function within the unit, its members considered him to be the political authority and even the real emir within the unit. He could issue binding rulings (fatwa) and his authority was never challenged by the shura. Sheikh Shaban was killed, together with Abu Haris, at an HVO (Croatian Defence Council) military checkpoint on 14 December 1995.", "11. The General Framework Agreement for Peace, which ended the war in BH, was initialled at a military base near Dayton, the United States, on 21 November 1995 and signed in Paris, France, on 14 December 1995. Article III of Annex 1A to that Agreement called for the withdrawal of all foreign forces, including individual advisors, freedom fighters, trainers, volunteers, and personnel from neighbouring and other States, irrespective of whether they were legally and militarily subordinated to any of the local forces. In view of that, on 14 December 1995 the ARBH disbanded El Mujahedin and ordered its foreign members to leave the country by 10 January 1996. Despite initial resistance, the shura accepted that the unit be disbanded. It would appear that awards, such as the \u201cGolden Lily\u201d, were given to its members as an incentive for foreigners to leave. Members of the unit were also provided with ARBH certificates of service, which assisted its foreign members to acquire BH citizenship. Whereas most of the unit\u2019s foreign members left BH, some of them (such as the present applicant) applied for BH citizenship and continue to live in BH to date.", "12. After the attacks of 11 September 2001, the official attitude towards foreign mujahedin changed dramatically. Many lost their BH citizenship or were deported from BH after being declared a threat to national security.", "13. The applicant was born in Iraq in 1960.", "14. He went to Bosnia and Herzegovina to pursue his studies in 1979. He first studied in Sarajevo and in 1983 moved to Zenica. In 1987 the applicant married a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina. They have five children together.", "15. During the 1992-95 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the applicant joined El Mujahedin unit mentioned above.", "16. The applicant acquired citizenship of Bosnia and Herzegovina (\u201cBH citizenship\u201d) on three occasions: on 23 March 1992, on 12 January 1995 (under the name of Awad Fadhil) and again on 20 February 1995. He has visited Iraq twice since the 1992-95 war, in 2003 and 2004. The applicant possesses an Iraqi passport, issued by the Iraqi Embassy in Vienna on 23 January 2007, which was valid until 22 January 2011.", "17. On 30 August 2006 the competent administrative authorities established that the applicant\u2019s BH citizenship had been acquired by means of fraudulent conduct, false information and concealment of some relevant facts (notably, the fact that he already possessed BH citizenship when he lodged the second application for naturalisation and that he had used documents issued in two different names) and quashed the decisions of 23 March 1992 and 20 February 1995. On 12 January 2007 the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (\u201cthe State Court\u201d) quashed the part of the decision of 30 August 2006 concerning the decision of 20 February 1995 and remitted the case for retrial.", "18. Meanwhile, on 6 June 2007 the applicant filed a request for a temporary residence permit. On 28 September 2007 the Aliens Service suspended those proceedings pending the final resolution of the applicant\u2019s citizenship status.", "19. On 27 November 2008 the competent administrative authorities quashed the decision of 20 February 1995 again. On 3 December 2009 the State Court upheld that decision. On 1 February 2010 the applicant appealed to the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (\u201cthe Constitutional Court\u201d). It appears that those proceedings are still pending. This does not, however, prevent the applicant\u2019s potential deportation, as he became an unlawful resident from the moment of the notification of the decision of 27 November 2008. The applicant, on the other hand, claimed that he still possesses BH citizenship based on a decision of 12 January 1995 (see paragraph 16 above). That decision was, however, issued in the name of another person (Awad Fadhil) and cannot, therefore, confer any rights on the applicant, as was confirmed in the Government\u2019s observations on the admissibility and merits of the case.", "20. On 23 June 2009 the Aliens Service established that the applicant was a threat to national security and placed him in Isto\u010dno Sarajevo Immigration Centre. It relied on secret intelligence reports. On 30 June 2009 the State Court, having assessed the secret evidence, upheld that decision. On 17 September 2009 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal as manifestly ill-founded. The initial detention period had been extended on a monthly basis until April 2011 when the applicant was released (see paragraph 26 below).", "21. After the decision revoking the applicant\u2019s citizenship of 27 November 2008 had become final, the proceedings before the Aliens Service concerning a request for a temporary residence permit were resumed at the applicant\u2019s request (see paragraph 18 above). On 8 January 2010 the Aliens Service refused his request and granted him a period for voluntary departure of fifteen days. On 2 March 2010 the Ministry of Security upheld that decision. On 1 June 2010 the State Court upheld the decision of 2 March 2010. On 21 April 2011 the applicant appealed to the Constitutional Court. It would appear that those proceedings are still pending.", "22. On 17 February 2010 the applicant claimed asylum. He maintained that Iraqi citizens who had joined the foreign mujahedin during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina were treated in Iraq as suspected terrorists and were subjected to ill-treatment. He added that his friend had informed him that his name was on a \u201cblack list\u201d and that his family was subjected to threats and ill-treatment due to their affiliation with the Ba\u2019ath Party. The applicant also claimed that he would be persecuted by Shia Muslims and Kurds upon his return to Iraq (Kirkuk) because he is a Sunni Muslim.", "23. On 23 February 2010 the Asylum Service interviewed the applicant in the presence of his lawyer and a UNHCR representative. It also had regard to reports of the US Department of State, the UNHCR, the International Organization for Migration and the UK Border Agency on Iraq. At the interview the applicant stated that he has visited Iraq twice since the change of regime, in 2003 and 2004. During both visits he stayed with his family in Kirkuk. In 2003 he went to visit his sick father and stayed for one and a half months. He took care of his father and accompanied him to the hospital on several occasions. In 2004 the applicant went to Kirkuk to hold a commemoration for his father and remained there for the whole month of Ramadan and the Bayram holiday. However, he claimed that during these visits he had been forced to hide in fear of the Kurdish authorities as his friend had told him that he was under surveillance and that his name was on a \u201cblack list\u201d. The applicant further claimed that in his subsequent contact with his family, after he had returned to Bosnia and Herzegovina, they had told him that the Kurds had searched their home looking for him. On 4 March 2010 the Asylum Service refused the asylum claim and granted him a period for voluntary departure of fifteen days. The Asylum Service held that the applicant\u2019s statements were contradictory and that he had not provided any evidence in support of his claims.", "24. On 26 May 2010 the State Court quashed that decision and remitted the case for a retrial stating that the Asylum Service should make a more thorough assessment of the applicant\u2019s claim. On 21 June 2010 the Asylum Service refused the applicant\u2019s request for asylum and granted him a period for voluntary departure of fifteen days. On 22 September 2010 the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina upheld that decision. On 19 November 2010 the applicant appealed to the Constitutional Court against that decision. On 9 February 2011 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal as manifestly ill-founded. It held that, although the general situation in Iraq was insecure and problematic, the applicant had not proved that there was a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention on account of his personal circumstances.", "25. On 8 November 2010 the Aliens Service issued a deportation order accompanied with an entry ban for a period of five years. It stated, however, that removal directions would not be issued for as long as the Court\u2019s interim measure was in force. On 3 December 2010 the Ministry of Security upheld that decision. On 16 March 2011 the State Court also upheld the deportation order. An appeal is pending before the Constitutional Court.", "26. On 5 April 2011 the State Court ordered the applicant\u2019s immediate release from the immigration centre, quashing the last extension order (of 21 March 2011) as unlawful. It held that the relevant authorities had not provided any new evidence as a basis for the applicant\u2019s continued detention. Furthermore, it prescribed the lesser measure of surveillance limiting the applicant\u2019s freedom of movement to his home address in Zenica with the obligation to report daily to the Aliens Service field office in Zenica. It also ordered the confiscation of the applicant\u2019s Iraqi passport and other personal documents he might use in an attempt to leave the country. The applicant was released from detention on 7 April 2011.", "27. The Secret Data Act 2005 (Zakon o za\u0161titi tajnih podataka, Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina nos. 54/05 and 12/09) entered into force on 17 August 2005. Section 5 of that Act provides that the judges of the State Court and the Constitutional Court have access to all levels of secret data without any formalities (such as security clearance or special authorisation), if such access is required for exercising their duties.", "28. The Aliens Act 2008 (Zakon o kretanju i boravku stranaca i azilu, Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina no. 36/08) entered into force on 14 May 2008. Section 105 thereof provides that a refugee is an alien who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group, is outside his or her country of nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country, or a stateless person, who, being outside the country of former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it. The same provision defines a person eligible for subsidiary protection as an alien who does not qualify as a refugee but in respect of whom substantial grounds have been shown for believing that he or she would face a real risk of the death penalty or execution, torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the country of origin or in the country of habitual residence, or there is a serious, individual threat to a civilian\u2019s life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflict, and who is unable, or, owing to fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country.", "The principle of non-refoulement is incorporated in section 91 of the Act, which reads as follows:", "\u201cAn alien shall not be returned or expelled in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his or her life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, regardless of whether or not the person concerned has been granted international protection. The prohibition of return or expulsion (non-refoulement) shall also apply to persons in respect of whom there is a reasonable suspicion for believing that they would be in danger of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. An alien may not be returned or expelled to a country where he or she is not protected from being sent to such a territory either.\u201d", "Pursuant to section 118 of the Act, an alien whose claim for international protection has been refused will nevertheless be granted leave to remain on humanitarian grounds, if his or her removal would breach the principle of non-refoulement. However, the alien concerned must be placed in detention if it has been established that he or she constitutes a threat to public order or national security.", "29. Under section 88(1)(h) of the Aliens Act 2008 the deportation of an alien can be ordered if it has been established that he or she constitutes a threat to public order or national security. An appeal against a deportation order suspends deportation (section 87 of that Act). A claim for international protection and an application for judicial review against a refusal of such a claim equally suspend deportation (sections 92, 109(9) and 117 of that Act). Pursuant to section 93 of that Act, once an alien has become expellable, removal directions are issued within seven days. An appeal against removal directions does not suspend deportation.", "30. In accordance with section 99(2)(b) of the 2008 Act, an alien must be detained if it has been established that he or she constitutes a threat to public order or national security, irrespective of whether a deportation order has been issued. Once a deportation order has been issued, the alien concerned may also be detained under section 99(1)(a) of that Act. An initial detention order is valid for 30 days (section 100(3) of that Act). It may be extended any number of times for up to 30 days at a time. However, the total period of detention may only exceed 180 days in exceptional circumstances, such as if an alien prevents his or her removal or if it is impossible to remove an alien within 180 days for other reasons (see section 102 of that Act).", "31. The General Framework Agreement for Peace, which put an end to the 1992-95 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, was initialled at a military base near Dayton, the United States, on 21 November 1995 and signed in Paris, France, on 14 December 1995. It entered into force on the latter date.", "32. Pursuant to Article III of Annex 1A to that Agreement, all foreign forces, including individual advisors, freedom fighters, trainers, volunteers, and personnel from neighbouring and other States, irrespective of whether they were legally and militarily subordinated to any of the local forces, had to be withdrawn from Bosnia and Herzegovina by 13 January 1996.", "33. The relevant part of the 2010 Human Rights Report on Iraq, published by the Human Rights Office of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI), reads as follows:", "\u201cThe human rights situation in Iraq remains fragile as the country continues to emerge from years of dictatorship, warfare and violence. While the government continues to take some measures aimed at improving the protection and provision of human rights and its citizens, given the challenges that the country faces, progress is slow. Iraq continues to transition from a conflict to post-conflict country which faces enormous development challenges that the Government and people of Iraq must now address. Widespread poverty, economic stagnation, lack of opportunities, environmental degradation and an absence of basic services constitute \u201csilent\u201d human rights violations that affect large sectors of the population. Other factors that affected the human rights environment in 2010 included the inconclusive results of the general elections leading to a long process of government formation that was not concluded until December 2010. It is believed that this fuelled instability, but also led to a degree of inactivity in relation to implementing reforms and other measures aimed at ensuring the respect, protection and provision of human rights to the Iraqi population. Also affecting security was the withdrawal of all USF-I combat troops during the year which was completed in August 2010.", "...", "Armed violence continued to impact negatively on civilians and civilian infrastructure. Civilians were subjected to arbitrary loss of life and injury, but also limiting access to, and enjoyment of, other basic rights, including, but not limited to, the right to access basic humanitarian services, and the right of assembly, freedom of expression, freedom of religion, etc. It also negatively impacted on economic development. Arbitrary or deliberate targeting of civilians also constitutes serious violations of applicable rules of human rights law and international humanitarian law. The number of civilians who died from armed violence in 2010 range from 2,953 killed and 14,398 wounded according to UNAMI to 3,254 dead and 13,788 wounded according to figures provided by the Ministry of Human Rights (MoHR) of the Government of Iraq.", "...", "Minorities suffered from various attacks throughout Iraq during 2010. In particular Christians, Yezidi and Shabaks, among other minorities, continued to be directly targeted during the year \u2013 resulting in some displacement of members of minority groups within the country and internationally, particularly of Christians.\u201d", "34. The United Nations and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) have stated that, although they \u201cdo not necessarily encourage return at this time because of security concerns, both are committed to providing assistance to those who do decide to return\u201d (IOM, Assessment of Iraqi Return, August 2008). Moreover, the Iraqi Government have initiated a financial incentive and subsidy programme for returnee families and they are working to develop their capacity to register and assist the increasing number of returnees (IOM, cited above). The IOM has further noted that the rate of displacement in Iraq has slowed and that the rate of return has accelerated, mostly to Baghdad (IOM, Review of Displacement and Return in Iraq, February 2011). According to the IOM, general insecurity is the primary reason preventing Iraqis from returning home.", "35. According to a report of 18 December 2006 by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR Return Advisory and Position on International Protection Needs of Iraqis Outside Iraq), no forcible return of Iraqis from Southern or Central Iraq should take place until there was a substantial improvement in the security and human rights situation in the country.", "36. In a follow-up report of August 2007 (UNHCR\u2019s Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Iraqi Asylum-Seekers), the UNHCR encouraged the adoption of a prima facie approach for Iraqi asylum-seekers from Central and Southern Iraq and stated that they should be considered as refugees based on the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees in signatory countries. In its more recent Eligibility Guidelines of April 2009, the UNHCR observed that in view of the serious human rights violations and ongoing security incidents which were continuing in the country, most predominantly in the five Central Governorates of Bagdad, Diyla, Kirkuk, Ninewa and Salah-Al-Din, the UNHCR continued to consider all Iraqi asylum seekers from these five Central Governorates to be in need of international protection and stated that, in signatory countries, they should be considered as refugees based on the 1951 Convention criteria (see paragraph 12 of the Guidelines). The Guidelines observed inter alia:", "\u201c27. In the context of the Central Governorates of Baghdad, Diyala, Kirkuk, Ninewa and Salah Al-Din where, even though the security situation has improved in parts, there is still a prevalence of instability, violence and human rights violations by various actors, and the overall situation is such that there is a likelihood of serious harm. Armed groups remain lethal, and suicide attacks and car bombs directed against the MNF-I/ISF [Multinational Forces in Iraq/Iraqi Security Forces], Awakening Movements and civilians, in addition to targeted assassinations and kidnappings, continue to occur on a regular basis, claiming the lives of civilians and causing new displacement. These methods of violence are usually targeted at chosen areas where civilians of specific religious or ethnic groups gather, including places of worship, market places, bus stations, and neighbourhoods. Violence appears often to be politically motivated and linked to ongoing struggles over territory and power among various actors. As clarified above, even where an individual may not have personally experienced threats or risks of harm, events surrounding his or her areas of residence or relating to others, may nonetheless give rise to a well-founded fear. There is also more specific targeting of individuals by extremist elements of one religious or political group against specific individuals of another, through kidnappings and execution-style killings.\u201d", "As regards Kirkuk, the Guidelines included the following observations (footnotes omitted):", "\u201c202. Most violence in the Governorate is linked to the yet unresolved administrative status of Kirkuk and related power struggles between the various Arab, Kurdish and Turkmen actors. Security conditions in Kirkuk Governorate, and in particular in Kirkuk City, tend to worsen during political events related to the status of Kirkuk as armed groups aim at influencing political decisions. For example, during intense negotiations over a provincial elections law in summer 2008, a suicide attack on demonstrating Kurds resulted in an outbreak of inter-communal violence, in which more than 25 people were killed and over 200 injured. Conversely, tensions and sporadic violence can complicate future status negotiations. With the postponing of provincial elections in Kirkuk, the security situation has somewhat stabilized. However, simmering inter-communal tensions are prone to erupt into new violence ahead of decisions to be taken in relation to Kirkuk\u2019s unresolved status. Some observers note that tensions among ethnic groups over the unresolved status of Kirkuk could turn into another civil war. Insurgent groups such as AQI [Al-Qaeda in Iraq] also aim at stirring inter-communal violence by attacking proponents of ethnic/religious groups. Furthermore, it has been reported that community groups in Kirkuk are arming themselves in preparation for future clashes.", "203. Kirkuk\u2019s Arab and Turkmen communities complain of harassment, intimidation, arbitrary arrests and demographic manipulation at the hands of the Kurds, who dominate the Governorate\u2019s political and security institutions. Kurdish law enforcement personnel and political leaders are in turn popular targets for assassination. PUK and KDP offices are also a regular target of attacks. Recently, two members of the Kurdistan Communist Party have been killed in their homes in Kirkuk. The brother of a high-ranking member of the same party was also killed. Religious and ethnic minorities often find themselves caught up in the middle of struggles for power and territory.", "204. In Kirkuk Governorate, there are regular roadside bombings, shootings, and occasional car bombs and suicide attacks. On 11 December 2008, a suicide bomber killed 46 people and wounded nearly 100 when he detonated his explosive vest in a restaurant packed with government officials, women and children during lunch near Kirkuk City. There are also targeted kidnappings and assassinations, including of security officials, tribal leaders/SoI [Sons of Iraq], government officials and employees, (mostly Kurdish) party officials, members of minority groups [referring notably to two incidents of attacks against Christians], journalists and other professionals. Dead bodies continue to be found occasionally in Kirkuk Governorate.\u201d", "37. In July 2010 the UNHCR issued a Note on the Continued Applicability of the April 2009 UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Iraqi Asylum-Seekers. It contained the following information on security developments (footnotes omitted):", "\u201cUnder the Status-of-Forces Agreement (SOFA) of 30 June 2009, the Iraqi authorities have taken over full responsibility for the security of the country. The former Multinational Forces-Iraq/United States Forces-Iraq (former MNF-I/USF-I) have withdrawn from Iraqi cities, towns and villages and operate from their military bases at the request of the Iraqi Government. Currently, the US is drawing down all combat forces and is expected to complete this process by 31 August 2010. The Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) have almost reached their intended end strength of about 680,000 members. Since spring 2009 the Iraqi Government has been fully responsible for managing and integrating the largely Sunni Awakening Councils or Sons of Iraq (SoI) groups into the ISF and Iraqi government employment. This process is still ongoing and by April 2010, of the 94,000 SoI, some 9,000 had transitioned into the ISF and over 30,000 into other government employment.", "The Iraq Body Count (IBC), a project which maintains data on civilian deaths, reported that in 2009 the annual civilian death toll was 4,644. Reports for 2010 indicate that some 2,000 Iraqis were killed and some 5,000 others were injured during the first five months of 2010. An upsurge in violence was noted since the 7 March 2010 elections and casualty statistics for the months of April and May 2010 reflect an increase in the numbers of Iraqis killed and wounded in violence. Reports show that in 2009 and early 2010, insurgents carried out several mass-casualty attacks, including on high-profile, highly guarded targets such as Iraqi government institutions, prominent hotels and foreign embassies. The assaults resulted in hundreds of civilians killed or injured in the attacks. Al-Qa\u2019eda in Iraq claimed responsibility for the attacks against embassies in Baghdad and residential targets in mainly Shi\u2019a districts of the capital in early April 2010. The reported incidents mostly took place in the central governorates of Baghdad, Diyala, Kirkuk, Ninewa and Salah Al-Din as well as in AlAnbar, which has seen an increase in violence since the summer of 2009. The relatively stable security situation in the Southern governorates is reportedly occasionally disrupted by mass-casualty attacks and low level violence mainly in areas close to Baghdad. The Kurdistan Region remains relatively stable, though there have been reported assaults on journalists and political opponents.", "Among other security related developments worth noting is the start of the implementation of an interim joint security plan for Kirkuk and other internally disputed areas by the USF-I. The plan is based on joint action and coordination by the Iraqi Army and Police as well as the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) Peshmerga. Thus far, the joint security plan has resulted in the establishment of a network of checkpoints and joint patrols around major cities, and the training of security personnel. Addressing the overall issue of the status of the \u201cdisputed areas\u201d is among the challenges that await the new Government. Crucial matters to be resolved in this area include administrative boundaries, the control of oil resources, minority rights and other matters.", "Since early 2010, the ISF, with the help of the USF-I, have arrested or killed a large number of senior insurgent leaders, in particular members of Al-Qa\u2019eda in Iraq. Ongoing attacks illustrate that the groups are still intent on, and capable of, attacks.", "Reports indicate that the targeting of Government of Iraq officials, members of the Iraqi security forces, Awakening Council members and prominent citizens continue unabated. Among the frequently targeted are Shiite civilians and pilgrims as well as religious sites in different areas, religious and ethnic minority groups mainly in Ninewa and Kirkuk Governorates (Yazidis, Turkmen, Shabak and Kaka\u2019i), and the Christian minority, mainly in Ninewa, which includes 5,000 Christians displaced from Mosul in early 2010. Compared to 2008, there has been a significant increase in the use of magnetic and adhesive bombs attached to vehicles as a weapon to assassinate particular individuals. Profiles targeted include, in particular, government officials and employees, party officials, members of the Awakening Councils or Sons of Iraq (SoI), members of the ISF (including off-duty members), religious and ethnic minorities [referring to several incidents of attacks against Christians and a suicide truck bomber in, a Shi\u2019ite Turkmen town 20 km south of Kirkuk destroying homes and damaging another 100 homes, affecting 600 people], Sunni and Shi\u2019ite clerics, journalists, academics, doctors, judges and lawyers, human rights activists and Iraqis working for NGOs or the USF-I and foreign companies, alcohol vendors (which are commonly Christians or Yazidis), women and LGBT individuals.", "...", "III. Conclusion", "The situation in Iraq is still evolving. UNHCR will continue to monitor developments in the country and will update the April 2009 UNHCR Guidelines once it judges that the situation is sufficiently changed. In the interim, UNHCR advises those involved in the adjudication of international protection claims lodged by asylum-seekers from Iraq and those responsible for establishing government policy in relation to this population continue to rely on the April 2009 UNHCR Guidelines. Accordingly, the current UNHCR position on returns to Iraq also remains unchanged.\u201d", "38. The Country of Origin Information Centre (Landinfo), an independent human rights research body set up to provide the Norwegian immigration authorities with relevant information, has in a report of 28 October 2008 stated the following about the security situation in Kirkuk city (footnotes and references omitted):", "\u201cIt is generally recognized that the level of violence in Kirkuk is by far lower than that in Baghdad and Mosul.", "The majority of the security incidents in the city appear to be attacks against police and military. Most frequent are attacks against road patrols, and against checkpoints and personnel. These attacks both take place on the roads between Kirkuk and surrounding areas and inside the city. Occasional civilian casualties result from such attacks ... .", "There are also occasional indiscriminate attacks aimed directly at civilians, such as suicide attacks at crowded places inside the city.", "Additional types of targets have been recorded by Landinfo since October 2005. These targets are very diverse. There have been attacks on local Kurdish political leaders and their families, on engineers and building contractors, oil business executives, private security guards, gas station workers, churches, Shiite mosques, polling stations, and at a Turkmen political party office. In October 2008 an Iraqi journalist was killed.", "The intensity of attacks against all target groups seems to have remained quite stable over the years. Between September 2005 and March 2006, 44 reported incidents were recorded ... . During November and December 2006, a total of 30 individuals were reported killed in violent incidents (DMHA 2006).", "In March 2008, it was reported that violence had gone up since 2006, and that security remained highly unstable ... . According to the US military commander in Kirkuk, by the summer of 2008 violence had dropped by two thirds as compared to the summer of 2007 ... . Figures indicate that since August 2008, violence remains stable through October ... .", "We do not have figures for the summer of 2007, nor do we know for how long period of time \u2018summer\u2019 refers to. What the sources indicate, however, is that violence went up by March 2008, then down again by summer the same year, and that it seems to have stabilized somewhat afterwards. With the reservation that we don\u2019t have exact figures to substantiate this trend, we do see, however, that the occurrence of violence is unstable through a fairly short period of time.", "The factors accounting for the security problems continue to be present for the foreseeable future.

A Thematic Note by Landinfo on the Security Situation in Kirkuk City and the Surrounding Areas (Temanotat IRAK: Sikkerhetssituasjonen i Kirkuk by og omr\u00e5dene rundt), dated 16 March 2010, summarised the situation as follows:", "\u201cDuring the last two years, the security situation in Kirkuk has shown a decreasing level of activity on the part of armed groups, in spite of a persistent high level of political tension connected to the disputed political status of the city. Still, both Kirkuk city and Kirkuk province continue to be plagued by persistent political violence. There are no clear signs of open conflict between the Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen population groups, but widespread mutual mistrust seems to prevail along with a possibly increasing physical segregation between them. In this environment, militants continue to carry out attacks.", "The armed groups operating in Kirkuk, Hawija and Tuz Khormatu are all Sunni Moslem. They appear as periodically connected to each other logistically, and to be coalescing over time.\u201d", "In Section 2 of the Note it was observed inter alia that the conflict related violence in Kirkuk had continuously decreased since 2007 and had in 2009 reached its lowest level since 2004. Nonetheless, politically motivated violence still occurred on a daily basis. There were otherwise no new patterns of acts of violence. It was still the situation that such acts were primarily targeting authorities, the army and the political milieu. However, the casualties among the civilian population were considerably higher than those of the target groups. The level of political violence appeared relatively low in view of the continuous political tensions related to the unclear political status of the city. At the same time, the political violence was directly linked to unresolved political questions. Both Kurdish regional authorities and the national central authorities claimed a right to governance in the city. There was little information available which systematically presented the situation in the province for each of the three ethnic groups \u2013 Kurds, Arabs and Turkmens. According to the newspaper Today\u2019s Zaman of 10 February 2010, the local police was composed of 36% Kurds, 39% Arabs and 26% Turkmens. In the Kurdish areas of the city there were both Kurdish and Turkmen officers. In the Hawija district west of Kirkuk, the officers were Arabs. Even though the different groupings were reasonably well represented within public administration and education, distrust between them had frequently been reported since 2003.", "40.

The situation is fragile and Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) and US forces have a strong presence in the area. AQIs [Al Qaeda in Iraq] and insurgent groups\u2019 presence contribute to making the situation particularly volatile, and there are reports that AQI is using children as suicide bombers or combatants in Kirkuk.\u2019", "See also the section heading on Northern Iraq which highlighted that in February 2011 Kurdish Peshmerga troops entered Kirkuk governorate in violation of agreed security procedures in place between Kurdish and Iraqi forces.\u201d", "41.

In Kirkuk, Kurdish parties holding the two most senior political posts, Governor and Chairman of the Provincial Council, agreed to give up the latter, as a gesture of goodwill in order to move the political process forward and to accommodate a long-standing demand by Turkmen and Arab components. Hassan Turan (Turkmen) was elected to the post of Chairman, Najmaldin O. Karim (Kurdish) was appointed as the new Governor and Rakan Sa\u2019id al-Jubouri (Arab) remained Deputy Governor.", "9. On 31 March, Kurdish Peshmerga troops that had been deployed around the city of Kirkuk since 25 February 2011 withdrew and returned to the Kurdistan region. The incident served as a reminder of the challenges that remain as the United States Forces in Iraq draw down and the combined security mechanism comes to an end. The combined security mechanism was established to encourage Iraqi security forces and Kurdish Peshmerga troops to coordinate their operations, set up joint patrols and checkpoints and exchange information under the auspices of the United States Forces. The Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government have yet to agree on the future of the combined security mechanism or any successor arrangements that could be put into place after the departure of the United States Forces.", "10. The United States Forces in Iraq have continued their planned withdrawal from the country with the intention of completing their departure by 31 December 2011, as envisaged under the status-of-forces agreement signed between the Governments of Iraq and the United States of America.

The participants agreed to focus on the following issues: (a) Kirkuk, including powersharing issues and conducting provincial council elections; (b) Ninewa, the current political stalemate, power-sharing and security issues; (c) the future of the combined security mechanism; and (d) the census. On 25 April, participants agreed that subsequent meetings would be expanded to include local stakeholders from the Kirkuk and Ninewa governorates.
