The applicant, Mr Nuri Kurt, is a Turkish citizen who was born in 1954 and currently lives in Diyarbak\u0131r, Turkey. Until 1994 the applicant lived in Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131, a village of the Kocak\u00f6y district in the province of Diyarbak\u0131r.", "10. The application concerns the alleged destruction of the applicant\u2019s house by State security forces and village guards, and the national authorities\u2019 refusal to allow the applicant to return to his village.", "11. The facts surrounding the alleged destruction of the applicant\u2019s house and his inability to return to his village are in dispute between the parties.", "12. In December 1994 a landmine placed on the road to Geyiks\u0131rt\u0131, a neighbouring village of Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131, exploded and caused the death of a number of village guards. Security forces from the District Gendarmerie Command in Kocak\u00f6y and village guards from the Geyiks\u0131rt\u0131 village accused the inhabitants of Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131 of perpetrating the explosion since they had refused to serve as village guards. They threatened to evacuate the village unless the inhabitants left their homes within a week. Along with a number of fellow villagers, the applicant left his home and moved to Diyarbak\u0131r where he currently lives.", "13. Sometime in July or August 1995, village guards from the Geyiks\u0131rt\u0131 village burned the villagers\u2019 crops in Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131. During the incident, a small number of houses caught fire, although the applicant\u2019s house remained intact.", "14. On an unspecified date, the applicant learned through his acquaintances that on 22 December 1995, two days before the general elections, security forces and village guards had set fire to his house, along with all other houses in the village.", "15. Immediately after the burning of the village, the security forces and village guards arrived in G\u00fcnalan, a neighbouring village. They required the villagers to assemble in the village square and threatened to burn the houses in G\u00fcnalan too if the villagers were to vote for HADEP (the People\u2019s Democracy Party) in the forthcoming elections.", "16. On 2 February 1996 the applicant, along with some of his fellow villagers, lodged applications with the offices of the Diyarbak\u0131r Governor, the Kocak\u00f6y District Governor and the Diyarbak\u0131r Chief Public Prosecutor. He complained that security forces from the District Gendarmerie Command in Kocak\u00f6y and village guards from Geyiks\u0131rt\u0131 had set fire to his house, along with other houses in the village. He requested that the perpetrators of the act be prosecuted, that the damage he had sustained be redressed and that the required measures be taken in order to enable him and other villagers to return to their homes.", "17. On 1 May 1997 the Diyarbak\u0131r Chief Public Prosecutor issued a decision of lack of jurisdiction and sent the case file to the office of the Administrative Council in Diyarbak\u0131r, in accordance with the Law on the Prosecution of Civil Servants (Memurin Muhakemat\u0131 Kanunu).", "18. On 30 May 1997 the applicant lodged his application with the European Commission of Human Rights alleging violations of Articles 6, 8, 13 and 14 of the Convention, and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.", "19. On 31 May 1997 the Kocak\u00f6y District Administrative Council launched an investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations. The investigation was conducted by a gendarme major, Mr Metin F\u0131rat, who had been appointed as an investigator (muhakkik) by the Commission on the Prosecution of Civil Servants (\u201cthe CPCS\u201d).", "20. On 3 September 1997 the CPCS decided that most of the houses in Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131 had been burned down as a result of a fire which had started in the Haran hamlet of Kara\u00e7imen, due to the burning of stubble in a field. The CPCS concluded that no proceedings should be brought against the accused security forces and the village guards. The case file was then sent to the Diyarbak\u0131r Regional Administrative Court.", "21. On 27 November 1997 the Kocak\u00f6y District Administrative Council\u2019s decision was served on the applicant.", "22. On 1 December 1997 the applicant filed an objection with the Diyarbak\u0131r Regional Administrative Court against the decision given by the CPCS.", "23. On 2 December 1997 the Diyarbak\u0131r Regional Administrative Court quashed the decision of the CPCS on the ground that the investigation file was incomplete. The court reasoned that the investigating authorities should have heard the applicant before reaching a conclusion on the matter.", "24. On 8 July 1998 the CPCS, after completing the investigation file, reiterated its decision of 3 September 1997 that no proceedings should be brought against the security forces and the village guards.", "25. On 20 October 1998 the Diyarbak\u0131r Regional Administrative Court upheld the decision of the CPCS.", "26. On 8 July 1999 the Registry of the Court sent a letter to the applicant\u2019s representative requesting him to provide a copy of the Administrative Court\u2019s decision.", "27. On 20 July 1999 the applicant applied to the Diyarbak\u0131r Regional Administrative Court\u2019s registry for a copy of its decision of 20 October 1998. The request was rejected, the applicant being informed that he should apply to the Kocak\u00f6y District Governor\u2019s office.", "28. In July 2000 a group of people, encouraged by unspecified village guards, settled in Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131 together with their livestock.", "29. On 17 August 2000 the applicant filed a petition with the Kocak\u00f6y District Governor\u2019s office requesting permission for his family\u2019s return to Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131 and the eviction of these new dwellers from their property. The applicant did not receive any response to his petition.", "30. In April 1994 the applicant, along with other villagers, left the Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131 village due to pressure by the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party).", "31. On 27 September 1994 a fire started in Haran, a hamlet of the Kara\u00e7imen village in Diyarbak\u0131r, caused by the burning of stubble in a field. The fire went out of control and spread to the Bozba\u011flar village, the G\u00fcltarla hamlet and the Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131 village. Despite the efforts of the Kocak\u00f6y Fire Brigade and the village guards from the neighbouring villages, most of the buildings in Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131 burned down, although the applicant\u2019s house remained undamaged.", "32. On 19 December 1996 the applicant lodged a petition with the Public Prosecutor\u2019s office in Diyarbak\u0131r, complaining about the burning down of his house by security forces from the District Gendarmerie Command in Kocak\u00f6y and village guards from the Geyiks\u0131rt\u0131 village.", "33. On 17 March 1997 the Diyarbak\u0131r Chief Public Prosecutor issued a decision of lack of jurisdiction and sent the case file to the office of the Administrative Council in Diyarbak\u0131r, in accordance with the Law on the Prosecution of Civil Servants.", "34. On 16 May 1997 the Governor\u2019s office in Diyarbak\u0131r initiated an investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations.", "35. On 31 May 1997 a gendarme captain was appointed by the District Gendarmerie Command in Kocak\u00f6y to investigate the applicant\u2019s allegations. Between 6 June 1997 and 5 August 1997, the investigator took statements from a total of fourteen witnesses, including some inhabitants of nearby villages, military officers and fire fighters serving in Kocak\u00f6y.", "36. In view of these statements, the investigator concluded that the houses in Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131 had been burned down in September 1994 as a result of a fire which had started in the Haran hamlet of Kara\u00e7imen, due to the burning of stubble in a field. He further noted that there were no traces of burning on the wooden parts of the applicant\u2019s house and that, therefore, it could not have been exposed to fire.", "37. The investigation conducted by the gendarmes further revealed that the applicant leased his land to two villagers in return for a share of the crop, which fact was confirmed by some villagers and the village mayor (muhtar).", "38. Currently, there are inhabitants living and cultivating fields in Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131.", "39. In his petition submitted to the Governor\u2019s office in Diyarbak\u0131r, the applicant complained about the forced eviction of the inhabitants of Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131 and the subsequent burning of the houses in the village by security officers and village guards. The applicant requested that their safe return to their homes be guaranteed, the perpetrators be brought to justice and their damage be redressed.", "40. On 1 December 1997 the applicant filed an objection with the Diyarbak\u0131r Regional Administrative Court against the decision given by the CPCS, which had held that no prosecution should be initiated against the alleged perpetrators. The applicant complained that the CPCS had conducted a superficial investigation with a view to covering up the crimes.", "41. On 20 July 1999 the applicant applied to the Diyarbak\u0131r Regional Administrative Court\u2019s registry for copies of its decisions of 2 December 1997 and 20 October 1998. The request was rejected.", "42. Until 1994, the witnesses were resident in Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131. They provided separate but, in part, identical statements.", "43. Among these witnesses, Mr Yolda\u015f stated that in 1994 security forces and village guards had exerted pressure upon them into either becoming village guards or vacating the village. Mr Yolda\u015f and Mr \u0130pek stated that security forces and village guards had been harassing the villagers as they believed that the villagers had been aiding and abetting the PKK. They claimed further that the village had been raided and searched on several occasions and that the villagers had been routinely battered.", "44. Mr Yolda\u015f stated, but none of the other witnesses confirmed, that one night in October or November 1992, unidentified persons opened fire at the village, wounding Mr Yolda\u015f and killing his 15-year old daughter. Mr Yolda\u015f heard rumours that the village guards from the K\u0131rmata\u015f and R\u0131kala villages were responsible for the shootings. He believed that the public prosecutor in charge had conducted a spurious investigation without even taking his statement. He stated that security forces and village guards had threatened to kill the villagers if they filed complaints against the allegedly guilty village guards. Out of fear and ignorance, Mr Yolda\u015f did not complain to the authorities about such threats.", "45. Mr Yolda\u015f and Mr \u0130pek asserted that in March 1993 security forces and village guards had assembled the villagers in Akrad-G\u00fcnalan and had tortured them. Mr Abdulbaki \u0130pek elaborated on the incident, stating that he was one of the four victims and that he had suffered three broken ribs. They also submitted that, angered by the landmine explosion, security forces and village guards had come to Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131 and had threatened to kill the villagers if they did not vacate the village. Such threats, added to earlier incidents, caused these witnesses and their families to leave the village on an unspecified date. Conversely, Masum Tosin, Hasan Kaya and Mevlude U\u00e7ar stated that the fire in September 1994 had taken place six or seven months after they had left the village. In this connection, Mr Tosin and Mr Kaya noted that, after the fire, they had gone to the village to examine the damage. It appears from these statements that at least some of the villagers, including these witnesses and their families, had left the village long before December 1994, the time when the landmine exploded and security forces and village guards allegedly forced the inhabitants of Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131 to evict their homes.", "46. In response to the Government\u2019s claim that the village was abandoned due to PKK repression, the witnesses explained that PKK militants had never come to Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131, even less terrorized the villagers.", "47. Concerning the fire which started in 1994, the witnesses explained that the fire had spread to the Haran hamlet, the G\u00fcltarla village and finally to Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131, and had burnt the crops in those areas, including those of the applicant and his brother. They stated that around 20 houses on the west side of Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131 had burned down, while the concrete houses and the ones located in the centre and the east side of the village had survived the fire.", "48. The witnesses said that they had heard from their acquaintances living in neighbouring villages that, two days before the general elections of 1995 (i.e. 22 December 1995), security forces and village guards had set fire to the houses which had survived the previous fire of 1994. According to Mr Yolda\u015f and Mr \u0130pek, immediately after the burning down of Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131, security forces and village guards went to the Akrad-G\u00fcnalan village and threatened to burn that village too if the villagers voted for HADEP in the elections.", "49. The witnesses added that, since 1998 or 1999, the authorities had been allowing the Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131 villagers to cultivate their fields in association with subcontractors from neighbouring villages. They claimed, however, that the applicant and his brother had been denied such permission.", "50. Mr Nifak and Mr Fahrio\u011flu have lived in the Kara\u00e7imen village of the Kocak\u00f6y District in Diyarbak\u0131r since their childhood. They have been cultivating the applicant\u2019s land since 2002. They stated that on 1 February 2003 they were called to the District Gendarmerie Command in Kocak\u00f6y and made to sign some documents, which they had later learned to be their witness statements. Since they were both illiterate they had not been aware of the content of such statements.", "51. They further asserted that everybody knew how the village had been evacuated but that they had preferred to remain silent for their own sake.", "52. This letter informed all village mayors in Lice about the policy set for an orderly return to the villages previously abandoned because of terrorism. It stated that all villagers were free to return to the villages found suitable for habitation by the respective District Governors.", "53. The letter divided villages into three categories in respect of the permitted time for such returns. It gave no indication as to which village fell under which \u201cphase\u201d. It explained that the former inhabitants of certain \u201cphase-II villages\u201d could return to those villages only for cultivation purposes during the day time. The letter did not contain any indication about the phase/category in which Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131 falls.", "54. According to the letter, no villager was allowed to resettle in or stay overnight in \u201cphase-II\u201d and \u201cphase-III\u201d villages until a decision had been taken by the respective governor\u2019s office to that effect.", "55. The letter pointed out the difficulties faced by security forces during the military operations conducted in the rural areas of Lice, Kulp and Hani. It explained that during such operations it was difficult to distinguish terrorists from the villagers wandering around in rural areas. The letter advised that notice be given to villagers to avoid any unfortunate incident for which the authorities would not accept any responsibility.", "56. The Human Rights Foundation is a non-governmental organisation with its head office in Ankara, Turkey. Its 1993 Report stated that, from 1990 to 1993, more than 913 villages and hamlets had been evacuated. The 1993 Report maintained that village evacuations had accelerated in 1993, mostly targeting the villages whose inhabitants refused to serve as village guards.", "57. The 1994 Report of the TIHV argued that the Government\u2019s policy was to claim that the evacuations and eventual destructions were caused by PKK terror, poverty and the forces of nature. According to the same report, some 50 to 60 villages were burned down in each of the provinces subject to the emergency rule.", "58. The 1995 Report maintained that more than 400 villages had been evacuated in 1995. According to the 1996 Report, the State-of-Emergency Regional Governor once mentioned that a total of 918 villages and 1767 hamlets had been evacuated for various reasons, although never admitting that evacuations had been carried out by security forces.", "59. The 1997 and 1998 Reports described the Government\u2019s policy of evacuating villages as a systematic \u201cinternal security operation\u201d applied throughout the 1990s.", "60. The excerpts gave a comprehensive list of burned-down and/or evacuated villages from February 1990 to January 1999. The list did not make any reference to Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131 as having been evacuated and destroyed.", "61. The excerpts contained several articles reproduced from a daily newspaper \u00dclkede G\u00fcndem, relating to the evacuation of villages and its detrimental effects on the displaced persons. The articles stressed that numerous villagers had filed petitions with the State authorities, complaining that their villages had been burned down by security forces.", "62. The articles also emphasized that the Government\u2019s public declarations, which appeared to allow displaced villagers to return to their villages, were unreliable. Whenever villagers had attempted to do so, they were physically denied access to their villages.", "63. This report was prepared by a Commission of Inquiry composed of ten members of parliament. According to the report, in 1993 and 1994 the inhabitants of 905 villages and 2,923 hamlets were evicted and forced to move to other regions of the country (p.13). The number of people evicted from 90 villages and 225 hamlets in the province of Diyarbak\u0131r, where the Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131 village is located, was estimated to be around 50,371 (p.12).", "64. The report included a statement by Mr Do\u011fan Hatipo\u011flu, a former governor of Diyarbak\u0131r. Mr Hatipo\u011flu explained that, during his office, occasional village evacuations by military authorities were brought to his attention. He stated that \u2013 although very rarely \u2013 he had received complaints about village burnings. According to Mr Hatipo\u011flu, it was inconceivable to assert that all the villages were vacated due to PKK coercion. He alleged that the Government had failed to take the necessary measures for a healthy resettlement of displaced persons (p.13).", "65. The report also referred to the \u201cHuman Rights Report \u2013 Turkey\u201d, prepared and submitted to the Commission of Inquiry in 1995 by Mr Yavuz \u00d6nen, the chairman of the Human Rights Foundation. This latter report dedicated a chapter to immigrants and evacuated villages. It argued that, in 1995, the practice of evacuation of villages and hamlets was widespread. Many houses in villages were either destroyed or made uninhabitable. People were forced to emigrate from the region and pressure was exerted on the inhabitants until they left their villages. In early 1995 there was practically no village or hamlet inhabited except those whose inhabitants agreed to become village guards (p.19).", "66. The report of the Commission of Inquiry also referred to the speech delivered at the Turkish Grand National Assembly by Mr Salih Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, a deputy from \u015e\u0131rnak, on 3 June 1997 on the question of evacuated villages. Mr Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m stated, inter alia, that the villages were evacuated either by the PKK, in order to intimidate those who opposed it, by the authorities since they were unable to protect the villages, or because the inhabitants of those villages refused to become village guards or were suspected of having aided the PKK (p. 20).", "67. In conclusion, it was recommended in the report that the inhabitants of the settlement units should be re-housed in the provinces, districts or central villages \u2013 rather than hamlets \u2013 close to the area where they used to live and that necessary economic measures should be taken with a view to providing employment to the inhabitants of the region, priority being given to the immigrants.", "68. In his letters dated 31 May 1999 and 24 March 2000, the applicant provided the Court with copies of title deeds representing the land jointly owned by him and others in Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131, and three colour photographs of what he described as his and some other villagers\u2019 burned-down houses. The applicant\u2019s house and the date of those photos were not specified. There was no indication whether his house was indeed one of them. It was not possible to tell from the pictures whether the houses in question were burned down or had simply deteriorated over the years. The applicant supplied no expert opinion as to the nature of such destruction. Also, there were a number of undamaged houses in the photos.", "69. Kocayol District Gendarmerie Command sent a letter to Central Gendarme Station, ordering that various witnesses be summoned to give statements in connection with the investigation in progress.", "70. This report was prepared by a gendarme captain from the District Gendarmerie Command in Kocak\u00f6y. It contained the findings of the captain after his investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations of 31 May 1997. It gave an account of witness statements by villagers, army officers and fire fighters, as well as the investigator\u2019s on-site observations.", "71. Between 6 June 1997 and 5 August 1997, the investigator took statements from a total of 14 witnesses, including inhabitants of nearby villages, military officers and fire fighters serving in Kocak\u00f6y.", "72. Beh\u00e7et Ba\u015faran, \u015eeyhmuz \u00c7ak\u0131\u015ft\u0131r, Salih Y\u0131lmaz, Maaz Yal\u00e7\u0131nkaya, Ahmet Gezer, Habip Ek, H\u00fcseyin Bu\u011fdayc\u0131, Kaz\u0131m Bu\u011fdayc\u0131, Abdulhaluk Ek and Mehmet Y\u0131ld\u0131z are inhabitants of nearby villages. In their individual statements, \u015eeyhmuz \u00c7ak\u0131\u015ft\u0131r, Ahmet Gezer, Habip Ek, H\u00fcseyin Bu\u011fdayc\u0131, Kaz\u0131m Bu\u011fdayc\u0131 and Abdulhaluk Ek pointed out that the inhabitants of Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131 had left their homes in 1994 because of the mounting coercion exerted by the PKK. Beh\u00e7et Ba\u015faran, Salih Y\u0131lmaz and Maaz Yal\u00e7\u0131nkaya stated that they had rushed to Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131 when they heard about the fire in September 1994. They claimed that the fire fighters and village guards had made every effort to put the fire out and that they had not seen any soldier nor had they heard a rumour that soldiers and village guards had started the fire. Mr Ba\u015faran, Mr Y\u0131lmaz, Mr Yal\u00e7\u0131nkaya and Mr Gezer further stated that they believed that the fire had stemmed from the burning of wheat stubble.", "73. Mehmet Kaya and Abdullah Efe are fire fighters in Kocak\u00f6y. In their individual statements, these witnesses explained that they had rushed to Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131 immediately after the Mayor\u2019s office had informed them about the fire. They submitted that, despite all efforts, the fire had got out of control and had burned the village, together with some parts of the neighbouring villages. They added that gendarmes and village guards could not have started the fire as there were no soldiers in the area and the village guards were the ones making the most fervent efforts to extinguish the fire.", "74. Mustafa Kalfa and Kaz\u0131m \u00c7elik were gendarme officers. In their separate statements, they asserted that all gendarme operations had been recorded in a book on a daily basis but that there was no record of any operation on 22 December 1995 in Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131. Mr \u00c7elik explained that gendarmes had had no reason to go to Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131 as the inhabitants had already abandoned that village. Mr \u00c7elik added that most houses in Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131 had been built of adobe, which would explain their natural deterioration over the years.", "75. H\u00fcseyin Bu\u011fdayc\u0131, Kaz\u0131m Bu\u011fdayc\u0131 and Abdulhaluk Ek were village guards. They each stated that the villagers had left their home in 1994 because of PKK terrorism. They noted that everybody in the neighbouring villages knew about the fire in September 1994 and how it had destroyed Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131. They further explained that the applicant was making dishonest claims in an effort to discredit them as village guards.", "76. In view of these statements, the investigator concluded that the houses in Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131 had been burned down in September 1994 as a result of a fire which had started in the Haran hamlet of Kara\u00e7imen, due to the burning of stubble.", "77. The report also included photographs of the applicant\u2019s ruined house in Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131. From his examination, the investigator concluded that there were no traces of burning on the wooden parts of the applicant\u2019s house. Accordingly, the investigator concluded that the house could not have been exposed to fire.", "78. The investigator further established that the applicant had been leasing his land to two farmers from a neighbouring village in return for a share of the crop, and thereby had been reaping economic benefits from his land.", "79. In a decision of 2 December 1997, the Diyarbak\u0131r Regional Administrative Court overturned the \u201cnon-prosecution\u201d decision of the CPCS. The court reasoned that the applicant\u2019s testimony should have been taken. It therefore ruled that the investigation file was incomplete.", "80. Upon the Diyarbak\u0131r Regional Administrative Court\u2019s invalidation of the CPCS decision of 3 July 1997 on procedural grounds, the CPCS completed the case file by taking the applicant\u2019s testimony.", "81. In his testimony, the applicant admitted that he had not been present in Su\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131 at the time of the burning of his house by security forces and village guards. He claimed that he had heard about the incident from Mahmut Gezer, a resident of the G\u00fcnalan village. However, in his statements dated 8 July 1998, Mr Gezer submitted that he had not seen or stayed in contact with the applicant since he had left the village in 1994.", "82. The decision further indicated that the photographs taken at the site of the alleged incident revealed that the applicant\u2019s house had deteriorated for natural reasons and the fact that it had remained uninhabited for years.", "83. Based on such findings, the CPCS reiterated its previous decision that no proceedings should be brought against the accused security forces and the village guards.", "84. Upon failed attempts to locate the applicant, the Kocak\u00f6y District Governor\u2019s office decided to serve the CPCS\u2019 decision of 8 July 1998 to the applicant by way of an announcement, pursuant to Articles 28 et seq. of the Law on Service of Process no. 7201.", "85. On an unspecified date, the announcement appeared in a local newspaper.", "86. This report contains the gendarme officers\u2019 findings that the applicant\u2019s house had deteriorated because it had not been inhabited for a long time.
