He was represented before the Court by Ms B. S\u0142upska-Uczkiewicz, a lawyer practising in Wroc\u0142aw. The Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "The applicant has been detained in K\u0142odzko Prison continuously since 24 March 2004.", "The applicant submitted that on an unspecified date he had been detained together with four other prisoners in a cell which measured 25 m\u00b2. The cell in question was not ventilated and the furniture inside was shabby. The cell was overcrowded to the point that the applicant had to lie in his bed almost all day. He had only one hour of outdoor exercise per day and a shower once a week. The applicant also maintained that the quality of food served in prison was very bad, the bed linen was washed only infrequently and water cuts occurred frequently.", "In his recent letters to the Court, the applicant made general statements that living conditions and medical care in K\u0142odzko Prison were bad. He claimed that his cell was overcrowded and that he had no choice but to lie in bed all day long.", "The Government furnished the Court with a detailed record of the applicant\u2019s detention in K\u0142odzko Prison. They submitted that the space per person in the applicant\u2019s cells ranged from 2.2 to 2.9 m\u00b2 over a total period of thirteen months, whereas for the remaining time, the applicant had more than 3 m\u00b2 of space. More recently, the Government submitted that on an unspecified date, presumably in November 2009, the applicant had been placed in a cell in which the statutory minimum standard of 3 m\u00b2 per person was respected.", "Between 2004 and 2007 the applicant lodged several complaints with the penitentiary authorities regarding various aspects of his detention. He did not complain to the penitentiary authorities in connection with the living conditions as regards the more recent period of his detention in K\u0142odzko Prison. The applicant did not bring a civil action in tort to seek compensation for the infringement of his personal rights."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
