The Government disclosed the names of some of the witnesses and indicated some of the dates on which witness statements had been obtained, but did not produce copies of transcripts of witness interviews. According to the Government, the officers had been shown Abdulkasim Zaurbekov\u2019s photograph for identification. They had stated that the applicants\u2019 relative had never been held in the temporary isolation unit of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD. Officer S., who at the material time had been the acting head of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD, had made positive reference to the applicants\u2019 relative and stated that during the search the investigators had obtained information to the effect that Abdulkasim Zaurbekov could have been killed by members of illegal armed groups for refusing to collaborate with them. Officer B. had stated that on the day of Abdulkasim Zaurbekov\u2019s disappearance he had seen the latter walking outside the territory of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD in the direction of a local market.

At the same time, the Government suggested that a Court delegation could have access to the file at the place where the preliminary investigation was being conducted, with the exception of \u201cthe documents [disclosing military information and personal data concerning the witnesses], and without the right to make copies of the case file and to transmit it to others\u201d.
