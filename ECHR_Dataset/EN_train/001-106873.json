Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "Since his early childhood, the applicant has been suffering from epilepsy marked by frequent seizures.", "On 23 March 2008 the applicant was remanded in custody in the United Kingdom in connection with criminal proceedings pending at that time against him. During his detention, he was treated at St George\u2019s Hospital.", "On 18 July 2008 the applicant was extradited to Poland.", "On 17 February 2009 he was convicted of a criminal offence by a competent Polish court and sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment.", "The proceedings are currently pending on appeal.", "On 27 August 2008 the applicant was committed to Cz\u0119stochowa Remand Centre.", "On 25 March 2009 he was transferred to the hospital of Gda\u0144sk Remand Centre.", "On 2 June 2009 the applicant was discharged from the hospital and transported in a prison van to Cz\u0119stochowa Remand Centre (a journey of approximately 500 km). He was committed to Bydgoszcz Remand Centre overnight. Subsequent short stopovers took place on 3 June at Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski and Inowroc\u0142aw Remand Centres.", "On 3 June 2009 at 5 p.m. the applicant arrived at Cz\u0119stochowa Remand Centre.

The cells in question measured on average 12 sq. m and were shared by eight detainees including the applicant (1.5 sq. m per person). They were insufficiently lit. As a result, the applicant\u2019s eyesight deteriorated.", "The applicant also claimed that the cells had been dirty and infested with insects. They were furnished with triple bunk beds, two tables and stools. The toilet annex in each cell was not separated and there was always a stench inside.", "The applicant also complained of being bullied and laughed at by the staff of Cz\u0119stochowa Remand Centre.", "The Government acknowledged that from September 2008 until November 2009, with the exception of July 2009, Cz\u0119stochowa Remand Centre had been overcrowded. The degree by which the number of prisoners exceeded the maximum capacity for that detention facility (calculated on the basis of the standard of 3 sq. m of cell space per prisoner provided for in Polish law) ranged from 22 to 33% in the period from September 2008 until January 2009. It was 16% in February, 7% in April, 5% in June, 3% in August, and 12% in November 2009.", "Moreover, the detailed records provided by the Government reveal the following information concerning the applicant.", "From 27 August until 17 October 2008 the applicant was assigned to cell no. 30 which measured 14 sq. m.

The applicant had one shower per week and an hour\u2019s outdoor exercise per day.", "The applicant submitted that in Cz\u0119stochowa Remand Centre he had not been under regular medical supervision and that his epilepsy had been treated with inadequate generic drugs administered in wrong dosages. As a result his epileptic seizures had increased and he had lived in constant fear for his life and in despair.", "Ambulances were called to the remand centre for the applicant on more than sixty occasions (namely, five times in November and twenty-two times in December 2008, eighteen times in January, twelve in February and seven in March 2009). He continued to have fits in Gda\u0144sk Remand Centre hospital, although, as he submitted, the medicine he received there had been more effective. The applicant also submitted that throughout his detention he had often been taken to the local hospitals in Cz\u0119stochowa for emergency treatment.", "During the applicant\u2019s journey from Gda\u0144sk to Cz\u0119stochowa Remand Centre on 2 and 3 June 2009, he did not receive adequate medical attention. His medicine was administered in the evening of 2 June in Bydgoszcz Remand Centre. The next morning, however, despite his repeated requests, the applicant did not receive any drugs. On 3 June at 1 p.m. he had a serious epileptic fit, after which he lost consciousness.", "On 17 July 2009 the applicant had a serious epileptic seizure during his outdoor exercise in Cz\u0119stochowa Remand Centre. He fell and hit his head on the concrete floor of the courtyard. He received some help from his fellow inmates. Five minutes into the seizure the applicant was surrounded by the remand centre\u2019s guards who were armed and wearing bullet proof vests. A remand centre doctor and a nurse only arrived twenty-five minutes later. The applicant was given an injection. Still unconscious, he was taken inside the building, where he was given another injection. He was then moved inside his cell, where he suffered from another seizure. Only then was an ambulance called and the applicant received some further medical treatment.", "On 26 July 2009 he was denied access to the remand centre\u2019s in-house doctor, even though he was not feeling well. His legs became momentarily paralysed and he was dragged into his cell by his fellow inmates. Since then, he has had difficulty walking.", "The Government submitted that throughout his detention the applicant had been under constant medical treatment and care in conformity with the requirements of his medical condition and the recommendations of specialist doctors. In order to avoid any accidents or injuries the applicant was assigned a bottom bunk bed. He was also regularly administered medicines as prescribed by a neurologist and a psychiatrist.", "The Government did not comment on the number of the applicant\u2019s epileptic seizures and medical emergencies. It was noted, however, that despite the efforts of the remand centre\u2019s medical staff, the applicant\u2019s epileptic fits had become more frequent and more serious.", "In March 2009 the applicant had to be hospitalised in Gda\u0144sk Remand Centre. He was prescribed complex pharmacological treatment for patients with medicine-resistant epilepsy. The treatment gave good results and on 2 June 2009 the applicant was transferred back to Cz\u0119stochowa Remand Centre in good condition with the recommendation to follow further treatment as an out-patient.", "The Government did not comment on the applicant\u2019s transport from the hospital in Gda\u0144sk to Cz\u0119stochowa Remand Centre on 2 and 3 June 2009. They also did not refer to the alleged incidents of 17 and 26 July 2009.", "In the Government\u2019s submission, until his release from the remand centre on 25 August 2009, the applicant\u2019s seizures were mild and less frequent than before his hospitalisation.", "On the other hand, when the applicant returned to prison on 19 November 2009 after nearly two months at liberty, his epilepsy was much worse than before his release. A medical examination of 23 November 2009 confirmed that the applicant was at risk of suffering injuries during his epileptic fits in prison and that he was not fit for further detention. On these grounds the authorities of Cz\u0119stochowa Remand Centre applied to suspend the execution of the applicant\u2019s sentence (zawieszenie wykonania kary). The suspension was granted on 25 November 2009.", "On 13 May 2009 the Katowice Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) examined the applicant\u2019s interlocutory appeal against a decision to extend his pre-trial detention. The applicant argued, among other things, that he had not been fit for further detention. The domestic court relied on an expert report which had been obtained by the first-instance court reviewing the applicant\u2019s preventive measure. It appears from another document in the Court\u2019s possession that the expert report in question was ordered by the Cz\u0119stochowa Regional Court on 15 January 2009. As quoted by the Katowice Court of Appeal, the expert had concluded that the applicant could receive adequate treatment in detention.", "The hospital information chart (karta informacyjna) of 2 June 2009, which was signed by a neurology specialist, Dr D.Z.W., contained the following relevant information: \u201cRecommendations for further treatment: Periodical neurological check-ups.

The relevant document stated that the applicant had had the disability since 2002.", "Since his release the applicant has been receiving constant medical treatment but his epilepsy is very severe. He suffers from frequent seizures, dizziness and anxiety. He claimed that he had to be accompanied by another person in his daily routine.", "From 11 to 15 March 2010 the applicant was admitted to the Cz\u0119stochowa Municipal Hospital (Miejski Szpital Zespolony) because he had broken his elbow during one of his epileptic fits.", "The applicant submitted that his current state of health had been caused by the inadequate treatment provided to him in prison.", "The applicant lodged numerous complaints with the Governor of Cz\u0119stochowa Remand Centre, the Director of the Prison Service and with other prison authorities. He claimed that he had not received adequate medical care in Cz\u0119stochowa Remand Centre. He also alleged to have been denied access to his medical records.", "Moreover, the applicant submitted many habeas corpus requests, asking to be released on health grounds.", "Lastly, the applicant submitted that he could not afford to bring a civil lawsuit.", "The provisions pertaining to medical care in detention facilities and general conditions of detention, and the relevant domestic law and practice are set out in the Court\u2019s judgments in the cases of Kaprykowski v. Poland, no. 23052/05, \u00a7\u00a7 36-39, 3 February 2009; S\u0142awomir Musia\u0142 v. Poland, no. 28300/06, \u00a7\u00a7 48-61 ECHR 2009... (extracts); and Orchowski v.
