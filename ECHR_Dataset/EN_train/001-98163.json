The admissions to hospital were well-founded; the copies of the medical documents issued by [the hospital] and presented to you are authentic.", "Subsequently [the applicant] continued to be monitored by [the hospital]. This monitoring was done without his being granted sick leave, as the hospital did not record any acute attacks of his chronic diseases during the monitoring period. The copies of documents issued by [the hospital] and submitted by you are authentic; however, they do not indicate that [the applicant] was incapacitated only temporarily. [The applicant\u2019s] state of health and his out-patient treatment did not prevent his presence at the hearings in Chita. [The applicant] is not currently being monitored by [the hospital].\u201d", "On 7 December 2004 the Military Court held a hearing which the applicant attended. Between 8 December 2004 and 25 January 2005 the Military Court scheduled fifteen hearings, of which three were adjourned because the applicant failed to appear and one was postponed at the request of a co-defendant who had to attend the funeral of a close relative.", "Of the twenty-nine hearings fixed between 25 January and 20 April 2005, four hearings were postponed because the applicant did not attend, two were adjourned because a co-defendant did not attend, and one was rescheduled so that one of the witnesses could attend.", "On 13 May 2005 the Military Court of the East-Siberian Command discontinued the criminal proceedings against the applicant and relieved him of criminal liability as the statutory limitation period had expired.
