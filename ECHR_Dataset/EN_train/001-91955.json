The applicant received the longest sentence. The court found that they had acted in concert, namely that Mr D.M. and Mr M.E. had loaded over 20 kg of heroin on to a truck in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in order to offer it for sale in Italy, where the applicant had temporary residence. The applicant's conviction was based on Mr M.E.'s statements given in the pre-trial proceedings and at the trial concerning his role in the crime. Mr D.M. denied knowing the applicant.", "The applicant, who was legally represented, successfully requested a reopening of the proceedings after his return to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.", "On 23 March 2006 the trial court set aside its decision of 4 October 2004, convicted the applicant of drug trafficking and imposed the same sentence.
