He entered Denmark in 1980, when he was thirteen years old.", "Four years later, in Turkey he married a Turkish woman who remained in their country of origin. There, the spouses had a daughter in 1987 and a son in 1989.", "In 1992, the applicant\u2019s wife and his two children entered Denmark under the rules regarding family unification. In 1994 the spouses had another daughter.", "On 19 April 2002 the applicant was detained on remand, charged with sexual offences allegedly having been committed throughout the past four years against his eldest daughter as from the time when she was eleven years old.", "An indictment of 6 June 2002 was submitted to the Copenhagen City Court (K\u00f8benhavns Byret), before which the applicant, the daughter and three witnesses were heard, including a teacher in whom the daughter had confided, and a police officer who worked at the institution where the daughter had been placed. The applicant pleaded not guilty and explained among other things that he had commenced sleeping on a mattress in his daughter\u2019s bedroom some years ago, approximately every 14 days, usually in connection with him having come home from a late night out. He did not wish to wake up his wife and his youngest daughter, who slept in the spouses\u2019 bedroom. Also, he was suffering from backache, and it did him good to sleep on a flat surface. In response to the fact that a forensic examination of the sheets in his daughter\u2019s bedroom revealed sperm cells, the applicant explained that he had slept with his wife in the daughter\u2019s bedroom.", "Before the Court the daughter explained among other things that the applicant had started sleeping with her when she was eleven years old in connection with her mother having gone to Turkey for a funeral.", "The applicant\u2019s wife was called to the witness stand but declined to give testimony against her husband.

This I promise\u201d. Also, it was found established that he had sent her an SMS in which he threatened to come and \u201cfuck her\u201d if she did not call him within 10 minutes.", "The applicant was sentenced to 3 years\u2019 imprisonment. Furthermore, pursuant to section 22 (ii) and (vi) of the Aliens Act (Udl\u00e6ndingeloven) he was expelled from Denmark forever. As to the latter the court noted on the one hand that the applicant had entered Denmark when he was 13 years old, that he had lived there for 21 years, and that his father and three siblings also lived in Denmark. On the other hand the court noted the seriousness and the nature of the crime, that the applicant\u2019s mother and five siblings lived in Turkey, that the applicant had maintained strong contact with them and that almost every year he had spent his vacation in Turkey.", "On 31 October 2002, on appeal, the judgment was upheld by the High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret), before which the applicant\u2019s wife agreed to testify. She confirmed that in March 1998 she had been in Turkey for sixteen days to participate in a funeral, and stated among other things that she had initiated a divorce from the applicant.", "Leave to appeal against the judgment to the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) was refused by the Leave to Appeal Board (Procesbevillingsn\u00e6vnet) on 10 January 2003.", "By judgment of 3 February 2003 the Copenhagen City Court granted the applicant\u2019s wife a divorce and awarded her custody over the three children. The applicant did not request access to any of his children.", "On 28 January 2004 the applicant was released from prison and expelled to Turkey.", "The applicant\u2019s father and brother who lived in Denmark also returned to Turkey, and the applicant\u2019s family in Turkey thus consisted of his parents and five siblings.", "In the summer of 2004 the applicant\u2019s wife went to Turkey to obtain a divorce from the applicant also according to Turkish law. It appears that the applicant objected thereto and that the proceedings thereon are still pending.", "During that summer the applicant\u2019s two youngest children visited him and his family in Turkey.", "During the summer of 2005 the applicant\u2019s son stayed with him in Turkey.", "The Aliens Act provided in so far as relevant:", "Section 22", "\u201cAn alien who has lawfully lived in Denmark for more than the last seven years, and an alien issued with a residence permit under sections 7or 8 may be expelled if:", "...", "(ii) the alien, for several criminal counts, is sentenced to minimum 2 years\u2019 imprisonment or other criminal sanction involving or allowing deprivation of liberty in respect of an offence that would have resulted in a punishment of this duration;", "...", "(vi) the alien is sentenced, pursuant to provisions in Parts XII and XIII of the Penal Code or pursuant to section 119(1) and (2), 180, 181, 183(1) and (2), 183 a, 186(1), 187(1), 192 a, section 210(1) and (3), cf. subsection (1), section 216, 222, sections 224 and 225, cf. sections 216 and 222, section 237, 245, 245 a, 246, 252(2), 261(2), section 276, cf. section 286, sections 278 to 283, cf. section 286, section 288 or 290(2) of the Penal Code, to imprisonment or other criminal sanction involving or allowing deprivation of liberty in respect of an offence that would have resulted in a punishment of this nature.", "Section 26:", "1. \u201cIn deciding on expulsion, regard must be had to the question whether expulsion must be assumed to be particularly burdensome, in particular because of:", "(i) the alien\u2019s ties with the Danish community, including whether the alien came to Denmark in his childhood or tender years;", "(ii) the duration of the alien\u2019s stay in Denmark;", "(iii) the alien\u2019s age, health, and other personal circumstances;", "(iv) the alien\u2019s ties with persons living in Denmark;", "(v) the consequences of the expulsion for the alien\u2019s close relatives livening in Denmark;", "(vi) the alien\u2019s slight or non-existent ties with his country of origin or any other country in which he may be expected to take up residence;", "(vii) the risk that, in cases other that those mentioned in section 7(1) and (2), the alien will be ill-treated in his country of origin or any other country in which he may be expected to take up residence.", "2.
