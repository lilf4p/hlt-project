The applicant, a hotel director, was suspected of a murder committed in 1994. In 1995 the murder case was struck out for lack of evidence.", "9. The applicant was arrested on 8 February 1996. On the same date the Chief Police Commissioner ordered the applicant's \u201cpreventive detention\u201d (prevencinis sulaikymas) for sixty days on the authorisation of the Deputy Prosecutor General. On 9 February 1996 a judge of the Vilnius Regional Court confirmed the preventive detention order. The order referred to a general provision of Article 50-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure then in force which permitted preventive detention in connection with banditry, criminal association and intimidation. The applicant appealed against his arrest, claiming, inter alia, that he had not been informed of the reason for his detention or of any charge against him. On 19 February 1996 a judge of the Vilnius Regional Court dismissed the appeal. No specific charge was brought against the applicant in the above decision. No investigation was carried out in connection with his preventive detention.", "10. On 8 March 1996 the murder case was reopened. The applicant was charged, as a principal offender, with murder with aggravating circumstances. He was accused of organising the unlawful punishment of the alleged thief of his car, who had died as a result. Among the five accused persons in the case were three police officers who had allegedly handed over the arrested victim to the applicant.", "11. On 14 March 1996 the Deputy Prosecutor General, by reference to Article 104 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, authorised the applicant's detention on remand on suspicion of murder. His detention was authorised until 4 June 1996.", "12. On 27 March 1996 the applicant was questioned. On 22 April 1996 he submitted an application to the prosecution, claiming that there was no evidence to suspect him of having committed or prepared an offence, and that his preventive detention and subsequent detention on remand were incompatible with domestic criminal procedure and Article 5 of the Convention. On 24 April 1996 the Chief Prosecutor of Panev\u0117\u017eys Region dismissed the application on the ground that the applicant's detention could be justified merely by the gravity of the alleged offence.", "13. On 17 May 1996 the applicant submitted an application to the Prosecutor General, again arguing that there was no reasonable suspicion against him, and that his detention infringed his rights under Article 5 of the Convention. On 21 May 1996 a regional prosecutor dismissed the application. On 4 June 1996 a renewed application by the applicant's representative was rejected by the Chief Prosecutor of the Panev\u0117\u017eys Region.", "14. The pre-trial investigation was concluded on 29 May 1996. From 30 May to 10 June 1996 the applicant and his counsel were given access to the case file. The other defendants in the case had access to the file until 14 June 1996.", "15. The applicant, after consulting the case file, submitted an application to the prosecution, arguing that the charge and detention were ill-founded. On 11 June 1996 a prosecutor of the Panev\u0117\u017eys Regional Prosecutor's Office dismissed the application, stating that the case file as a whole contained sufficient evidence of the applicant's guilt.", "16. On 13 June 1996 the prosecutor informed the authorities of the prison in which the applicant was remanded that his detention was \u201cautomatically extended until 14 June 1996\u201d pursuant to former Article 226 \u00a7 6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and that the case had been transmitted to the Chief Prosecutor of the Panev\u0117\u017eys Region to confirm the bill of indictment. No decision on the applicant's detention on remand was taken.", "17. On 24 June 1996 the Chief Prosecutor of the Panev\u0117\u017eys Region wrote to the prison authorities, informing them that the murder case had been transmitted to the Panev\u0117\u017eys Regional Court, and that the applicant's detention had been valid. No decision as to the detention was taken.", "18. On 1 July 1996 the Panev\u0117\u017eys Regional Court informed the prison authorities that a court hearing would be held on 31 July 1996 and that directions for the trial of the applicant and his co-accused would be given. No formal order as to the applicant's detention on remand was issued.", "19. On 31 July 1996, at the directions hearing, a judge of the Panev\u0117\u017eys Regional Court decided that the applicant's detention on remand \u201cshould remain unchanged\u201d. The judge did not mention any other aspects concerning the lawfulness of the applicant's detention. The applicant's counsel was present at the hearing.", "20. The trial started before the Panev\u0117\u017eys Regional Court on 3 September 1996. On 9 September the examination of the case was adjourned in order to collect further material evidence.", "21. From 14 to 16 October 1996 the Regional Court heard the case in the presence of the applicant and his lawyer. On 16 October 1996 the court decided that the applicant was to remain in custody. No other aspects of the lawfulness of the applicant's detention on remand were mentioned in the decision. The term of the applicant's detention was extended to 15 February 1997. The court also ordered additional investigative measures.", "22. On 28 October 1996 the applicant appealed against that decision to the Court of Appeal. He also lodged applications with the Prosecutor General, the prison authorities, and the Ombudsman. The applicant claimed that the Regional Court's decision to detain him had not been valid, because it had simply prolonged a non-existent decision on detention which had expired on 4 June 1996. The applicant stated, inter alia, that Article 20 of the Lithuanian Constitution and Article 5 of the Convention had been infringed to his detriment.", "23. On 21 November 1996 the Ombudsman drew the attention of the Minister of the Interior, the Prosecutor General, the Director of the Prison Department and the prison governor to the fact that, in his view, the applicant \u201chad been remanded in custody unlawfully from 14 June 1996 until 31 July 1996, in breach of Article 20 of the Constitution ... and Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention\u201d.", "24. On 25 November 1996 the applicant renewed his appeal against his detention.", "25. On 27 November 1996 the Court of Appeal disallowed the appeal by reference to Article 372 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as it was worded at the time. In its letter to the applicant, the Court of Appeal admitted that the lower judges had \u201cpossibly\u201d erred in law in deciding the question of his detention, but it noted that no appeal lay against their decisions.", "26. On the same date, on appeal by the prosecution against the Panev\u0117\u017eys Regional Court's decision of 16 October 1996, the Court of Appeal quashed the decision to order additional investigative measures in the case. The applicant appealed.", "27. On 30 November 1996 the applicant lodged an application against his detention with the President of the Supreme Court. On 30 December 1996 the President of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court informed the applicant that the application could not be examined. He admitted that the applicant \u201cwas remanded in custody from 4 June 1996 to 31 July 1996 without the remand measure being extended\u201d. He emphasised, however, that the \u201cground of appeal cannot overturn the provision of law according to which a decision ordering, varying or extending a remand measure (Article 372 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure) ... cannot be the subject of an appeal\u201d.", "28. On 14 January 1997 the Supreme Court amended the Court of Appeal's decision of 27 November 1996 quashing the Panev\u0117\u017eys Regional Court's decision of 16 October 1996 to order additional investigative measures. The Supreme Court also decided that a bench of three judges rather than a single judge should consider the merits of the murder case.", "29. The applicant instituted civil proceedings against the prison authorities for keeping him in detention without any formal order. On 26 February 1997 a judge of the \u0160iauliai District Court dismissed the action. The judge held that the prison's actions had been based on \u201cthe authorisation of the prosecutor, and letters containing information about the extension of the detention, and decisions of the judge and court\u201d. On 28 April 1997 the \u0160iauliai Regional Court upheld the decision of the District Court.", "30. The applicant applied for bail on health grounds. On 17 March 1997 the Panev\u0117\u017eys Regional Court dismissed the application. The trial was again adjourned and additional investigations ordered until 28 April 1997, when the case was referred back to court. The trial resumed on 26 May 1997.", "31. On 9 June 1997 the Panev\u0117\u017eys Regional Court acquitted the applicant on all charges for lack of evidence. He was released from custody.", "32. The prosecution and the other defendants in the case appealed against the first-instance judgment. On 27 August 1997 the Court of Appeal quashed the judgment of the Regional Court. The case was referred back to the prosecution for further investigation.", "33. On 22 October 1997 a prosecutor of the Panev\u0117\u017eys Regional Prosecutor's Office informed the applicant that the criminal proceedings against him had been discontinued by a decision of 21 October 1997.", "34.
