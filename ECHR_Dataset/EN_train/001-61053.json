FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses partial award - domestic proceedings;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["8. The applicant was born in 1931 and lives in Saintes (Charente-Maritime). He is a winegrower.", "9. On 19 May 1993 plans for improving a major road on the edge of the Saintes urban area were declared to be in the public interest. Completion of this operation required the expropriation of various plots of land, including twenty-one hectares belonging to the applicant. The expropriation liability order was issued on 5 September 1994.", "10. On 12 September 1994 the expropriations judge for the d\u00e9partement of Charente-Maritime issued an expropriation order giving rise to a transfer of ownership.", "On 28 September 1994, in the absence of an agreement between the applicant and the State as the expropriating authority (represented by Mr H., an inspector from the Charente-Maritime Revenue Department) on the amount of compensation to be paid, the latter applied to the expropriations judge. In an order of the same day the expropriations judge for the d\u00e9partement of Charente-Maritime set 4 November 1994 as the date for the site inspection and stated that the public hearing would be held immediately afterwards.", "On 3 November 1994 Mr P., Deputy Director of the Charente-Maritime Revenue Department, filed submissions in his capacity as Government Commissioner. The applicant\u2019s lawyer then requested an adjournment because of the lateness of these submissions. The hearing was accordingly fixed for 18 November 1994.", "In a judgment of 9 December 1994, having heard the applicant, Mr H., the State\u2019s representative in the proceedings, and Mr P., the Government Commissioner, the expropriations judge assessed the compensation payable by the State at 1,441,517 French francs (FRF).", "11. On 5 January 1995 the applicant appealed against this decison and filed a memorial with the Expropriations Division of the Poitiers Court of Appeal, in which he assessed the amount of compensation due at FRF 3,763,698.", "On 13 April 1995 the Charente-Maritime Revenue Department filed a memorial in reply, signed by Mr H., in which it asked that the decision be upheld; a sheet of paper entitled \u201cStudy of the local property market\u201d, listing thirteen contracts of sale and one judgment, was appended. On 24 April 1995 the applicant\u2019s representative wrote to the signee of the memorial, requesting that he send a full copy of the contracts and decisions cited. In a letter of 18 July 1995 the Deputy Director of the Charente-Maritime Revenue Department, Mr P., refused to produce the documents on the ground that tax officials were bound by a duty of professional confidentiality.", "On 17 August 1995 the applicant\u2019s counsel replied to the Deputy Director of the Revenue Department as follows:", "\u201c... it is regrettable that almost three months were required to send a brief reply to a standard request for production of documents, dated 24 April 1995, even though the case is due to be heard on 22 September. This aside, you are mistaken in failing to distinguish between your roles as Director of the Revenue Department and as representative of the expropriating authority in legal proceedings brought in application of the Decree of 11 December 1973 \u2013 Article R. 179 of the Code of State Property.", "In this latter capacity, you are obliged to respect the fundamental principle of adversarial proceedings and the provisions of the new Code of Civil Procedure which impose a basic obligation on the parties to produce the evidence to which they refer. This principle also applies when you are acting in your capacity as Government Commissioner, which for the moment poses no further difficulties. I might add that had your memorial contained, as a minimum, sufficient indications to enable me to order the contracts from the land registry, I would have refrained from asking you to produce these documents.", "I am therefore obliged to ask the court ... to order discovery of the documents which you refer to, unless the court prefers purely and simply to discount this evidence, which would mean that it would rule only on the basis of my own terms of comparison ...\u201d", "On 4 September 1995 Mr P., standing in for the Director of the Vienne Revenue Department in his capacity as Government Commissioner, lodged submissions in support of a cross-appeal with a view to the hearing before the Expropriations Division of the Court of Appeal (initially set for 22 September 1995, the hearing was subsequently postponed at the applicant\u2019s request until 24 May 1996); he assessed the compensation in issue at FRF 1,396,267.", "The applicant filed a memorial in reply, referring in particular to an infringement of his right to a fair trial in the following terms:", "\u201c...", "In the present case, the Director of the Revenue Department representing the expropriating authority and the Director of the Revenue Department acting as Government Commissioner are one and the same person, even if, for form\u2019s sake, the Director of the Revenue Department is represented by two separate individuals, which is a fiction, since, as we have seen, the same person replied to the expropriated party\u2019s counsel on behalf of the expropriating authority and also signed the Government\u2019s Commissioner\u2019s submissions.", "It follows that the Director of the Revenue Department may take part in the present proceedings only in his capacity as the State\u2019s representative or in his capacity as Government Commissioner, and may not combine the two roles. Otherwise, the parties do not enjoy a fair trial within the meaning of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights ...\u201d", "According to the Government, the registry of the Expropriations Division informed the applicant and the Director of the Revenue Department within the Property Department, in letters dated 9 May 1996, of further grounds of appeal lodged on the same day by the Government Commissioner.", "12. In a judgment of 21 June 1996 the Expropriations Division of the Poitiers Court of Appeal established the compensation amount at FRF 1,542,867. It held that the applicant\u2019s request that the court dismiss the intervention by the Director of the Revenue Department in his capacity as Government Commissioner was ill-founded. The judgment stated:", "\u201c... The [applicant\u2019s] criticisms of the Director of the Revenue Department\u2019s activities and of the dual nature of his functions are unfounded because:", "(i) The Director of the Revenue Department\u2019s twofold status as Government Commissioner and ... representative of the expropriating authority does not amount to a defect; despite the strangeness of this situation, there is nothing to prevent the Director of the Revenue Department representing the expropriating authority and simultaneously assuming the functions of Government Commissioner.", "(ii) The Director of the Revenue Department\u2019s joint role as Government Commissioner and representative of the expropriating authority does not deny the expropriated party a fair trial provided that the Government Commissioner does not participate in the decision-making process within the expropriations court.", "(iii) In any event, in the specific case of this appeal, two Directors of Revenue Departments intervened, namely the Director of the Charente-Maritime Revenue Department, representing the State, and the Director of the Vienne Revenue Department as the Government Commissioner (see the appointments of substitutes dated 25 August 1995 and 2 May 1996 in the case file).", "Consequently, the [applicant\u2019s] claims on the basis of Article 6 of the Convention ... must be rejected.", "...", "As regards the [applicant\u2019s] request that the State provide him with a copy of the contracts and judgments referred to as terms of comparison, and in the light of the adversarial principle, it seems initially that this request is admissible since it is not \u2018a new ground which was not raised at first instance\u2019 but new claims intended to secure dismissal of the other party\u2019s claims (Article 654 of the New Code of Civil Procedure);", "However, this request [by the applicant] ... must be rejected since the information provided is sufficient to allow identification of the property sold and the price agreed upon together with free discussion of their value as evidence;", "...\u201d", "13. The applicant appealed on points of law, alleging in particular that there had been a violation of his right to a fair trial. He submitted that it was not necessary for a party to participate in the decision-making process for its intervention to be considered a violation of Article 6 of the Convention, and complained that the Government Commissioner had been the last to speak, after the expropriated party, and that the latter had had no opportunity to reply. The applicant also complained that the Court of Appeal had dismissed his request for production of copies of the terms of comparison cited by the Government Commissioner.", "On 8 April 1998 the Court of Cassation dismissed this appeal on the following grounds:", "\u201c... Firstly, the judgment correctly accepts that, since Article 6 of the Convention ... is not applicable, in that the Government Commissioner does not take part in the Expropriations Division\u2019s decision-making process, it is not necessary to find his intervention inadmissible.", "Secondly, there is no text prohibiting the parties from replying to the submissions made by the Government Commissioner at the hearing.", "...", "The Court of Appeal justified its decision in law ... by accepting in the exercise of its unfettered discretion that the information provided had been sufficient to enable identification of the property sold and the price agreed upon together with free discussion of their value as evidence.", "...\u201d", "14. In a number of d\u00e9partements, including Charente-Maritime, the Revenue Department is the sole authority empowered to carry out purchases of real property, real-property rights or businesses, by agreement or through compulsory purchase orders, on behalf of all the State\u2019s public, civil or military bodies (Article R. 176 of the Code of State Property). In the expropriation proceedings for which it is consequently responsible, it carries out, on behalf of the expropriating authority, \u201call the acts incumbent on the latter\u201d (Article R. 178 of the same Code). Article 179 of the Code of State Property, in the version applicable at the material time, further provides:", "\u201cIn determining compensation for expropriation, the officials of the Revenue Department appointed by order of the General Director of Revenue shall act before the Expropriations Divisions on behalf of the State\u2019s expropriating bodies.", "...", "The appointments provided for in this Article shall not apply to the officials mentioned in [Article 13-7 of the Expropriations Code].\u201d", "15. The relevant provisions of the Expropriations Code are worded as follows:", "\u201cFailing agreement between the parties, compensation shall be determined by an expropriations judge appointed for each d\u00e9partement from among the judges who are members of a tribunal de grande instance.\u201d", "\u201cNo objection may be filed against judgments given at first instance.", "An appeal lies to the court of appeal within a period of fifteen days from service of judgments given in application of Chapter III.\u201d", "\u201cAn extract of the judgment shall be notified at the request of the most diligent party.", "It may be referred to the Court of Cassation. Appeals on points of law shall be brought, investigated and tried in accordance with the procedure provided for in Section II of Title II of Law no. 47-1366 of 23 July 1947.\u201d", "\u201cThe Director of the Revenue Department (Property) of the d\u00e9partement in which the Expropriations Division is based shall exercise the function of Government Commissioner before this Division.", "The Director of the Revenue Department (Property) may appoint officials from his Department as his substitute in the role of Government Commissioner before the court mentioned in Article R.13-1.", "Before the Chamber dealing with the appeal, he may be substituted either by Directors of Revenue Departments (Property) from other d\u00e9partements within the court of appeal\u2019s territorial jurisdiction, or by officials from the Revenue Department (Property) whom he shall appoint specifically for this purpose.\u201d", "\u201cCases brought before the courts cited in Articles L. 13-1 and L. 13-22 shall not be transmitted to State Counsel\u2019s Office if the latter\u2019s presence is not required at the hearing.\u201d", "\u201cBefore the Chamber dealing with the appeal, State Counsel may nevertheless ask to see the file in all cases where he believes that his Office should be represented. In such an event, he may attend the hearing in order to lodge those submissions which he considers necessary, without prejudice to those of the Government Commissioner.\u201d", "\u201cFailing agreement between the parties within one month of receiving notification of the expropriating authority\u2019s offers ... the case may be referred to the expropriations judge by the more diligent party under the conditions set out in Article L. 13-4.", "...\u201d", "\u201cA copy of the order fixing the date and time for inspection of the site shall be sent to the expropriating authority by the registrar of the court, with a view to its communication to the interested parties and to the Government Commissioner.", "If the case is referred to the judge by the expropriated party, the parties shall be notified directly by the registrar of the date of the site inspection.", "The registrar shall append a copy of the memorials and other documents in his possession to the notification sent to the Government Commissioner.", "The parties and the Government Commissioner must be informed at least fifteen days in advance of the date of the site inspection.", "The visit to the site shall be conducted in their presence. A report shall be produced on the inspection.\u201d", "\u201cThe judge may not appoint experts.", "In order to assess the value of non-transferable real property and immovable property which present particular valuation difficulties, he may exceptionally be assisted during the inspection of the site by a notary or retired notary appointed from a list drawn up for the whole area within the court of appeal\u2019s territorial jurisdiction by its president, on the basis of proposals from the regional Chamber of Notaries.", "Exceptionally, he may also appoint a person whom he considers suitably qualified to provide advice in the event of technical problems concerning the assessment of compensation sums other than those referred to in the preceding paragraph.\u201d", "\u201cThe public hearing shall be held on completion of the inspection of the site.", "At the latest during this inspection, the judge shall inform the parties or their representative, as well as the Government Commissioner, of the place and time of the hearing, which may take place outside the premises in which the court sits.\u201d", "\u201cThe judge shall hear the representative of the expropriating authority and the expropriated parties ...

Intervention by the State official responsible for property as representative of the expropriating authority, under the Decree of 12 July 1967, and simultaneously as Government Commissioner, in application of Article R. 13-7, paragraphs 1 and 3, of the Expropriations Code, does not constitute a ground for alleging procedural impropriety (Paris Court of Appeal, Expropriations Chamber, judgment of 30 January 1981). In addition, the Court of Cassation has ruled that the fact that the Government Commissioner\u2019s role was assumed by the inspector of property who drew up the preliminary opinion assessing the compensation offers on behalf of the expropriating authority does not contravene Article 6 of the Convention, in that the Government Commissioner does not take part in the Expropriations Division\u2019s decision-making process (Third Civil Division, judgment of 21 October 1992, St\u00e9 Rivom c.
