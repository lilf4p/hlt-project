The applicant, Mrs Di\u0101na Ploti\u0146a, is a Latvian national who was born in 1975 and lives in Jelgava District. She was represented before the Court by Mr T. Klauberg, a lawyer practising in R\u012bga. The Latvian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mrs I. Reine.", "2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "3. On 5 September 1992 the applicant was staying in a caf\u00e9 in Jelgava. On the premises there was also a certain K, who at the material time was an employee of the Security Service of the Republic of Latvia (Latvijas Republikas Dro\u0161\u012bbas Dienests). K gave his gun to a private person, P, assuring him that the gun was unloaded. However, there was one bullet left in the barrel and the gun fired while P was examining it. Accidentally, the applicant was hit by the bullet. As a result of the injuries, she had to undergo several operations and rehabilitation procedures and was granted the status of a person with a second-degree disability. On the same day a prosecutor of the Jelgava Regional Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office opened criminal proceedings in this connection.", "1. Criminal proceedings against K", "4. On 28 October 1992 K was charged with carelessly storing a firearm, under Article 220 of the Criminal Code. The charge was not presented to K as he did not appear at the prosecutor\u2019s office.", "5. In 1992 the Jelgava Regional Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office decided to separate the criminal case against P from the case against K, who had left Latvia in the meantime and had gone to Belarus without the permission of the prosecutor in charge of the case. The pre-trial investigation against K was stayed and he was put on the wanted-persons list.", "6. On 10 September 1997 and 23 February 1998 the applicant complained to the Presiding Prosecutor of Jelgava City about the lack of progress in the investigation of the criminal case against K.", "7. On 3 March 1998 the Jelgava Police Department informed the applicant that K was not wanted by the police any longer. K had been on the wanted-persons list from 12 November 1992 to 1 March 1993. It was established that he was living in Belarus and his extradition had to be decided by the Prosecutor General.", "8. On 20 April 1998 the applicant applied to the Prosecutor General, complaining about the lack of progress in the investigation of the criminal case against K and requesting him to take a decision concerning his extradition.", "9. On 21 May 1998 the Prosecutor General informed the applicant that K was residing in Belarus and the Jelgava City Prosecutor\u2019s Office had requested the Belarusian Embassy to provide information concerning his citizenship. Thereafter it could be decided whether to request the extradition of K or to transfer the proceedings to the Public Prosecutor of Belarus. In addition, the Jelgava City Prosecutor\u2019s Office was requested to speed up the investigation.", "10. On 9 April 1999, upon the applicant\u2019s complaint, the Prosecutor General informed her that the relevant information concerning K\u2019s citizenship had not yet been received. The Jelgava City Prosecutor\u2019s Office was requested to speed up the investigation.", "11. On 29 November 2000, upon the applicant\u2019s complaint of 20 October 2000, the Prosecutor General informed her that the case against K had been closed on 6 April 1999 having regard to the statute of limitations. This decision was quashed and the case returned for additional investigation. The Presiding Prosecutor of Jelgava City was requested to establish whether K could be held liable as a State official because of his previous employment with the Security Service and to conduct the investigation by 20 December 2000.", "12. On 27 December 2000 the Jelgava City Prosecutor\u2019s Office informed the applicant that, in order to proceed with the criminal case against K, additional investigation was necessary.", "13. On 29 March 2001 a prosecutor of the Jelgava City Prosecutor\u2019s Office decided to close the criminal case against K. He acknowledged the accuracy of the events of 5 September 1992 and the status of K at the time, as established in the course of the pre-trial investigation. The prosecutor noted that on 8 September 1992 K had been dismissed from the Security Service for infringement of service discipline. The prosecutor considered that K had not misused his official position on 5 September 1992 and that he could not therefore be held liable in accordance with Article 162 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code. According to the prosecutor, K could be formally held liable under Article 220 of the Criminal Code as he, when giving his gun to P, being convinced that it was unloaded, had failed to examine the barrel. The prosecutor also established that on 24 December 1992 the registration of K\u2019s domicile in Latvia had been deleted. The prosecutor decided to close the case, in accordance with Article 53 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, taking into consideration the facts that K had been punished at a disciplinary level, that he was residing abroad, that 8 years had passed since the incident and that \u2013 although he had committed a criminal offence provided for in the Criminal Code \u2013 he personally had not caused a degree of harm such as to justify criminal punishment.", "14. On 23 November 2001 a prosecutor of the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office quashed the decision of the prosecutor of the Jelgava City Prosecutor\u2019s Office of 29 March 2001 as unsubstantiated, and decided to close the criminal case against K having regard to the statute of limitations. She also established that K had committed a criminal offence under Article 220 of the Criminal Code and that he could not be found liable for the criminal offence provided for in Article 162 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code. In the accompanying letter, the prosecutor informed the applicant that any material issues had to be dealt with in civil proceedings.", "2. Criminal proceedings against P", "15.

On 3 December 1992 the Jelgava City Court found P guilty of unintentional grievous bodily harm and sentenced him to eight months\u2019 imprisonment.

The court acknowledged that the first-instance court had not taken into consideration, when it sentenced P, that he had been sentenced previously for another criminal offence and he had not served the sentence at that time.", "23. On 6 May 1993 P was released after having served his sentence.", "24. On 10 May 1993 the Jelgava City Court received the decision of the Supreme Court of 19 April 1993.", "25.
