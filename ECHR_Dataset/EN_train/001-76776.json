CROATIA", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant, Mr Nikola Gavella, is a Croatian national who was born in 1937 and lives in Zagreb. He was represented before the Court by Mrs I. K. Vuceli\u0107, a lawyer practising in Zagreb. The Croatian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mrs \u0160. Sta\u017enik.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "On 1 January 1997 the Act on the Restitution of and Compensation for Property Expropriated during the Yugoslav Communist Regime (\u201cthe Denationalisation Act\u201d) entered into force.", "Pursuant to section 22 of the Denationalisation Act, nationalised flats in respect of which third persons had acquired specially protected tenancies (stanarsko pravo) were not to be restored to their former owners. The tenants had a right to purchase such flats from the Fund for the Restitution of and Compensation for Expropriated Property (Fond za naknadu oduzete imovine \u2013 \u201cthe Fund\u201d) under favourable conditions set out in the Specially Protected Tenancies (Sale to Occupier) Act. At the same time, the former owners or their heirs were entitled to financial compensation in respect of the flats.", "In addition, section 29 of the Denationalisation Act provided that, in the event of subsequent \u201cdisposal in rem\u201d of flats purchased by such tenants, the former owners had the right of pre-emption (pravo prvokupa). In such cases, the new owner (the former tenant) was obliged to offer it first to the former owner for the same price as he or she had paid to the Fund. If the former owner accepted the offer and concluded a contract of sale with the new owner, he or she had to pay the Fund the difference between the sale price and the amount of financial compensation previously received.", "Pursuant to section 29 (2) of the Denationalisation Act, the right of pre-emption was to be noted (zabilje\u017eba) in the land register on the basis of a mandatory clause to be inserted into every contract of sale concluded between a tenant and the Fund.", "Three residential buildings in the centre of Zagreb had been owned by the applicant's family and were nationalised during the Communist regime.", "On 2 February and 29 March 2001 respectively, the Office for Property Affairs of the City of Zagreb (Grad Zagreb, Gradski ured za imovinskopravne poslove) issued two decisions finding that the applicant, as the sole heir of his late mother, E.G., was entitled to financial compensation in the amount of 2,763,164 Croatian kunas in respect of 27 flats situated in the nationalised buildings. Twenty-five percent of the compensation was to be paid within six months of the decisions becoming final, while the rest was to be paid in State bonds in 40 twice-yearly instalments over the period between 1 January 2000 and 1 July 2019.", "The applicant submitted that he had renounced his pre-emption rights in respect of five of the flats.", "In 1996 24 members of the upper house of Parliament \u2013 the House of Counties (\u017dupanijski dom Sabora Republike Hrvatske) \u2013 lodged an application with the Constitutional Court challenging the constitutionality of the Denationalisation Act (application for abstract constitutional review \u2013 zahtjev za ocjenu ustavnosti) under section 13 of the 1991 Constitutional Act on the Constitutional Court (\u201cthe 1991 Constitutional Court Act\u201d).", "In addition, in the period between 1996 and 1999, the Constitutional Court received 64 petitions lodged by various individuals requesting the institution of proceedings to review the constitutionality of the Denationalisation Act (petition for abstract constitutional review \u2013 prijedlog za ocjenu ustavnosti) under section 15 of the 1991 Constitutional Court Act.", "On 21 April 1999 the Constitutional Court delivered a single decision on the above application and petitions. It quashed certain provisions of the Denationalisation Act as unconstitutional. Among other provisions, the Constitutional Court quashed section 29 (1), which provided for pre-emption rights for former owners. As a result, the applicant lost his right of pre-emption.", "The Constitutional Court held that the constitutionally protected right to ownership included the right to dispose of a property, which meant, inter alia, the right to sell it at a contracted (market) price. Since the statutory right of pre-emption restricted the right of disposal, thereby placing a limitation on the constitutional right of ownership, that limitation had to meet the aim which it sought to achieve. The aim of the right of pre-emption was to protect former owners and the legal order against any unjustifiable profit which the new owner of a flat (the former tenant) might make by selling it at the market price (having previously bought it from the Fund at a significantly lower price). However, it was not necessary to provide for the right of pre-emption in perpetuity in order to meet that aim. Instead, the aim could have been achieved by imposing a reasonable time-limit. A perpetual right of pre-emption was not proportionate to the aim pursued, and therefore constituted an excessive restriction on the rights of current owners, hampering even socially desirable disposal of property (aimed, for example, at meeting the housing needs of the owner's immediate family members) and paralysing real property transactions to a significant extent.", "In addition, section 29 (1) was found to be contrary to the principle of legal certainty and thereby to the rule of law, on account of the vague and imprecise nature of the terms used. In particular, it was not clear whether the right of pre-emption in question constituted a right in rem or in personam (and if the latter was the case, whether it existed for the lifetime of the former or the current owner). Moreover, the Constitutional Court held that the use of the term \u201cdisposal in rem\u201d (which, apart from sale, could involve other forms of alienation and mortgaging of the property) to describe an event triggering the former owner's right of pre-emption, was inconsistent with the other provisions of the Denationalisation Act, which used the term \u201csale\u201d to describe the same event.", "The Constitutional Court deferred the effects of its decision by giving the legislature one year to comply with the decision and enact amendments to the Denationalisation Act to replace the unconstitutional provisions. The quashed provisions were to lose their legal force with the entry into force of the envisaged amendments, but no later than one year from the date of publication of the court's decision. The decision was published in the Official Gazette on 23 April 1999.", "Following several requests by the Government, the Constitutional Court extended this time-limit on five occasions. The time-limit was finally set at 1 July 2002.", "On 5 July 2002 Parliament adopted amendments to the Denationalisation Act (\u201cthe Amendments\u201d) which entered into force on the same day. Section 4 of the Amendments repealed sections 29, 30 and 31 of the Denationalisation Act, that is, the provisions providing for pre-emption rights for former owners.", "Parliament did not accept the Government's bill, which provided for pre-emption rights for former owners in the event of a flat's subsequent sale, donation or exchange, for a period of fifteen years. It considered that the proposed solution would result in an undesirable stalemate whereby the current owner would have no incentive to sell his or her flat, and therefore making it impossible for former owners to make use of their right of pre-emption. If adopted, the bill would impose an excessive burden on the current owners while not benefiting the former owners. Moreover, since property transactions concerning these flats would be paralysed, it would deprive the State of the taxation revenue from such transactions.", "On 19 August 2002 the applicant requested the Constitutional Court to institute proceedings to review the constitutionality of the Amendments (petition for abstract constitutional review), arguing that they were in breach of the Constitution. The Constitutional Court has not yet decided on the applicant's petition.", "The relevant provisions of the 1990 Croatian Constitution (Ustav Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette nos. 56/1990, 135/97, 113/2000 and 28/2001) read as follows:", "\u201cRights and freedoms may be restricted only by law, in order to protect the rights and freedoms of others, the legal order, public morals or public health.\u201d", "\u201c1.
