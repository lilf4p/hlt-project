The applicants were born in 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1947 respectively and live in Baku.", "6. On 4 April 2001 the applicants founded a public association named \u201cAssistance to the Human Rights Protection of the Homeless and Vulnerable Residents of Baku\u201d (\u201cEvsiz v\u0259 M\u0259zlum Bak\u0131l\u0131lar\u0131n \u0130nsan H\u00fcquqlar\u0131n\u0131n M\u00fcdafi\u0259sin\u0259 Yard\u0131m\u201d \u0130ctimai Birliyi). This was a non-profit organisation aimed at providing aid to the homeless and protection of their interests.", "7. On 9 April 2001 the applicants filed a request for the association's state registration with the Ministry of Justice (hereinafter also referred to as the \u201cMinistry\u201d), the government authority responsible for the state registration of legal entities. According to the Government, this request was filed on 12 April 2001. Under the domestic law, a non-governmental organisation acquired the status of a legal entity only upon its state registration by the Ministry.", "8. On 18 May 2001 the Ministry returned the registration documents to the applicants \u201cwithout taking any action\u201d, i.e. without issuing a state registration certificate or an official refusal to register the association. In the cover letter, the Ministry noted that the association's charter did not comply with Article 6 of the Law On Non-Governmental Organisations, because it did not include a provision on the territorial area of the association's activity.", "9. The applicants redrafted the charter in line with the Ministry's comments and on 4 June 2001 filed the second registration request, submitting a new version of the charter. On 10 September 2001 the Ministry responded with another refusal, stating that the charter was once again not in compliance with the requirements of the Law On Non-Governmental Organisations. Specifically, it failed to provide for the terms of office of the association's supervisory board, as required by Article 25.1 of that Law.", "10. The applicants again revised the charter and on 2 October 2001 submitted their third registration request.", "11. Having not received any response to their third registration request for several months, on 22 May 2002 the applicants applied to the Yasamal District Court, complaining that the Ministry \u201cevaded\u201d registering their organisation and asking the court to oblige the Ministry to register it. They also demanded moral compensation in the amount of 25,000,000 Azerbaijani manats (AZM).", "12. On 5 July 2002 the Ministry sent a letter to the court, informing that the documents were again returned \u201cwith no action taken\u201d by the Ministry. This time the reason for declining the registration was the applicants' failure to include in the charter the conditions for membership in the association, as required by Article 10.3 of the Law On Non-Governmental Organisations.", "13. On 15 July 2002 the Yasamal District Court dismissed the applicants' claim, finding nothing unlawful in the actions of the Ministry. The court found that the association's charter had not been drafted in accordance with the requirements of the domestic law.", "14. The applicants appealed. On 19 September 2002 the Court of Appeal upheld the district court's judgment. On 20 November 2002 the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal's decision.", "15. In the meantime, the applicants once again re-drafted the organisation's charter according to the Ministry's latest comments and on 29 July 2002 submitted their fourth registration request. Having not received a reply within the statutory five-day period, they filed a new lawsuit with the Yasamal District Court, claiming that the Ministry committed repeated procedural violations and unlawfully delayed the examination of their registration request.", "16. The representatives of the Ministry argued in the court that the examination of the applicants' registration request was delayed due to the heavy workload of the Ministry's Department of State Registration of Legal Entities.", "17. On 5 September 2002 the Yasamal District Court issued a procedural decision (q\u0259rardad) on \u201cleaving the claim without examination\u201d, i.e. declaring the applicant's lawsuit inadmissible. The court noted that the applicants' registration request was still pending examination with the Ministry of Justice and that the applicant had filed the lawsuit without exhausting extrajudicial resolution of the matter. On 1 November 2002 the Court of Appeal and on 13 January 2003 the Supreme Court upheld this decision.", "18. While the second lawsuit was still examined on appeal, the applicants, having not received any answer from the Ministry by December 2002, filed another lawsuit, asking the court to provide legal interpretation as to whether the Ministry had a right under the domestic law to delay and decline registration multiple times, and to forward the matter of constitutionality of the Ministry's actions for the consideration of the Constitutional Court. On 18 December 2002 the Yasamal District Court refused to admit the lawsuit, noting that the applicants' previous lawsuit was still under consideration on appeal. It also noted that, under the domestic law applicable at that time, a petition to forward the case to the Constitutional Court should be filed with the Supreme Court. By a final decision of 26 September 2003, the Supreme Court upheld this decision.", "19. In January 2003, about six months after the filing of the applicants' fourth registration request in July 2002, the Ministry again refused registration. It appears that, on a later unspecified date, having again redrafted the charter, the applicants re-submitted their registration request for the fifth time.", "20. At the same time, the applicants filed a new lawsuit against the Ministry's latest refusal. On 26 February 2003 the Yasamal District Court refused to admit this lawsuit, because the applicants' appeals in earlier lawsuits were still pending before the higher courts. By a final decision of 3 September 2003, the Supreme Court upheld this decision.", "21. Finally, the applicants filed an additional-cassation appeal with the President of the Supreme Court, requesting the reopening of the proceedings and referral of the case to the Plenum of the Supreme Court. By a letter of 10 November 2003, the Supreme Court's President rejected the applicants' request, finding no grounds for the reopening of the proceedings.", "22. The applicants filed a constitutional complaint against the domestic courts' judgments, claiming that a number of their constitutional rights had been violated. On 23 February 2004 the Constitutional Court admitted their complaint for examination on the merits.", "23. By a decision of 11 May 2004, the Constitutional Court found that all the judgments and decisions of the Yasamal District Court, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court were in breach of the judicial guarantees for protection of human rights and freedoms, as guaranteed by the Constitution. Specifically, the Constitutional Court noted that, in the first set of judicial proceedings, the domestic courts failed to examine the applicants' complaint thoroughly and assess the evidence objectively. In particular, in the first set of civil proceedings, the courts failed to thoroughly examine the issue of an alleged violation of the applicants'Constitutional Court found that, thus, the domestic courts violated Articles 60 and 70 (I) of the Constitution, providing for judicial guarantees of individual rights and freedoms, as well as a number of provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. It further found that, in the subsequent judicial proceedings, the domestic courts likewise violated the same provisions of the Constitution.", "24. The Constitutional Court quashed all the domestic judgments and decisions relating to the applicants' case and remitted the case to the courts of general jurisdiction for a new examination. It specifically instructed them to examine the alleged violation of the applicants' right to freedom of association guaranteed by Article 58 of the Constitution.", "25. On 18 February 2005 the Ministry of Justice, in response to the applicants' fifth registration request, registered the association and issued a state registration certificate.", "26. On the same day, the Yasamal District Court re-examined the applicants' complaint concerning the unlawful actions of the Ministry and their claim of compensation in the amount of AZM 25,000,000 for the alleged violation of their freedom of association. The court dismissed the applicants' claims, noting that, by the time of the new examination of the case, the applicants' association had already been registered and, therefore, the disputed matter had been solved. The court further held that the domestic law did not provide for compensation for moral damages in such situations.", "27. On 22 July 2005 the Court of Appeal upheld the first-instance courts' judgment. On 22 December 2005 the Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' judgments.", "28. It appears that, thereafter, the applicants filed a new lawsuit, seeking acknowledgement of a breach of domestic law by the Ministry of Justice. On 14 September 2006 the Yasamal District Court rejected this claim. Following an appeal, on 8 December 2006 the Court of Appeal found that the repeated delays by the relevant official of the Ministry of Justice in responding to the applicants' registration requests had constituted a breach of requirements of Article 9 of the Law On State Registration of Legal Entities. The court awarded three of the four applicants in the present case, Ms Ramazanova, Mr Alizadeh and Ms Ganbarova, collectively, the sum of 800 New Azerbaijani manats (AZN), which approximately equals to 705 euros (EUR), as a compensation for moral damages. This amount was to be paid by the relevant official of the Ministry of Justice responsible for the delays in the association's state registration.", "\u201cI.
