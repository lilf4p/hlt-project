On 5 March 2008 the judgment was served on the applicant.", "29. The present case was initially registered under application no. 847/04. In his application form the applicant merely complained about the refusal of the Pension Office to grant him an early pension for disabled persons and a pension on account of his reduced earning capacity.", "30.
