The hearing scheduled for 14 July 1998 was adjourned as H.P.'s counsel had died.", "14.

On 3 April 2001 the Zagreb County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Zagrebu) quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case for retrial. The appellate court found that the first-instance court had failed to establish all the relevant evidence and that H.P.'s paternity could not have been established primarily on his avoidance of DNA tests.
