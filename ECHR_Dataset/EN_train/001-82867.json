The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Cimi\u015flia.", "6. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "7. From 1986 the applicant was employed by the Bureau of Architecture, Projects and Production of the Chief Architect of Cimi\u015flia Region (\u201cthe Cimi\u015flia Bureau\u201d), a State service. In 1993 the Bureau adopted new by-laws, which were approved by the Ministry of Architecture and Construction. Under these by-laws, the Bureau was registered as an independent legal person with the rights of a State company and governed by the Regulations of State companies. It was created within the organs of local public administration and on the basis of municipal property but was financed exclusively from the income it generated from selling a variety of services to the local administration and to the population.", "8. On 16 December 1999 L\u0103pu\u015fna County Council decided to merge several bureaux, including the Cimi\u015flia Bureau, into one service at the County level. The L\u0103pu\u015fna Bureau thus became the legal successor of the Cimi\u015flia Bureau in which the applicant had worked. Before this merger, the Cimi\u015flia Bureau decided to reduce the number of personnel employed and as a result the applicant was made redundant by an order of 29 December 1999.", "9. On 12 January 2000 he acknowledged the dismissal notice in writing, as requested by law. In accordance with the relevant labour legislation, he requested redundancy payments (namely redundancy compensation worth one month's average salary, his average monthly salary during the three months when he would be looking for a new job, payment for unused leave for 1999 and payment of his salary for December 1999 and part of January 2000).", "10. The employer refused to pay because it had set aside no money for redundancy payments. According to a certificate issued by the Cimi\u015flia employment office on 9 June 2000, the applicant had been unemployed from 21 January 2000 to the date of the issue of the certificate.", "11. The applicant initiated court proceedings, claiming redundancy payments, namely one month's salary on dismissal, the continuing payment of his salary for the three subsequent months when he would be looking for another job and monetary compensation for untaken leave. On 5 July 2000 the Cimi\u015flia District Court partly accepted his claims. He appealed and the Cahul Regional Court quashed that judgment, ordering a full re-hearing of the case.", "12. On 27 April 2001 the Cimi\u015flia District Court rejected all his claims as unfounded.", "13. On 14 August 2001 the Cahul Regional Court upheld that judgment. It found, among other things, that the applicant had missed the two-month deadline for making his claim against the Cimi\u015flia Bureau, since the decision to reorganise the bureau had been published in January 2000 and the complaint had been lodged in May 2000.", "14. Notwithstanding the fact that the applicant had missed the above-mentioned time-limit, on 26 April 2002 the Court of Appeal examined the substance of his appeal and upheld the judgment of the Regional Court. The court reasoned that no compensation was due because the Cimi\u015flia Bureau, in which the applicant had worked, was self-financed; it had not set aside any resources for compensation but had distributed all the money obtained from its activity to its employees, after paying taxes. Since it had been an independent legal person, its legal successor, the L\u0103pu\u015fna Bureau, could not be held liable for any outstanding debts. The court also found that the applicant had not offered any new services after October 1999 and thus could not claim his salary for November-December 1999. He had been warned in April 1999 of impending dismissal and instructed to complete all outstanding work by 29 December 1999. Finally, the court found that he had not registered with the L\u0103pu\u015fna employment office as unemployed and could therefore not claim redundancy compensation.", "15.
