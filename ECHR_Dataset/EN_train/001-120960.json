By a decision of 23 October 2008 the judge responsible for the execution of sentences dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint. The judge held that the Jilava Prison authorities had taken the necessary steps to combat the vermin infestation of the cells as they had signed pest control contracts with a number of companies and the cells were disinfected at least once every three months. Moreover, the judge held that the applicant\u2019s complaints concerning the poor quality of the food and drinking water and the lack of food and personal hygiene facilities were unfounded, as: (i) the food at the prison was prepared and stored on the basis of guidelines set by the Ministry of Justice; (ii) the quality of the drinking water had been found to comply with legal requirements according to an expert report of the Apa Nova water testing laboratory; (iii) the applicant had access to the prison facilities necessary to ensure his personal hygiene; and (iv) he was under an obligation to clean and air his room in accordance with the daily schedule for detainees.

Finally, the judge held that the applicant was being provided with adequate medical care. He was kept under medical surveillance, was prescribed the medical treatment that the doctors considered appropriate for his medical condition and, in addition, his request to be treated at A.D.\u2019s natural private clinic at his own expense had been examined according to the relevant legal provisions. The judge also rejected the applicant\u2019s claim for compensation, finding that the applicant could not bring a claim for compensation on the basis of the procedure provided for by Law No. 275/2006 and that he therefore had to bring separate proceedings seeking compensation. The applicant appealed against the judge\u2019s decision.", "41.

The domestic court ordered an expert forensic report in respect of the applicant\u2019s medical condition.", "42. According to the expert forensic report produced by the Mina Minovici Medical Forensic Institute on 28 November 2008, the applicant was suffering from, inter alia, a spinal disc hernia which required surgery and specialised post-surgery recovery. Consequently, the forensic expert report recommended the discontinuance of the applicant\u2019s prison sentence for three months on the ground that the applicant\u2019s spinal disc hernia could not be operated on in a prison hospital.", "43. By a final judgment of 11 December 2008 the Bucharest County Court allowed the applicant\u2019s action seeking his temporary release from prison on medical grounds and ordered his immediate release.", "44. On 12 December 2008 the Rahova Prison authorities informed the Bucharest District Court that the applicant could not be released as the Bucharest Court of Appeal had issued a separate arrest warrant in his name on 17 December 2005 in a separate set of proceedings concerning human trafficking.", "45. On 19 December 2008 the Bucharest County Court informed the Rahova Prison authorities that the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention on the basis of the arrest warrant of 17 December 2005 had been extended by an interlocutory judgment of 18 December 2008. It does not appear from the evidence in the file that the applicant appealed against the interlocutory judgment of 18 December 2008.", "46. By a final judgment of 14 January 2009 the Bucharest District Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal against the decision of the judge responsible for the execution of sentences dated 23 October 2008, upholding the decision and finding that there was no evidence that the applicant\u2019s rights as a detainee had been breached.", "47.

By a final interlocutory judgment of 29 May 2009 the Bucharest Court of Appeal also dismissed the applicant\u2019s request for the suspension of the proceedings on medical grounds. Neither of the parties has provided the Court with the reasoning part of the interlocutory judgments delivered by the Bucharest Court of Appeal.", "49.

The relevant parts of the report of the Romanian Helsinki Committee of 12 June 2008 in respect of the detention conditions in Jilava Prison read as follows:", "\u201c... the basement of the old part of the prison building was completely flooded with waste water ... Consequently, rats and cockroaches (and bed bugs according to some detainees) have infested the cells in that part of the building. Moreover, most cells were also infested with lice, mainly due to worn out bed mattresses. No delousing operation could be effective as long as the mattresses were not replaced ... The prison management claimed it had engaged several pest control companies, which all gave up after taking note of the situation in the prison. Another notorious problem was the extremely poor water quality (muddy and filled with impurities) - unfit for drinking and risky even for washing ... In terms of detention space, the total area of detention space was 3034.81 sq. m, while the population was 1460, meaning 2.08 sq. m of available detention space per detainee, half of the minimum norm recommended by the CPT ... The kitchen area was totally unhygienic and the food quality was poor ...\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
