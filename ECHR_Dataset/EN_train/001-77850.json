The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Chi\u015fin\u0103u.", "7. The applicant was arrested on 24 January 2002 on suspicion of abetting bribery.", "8. On 26 January 2002 the Centru District Court issued an order remanding the applicant in custody for a period of thirty days. The court\u2019s reasoning was the following: \u201cthe suspect has reached the age at which he may be criminally prosecuted, he is suspected of having committed a serious offence and he is unemployed\u201d.", "9. On 4 February 2002 the applicant was indicted inter alia for the offence of aiding and abetting bribery, involving large sums of money, which was punishable by up to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment.", "10. On 14 February 2002, the Centru District Court examined a habeas corpus request lodged by the applicant and a request lodged by the prosecutor to prolong the detention. In his habeas corpus request the applicant argued that he was married, had three children and was employed. The court dismissed the applicant\u2019s request but upheld the prosecutor\u2019s request and prolonged the detention.", "11. Similar prolongations were ordered up until 23 May 2002, when the investigation was completed and the criminal case file was sent by the prosecution to the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Regional Court. After that date, the applicant remained in detention without having his detention warrant prolonged. He submitted numerous habeas corpus requests relying inter alia on his medical condition (see paragraph 17 below) and on the impossibility of receiving appropriate medical care in prison due to a lack of specialised doctors and medication, but they were all rejected.", "12. On 13 February 2003 the applicant complained inter alia that from 23 May 2002 he had been detained without any warrant. His request was dismissed.", "13. On 19 December 2005 the applicant lodged a habeas corpus request with the Centru District Court arguing inter alia that his detention was incompatible with his medical condition due to the lack of appropriate medical care in prison. He asked to be released from detention.", "14. On 28 December 2005 Judges Catan\u0103, Gordil\u0103 and Pitic from the Centru District Court found the applicant\u2019s request well-founded and decided to replace the applicant\u2019s remand in custody with house arrest.", "15. It appears that at the time of adoption of the present judgment the applicant was still under house arrest.", "16. From 26 January 2002 the applicant was detained in Remand Centre No. 3 of the Ministry of Justice (Izolatorul Anchetei Preliminare Nr. 3). On several occasions he was hospitalised in the Prison Hospital.", "17. According to medical certificates submitted by the applicant, and not contested by the Government, he suffered from numerous diseases such as chronic hepatitis, second-degree hydronephrosis (accumulation of urine in the kidney because of an obstruction in the urethra), uric diathesis, increased ecogenicity of pancreatic parenchyma, chronic bilateral pyelonephritis (inflammation of the kidney and pelvis caused by bacterial infection) with functional impairment of the right kidney, hydronephrosis of the right kidney with functional impairment, stones in the urinary tract, somatoform disorder, chronic renal failure, head trauma and generalised anxiety disorder of hypertensive type.", "18. On numerous occasions he was prescribed treatment in hospital and even surgery on his right kidney. On 21 October 2002 and 22 April 2003 the applicant was consulted by Dr Sp\u00e2nu, an urologist from the Central Republican Hospital, a hospital belonging to the Ministry of Health, who recommended urgent surgery on his right kidney in order to eliminate an obstruction of the urethra. The doctor advised that a delay might result in the degradation of the kidney and its extirpation. A similar recommendation was reiterated on 23 June 2003 by the Doctor in Chief of the Prison Hospital, Dr. Cu\u0163itaru, who recommended that the operation be carried out in a specialised urological hospital of the Ministry of Health. It does not appear from the Government\u2019s submissions that this recommendation was ever followed up.", "19. The Government argued that the applicant was provided with sufficient medical care, but the applicant disputed this.", "20. The Government submitted numerous reports drawn up by prison doctors stating that the applicant refused to submit to medical checks and treatment and requested to be transferred to a normal hospital. According to some such reports the applicant argued that the treatment in prison was ineffective and that he needed medication which was not available there.", "21. According to a letter addressed to the Centru District Court and to the Prosecutor\u2019s Office by the prison authorities on 15 November 2004, the applicant started a hunger strike to protest against his being treated in the prison.", "22. On an unspecified date the applicant complained to the Ministry of Justice about the lack of adequate medical treatment. By a letter dated 23 September 2003 the applicant\u2019s complaint was rejected and he was informed inter alia that he had had medical checks on 43 occasions by prison doctors and by doctors from outside the prison. He had been offered medical treatment in accordance with the \u201cmodest possibilities\u201d of the prison medical service and with the medication brought by his relatives. He had been hospitalised in the medical section of the prison on four occasions, where he had received adequate medical treatment, and on two occasions in the Prison Hospital.", "23. The applicant submitted a letter from the Doctor in Chief of the Prison Hospital addressed to his lawyer, dated 7 October 2003, in which it was stated that there were no urologists, cardiologists and neurosurgeons among the doctors of the Prison Hospital.", "24. In another letter addressed to the applicant\u2019s lawyer by the Chief of the Prison where the applicant was detained, dated 12 October 2005, the latter was informed that there were no such doctors at the prison either and that in the event of an emergency the applicant would be transferred to the Prison Hospital.", "25. On 24 January 2002 the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant and another co-accused on charges of abetting bribery.", "26. On 12 February 2002 the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office initiated new criminal proceedings against the applicant on charges of fraudulently dispossessing a person of 1,200 United States dollars (USD).", "27. On 25 February 2002 the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office initiated new criminal proceedings against the applicant on charges of fraudulent dispossession of two persons of their apartments.", "28. All of the above criminal proceedings were joined in one single case file and the criminal investigation lasted until 23 May 2002, when the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office sent the criminal file to the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Regional Court.", "29. On 30 May 2002 the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Regional Court received the criminal file and a judge was assigned to the case.", "30. On 10 June 2002 the judge set 21 June 2002 as the date of the first hearing.", "31. On 21 June 2002 the applicant was unable to come to the hearing due to high blood pressure. He was examined by a doctor who issued him a certificate confirming that the applicant had high blood pressure and was not able to attend the hearing. The hearing was adjourned until 1 July 2002.", "32. On 1 July 2002 the hearing did not take place since the prosecutor and two of the alleged victims were absent. It was adjourned until 16 July 2002.", "33. On 16 July 2002 the hearing was adjourned until 30 July 2002 due to the absence of three of the alleged victims and the applicant\u2019s lawyers.", "34. On 30 July 2002 the applicant informed the court that he was not feeling well and asked to be hospitalised. The court decided to send the applicant for a medical examination at the Central Republican Hospital, a hospital belonging to the Ministry of Health. The hearing appears to have been adjourned indefinitely.", "35. On 20 August 2002 the applicant complained to the court that the authorities were refusing to send him for a medical examination, and that he had therefore commenced a hunger strike on 15 August 2002.", "36. On 12 September 2002 the judge assigned to the case wrote to the prison authorities and asked them to comply with the decision of 30 July 2002.", "37. On 26 September 2002 the applicant complained to the Ministry of Justice about the non-enforcement of the decision of 30 July 2002.", "38. It appears that on an unspecified date the prison authorities had attempted to take the applicant to the Prison Hospital, but that he had refused on the ground that the decision of 30 July 2002 provided for his examination in the Central Republican Hospital. The prison authorities informed the judge assigned to the case about the applicant\u2019s refusal.", "39. On 10 October 2002 the applicant wrote again to the judge informing him that the prison authorities had refused to take him to the Central Republican Hospital as provided in the decision of 30 July 2002, and as a result his medical condition was becoming worse. He informed the judge that he had no other solution but to go on hunger strike again.", "40. It appears that one week later the applicant was taken to the Central Republican Hospital for examination since the criminal file contains medical documents from the Central Republican Hospital dated 17 October 2002.", "41. On 24 October 2002 the resumption of the hearings was scheduled. However, the proceedings were adjourned due to the applicant\u2019s medical condition. The applicant was seen by a doctor, who concluded that he was suffering from the consequences of a brain disease (consecin\u0163ele afec\u0163iunii organice a creierului cu sindrom cerebral astenic) and noted that he refused the treatment prescribed to him.", "42. On 28 October 2002 the prosecutor and one of the applicant\u2019s lawyers were absent. The applicant declared that he was not satisfied with his lawyers and that he wanted to instruct other lawyers. He requested an adjournment. The hearing was adjourned until 12 November 2002.", "43. On 12 November 2002 the hearing was adjourned due to the fact that the applicant had not instructed a new lawyer.", "44. On 19 November 2002 the hearing was adjourned until 22 November 2002 at the request of the applicant\u2019s new lawyer, who intended to present evidence confirming the applicant\u2019s serious medical condition.", "45. On 22 November 2002 the applicant\u2019s lawyer presented medical documents and requested that the applicant undertake a psychiatric examination in order to establish his competence to plead to the charges. The request was allowed and a psychiatric examination of the applicant was ordered.", "46. On 11 December 2002 a commission of psychiatric doctors concluded that a psychiatric examination would only be possible after the applicant\u2019s admission to the Psychiatric Hospital.", "47. On 4 January 2003 Judge Buruian\u0103 ordered that the applicant be admitted to the Psychiatric Hospital in order to carry out the psychiatric examination ordered on 22 November 2002.", "48. On 21 January 2003 the psychiatric examination was completed and the applicant was found competent to plead to the criminal charges. The medical report was sent to the court on 28 January 2003.", "49. On 13 February 2003 the applicant asked the court inter alia about the state of the proceedings and was informed on 20 February by Judge Buruian\u0103 that the hearings would be resumed in March 2003 after the lawyer of the other co-accused had returned from a business trip to the Russian Federation.", "50. On 11 March 2003 a hearing was adjourned until 8 April 2003 on the ground of the applicant\u2019s request for a change of lawyer.", "51. On 8 April 2003 the applicant challenged the judge assigned to his case on the ground inter alia that this judge would prolong the examination of the case, would not allow him to undergo surgery on his kidney as recommended by Dr Sp\u00e2nu, would be biased and would reject his habeas corpus requests. The challenge was dismissed and the hearing was adjourned in order to request information from the prison authorities about the applicant\u2019s medical condition.", "52. On 21 April 2003 the applicant requested an adjournment of the hearing on the ground that he was not feeling well and that he needed medical treatment. The hearing was adjourned until 25 April 2003.", "53. On 22 April 2003 the applicant was examined by Dr Sp\u00e2nu, an urologist, who prescribed urgent surgery on his kidney (see paragraph 18 above).", "54. On 25 April 2003 the hearing was resumed and the court examined and dismissed a habeas corpus request lodged by the applicant who relied mainly on his medical condition. The hearing was then adjourned.", "55. On 13 May 2003 the applicant again challenged the judge on the ground that he refused to allow his release on medical grounds; the challenge was dismissed. He also asked that an ambulance be called; this request was also dismissed, the court observing that the applicant was attempting to prolong the criminal proceedings against him. The court also gave the applicant an official warning since he had raised his voice to the judge. The applicant finally dismissed his lawyer and he was given time to sign a contract with another lawyer.", "56. On 21 May 2003 the applicant was absent from the hearing on grounds of health and the court adjourned it until 6 June 2003.", "57.

He requested that the case be transmitted to the Centru District Court for examination. The court allowed the Prosecutor\u2019s request and the criminal file was sent to the Centru District Court.", "59. On 21 October 2003 the President of the Centru District Court wrote to the Supreme Court of Justice and asked it to order that the case be transferred to the Court of Appeal because, inter alia, following the judiciary reform of 2003 the Court of Appeal was the successor instance of the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Regional Court which had already started to examine the case.", "60. On 31 October 2003 the Supreme Court of Justice rejected the request of the President of the Centru District Court and drew her attention to the need to ensure the examination of the case within a reasonable time.", "61. On 18 November 2003 a hearing was held for the first time before the Centru District Court.
