The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Czelad\u017a.", "7. She and her husband married in 1973. Their daughter was born in 1976. It appears that the applicant's husband abused alcohol and subjected her to psychological harassment over a long period of time. In the early 1980s that situation led to the applicant's nervous breakdown. She began receiving neurological treatment. In October 1993 she and her daughter left the matrimonial home. Nonetheless, the applicant's husband continued to harass her.", "8. In November 1995 the applicant applied for a divorce order which was granted in March 1996. The divorce court found that the applicant's husband had been at fault in respect of the breakdown of their marriage.", "9. In July 1996 the applicant began receiving psychiatric treatment. In January 1997 she was declared to have a \u201csecond degree of invalidity\u201d and granted an invalidity pension on account of the state of her mental health. In March 1998 the applicant was declared entirely unfit for work.", "10. On 26 February 1999 the applicant filed with the B\u0119dzin District Court a claim for maintenance in the amount of PLN 600 per month against her former husband.

On 29 March 1999 the District Court gave judgment by default, allowing the applicant's claim in full.", "12. Subsequently, the defendant filed an objection against the judgment by default.

It ordered the defendant to pay monthly maintenance in the amount of PLN 300 as of 1 April 1999.", "13. On 25 October 1999 the applicant lodged an appeal against the first-instance judgment. She requested the District Court to exempt her from the court fees and to appoint a legal-aid lawyer in the appeal proceedings. She submitted that she was unable to represent herself during the proceedings due to stress related to her presence in the court. She further submitted that she could not afford a lawyer.", "14. On 28 October 1999 the District Court dismissed her application for a legal-aid lawyer. It considered that assistance of a legal-aid lawyer was necessary only in complex cases or where a party to the proceedings was incapable of defending his/her interests. However, in the present case those conditions had not been met. It further found that the content of the applicant's submissions to the court supported the finding that she was capable of effectively representing herself.", "15. On 19 November 1999 the applicant filed an interlocutory appeal (za\u017calenie) against the decision of 28 October 1999. She referred to the stress caused by her participation in the proceedings. She further submitted that she was receiving psychiatric treatment, had been granted an invalidity pension on account of her mental health and was regularly taking various medicines. Those medicines significantly affected her memory, concentration and the ability to express her thoughts clearly. Furthermore, she submitted that she was not an educated person and that her friends had assisted her in preparation of the court's submissions. Thus, she considered that legal aid was necessary in order to enable her to defend her interests adequately in the proceedings.", "16.

On 23 March 2000 the Regional Court informed the applicant that a cassation appeal in her case was not provided for by law and inquired whether she wanted to pursue her legal aid application. On 31 March 2000 the applicant replied in the affirmative.", "21. On 14 April 2000 the Regional Court dismissed her application for legal aid. It considered that a cassation appeal in her case could not be lodged as a matter of law, and thus there was no need to provide her with legal assistance. On 2 May 2000 the applicant filed an interlocutory appeal against that decision.", "22. On 1 June 2000 the Regional Court rejected her interlocutory appeal as inadmissible in law. Her further appeals were rejected on 6 July and 16 August 2000.", "23. On 28 July 2000 the Regional Court informed the applicant that she had been previously advised that a cassation appeal in her case, which could only concern the amount of maintenance, was not available.

On 27 September 2000 the applicant filed with the Supreme Court an interlocutory appeal against the decision of 14 September 2000.", "26. On 18 January 2001 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant's interlocutory appeal. Firstly, it held that, contrary to the position of the Regional Court, the applicant's cassation appeal, which concerned the issue of her entitlement to maintenance, was allowed in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure as applicable at the relevant time. It found that the applicant's case did not concern the issue of the amount of maintenance, which was excluded from the Supreme Court's jurisdiction. However, the applicant's cassation appeal was inadmissible on two other statutory grounds invoked by the Regional Court, namely non-compliance with the applicable time-limit and compulsory legal representation in cassation appeal proceedings.", "27.

At the relevant time Article 111 \u00a7 1 (1) of the CCP provided that a party seeking maintenance was statutorily exempted from court fees.", "30. Article 113 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in the version applicable at the material time, stipulated:", "\u201cAn individual may ask the court competent to deal with the case to grant him an exemption from court fees provided that he submits a declaration to the effect that the fees required would entail a substantial reduction in his and his family's standard of living. Such a declaration shall contain details concerning his family, assets and income. It falls within the court's discretion to assess whether or not the declaration satisfies the requirements for granting the exemption requested.\u201d", "31. The Code of Civil Procedure lays down the principle of mandatory assistance of a lawyer in cassation appeal proceedings. Article 393\u00b2 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, applicable at the relevant time, required that a cassation appeal be filed by an advocate or a legal adviser.
