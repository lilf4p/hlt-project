By a decision of 26 July 2006, the court found against the applicant company. On 2 October 2006 the Dnipropetrovs\u2019k Regional Commercial Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant company\u2019s appeal and upheld the decision of the first-instance court.", "7. By a decision of 12 December 2006, the Higher Commercial Court, upon the applicant company\u2019s appeal, quashed the decisions of the lower courts and found in favour of the applicant company.", "8. On 20 February 2007 the Supreme Court of Ukraine, upon the IT company\u2019s cassation appeal, quashed the ruling of the Higher Commercial Court on the ground that its findings had been unfounded and erroneous, and upheld the decision of the Dnipropetrovs\u2019k Regional Commercial Court of Appeal. In taking this decision, the Supreme Court noted:", "\u201cThe Supreme Court of Ukraine, with regard to the provisions of Articles 6 and 8 of the Constitution of Ukraine, does not consider it necessary to remit the case for fresh examination to the first-instance court. This would be contrary to the provisions of Article 125 of the Constitution of Ukraine and sections 2 and 39 of the Law of Ukraine \u201cOn the Judicial System of Ukraine\u201d [the Judiciary Act] regarding the status of the Supreme Court of Ukraine and its task to ensure the administration of justice in accordance with the law. It would further cause a constitutionally unacceptable need to quash the lawful decision of the court of appeal. In this regard, the list of possible outcomes of cassation appeals against decisions of the Higher Commercial Court of Ukraine envisaged in Article 111-18 of the Code of Commercial Procedure of Ukraine is not considered a legal impediment to adopting the decision.\u201d", "9.

The Code of Commercial Procedure (formerly: Arbitration Procedure) was significantly reworded on 21 June 2001. At that time, a fourth level of jurisdiction was introduced into commercial procedure. According to the relevant provisions of the Code, a cassation appeal to the Higher Commercial Court, similar to that found in other member States of the Council of Europe, and a second (or repeated) cassation appeal to the Supreme Court was available to the parties in a commercial case. Commercial procedure was the only judicial procedure of Ukraine where a fourth level of jurisdiction existed and where the Supreme Court acted as a second-instance court of cassation (in criminal and civil proceedings it acted as an ordinary court of cassation and in administrative and administrative offences proceedings it performed only extraordinary review). The relevant legislation was changed in July 2010 and the competence of the Supreme Court in commercial cases was limited to the review of a case in the event of inconsistencies in judicial practice or in the event that a decision is adopted by an international tribunal.", "The relevant provisions of the Code of Commercial Procedure (in its wording of 15 May 2003) read as follows:", "\u201cA commercial court shall nullify proceedings in the case, if", "1) a dispute is not subject to examination in the commercial courts of Ukraine; ...\u201d", "\u201cThe parties to a case and the Prosecutor General of Ukraine have the right to appeal in cassation to the Supreme Court of Ukraine against a resolution of the Higher Commercial Court of Ukraine adopted following the review of a decision of a first-instance commercial court that has entered into force, or a resolution of the Commercial Court of Appeal [as well as the ruling of the Higher Commercial Court of Ukraine on return of the appeal (request for review) in cassation].\u201d", "\u201cThe Supreme Court of Ukraine reviews in cassation the resolutions [or rulings] of the Higher Commercial Court of Ukraine if they are appealed against:", "1) on the basis of the application by the Higher Commercial Court of Ukraine of a law or normative act which contravenes the Constitution of Ukraine;", "2) where a decision contravenes decisions of the Supreme Court of Ukraine or of a higher court of a different specialisation on the issue of the application of the norms of substantive law;", "3) where it is revealed that the Higher Commercial Court of Ukraine has applied the same provision of the law or any other normative act differently in similar cases;", "[3-1) due to the inconsistency of the resolutions or rulings with the international treaties of Ukraine agreed as binding by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine;]", "4) where an international judicial body whose jurisdiction is recognised by Ukraine finds that a resolution [or ruling] has violated the international obligations of Ukraine.\u201d", "\u201c...
