In these proceedings, on 22 December 2004 he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. His pre-trial detention was credited towards the sentence (\u201cthird conviction\u201d).", "In respect of the second and third convictions, a cumulative sentence was passed in which the applicant was subjected to altogether three years and seven months' (i.e. 43 months') imprisonment. This decision became final on 22 December 2004. Having regard to the cumulative sentence and to the one relating to the first conviction, he was liable to detention for altogether 47 months. His detention started on 18 April 2001; consequently, it should have been terminated by 18 March 2005. However, he was released only on 23 April 2005.", "In dismissing the applicant's ensuing complaint, the prison governor made reference to Decree no. 17/1997. (V.9.) IM. of the Minister of Justice on the Determination of the First and Last Day of Imprisonment. The governor established that the period theoretically corresponding to the cumulative sentence had indeed been served by the applicant by 17 November 2004. However, the decision on the cumulative sentence had become final only on 22 December 2004, and it was only from that day onwards that the applicant's continued detention could be regarded as corresponding to the four-month prison term flowing from the first conviction. The intervening period of one month and five days, although the applicant had spent it in prison, could not be deducted from this term.", "Section 339(1) of the Civil Code provides:", "\u201cAnyone who unlawfully causes damage to another person shall be obliged to pay compensation.
