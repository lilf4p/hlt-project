CROATIA", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 2 (substantive aspect);Non-pecuniary damage - award", "JUDGES": "Anatoly Kovler;Christos Rozakis;Dean Spielmann;Elisabeth Steiner;George Nicolaou;Giorgio Malinverni", "TEXT": ["4. The applicants were born in 1956, 1963, 1985, 1995 and 2001 respectively and live in \u010cakovec. The first and second applicants are husband and wife and the third to fifth applicants are their children.", "5. During 2004 M.T., the first and second applicants\u2019 daughter and the third to fifth applicants\u2019 sister, entered into a relationship with a certain M.M. They started living together with the applicants in their home. On 1 March 2005 they had a child, V.T. Soon afterwards M.M. had a series of disputes with the members of the household and often expressed verbal threats against M.T., which resulted in him moving out of the house in July 2005. On 4 January 2006 the \u010cakovec Social Welfare Centre (Centar za socijalnu skrb \u010cakovec \u2013 hereinafter \u201cthe Welfare Centre\u201d) filed a report with the Me\u0111imurje Police Department (Policijska uprava me\u0111imurska) stating, inter alia, that on 2 January 2006 M.M. had come to the Centre and claimed that he had a bomb and would \u201cthrow it at his former wife [meaning M.T.] and child\u201d.", "6. On 5 January 2006 M.T. lodged a criminal complaint with the \u010cakovec State Attorney\u2019s Office against M.M. She alleged that on a number of occasions since July 2005 M.M. had come to her parents\u2019 house where she also lived with her daughter and had threatened to kill her and their daughter with a bomb unless she agreed to come back to him. He had also often made telephone calls and sent SMS messages to her by mobile phone repeating the same threats.", "7. On 3 February 2006 M.M. was detained following the instigation of the criminal proceedings against him in the \u010cakovec Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u \u010cakovcu) on 27 January 2006. A psychiatric opinion obtained during the proceedings stated that on 2 January 2006 M.M. had claimed before the employees of the Welfare Centre that he had a bomb and that his threats had been meant seriously. He had repeated the same claim on 19 January 2006 before police officers from the Me\u0111imurje Police Department. The relevant parts of the conclusions of the report read as follows:", "\u201c1. Defendant M.M. is a person suffering from a profound personality disorder etiologically linked to innate malfunctioning of the brain and the highly unfavourable pedagogical circumstances of his childhood. Dg: mixed personality disorder ...", "2. In the context of the said personality disorder the defendant\u2019s reaction to a problematic situation was an inadequate and pathological defence mechanism with inflated ideas and related activities. These inflated ideas do not amount to a mental illness.", "3. I have not found elements of either permanent or temporary innate mental illness, diminished intellectual capacity or epilepsy which might be linked to the criminal offences with which the defendant is charged.", "4. He is not addicted to alcohol, drugs or other substances ...", "5. In view of what has been said under 1, 2 and 3 and in view of all the other information collected so far in connection with the criminal offences, I consider that his ability to wilfully control and understand the meaning and consequences of his act tempore criminis was diminished, but that [he was not] completely unaccountable.", "6. There is a strong likelihood that he will repeat the same or similar criminal offences. In order to prevent this, I recommend that the court, apart from the other measures, order compulsory psychiatric treatment with a predominantly psychotherapeutic approach with the aim of developing an ability to resolve difficult situations in life in a more constructive manner.\u201d", "8. On 15 March 2006 the Municipal Court found M.M. guilty of threatening M.T. on several occasions during the period between July and 30 December 2005 both in front of her family house and at the parking lot near the city graveyard when M.T. had been alone. He had shouted threats that he would kill her, himself and their child with a bomb; at the Welfare Centre on 2 January 2006 he had said that his threats had been meant seriously, that he actually had a bomb and that he would kill himself and the child with the bomb on the child\u2019s first birthday on 1 March 2006. He was sentenced to five months\u2019 imprisonment and a security measure of compulsory psychiatric treatment was ordered during his imprisonment and afterwards as necessary. In ordering the defendant\u2019s compulsory psychiatric treatment the court relied entirely on the findings of the psychiatric report. The relevant part of the judgment read as follows:", "\u201c... throughout the whole period in question the defendant had been telling the victim that he would throw a bomb at himself and their child as well as her [the victim] if she happened to be around. These events came to a head on 30 December. The defendant did not refrain from mentioning a bomb either in front of the Welfare Centre\u2019s employees or a policeman. Furthermore, he said in front of the policemen that he would blow himself and the child up with a bomb on the child\u2019s first birthday. Therefore, there is no doubt that both the victim and the witnesses understood these threats as being meant seriously ... Thus, the victim\u2019s fears for her own as well as her child\u2019s safety were justified ...", "...", "... all conditions for ordering a security measure [of compulsory psychiatric treatment] have been fulfilled since the defendant committed a crime while his capacity for understanding was diminished and it is likely that he will repeat the same or similar offence. It is necessary to order compulsory psychiatric treatment during his prison term and after his release. The treatment shall take a predominantly psychotherapeutic approach, as recommended by the expert, in order to develop [the defendant\u2019s] ability to address difficult situations in life in a more constructive manner.\u201d", "9. On 28 April 2006 the \u010cakovec County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u \u010cakovcu) reduced the security measure to the duration of M.M.\u2019s prison sentence and upheld the remaining part of the judgment. The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows:", "\u201c... there is no doubt that frequent murder threats by ... a bomb should by any objective test have been understood as meant seriously and that [such threats] would cause a real sense of disquiet, fear and anxiety in an average person, in particular in a situation where the victim has known the perpetrator as an aggressive person out of control, as is the case with the victim in the present case.", "There is also no doubt that ... the defendant\u2019s threats extended throughout a period of half a year during which the victim feared, owing to continued threats, not only for her own safety but also for the safety and wellbeing of her child which was not even a year old at the time. The victim was thus undoubtedly put in a difficult and unenviable position where she feared daily for her and her daughter\u2019s life, which was confirmed not only in her testimony but also the fact that she sought assistance from the competent authorities [such as] the police, the Social Welfare Centre and the State Attorney.", "...", "While examining ... the impugned judgment under Article 379 paragraph 1(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure this appellate court has established that the first-instance court violated the statutory provisions to the detriment of the defendant when it ordered that a security measure of compulsory psychiatric treatment should continue after the defendant\u2019s release [from prison], which is contrary to Article 75 of the Criminal Code according to which compulsory psychiatric treatment may last as long as the reasons for its application exist but no longer than the prison term.", "...", "... this court does not agree with the defendant\u2019s argument that in his case the purpose of punishment would be achieved by a suspended sentence, especially in view of the fact that the defendant ... did not show any self-criticism as regards his acts or any feelings of remorse for what he had said ...\u201d", "10. M.M. served his sentence in Vara\u017edin Prison and was released on 3 July 2006. On 15 August 2006 he shot M.T., her daughter V.T. and himself. Before the shooting he was spotted by M.T.\u2019s neighbour carrying an automatic gun and leaving his bicycle in the adjacent woods. The neighbour immediately called the police. The police arrived at the scene twenty minutes later, just after the tragic event.", "11. On 15 August 2006 the police interviewed M.T.\u2019s neighbour I.S. who had seen M.M. approaching M.T.\u2019s house immediately before the critical event. At the request of the police, on 17 August 2006 an investigating judge of the Vara\u017edin County Court issued a search warrant of a flat and a vehicle belonging to a certain M.G. who was suspected of having procured weapons for M.M. The warrant was executed the same day, but no connection was established between M.G. and the weapons used by M.M.. The investigating judge has not taken any further steps in that case.", "12. On 18 August 2006 the police submitted a report to the \u010cakovec County State Attorney\u2019s Office detailing the circumstances of the tragic event.", "13. On 28 November 2006 the State Attorney\u2019s Office dismissed a criminal complaint against M.M. for murdering M.T. and V.T. on the ground that he was dead. It is unclear who lodged that complaint, but a copy of this decision was sent to the applicants. In a letter of the same day the State Attorney\u2019s Office asked the Me\u0111imurje Police Department to collect all information concerning psychiatric treatment of M.M. in Vara\u017edin Prison. The relevant part of a report drawn up on 13 December 2006 by the Vara\u017edin prison authorities reads as follows:", "\u201cM.M. had been kept in detention on remand in Vara\u017edin Prison from 3 February to 22 May 2006 when he was sent to serve his prison term ... which expired on 3 July 2006.", "A psychiatric examination of M.M. carried out during his stay in detention showed that he suffered from a mixed personality disorder which derived from innate malfunctioning of the brain and the unfavourable pedagogical circumstances of his childhood. In the same opinion the expert psychiatrist recommended that compulsory psychiatric treatment be ordered with a predominantly psychotherapeutic approach with the aim [that M.M.] develop an ability to resolve difficult situations in life in a more constructive manner.", "While M.M. served his prison term, intensive treatment consisting in frequent individual conversational sessions was envisaged, in accordance with the individual programme of serving a prison term. He rarely came for the sessions of his own accord and was therefore, in [order to satisfy] the need for treatment, requested to do so by the staff. ...", "While in prison M.M. saw the prison doctor on five occasions, sometimes of his own accord, sometimes at the doctor\u2019s call. He did not insist on his psychiatric therapy and therefore his treatment was based, as recommended by the expert, on intensive psychotherapeutic treatment by the staff, the prison governor and the others who talked to him. He was a highly introverted person, so his true personality could not be detected in detention or prison conditions.\u201d", "14. On 11 December 2006 the Me\u0111imurje Police Department interviewed the Vara\u017edin prison governor, P.L. The relevant part of a report on the interview drawn up on 2 December 2006 reads as follows:", "\u201cThe above-mentioned is the governor of Vara\u017edin Prison and he states that the late M.M. served his prison term in Vara\u017edin Prison from 3 February to 3 July 2006 ...", "While in prison M.M. underwent psychiatric treatment pursuant to the expert opinion and recommendation. The treatment was based on intensive psychotherapeutic treatment of M.M. consisting of conversational sessions between M.M. and the prison staff, himself [meaning the governor] and the prison doctor. During the treatment M.M. neither received nor asked for any pharmacotherapy. It was also established that M.M. was a very introverted person who did not wish to cooperate in the treatment.", "During his stay in the prison M.M. saw the prison doctor on five occasions in connection with some other problems, that is to say, illnesses.", "He further maintains that there are no internal regulations on the implementation of security measures and that all treatment is carried out in accordance with the Enforcement of Prison Sentences Act.\u201d", "15. According to the Government, since no oversights on the part of the persons in charge of the execution of the M.M.\u2019s prison term and security measure had been established, the investigation was concluded, although no formal decision to that effect has been adopted.", "16. M.M.\u2019s medical record from prison, submitted by the Government, does not indicate any psychiatric or psychotherapeutic treatment.", "17. On 6 November 2006 the applicants submitted a proposal to the State Attorney for a settlement of their claim for non-pecuniary damages related to the deaths of M.T. and V.T. They alleged failures by the competent authorities to take adequate steps to protect the lives of M.T. and V.T. and inadequacy of the investigation into the circumstances of their deaths. They sought 1,105,000 Croatian kunas (HRK) in compensation and HRK 13,481 for costs. They received no reply. Under section 186(a) of the Civil Procedure Act, where such a request has been refused or no decision has been taken within three months of its submission the person concerned may file an action with the competent court.
