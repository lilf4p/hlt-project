The Greek Government were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Bakalis, President of the Legal Council of the State.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "On an unspecified date in 1998 the applicants were arrested in Greece.", "On 8 September 1998 the applicants were charged by the Greek authorities with illegally entering Greek territory, setting up and participating in a criminal organisation and drug trafficking.", "On 9 December 1999 the Athens Court of Appeal, sitting as a first-instance court with a bench of three judges, found the applicants guilty and sentenced them to life imprisonment and to the payment of a fine that amounted to 10 million drachmas.", "On an unspecified date in 2000, since their minor children and family were living in Albania, the applicants lodged a request with the Greek Ministry of Justice pursuant to a 1993 Bilateral Agreement between Albania and Greece on the transfer of sentenced persons (\u201cthe Bilateral Agreement\u201d), seeking to serve their prison sentence in an Albanian prison. According to the applicants, in order to fulfil the requirements for their transfer to Albania they waived their right to appeal against the judgment that had led to their conviction.", "On 7 April and 4 May 2000 the Greek Ministry of Justice requested the Albanian authorities to initiate proceedings for the transfer of the applicants to Albania. The standard text of the requests, in so far as relevant, read as follows:", "\u201cI.

Lastly, the court ordered that the applicants should pay the costs of the proceedings. The judgment became final on 27 November 2000.", "It appears that on 6 April 2001 the Albanian Ministry of Justice informed its Greek counterparts that there existed the possibility of conditional release for the applicants after serving half of their sentence, provided that they had displayed good behaviour in prison. Consequently, on 8 June 2001 the Greek Ministry of Justice informed the applicants and the Albanian Ministry of Justice of its refusal to transfer the applicants on the ground that the sentences commuted by the Albanian court were inferior to those imposed by the Greek court and thus incompatible with the gravity of their offence and with the short time they had spent in Greek prisons.", "In 2003 and 2004 the applicants unsuccessfully requested that the Greek authorities transfer them to Albania in accordance with the transfer procedure.", "It would appear that on 25 February 2003 the second and third applicants sought leave to appeal out of time against the sentence of 9 December 1999.
