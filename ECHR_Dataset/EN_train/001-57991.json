He came to France in 1968 and lived there continuously until his deportation. His parents and his ten brothers and sisters reside in France. Eight of his brothers and sisters were born there. He claims that he lived with a woman of French nationality (Miss S.), whose child, born on 19 June 1993, he formally recognised on 5 April 1994.", "8. The applicant was convicted on a number of occasions. On 21 December 1981 he was sentenced to ten months\u2019 imprisonment, four of which were suspended, for burglary. On 22 September 1983 he was sentenced to two months\u2019 imprisonment for an assault resulting in the victim\u2019s not being fit for work for a period exceeding eight days. On 25 September 1986 he was fined 1,500 francs for driving without a licence and without insurance and on 24 March 1987 he was sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment for living on the earnings of prostitution with aggravating circumstances.", "9. On 8 March 1988 the Minister of the Interior issued an order for Mr Boughanemi\u2019s deportation worded a follows:", "\"... Having regard to sections 23 and 24 of Ordinance no. 45-2658 of 2 November 1945, as amended,concerning the conditions of entry and residence ofaliens in France;", "Having regard to Decree no. 82-440 of 26 May 1982;", "Whereas Kamel Boughanemi ... committed the followingoffences: on 21 August 1981 a burglary; on21 November 1981 an assault on the person of arepresentative of the public authority who was performinghis duties; on 25 January 1983 an assault; and from 26 September 1986 to 10 October 1986, acts amounting toliving on the earnings of prostitution with aggravating circumstances;", "Whereas on account of his behaviour the presence of thisforeign national on French territory represents a threatto public order;", "... IT IS HEREBY ORDERED AS FOLLOWS", "Article 1: the above-mentioned person is enjoined to leave the French territory;", "Article 2: the Prefect of Police and the prefects are instructed to serve and execute this order.", "...\"", "10. The deportation order was executed on 12 November 1988 but the applicant returned to France and lived there illegally.", "11. On 16 March 1989 the Lyons Administrative Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal alleging that the deportation order was an abuse of authority.", "12. On 21 March 1990 the applicant applied to the Minister of the Interior to have the deportation order rescinded. His application was rejected on 10 August 1990 on the following grounds:", "\"...", "I hereby inform you that the deportation order was madeby the competent authorities in view of the nature andincreasing gravity of the offences committed by theapplicant. The threat to public order was also assessedwith reference to Mr Boughanemi\u2019s general conduct as wasrequired under the circular on the implementation of theLaw of 9 September 1986.", "In addition, the Lyons [Administrative Court] confirmed the deportation order on 16 March 1989.", "It is accordingly impossible for me to grant your request. The deportation order of 8 March 1988 must therefore remain in force.", "...\"", "13. On 9 October 1990 Mr Boughanemi lodged with the Lyons Administrative Court an application for judicial review of the Minister\u2019s decision refusing to rescind the deportation order. In its judgment of 26 February 1991 dismissing the application, the Lyons court gave the following grounds:", "\"...", "Under section 23 of the Ordinance of 2 November 1945, asamended in particular by the Law of 2 August 1989,\u2019subject to the provisions of section 25, deportation maybe decided by order of the Minister of the Interior if analien\u2019s presence on French territory constitutes aserious threat to public order. The deportation ordermay be rescinded at any time by the Minister of theInterior ...\u2019 Although section 25, as amended by theaforementioned Law, prohibits the Minister, save in casesof extreme urgency as provided for in section 26, fromordering the deportation of certain categories of alien,that provision cannot be usefully invoked to support anapplication to have a previously issued deportation orderrescinded. It is exclusively a matter for the Ministerto whom such an application has been made to assesspursuant to section 23 whether the presence of the personconcerned on French territory constitutes at the date onwhich he gives his decision a serious threat to public order.", "In the first place, it follows from the foregoing thatthe submission based on the fact that Mr Boughanemi haslived continuously in France since the age of 8 and thatfor that reason, in accordance with the new section 25 ofthe Ordinance of 2 November 1945, a deportation ordercould not be made against him after the coming intooperation of the Law of 2 August 1989 is without force inregard to the decision refusing to rescind thedeportation order made against him on 8 March 1988. Norcan he rely on the principle that more lenient criminallegislation should be applied with retrospective effect.", "Secondly, an appeal brought against the deportationdecision of 8 March 1988 alleging that it was an abuse ofauthority was dismissed as unfounded by a judgment ofthis court on 16 March 1989. That decision carries withit the authority of res judicata, which precludesMr Boughanemi from pleading the unlawfulness of thatmeasure in support of his submissions directed againstthe refusal to rescind it.", "Finally, the documents in the file show that theMinister, who took his decision in the light of all thecircumstances of the case, did not make a manifest errorof assessment in concluding, on the basis of the actsthat gave rise to the applicant\u2019s being arrested andprosecuted on several occasions between 1981 and 1988 andaspects of Mr Boughanemi\u2019s conduct, that the latter\u2019spresence on French territory constituted a serious threatto public order and in refusing on those grounds torescind the deportation order made against him.", "It follows from all the foregoing considerations that the applicant\u2019s submission that the impugned decision isvitiated as an abuse of authority is unfounded and hisapplication to have it set aside on that ground must fail.\"", "14. On 7 December 1992 the Conseil d\u2019Etat dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal lodged on 23 October 1991. It gave, inter alia, the following reasons:", "\"...", "Although the wording of section 25 of the above-mentioned Ordinance of 2 November 1945 was amended by the Law of 2 August 1989, Mr Boughanemi cannot usefully rely on thischange in the legal position in order to plead that the Minister of the Interior was under a duty to rescind thedeportation order issued against him under previouslegislation concerning aliens. It was exclusively amatter for the Minister to whom an application for suchan order to be rescinded has been made to determinewhether, in accordance with section 23 of the Ordinance of 2 November 1945 as in force at the date of theapplication, the presence of the person concerned onFrench territory represented a serious threat to public order.", "It appears from the documents in the file that the Minister, who took his decision in the light of all theevidence in the case, did not make a manifest error ofassessment in finding that the presence in France of theappellant, who had committed repeated and increasingly serious offences, including that of living on theearnings of prostitution with aggravating circumstances,still represented, as at 10 August 1990, a serious threatto public order. He was therefore entitled to refuse torescind the order for Mr Boughanemi\u2019s deportation.", "In the circumstances of this case, the Minister of the Interior\u2019s refusal to rescind the deportation order made against Mr Boughanemi, who returned to France and lived there illegally after the execution of that deportationorder, did not interfere with the latter\u2019s family life toan extent that exceeded what was necessary to preservepublic order. Thus the submission that the refusal torescind the deportation order of 8 March 1988 infringed the right to respect for family life guaranteed byArticle 8 (art. 8) of the European Convention on Human Rights must fail.", "...\"", "15. Mr Boughanemi was arrested on 28 July 1994 for breach of the deportation order and was sentenced to three months\u2019 imprisonment. On 12 October 1994 he was deported to Tunisia.", "16. On 20 June 1994 the Commission received from Miss S. (see paragraph 7 above) the following letter, dated 15 June 1994:", "\"As partner (concubine) and mother of the child ofMr Kamel Boughanemi, I wish by this letter to draw yourattention to our situation.", "The difficulty of getting his identity papers back makesit impossible for us to lead a normal life.", "There is also the fact that, as I am myself unemployed,my financial circumstances make it impossible for me togive him either moral or financial support. What ismore, I am his partner and, despite all his efforts to berecognised as a normal citizen, it is unfortunately impossible for us to live together. Faced with all the problems raised by his getting administrative recognition, I write to you in the hope that you willtake account of the fact that both he and I are acting ingood faith.", "...\"", "On 6 December 1994 Miss S. made the following statement to an officer of the criminal investigation department (extracts from the police report):", "\"...", "I do know Kameledine Boughanemi. I\u2019ve known him for about three years. I lived with him from the end of 1992 till Christmas 1993 when we separated because of a disagreement.", "When we lived together he was out of work. He lived at my place ... I paid for his keep.", "He never gave me any money because he didn\u2019t have any.", "He didn\u2019t recognise my son until April 1994, because tobegin with I wasn\u2019t too keen on the idea.", "So far he has never sent any money for our child. Hecalls me from time to time to find out if there is anynews about his application to the European Court. I don\u2019t intend to live with him if he comes back.", "I have nothing else to say on this matter.", "...\"", "17. Deportation is governed by Ordinance no. 45-2658 of 2 November 1945 concerning the conditions of entry and residence of aliens in France, as amended by, inter alia, the following Laws: no. 81-973 of 29 October 1981; no. 86-1025 of 9 September 1986; no. 89-548 of 2 August 1989; no. 91-1383 of 31 December 1991; and no. 93-1027 of 24 August 1993.", "18. According to the first paragraph of section 23 of the Ordinance, as amended by the Law of 9 September 1986, \"subject to the provisions of section 25, deportation may be decided by order of the Minister of the Interior if an alien\u2019s presence on French territory constitutes a threat to public order\".", "The Law of 2 August 1989 restored the wording that this section had contained prior to the Law of 9 September 1986, to the effect that deportation might only be ordered in the event of a \"serious\" threat to public order.", "19.
