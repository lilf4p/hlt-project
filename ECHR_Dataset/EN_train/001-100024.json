The applicants were born in 1976, 1973 and 1999 respectively and live in Yerevan.", "5. According to the applicants, they enjoyed a right of use of accommodation in respect of 33.8 sq. m of a flat which in total measured 66.8 sq. m. and was situated at 17 Byuzand Street, Yerevan. It appears that the flat was owned by their family member, K.H. The Government contested this allegation and claimed that only the applicants Hovhannes Hovhannisyan and Astghik Hovhannisyan (\u201cthe first applicant\u201d and \u201cthe second applicant\u201d) enjoyed such a right, while the applicant Diana Shiroyan (\u201cthe third applicant\u201d), who was a minor, was only entitled to live in the flat in question.", "6. On 1 August 2002 the Government adopted Decree no. 1151-N, approving the expropriation zones of the immovable property (plots of land, buildings and constructions) situated within the administrative boundaries of the Central District of Yerevan to be taken for the needs of the State for the purpose of carrying out construction projects, covering a total area of 345,000 sq. m. Byuzand Street was listed as one of the streets falling within such expropriation zones.", "7. On 17 June 2004 the Government decided to contract out the construction of one of the sections of Byuzand Street \u2013 which was to be renamed Main Avenue \u2013 to a private company, Vizkon Ltd.", "8. On 1 October 2004 Vizkon Ltd and the Yerevan Mayor's Office signed an agreement which, inter alia, authorised the former to negotiate directly with the owners of the property subject to expropriation and, should such negotiations fail, to institute court proceedings on behalf of the State, seeking forced expropriation of such property.", "9. By a letter of 25 February 2005 Vizkon Ltd informed the first and second applicants that the flat in question was situated within the expropriation zone of the Main Avenue area and was to be taken for State needs. Each applicant was offered a total of the Armenian dram (AMD) equivalent of 3,500 United States dollars (USD) as financial assistance, pursuant to paragraphs 7(c) and 8(e) of the compensation procedure approved by Government Decree no. 950 of 5 October 2001 (see paragraphs 26 and 27 below; hereafter, \u201cthe compensation procedure\u201d).", "10. It appears that the first and second applicants did not accept this offer.", "11. On an unspecified date, Vizkon Ltd instituted proceedings against the first and second applicants on behalf of the State, seeking to terminate their right of use through payment of financial assistance and to evict all the applicants with reference to, inter alia, Articles 218 and 220 of the Civil Code. The plaintiff claimed that persons enjoying a right of use were entitled, pursuant to paragraph 8 of the compensation procedure, to receive assistance in the Armenian dram equivalent of USD 3,500.", "12. It appears that in the course of the court proceedings Vizkon Ltd offered the same amount of compensation also to the third applicant, since she was also registered at the flat in question. The third applicant joined the proceedings as a co-defendant.", "13. On 2 March 2005 a contract was signed between Vizkon Ltd and the owner of the flat, K.H., according to which she agreed to cede the flat to the State in exchange for another flat.

Article 218 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 provided that a plot of land might be taken from the owner for the needs of the State or the community by compensating its value. Depending on for whose needs a plot of land was to be taken, its value was to be compensated by either the State or the community. The decision to take a plot of land for the needs of the State or the community was to be taken by a public authority.", "25.
