She is represented before the Court by Ms A. Kobyli\u0144ska, a lawyer practising in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. The Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) are represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "On 10 July 1991 the applicant filed a civil action with the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Court, Labour Law Division. The applicant was a victim of chemical poisoning to which she had been exposed while she was performing her job (she took part in a rescue operation as a doctor). She sued both her former employer (the ambulance station) and the company responsible for the accident. She sought a pension, damages and just satisfaction.

In addition, it transferred the part of the action lodged against the company responsible for the accident to another court as it considered that it was not competent to examine the case.

Both the applicant and the defendant appealed.", "On 31 March 1993 the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Court of Appeal upheld the judgment. In its written grounds it stated inter alia that the transfer of the part of the action to another court was not consistent with relevant legal provisions.
