It further noted, however, that it did not have the Maryanivka village council records for 1945.", "On 28 March 2005 the applicant wrote to the Head of the Department of Labour and Social Protection for advice on how to claim compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage sustained as a result of the forced resettlement in 1945 and for the abandoned property. In reply, the Department informed the applicant that he qualified for war-participant status which would entitle him to apply for various social benefits. As to compensation for the abandoned property and forced resettlement, it stated that it had no authority to deal with such issues.", "The applicant sent similar requests to a number of institutions, but to no avail.
