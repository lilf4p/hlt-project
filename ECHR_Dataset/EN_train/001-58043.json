On 26 September 1991 the police forwarded the report on the arrest to the public prosecutor\u2019s office, which that same day arranged a hearing for the following morning in the Rome District Court, seeking to have the arrest confirmed (convalida dell\u2019arresto).", "10. On 27 September 1991 at 11 a.m. the public prosecutor\u2019s office also applied for Mrs Manzoni to be detained at her home pending trial (Article 284 of the New Code of Criminal Procedure).", "11. After satisfying itself that the relevant statutory formalities in respect of arrest had been complied with (including bringing the applicant before the public prosecutor\u2019s office within twenty-four hours of her arrest, drawing up and sending on the police report within the same period and requesting the public prosecutor\u2019s office to confirm the arrest within forty-eight hours), the court confirmed the arrest. However, it did not consider it necessary to detain Mrs Manzoni pending trial and ordered that she be released immediately.", "12. At the end of proceedings known as \"patteggiamento\" (a shortened form of procedure whereby, at the request of the public prosecutor\u2019s office or, as in the present case, of the defendant, the court imposes a sentence agreed on by the public prosecutor\u2019s office and the defendant) the court sentenced the applicant to three months and eleven days\u2019 imprisonment, suspended.", "13. The hearing ended at 11.45 a.m. At about 1.30 p.m. the police escorted Mrs Manzoni to Rebibbia Prison. At 3.10 p.m. the record of the hearing was served on her by the prison management.
