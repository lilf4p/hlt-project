At least one person had complained to the Portuguese Stock Exchange authority (Comiss\u00e3o do Mercado de Valores Mobili\u00e1rios, hereinafter CMVM) about the activities of this company.

He alleged, invoking Article 6 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention, that the service of the indictment was null and void due to the absence of a written translation. The applicant submitted that the maximum lawful duration of his detention on remand had expired, which rendered his further detention unlawful.", "On the same day, the investigating judge rejected the application, noting that neither Article 6 \u00a7 3 (a) nor the relevant Portuguese legislation required a written translation of the indictment. The investigating judge added that in any event the one-year period ran until the issuing of the indictment and not until its service.", "A writ of habeas corpus filed by the applicant before the Supreme Court (Supremo Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a) on 4 May 1998, on the same grounds, was also rejected, by a judgment of 7 May 1998.", "The applicant appealed to the Lisbon Court of Appeal against the decision of the investigating judge.

By a judgment of 19 February 1997, published in the Official Gazette (Di\u00e1rio da Rep\u00fablica) of 30 April 1997, the Constitutional Court, referring to the European Court\u2019s judgment in Lamy v. Belgium (judgment of 30 March 1989, Series A no. 151), ruled that these provisions would be contrary to the Constitution if interpreted in such a way as to deny access to the case-file to an accused who wished to challenge the prosecution\u2019s views on the lawfulness of the detention."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
