BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant, Mr Du\u0161an Jankovi\u0107, is a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina who was born in 1946 and lives in Banja Luka. He is represented before the Court by Mr Z. Male\u0161evi\u0107, a lawyer practising in Banja Luka. The respondent Government are represented by Ms Z. Ibrahimovi\u0107, Agent, and Ms M. Miji\u0107, Deputy Agent.", "1. Relevant background to the applicant\u2019s case", "Following the declaration of independence in March 1992 by the then Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the legal predecessor of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina), war broke out. It was characterised by ethnic conflict and discrimination, large scale displacement of people and the destruction or occupation of their homes. On 14 December 1995 the three principal parties to that war (the then Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the then Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) signed a peace settlement \u2013 the 1995 General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina (hereinafter \u201cthe Dayton Agreement\u201d). The Dayton Agreement set out provisions for the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes of origin and the restitution of their property.", "2. Relevant facts of the applicant\u2019s case", "The facts of the applicant\u2019s case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "Prior to the 1992-95 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina the applicant and his wife lived in his wife\u2019s house in the vicinity of Visoko in what is now the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (an Entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina). E.M. and M.M. lived in Banja Luka in what is now the Republika Srpska (the other Entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina).", "On 2 October 1993 the applicant and his wife concluded a contract with E.M. and M.M. exchanging his wife\u2019s house and other property in the vicinity of Visoko for a house and other property in Banja Luka belonging to E.M. and M.M (hereinafter \u201cthe exchange contract\u201d). As a result, the applicant and his wife became the registered joint owners of the house and property in Banja Luka. However, it would appear that E.M. and M.M. did not register their ownership of the house and property in the vicinity of Visoko (the applicant\u2019s wife remained the registered owner).", "On 5 March 1999 E.M. and M.M. initiated proceedings before the Banja Luka Court of First Instance seeking that the exchange contract be declared void.", "It would appear that in or around that date E.M. also filed an application with the Commission for Real Property Claims of Displaced Persons and Refugees (hereinafter \u201cthe CRPC\u201d) which was set up by the Agreement on Refugees and Displaced Persons (Annex 7 to the 1995 Dayton Agreement).", "On 9 December 1999 the CRPC established that E.M. was the pre-war owner of the house in Banja Luka and annulled any involuntary transfer of ownership after 1 April 1992.", "On 22 August 2002 E.M. obtained an order enforcing the CRPC\u2019s decision from the Ministry of Refugees and Displaced Persons of the Republika Srpska. The applicant and his wife were ordered to vacate the house within 90 days and were entitled to alternative accommodation. They were instructed that an appeal against the order would not suspend the enforcement proceedings but that they could apply for suspension to the Banja Luka Court of First Instance (pursuant to section 12a of the Implementation of the Decisions of the Commission for Real Property Claims of Displaced Persons and Refugees Act 1999 \u2013 hereinafter \u201cthe 1999 Act\u201d).", "On 31 October 2002 the Ministry of Refugees and Displaced Persons of the Republika Srpska issued another order which replaced that of 22 August 2002. Pursuant to the new order, the applicant and his wife were to vacate the house within 15 days and were not entitled to alternative accommodation as the house in the vicinity of Visoko (of which the applicant\u2019s wife remained the registered owner regardless of the impugned exchange contract) was available to them. They were again instructed that an appeal against the order would not suspend the enforcement proceedings but that they could apply for suspension to the Banja Luka Court of First Instance within 30 days (pursuant to section 12a of the 1999 Act).", "The applicant and his wife appealed against the order of 31 October 2002 and applied for the suspension of the enforcement proceedings to the Banja Luka Court of First Instance. It would appear that they have not received any response.", "On 19 November 2002 the CRPC rejected a request for the reconsideration of its decision of 9 December 1999 which had been submitted by the applicant and his wife because they had not shown that E.M. was not the former owner of the house in Banja Luka. As to their submissions regarding the exchange contract, the CRPC referred them to the competent court.", "On 5 December 2002 the applicant and his wife were evicted from the house in Banja Luka.", "On 9 December 2002 the applicant complained about his eviction to the Human Rights Chamber which was set up by the Agreement on Human Rights (Annex 6 to the 1995 Dayton Agreement).", "On 11 December 2002 the applicant\u2019s wife moved to her house in the vicinity of Visoko. It would appear that the applicant has not followed her.", "On 4 March 2003 the Banja Luka Court of First Instance declared the exchange contract void ab initio as having been concluded under duress (in the context of large scale displacement and discrimination).", "On 4 April 2003 the applicant appealed to the Banja Luka District Court against that judgment claiming that E.M. and M.M. had not been forced to conclude the contract. He noted that his mother-in-law had remained in his wife\u2019s house in the vicinity of Visoko after the conclusion of the contract where she had allegedly been killed. It would appear that the appeal is still pending.", "On 13 November 2003 the applicant submitted an application for interim measures to the Banja Luka District Court asking to be reinstated in the house in Banja Luka pending his appeal against the judgment of 4 March 2003. It would appear that he has not received any response.", "On 1 December 2003 the applicant withdrew his application before the Human Rights Chamber. Therefore, the Human Rights Commission within the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the legal successor of the Human Rights Chamber) decided on 4 May 2004 to strike out the application.", "On 28 and 29 May 2001 the relevant administrative authorities expropriated a plot of land in front of the house in Banja Luka indicated above for the purpose of building a public road.", "On 22 January 2002 the Banja Luka District Court quashed the decision of 28 and 29 May 2001, in an administrative dispute, as the proceedings before the Banja Luka Court of First Instance concerning the validity of the exchange contract were still pending. The court also found that the contested decision did not establish certain relevant facts.", "On 25 August 2004 the Banja Luka Office of the Administration for Real Property Issues of the Republika Srpska decided to suspend the expropriation proceedings pending the proceedings concerning the validity of the exchange contract.", "On 13 September 2004 the Administration for Real Property Issues of the Republika Srpska upheld its Banja Luka Office\u2019s decision of 25 August 2004.", "On 29 September 2004 the applicant instituted administrative proceedings before the Supreme Court of the Republika Srpska challenging the legality of the decision of 13 September 2004. He complained because the land at issue had not been immediately expropriated (i.e. regardless of the proceedings concerning the validity of the exchange contract). It would appear that those proceedings are still pending.", "Three principal parties to the 1992-95 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (the then Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the then Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) signed the Dayton Agreement on 14 December 1995. It entered into force on the same day. There are twelve Annexes to the Agreement, including the Agreement on Human Rights (Annex 6) and the Agreement on Refugees and Displaced Persons (Annex 7).", "The Agreement on Human Rights was signed by Bosnia and Herzegovina (at the time, the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina), the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska on 14 December 1995, when it entered into force. For its relevant provisions see Jeli\u010di\u0107 v. Bosnia and Herzegovina ((dec.), no. 41183/02, ECHR 2005-...).", "The former Human Rights Chamber was set up pursuant to this Agreement. On 31 December 2003 it was replaced by the Human Rights Commission within the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina with a mandate to decide on cases received by the Human Rights Chamber up to that moment.", "In 2003 the former Human Rights Chamber delivered a decision in a case of an individual who had concluded a contract of exchange of houses with another individual during the 1992-95 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and who had been threatened with eviction from her home pending court proceedings relating to the validity of the contract of exchange (see Samard\u017ei\u0107, decision no. CH/02/9130 of 6 January 2003). Pending the proceedings before it, the former Human Rights Chamber applied interim measures suspending the eviction. Its final decision further suspended the eviction until a final decision of the competent court on the validity of the contract of exchange. The following is its relevant part concerning Articles 8 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights:", "\u201c55. This Law on Implementation of the Decisions of the Commission for Real Property Claims of Displaced Persons and Refugees in Article 12a contains a mechanism that allows the court seized with the dispute about the validity of the exchange contract to decide whether, in the specific case before it, the general aim of expeditious repossession of pre-war homes should prevail over the rights asserted on the basis of the exchange contract or not...", "56. The law appears to envision that the competent court, once it has been requested to issue an order provisionally halting the enforcement of the administrative repossession proceedings, will make a decision on the basis of the case file before it. The court will examine the prima facie strength of the arguments made and evidence presented by the two parties, the one asserting the validity of the exchange contract and the one claiming that it was concluded under duress. In this respect the court will require the side asserting the validity of the exchange to, as a minimum, \u201cshow evidence of a written contract\u201d on the exchange. The court will then take into account whether the party seeking suspension of the eviction can make credible that the deprivation of the possession of the home until the dispute about the contract is solved will cause irreparable harm to it. The Chamber is of the opinion that the mechanism envisaged by the law may be seen to strike a fair balance between the two parties to the dispute.", "57. However, in the case before the Chamber, the First Instance Court in Banja Luka has failed until today to decide on the, manifestly urgent, request for provisional measures by the applicant. As a result, the balance crafted by the legislator is overthrown and the applicant de facto deprived of all procedural safeguards. Under these circumstances, the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for her home does not comply with the requirement that it be \u201cnecessary in a democratic society for the protection of the rights of others\u201d, in this case of the pre-war owner M.J.", "...", "69. In the present case, although the applicant has requested that the First Instance Court in Banja Luka issue an order for provisional measures to prevent her eviction pending court proceedings on the validity of the exchange contract as provided for in Article 12a, due to the silence of the first instance court, the applicant is left without any other remedy to seek suspension of her eviction. The Banja Luka Court of First Instance has the power under Article 12a to order suspension, but it has failed to reply to the applicant\u2019s request for an interim measure. As of today the Court has not given any decision on the request for provisional measures. The respondent Party has confirmed the applicant\u2019s allegation that her case is just an instance of a general practice not to decide requests for provisional measures in cases like hers. The Chamber is of the opinion that under such circumstances, the applicant was deprived of her right under Article 13 to an effective remedy against the violation of her right to respect for her home.\u201d", "Following this decision, the Implementation of the Decisions of the Commission for Real Property Claims of Displaced Persons and Refugees Act 1999 has been amended. The relevant authorities will now suspend ex officio execution of the decisions of the Commission for Real Property Claims of Displaced Persons and Refugees in cases of exchanged houses pending court proceedings about the validity of the exchange (see \u201cImplementation of the Decisions of the Commission for Real Property Claims of Displaced Persons and Refugees Act 1999\u201d below).", "The Agreement on Refugees and Displaced Persons was signed by Bosnia and Herzegovina (at the time, the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina), the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska on 14 December 1995, when it entered into force. The following are its relevant provisions:", "\u201cAll refugees and displaced persons have the right freely to return to their homes of origin. They shall have the right to have restored to them property of which they were deprived in the course of hostilities since 1991 and to be compensated for any property that cannot be restored to them. The early return of refugees and displaced persons is an important objective of the settlement of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Parties confirm that they will accept the return of such persons who have left their territory, including those who have been accorded temporary protection by third countries.\u201d", "\u201cThe Parties hereby establish an independent Commission for Displaced Persons and Refugees (the \u201cCommission\u201d) ...\u201d", "\u201cThe Commission shall be composed of nine members. Within 90 days after this Agreement enters into force, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina shall appoint four members, two for a term of three years and the others for a term of four years, and the Republika Srpska shall appoint two members, one for a term of three years and the other for a term of four years. The President of the European Court of Human Rights shall appoint the remaining members, each for a term of five years, and shall designate one such member as the Chairman. The members of the Commission may be reappointed.\u201d", "\u201cThe Commission shall receive and decide any claims for real property in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the property has not voluntarily been sold or otherwise transferred since 1 April 1992, and where the claimant does not now enjoy possession of that property. Claims may be for return of the property or for just compensation in lieu of return.\u201d", "\u201cIn determining the lawful owner of any property, the Commission shall not recognize as valid any illegal property transaction, including any transfer that was made under duress, in exchange for exit permission or documents, or that was otherwise in connection with ethnic cleansing...\u201d", "\u201cCommission\u2019s decisions shall be final...\u201d", "Like the Human Rights Chamber, on 31 December 2003 the original Commission for Real Property Claims of Displaced Persons and Refugees ceased to exist. It has been subsequently replaced by a homonymous Commission which is composed of entirely Bosnia and Herzegovina citizens and financed by Bosnia and Herzegovina.", "This Act was enacted by the High Representative (an institution set up by the Agreement on Civilian Implementation \u2013 Annex 10 to the 1995 Dayton Agreement \u2013 to oversee the implementation of the civilian aspects of the Dayton Agreement on behalf of the international community). The Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council (a group of 55 states and international organisations that sponsor and direct the peace implementation process) nominates the High Representative. The United Nations Security Council, which approved the Dayton Agreement and the deployment of international troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina, then endorses the nomination, acting thereby under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. The Steering Board also provides the High Representative with political guidance. The Office of the High Representative is funded by the Peace Implementation Council. The current High Representative, Mr Schwarz-Schilling, is also the European Union\u2019s Special Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina (as was the previous one, Lord Ashdown).", "The Act has been in force since 28 October 1999.
