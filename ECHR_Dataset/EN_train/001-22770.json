In 1991 he was again admitted as a professional soldier. In accordance with the governmental Regulation No. 249/1992, in conjunction with the ExtraJudicial Rehabilitations Act of 1991, the period during which the applicant had been prevented, for political reasons, from serving as a professional soldier was to be considered as a period of service in the army when determining his salary and pension entitlements.", "On 1 January 1998 the Pecuniary Entitlements of Soldiers Act of 1997 entered into force. It provided, in Section 79, that the above Regulation No. 249/1992 should not be applicable in respect of professional soldiers. As a result, the applicant\u2019s salary and pension entitlements were considerably diminished since their amount depended on the period of time during which he had served in the army.", "On 27 February 1998 the Ministry of the Defence confirmed to the applicant, with reference to the Pecuniary Entitlements of Soldiers Act of 1997, that the period during which he had been prevented from serving in the army could no longer be taken into account when determining his salary and pension rights.", "On 24 March 1998 the president of a parliamentary committee confirmed the position to the applicant.

The letter concluded that the Constitutional Court could not entertain the applicant\u2019s complaint.", "On 25 August 1998 a judge of the Supreme Court informed the applicant that the Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction to make general comments on legal rules.", "On 9 September 1998 the Office of the Government admitted, in reply to the applicant\u2019s complaint, that there was an inconsistency between the Pecuniary Entitlements of Soldiers Act of 1997 and Section 180 of the Military Service Act of 1997, and that the relevant provisions had to be brought into conformity with the Constitution. The applicant was further informed that it was expected that the Ministry of the Defence would initiate a legislative amendment with a view to resolving the problem.", "The applicant requested the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office to bring proceedings with a view to having the alleged conflict between the Pecuniary Entitlements of Soldiers Act of 1997 and the Constitution determined by the Constitutional Court.

It governs the legal aspects of the exercise of military service and its cessation.", "Section 180 (1) provides that all periods of time during which a person was considered to have served in the army under rules in force prior to the enactment of the Military Service Act of 1997 shall be included in the overall duration of such a person\u2019s military service when determining his or her entitlements under that Act.", "Constitutional provisions and practice", "Pursuant to Article 127 of the Constitution, as in force at the relevant time, the Constitutional Court shall review the challenges to final decisions made by central government authorities, local government authorities and local self-government bodies in cases concerning violations of fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens, unless the protection of such rights falls under the jurisdiction of another court.", "Article 130 of the Constitution, as in force at the relevant time, provides as follows:", "\u201c1.
