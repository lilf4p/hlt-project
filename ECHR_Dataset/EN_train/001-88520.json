He is a co-chairman of the Kharkiv Human Rights Group (a human rights NGO registered in Kharkiv), and an Editor-in-Chief of a \u201cHuman Rights Bulletin\u201d (human rights magazine).", "On 31 August 2001 the applicant, in his capacity as the Editor-in-Chief of \u201cHuman Rights Bulletin\u201d, the co-Chairman of the Kharkiv Human Rights Group and referring to Articles 34 and 35 of the Information Act, requested the Prosecutor General to provide this non-governmental organisation with statistical data as to a number of judges and/or law enforcement officers convicted of bribery, ill-treatment of private persons and defamation in 1998 \u2013 2000 and the first semester of 2001. He further requested the Prosecutor General to confirm or to deny information disseminated in the 2000 US State Department Report on Ukraine. This report referred to statistical information disseminated by the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine in 1997.", "On 13 September 2001 the First Deputy Prosecutor General replied that such data was not available at the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office (hereafterGPO) and recommended the applicant to request it from the Ministry of Justice that was dealing with the judicial statistics.", "On 4 December 2001 the applicant, again acting in his official capacity as the Editor-in-Chief and the co-chairman of the Human Rights Group, requested the Prosecutor General to ensure that the regional prosecutor\u2019s offices provided responses to similar to the above requests that were sent to these offices. In particular, he mentioned that the Volyn, Zakarpattia, Mykolayiv, Poltava, Rivne and Chernigiv regional prosecutor\u2019s offices had replied to his requests. However, others did not reply or refused to provide such information.", "On 24 December 2001 the First Deputy Prosecutor General informed the applicant, as Editor-in-Chief of the \u201cHuman Rights Bulletin\u201d, that such statistical data was given not only by the regional prosecutor\u2019s offices, but by the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Justice, which transfer it to the State Committee on Statistics. He recommended the applicant to request this information from that committee on the grounds specified in the Statistics Act (Articles 8 and 9), which presumed that the applicant\u2019s organisation had to pay for this information, on the basis of the tariffs approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.", "On 14 January 2002 the applicant, acting in his official capacity, requested the State Statistics Committee to provide him with information of interest to the \u201cHuman Rights Bulletin\u201d. In reply, on 18 January 2002 the Deputy Head of the State Statistics Committee stated that such information, which was provided to the Committee by the law enforcement authorities, was not processed and regrouped in accordance with the previous employment of a convicted person at a law enforcement authority or prosecution service. As to the number of sentenced persons, the Deputy Head mentioned that this information was exclusively available from the Ministry of Justice.", "On 24 January 2002 the applicant, acting as a representative of the \u201cHuman Rights Bulletin\u201d and a co-chairman of the Kharkiv Human Rights Group, again requested the Prosecutor General to provide their mass media source with information he initially requested on 31 August 2001. He referred to Article 40 of the Constitution and Article 21 of the Information Act. He maintained that this information should be available from the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office as its function, under Article 121 of the Constitution, was to supervise lawfulness of functioning of the inquiry and pre-trial investigation bodies.", "On 8 February 2002 the First Deputy Prosecutor General refused to provide information requested by the applicant as it was not available from the prosecution bodies, but could be requested from the State Statistics Committee, under Articles 8 and 9 of the State Statistics Act. He also stated that therefore there were no grounds for instituting disciplinary proceedings against the officials of the regional prosecutor\u2019s offices who refused to provide this information.", "On 15 January and 9 February 2004, the applicant received information from four regional prosecutor\u2019s offices, which were unable to satisfy the applicant\u2019s information requests in full (because the information was unavailable, or not accessible as requested, or because the regional prosecutor\u2019s offices were not responsible for such matters). Only the Rivne Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office previously informed the applicant, on 25 October 2001, about measures taken by them with regard to the investigation and prosecution of the crimes referred to in the request.", "On 27 March 2002 the applicant, as a private person, represented by an advocate and acting under Articles 248-1 and 248-3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, lodged an administrative complaint with the Pechersky District Court of Kyiv seeking to declare the failure of the GPO to provide him with information on convictions (mentioned above) unlawful. He also sought court orders compelling the GPO to provide him with this information on his request. He maintained that his right to receive information from the GPO had been violated.", "On 4 April 2002 the Pechersky Court refused to examine the applicant\u2019s claim as it was not substantiated by relevant evidence (Article 137 of the Code of Civil Procedure). Furthermore, the applicant was asked to provide relevant legal substantiation for his administrative action. In particular, the court asked the applicant to state how his rights and freedoms had been infringed by the refusal of the GPO to reply to information request. The applicant was allowed time to rectify these shortcomings and re-lodged his administrative complaint with the assistance of his legal representative. However, on 19 April 2002 the Pechersky Court rejected his complaint as it found inter alia that the applicant failed to establish a link between infringement of his rights and the refusal of the prosecution authorities to provide information to the human rights magazine.", "The applicant appealed to the Kyiv City Court of Appeal, which on 27 June 2002 rejected the appeal as unsubstantiated. In particular, the Court of Appeal held that the applicant should indicate specifically, in his complaints, which public official or administrative body had infringed his personal rights. He had also failed to mention which of his rights and freedoms were violated. The court also referred to the judicial practice recommendation contained in the Resolution no. 13 of the Plenary Supreme Court of 3 December 1997 (sees domestic law and practice below).", "The applicant appealed in cassation, but on 11 October 2002 the Pechersky Court refused the applicant leave to appeal in cassation as the cassation appeal did not comply with the requirements envisaged by Articles 322 and 323 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The applicant was invited to rectify these shortcomings. He lodged his appeal in cassation anew and on 23 October 2002 the Pechersky Court refused leave to appeal in cassation as the applicant again failed to comply with the court\u2019s previous ruling. The applicant lodged a cassation appeal for the third time and on 23 March 2003 the Pechersky Court rejected it for failure to comply with the requirements of the law.", "The cassation appeal was re-lodged, examined and rejected by the Supreme Court on 12 March 2004.
