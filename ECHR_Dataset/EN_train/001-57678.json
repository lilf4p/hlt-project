FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 5-3;No violation of Art. 5-4;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["8. Mrs Monique Merdy, n\u00e9e Letellier, a French national residing at La Varenne Saint-Hilaire (Val-de-Marne), took over a bar-restaurant in March 1985. The mother of eight children from two marriages, she was separated from her second husband, Mr Merdy, a petrol pump attendant, and at the material time was living with a third man.", "9. On 6 July 1985 Mr Merdy was killed by a shot fired from a car. A witness had taken down the registration number of the vehicle and on the same day the police detained Mr G\u00e9rard Moysan, who was found to be in possession of a pump-action shotgun. He admitted that he had fired the shot, but stated that he had acted on the applicant\u2019s instructions. He claimed that she had agreed to pay him, and one of his friends, Mr Michel Bredon - who also accused the applicant -, the sum of 40,000 French francs for killing her husband and that she had advanced him 2,000 francs for the purchase of the weapon.", "Mrs Letellier denied these accusations although she admitted having seen the murder weapon, having declared in public that she wished to get rid of her husband and having given her agreement \"without thinking too much about it\" to Mr Moysan who had proposed to carry out the deed. She maintained, moreover, that she had given 2,000 francs to Mr Moysan, whom she described as \"a poor kid\", so that he could buy a motor car.", "10. On 8 July 1985, in the course of the first examination, the investigating judge of the tribunal de grande instance (Regional Court) of Cr\u00e9teil charged the applicant with being an accessory to murder and remanded her in custody.", "11. On 20 December 1985 the applicant sought her release arguing that there was no serious evidence of her guilt. She claimed in addition that she possessed all the necessary guarantees that she would appear for trial: her home, the business, which she ran single-handed, and her eight children, some of whom were still dependent on her.", "12. On 24 December 1985 the investigating judge ordered her release subject to court supervision; she gave the following grounds for her decision:", "\"... at this stage of the proceedings detention is no longer necessary for the process of establishing the truth; ... although the accused provides guarantees that she will appear for trial which are sufficient to warrant her release, court supervision would seem appropriate.\"", "He ordered the applicant not to go outside certain territorial limits without prior authorisation, to report to him once a week on a fixed day and at a fixed time, to appear before him when summoned, to comply with restrictions concerning her business activities and to refrain from receiving visits from or meeting four named persons and from entering into contact with them in any way whatsoever.", "Thereupon the guardianship judge (juge des tutelles) returned custody of her four minor children to Mrs Letellier.", "13. On appeal by the Cr\u00e9teil public prosecutor, the indictments division (chambre d\u2019accusation) of the Paris Court of Appeal set aside the order on 22 January 1986, declaring that it would thereafter exercise sole jurisdiction on questions concerning the detention. It noted in particular as follows:", "\"...", "The file contains ... considerable evidence suggesting that the accused was an accessory to murder, which is an exceptionally serious criminal offence having caused a major disturbance to public order, the gravity of which cannot diminish in the short lapse of time of six months.", "The investigations are continuing and it is necessary to prevent any manoeuvre capable of impeding the establishment of the truth.", "In addition, in view of the severity of the sentence to which she is liable at law, there are grounds for fearing that she may seek to evade the prosecution brought against her.", "No measure of court supervision would be effective in these various respects.", "Ultimately detention on remand remains the sole means of preventing pressure being brought to bear on the witnesses.", "It is necessary in order to protect public order from the disturbance caused by the offence and to ensure that the accused remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities.", "... .\"", "As a result, the applicant, who had been released on 24 December 1985, returned to prison on 22 January 1986.", "14. At the hearing on 16 January 1986 Mrs Letellier had filed a defence memorial. In it she stressed that she had waited until the main phase of the investigation had been concluded before lodging her application for release; thus all the witnesses had been heard by the police or by the investigating judge, two series of confrontations with Mr Moysan had taken place and all the commissions rogatoires had been executed. She noted in addition that Article 144 et seq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure in no way regarded the gravity of the alleged offences as one of the conditions for placing and keeping an accused in pre-trial detention and that the parties seeking damages (parties civiles) had not filed any observations on learning of her release. She urged the indictments division to confirm the order of 24 December 1985 releasing her subject to court supervision and stated that she had no intention whatsoever of evading the prosecution, that she would comply scrupulously with the court supervision, that she could provide firm guarantees that she would appear in court and that further imprisonment would destroy, both financially and emotionally, a whole family, whose sole head she remained.", "15. Mrs Letellier filed an appeal which the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation dismissed on 21 April 1986 on the following grounds:", "\"...", "In setting aside the order for the release subject to court supervision of Monique Merdy, n\u00e9e Letellier, accused of being an accessory to the murder of her husband, the indictments division, after having set out the facts and noted the existence of divergences between her statements and the various testimonies obtained, observed that the offence had caused a disturbance to public order which had not yet diminished, that, as the investigation was continuing, it was important to prevent any manoeuvre likely to impede the establishment of the truth and bring pressure to bear on the witnesses, and that the severity of the sentence to which the accused was liable at law raised doubts as to whether she would appear for trial if she were released; the indictments division considered that no measure of court supervision could be effective in these various respects;", "That being so the Court of Cassation is able to satisfy itself that the indictments division ordered the continued detention of Monique Merdy, n\u00e9e Letellier, by a decision stating specific grounds with reference to the particular circumstances and for cases provided for in Articles 144 and 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure;", "... .\"", "16. On 24 January 1986 the applicant again requested her release; the indictments division of the Paris Court of Appeal dismissed her application by a decision of 12 February 1986, similar to its earlier decision (see paragraph 13 above).", "17. On an appeal by Mrs Letellier, the Court of Cassation set aside this decision on 13 May 1986 on the ground that the rights of the defence had been infringed as neither the applicant nor her counsel had been notified of the date of the hearing fixed for the examination of the application. It remitted the case to the indictments division of the Paris Court of Appeal, composed differently.", "18. The latter indictments division dismissed the application on 17 September 1986. It considered that there were \"in the light of the evidence ..., serious grounds for suspecting that the accused had been an accessory to murder\". It took the view that \"under these circumstances ..., the accused\u2019s detention [was] necessary, having regard to the seriousness of the offence ... and the length of the sentence [which she risked], in order to ensure that she remain[ed] at the disposal of the judicial authorities and to maintain public order\".", "It also dismissed the complaints based on a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 (art. 5-3, art. 5-4) of the Convention, stressing that these complaints were not based on any provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that it had taken its decision with due dispatch in accordance with that code.", "19. At the hearing on 16 September 1986, Mrs Letellier had submitted a defence memorial. In it she requested the indictments division to order her release \"because her application for release had not been heard within a reasonable time\" within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 3 (art. 5-3) of the Convention and to take formal note that she did not object to being placed under court supervision.", "20. On an appeal by Mrs Letellier, the Court of Cassation overturned this decision on 23 December 1986. It found that the Court of Appeal had not answered the submissions concerning the failure to respect the \"reasonable time\" referred to in Article 5 \u00a7 3 (art. 5-3).", "21. On 17 March 1987 the indictments division of the Amiens Court of Appeal dismissed the application, which had been remitted to it, on the following grounds:", "\"...", "... the charges are indeed based on sufficient, relevant and objective evidence despite the accused\u2019s claim to the contrary;", "Having regard to the complexity of the case and to the investigative measures which it necessitates, the time taken to conduct the investigation remains reasonable for the purposes of the European Convention, with reference to the dates on which Mrs Letellier was placed in detention and had her detention extended; the proceedings have never been neglected, as examination of the file shows;", "Mrs Letellier\u2019s complaint that a reasonable time has been exceeded is also directed against the time taken to hear her application for release ... and she infers therefrom, by analogy with Articles 194 and 574-1 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure, that such a decision should have been taken within a period of between thirty days and three months;", "However, none of the provisions of that code which are expressly applicable to the present dispute has been infringed and it must be recognised that the period of time which elapsed between the date of the application and that of the present judgment is only the inevitable result of the various appeals filed;", "Finally the applicant\u2019s continued detention on remand remains necessary to preserve public order from the disturbance caused by such a - according to the present state of the investigation - decisive act of incitement to the murder of Mr Merdy; the extent of such disturbance, to the whole community, is not determined only on the basis of the reactions of the victim\u2019s entourage, contrary to what the defence claims ... . \"", "22. The applicant filed an appeal on points of law. She relied inter alia on Article 5 \u00a7 3 (art. 5-3) of the Convention, claiming that the indictments division had \"failed to consider whether detention lasting more than twenty-two months, when the investigation [was] not yet concluded, exceeded a reasonable time\". She also alleged violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (art. 5-4) inasmuch as the eighty-three days which had elapsed between the judgment of the Court of Cassation on 23 December 1986 and the judgment of the court to which the application was remitted could not be regarded as satisfying the requirement of speediness.", "The Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal on 15 June 1987 on the following grounds:", "\"...", "In order to reply to the accused\u2019s submissions based on the provisions of Article 5 \u00a7 3 (art. 5-3) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which she had claimed had been infringed, the court to which the application was remitted found that, in relation to the dates on which Monique Letellier had been placed in detention on remand and had her detention extended, having regard to the complexity of the case and the necessary investigative measures, the proceedings had been conducted within a reasonable time within the meaning of the above-mentioned Convention; it found that the time which had elapsed between the date of her application for release of 24 January 1986 and that of the present judgment was only the inevitable result of the various appeals filed, cited in the judgment;", "Moreover, in dismissing this application for release and ordering the accused\u2019s continued detention on remand, the indictments division, after having referred to the grounds for suspicion against Monique Letellier, noted that the latter denied having been an accessory in any way although the declarations in turn of the two main witnesses conflict with the accused\u2019s version. According to the indictments division, it remains necessary to keep the accused in detention on remand in order to protect public order from the disturbance to which incitement to the murder of a husband gives rise;", "In the light of the foregoing statements, the Court of Cassation is able to satisfy itself that the indictments division, before which no submissions based on the provisions of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (art. 5-4) of the European Convention were raised and which was not bound by the requirements of Article 145-1, sub-paragraph 3, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which do not apply in proceedings concerning more serious criminal offences (mati\u00e8re criminelle", "... .\"", "23. During the investigation, the applicant submitted six other applications for release: on 14 February, 21 March, 19 November and 15 December 1986 and then on 31 March and 5 August 1987. The indictments division of the Paris Court of Appeal dismissed them on 5 March, 10 April, 5 December and 23 December 1986 and on 10 April and 24 August 1987 respectively. It based its decisions on the following grounds:", "Judgment of 5 March 1986", "\"...", "The file thus contains considerable evidence suggesting that the accused was an accessory to murder, which is an exceptionally serious criminal offence having caused a major disturbance to public order, the gravity of which cannot diminish in the short lapse of time of seven months.", "The investigations are continuing and it is necessary to prevent any manoeuvre capable of impeding the establishment of the truth.", "In addition, in view of the severity of the sentence to which she is liable at law, there are grounds for fearing that she may seek to evade the prosecution brought against her.", "No measure of court supervision would be effective in these various respects.", "Ultimately, detention on remand remains the sole means of preventing pressure being brought to bear on the witnesses.", "It is necessary to protect public order from the disturbance caused by the offence and to ensure that the accused remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities.", "... .\"", "Judgments of 10 April and 5 December 1986", "Identical to the preceding decision - itself very similar to that of 22 January 1986 (see paragraph 13 above) - except that the sixth paragraph was not included and that the first paragraph ended at the word \"accessory\".", "Judgment of 23 December 1986", "\"...", "In these circumstances there are strong indications of Mrs Merdy\u2019s guilt, indications which were moreover noted most recently by a judgment of this indictments division dated 5 December 1986.", "The acts which Mrs Merdy is alleged to have carried out seriously disturbed public order and this disturbance persists. In addition there is a risk that, if she were to be freed, she would, in view of the severity of the sentence to which she is liable, seek to evade the criminal proceedings brought against her.", "The constraints of court supervision would be inadequate in this instance.", "The detention on remand of Mrs Merdy is necessary to preserve public order from the disturbance caused by the offence and to ensure that she remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities.", "... .\"", "Judgment of 10 April 1987", "\"...", "There are strong indications of Monique Letellier\u2019s guilt, having regard to the consistency of Mr Moysan\u2019s statements.", "No new item of evidence has as yet been brought to the court\u2019s attention such as would be capable of altering the situation as regards Monique Letellier\u2019s incarceration.", "The continuation of her detention on remand remains necessary to preserve public order from the serious disturbance caused by the offence and to ensure that she will appear for trial.", "The constraints of court supervision would clearly be inadequate to attain these objectives.", "... .\"", "Judgment of 24 August 1987", "\"...", "In the present state of the proceedings, Monique Letellier is the subject of an order for the forwarding of documents to the principal public prosecutor dated 8 July 1987 made by the Cr\u00e9teil investigating judge, which gives grounds for supposing that the investigation is close to conclusion so that the competent court will be able to give judgment within a reasonable time.", "In consequence the detention on remand is absolutely necessary on account of the particularly serious disturbance caused by the offence.", "It is to be feared that Mrs Letellier will seek to evade trial, having regard to the severity of the sentence which she risks.", "It is consequently essential that the accused remains in detention in order to ensure that she is at the disposal of the trial court.", "The guarantees of court supervision would clearly be inadequate to attain these objectives.", "... .\"", "24. In the defence memorials which she submitted at the hearings on 23 December 1986, 3 March 1987 and 10 April 1987, Mrs Letellier stressed the contradictions in the investigation and the statements of the witnesses. Moreover, she contested the arguments put forward to justify the extension of her detention. She maintained that, once released, she would remain at the disposal of the judicial authorities and that public order would in no way be threatened; she would comply scrupulously with any court supervision; she would provide very firm guarantees for her appearance in court and her continued detention would destroy emotionally and financially a whole family, whose sole head she remained. She claimed the benefit of the presumption of innocence, a fundamental and inviolable principle of French law.", "In her memorial of 3 March 1987, the applicant also invoked Article 5 \u00a7 3 (art. 5-3) of the Convention. She noted that \"... in accordance with the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, the grounds given in the decision(s) concerning the application(s) for release, on the one hand, taken together with the true facts indicated by [her] in her applications, on the other, [made] it possible [for her] to affirm that those grounds contained both in the judgment ... of 12 February 1986 and in the preceding judgment of 22 January 1986 and in the subsequent judgments [were] neither relevant nor sufficient\". She added that the parties seeking damages, the victim\u2019s mother and sister, had not formulated any observations when she had filed her applications for release of December 1985, January, February, March, November and December 1986, whereas they had energetically opposed those of Mr Moysan; she reiterated this last argument in her memorial of 10 April 1987.", "25. The case followed its course. On 26 May 1987 the investigating judge made an order terminating the investigation and transmitting the papers to the public prosecutor\u2019s office. On 1 July the Cr\u00e9teil public prosecutor lodged his final submissions calling for the file to be transmitted to the principal public prosecutor\u2019s office of the Court of Appeal. This was ordered by the investigating judge on 8 July.", "26. On 26 August 1987 the indictments division committed the applicant for trial on a charge of", "\"having, in the course of 1985 in Val-de-Marne, being less than ten years ago, been an accessory to the premeditated murder of Bernard Merdy committed on 6 July 1985 by G\u00e9rard Moysan, inasmuch as she had by gifts, promises, threats, misuse of authority or power, incited the commission of this deed or given instructions for its commission\".", "27. On 9 September 1987 the Cr\u00e9teil public prosecutor\u2019s office advised Mrs Letellier\u2019s counsel that \"the case [was] liable to be heard during the first quarter of 1988\". By a letter of 21 October 1987, however, the lawyer in question gave notice that he would be unavailable from 1 February to 15 March 1988 on account of his participation in another trial before the Assize Court of the Vienne d\u00e9partement.", "28. On 23 March 1988 the public prosecutor informed the accused\u2019s lawyer that the case would be heard on 9 and 10 May 1988. On 10 May 1988 the Val-de-Marne Assize Court sentenced Mrs Letellier to three years\u2019 imprisonment for being an accessory to murder. It sentenced Mr Moysan to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment for murder and acquitted Mr Bredon.", "The applicant did not file an appeal on points of law; she was released on 17 May 1988, the pre-trial detention being automatically deducted from the sentence (Article 24 of the Criminal Code).", "29.
