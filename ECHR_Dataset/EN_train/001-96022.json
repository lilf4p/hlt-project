He was born in 1965 and is represented by Mr J. Welch, a solicitor with Liberty, a non-governmental civil liberties organisation based London. The second applicant is Ms Maya Evans. She is represented by Mr M. Schwartz of Bindmans Solicitors, London. Both are British nationals and live in East Sussex.", "s, may be summarised as follows.", "s", "On 25 October 2005 the first applicant participated in a demonstration, which he had organised, in Whitehall opposite Downing Street, a \u201cdesignated area\u201d within the meaning of section 138 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (\u201cthe 2005 Act\u201d). The second applicant also participated in it.", "Prior to 25 October 2005 the first applicant had informed the police orally that the demonstration was going to be held, he gave the time, date and place of the demonstration and (politely) informed the police that an authorisation would not be sought. He had also posted information the day before the demonstration on a website confirming that it was not authorised so that the risk of arrest was high and that, in fact, he had been informed by the police that he would be arrested under the 2005 Act. The second applicant was also aware prior to the relevant date that authorisation had not been sought so that demonstrating in that area would be an offence. The High Court later noted that the demonstration was just as much a demonstration against the requirement for an authorisation under the 2005 Act as against the Iraqi conflict. The Magistrates\u2019 Court (in its case stated to the High Court in the first applicant\u2019s case) noted police evidence to the effect that, had authorisation been sought, no conditions would have attached to it.", "At the demonstration, the first applicant read out names of Iraqi citizens killed in the Iraqi conflict and the second applicant read out names of British soldiers killed in that conflict. Placards were displayed about the Iraq conflict and a bell was rung at regular intervals. The applicants behaved in a peaceful and orderly manner throughout. The police attended at the demonstration and warned the applicants that they would be arrested and charged if they continued given the lack of an authorisation. The police then withdrew to enable the applicants to stop the demonstration. They chose to continue.", "The first and second applicants were therefore arrested, detained in the police station for a number of hours and charged: the first applicant for having organised an unauthorised demonstration in a designated area contrary to section 132(1)(a) of the 2005 Act and the second for having participated in the same demonstration contrary to section 132 (1)(b) of that Act. It appears that both were granted police bail: the documents submitted do not indicate that bail was subject to any conditions (apart from appearing before the Magistrates\u2019 Court on the relevant date).", "Before the Magistrates\u2019 Court the applicants argued that section 132(1) (a) and (b) of the 2005 Act were not compatible with Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention. Unless those provisions were interpreted compatibly with those Articles, their convictions would be unlawful. The Magistrates\u2019 Court found that the relevant sections were necessary and proportionate restrictions of the applicant\u2019s rights under Articles 10 and 11. In any event, additional words could not be read into the sections as that would run counter to legislative intent. The convictions would not therefore be unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998. The applicants were convicted as charged on 7 December 2005 and 16 March 2006, respectively. The first applicant was sentenced to a fine of 350 pounds sterling (GBP) and ordered to contribute to prosecution costs in the sum of GBP150 and the second applicant was sentenced to a conditional discharge of 12 months and to contribute to costs in the sum of GBP100.", "The applicants appealed by way of a case stated to the High Court. They conceded that section 132(1)(a) and (b) was not incompatible with Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention but argued that the relevant State actors (the police, the Crown Prosecution Service and the courts) should have been required to justify the necessity to act (arrest, prosecute and convict) on the facts of each individual case. Accordingly, those authorities should have looked not merely at whether there was an authorisation but also at the later peaceful conduct of the actual demonstration. Since the Magistrates\u2019 Court had not considered the justification for their conviction along those lines, their arrest, prosecution and conviction were contrary to their Convention rights.", "By judgment dated 20 December 2006, the High Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeals (and the appeals of two others, Blum and Others v Director of Public Prosecutions [20061 EWHC 3209 (Admin)). It noted that the only charge against the applicants was demonstrating without an authorisation. The High Court considered that the reasoning in the case of Ziliberberg v. Moldova (no. 61821/00, 4 may 2004) was compelling. Nothing in the other Convention or domestic jurisprudence opened to the High Court undermined that reasoning. Those Convention and domestic cases rather raised various public order, safety and security issues (Plattform \u201c\u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben\u201d v. Austria, 21 June 1988, Series A no. 139; Ezelin v. France, 26 April 1991, Series A no. 202; and Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden v. Bulgaria, nos. 29221/95 and 29225/95, ECHR 2001IX, as well as G. v. the Federal Republic of Germany, no. 13079/87, Commission decision of 6 March 1989, 60 Decisions and Reports (\u201cDR\u201d), 256; and \u00c7iraklar v. Turkey, No. 19601/92, Commission Decision of 28 October 1998, 80-B DR 46). Accordingly, once it was accepted that the section requiring the authorisation was compatible with Article 10 and 11 (as the applicants did), the High Court was not required to look at the nature of the activity actually pursued thereafter without authorisation in order to determine whether a sanction should be imposed. Once an authorisation procedure was Article 11 compliant, Parliament was entitled to impose sanctions for a failure to obtain authorisations. The High Court refused to certify a point of law of general public importance for the House of Lords.", "B.
