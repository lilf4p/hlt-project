On 13 September 2006 the applicant\u2019s lawyer filed a motion with the Sok\u00f3\u0142ka District Court referring to the Bia\u0142ystok District Court\u2019s decision and asking for the applicant\u2019s release.", "11.

He submits that on his arrival he was examined by a doctor who stated that there was no need to keep him in hospital. However, the applicant was ordered to stay in the hospital. The Government submit that the applicant was ordered to stay in the hospital as there were strong medical grounds justifying his detention.", "17. On 8 January 2007 the applicant lodged an interlocutory appeal against the decision to admit him to hospital. He argued that his placement in the psychiatric hospital had not been necessary.
