The applicant was born in 1938 and lives in Chi\u015fin\u0103u.", "6. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "7. In 1985 the applicant published the photograph 'Soroca Castle' in the album Poliptic Moldav. He received author's fees for that photograph.", "8. In 1996 the Government adopted a decision regarding national identity cards using, inter alia, the photograph taken by the applicant as a background for the identity cards issued by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Moldova (\u201cthe Ministry\u201d). The applicant was not consulted and did not agree to such a use of the photograph.", "9. In 1998 he requested the Ministry to compensate him for the infringement of his rights caused by the unlawful use of the photograph he had taken, as well as to conclude a contract with him for the future use of the photograph.", "10. When his request was rejected, the applicant initiated court proceedings against the Ministry on 10 November 1998. On 24 March 1999 the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Regional Court partly allowed his claims and found that he had been the author of the photograph which had been used without his agreement. The court awarded him 4,050 Moldovan lei (MDL), equivalent to 568 United States dollars (USD). The court also obliged the Ministry to publish an apology but rejected the applicant's request that the Ministry be ordered to conclude a contract with him for the future use of the photograph.", "11. The applicant appealed. He submitted, inter alia, that the reason why he had not asked for the withdrawal of the identity cards already issued in infringement of his rights and for new identity cards using the photograph taken by him not to be issued in the future was that this would have incurred unreasonably high costs for the Ministry and would have caused unnecessary problems for identity card holders. He had therefore requested the conclusion of a contract with the Ministry.", "12. On 16 September 1999 the Court of Appeal quashed the lower court's judgment and rejected the applicant's requests.", "13. On 22 December 1999 the Supreme Court of Justice quashed the Court of Appeal's judgment and upheld the judgment of the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Regional Court as regards the award to the applicant, while rejecting his request for an apology to be published. The court also ordered a re-examination of the case as regards the conclusion of a contract with the applicant for the future use of the photograph since, in its opinion, he had such a right.", "14. From 1 May 2000 the Ministry ceased using the photograph taken by the applicant as a background for identity cards.", "15. In a new set of proceedings the applicant requested compensation for the financial loss caused by the continued unlawful use of his photograph between the date of the judgment, 24 March 1999, and 1 May 2000. Since more than 260,000 identity cards had been issued during the relevant period, he claimed 10% of the amount paid by the identity cards' owners to the State (MDL 2,403,137). He also claimed compensation for infringement of his moral rights (MDL 200,000).", "16. On 6 November 2001 the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Regional Court awarded the applicant MDL 180,000 in compensation for pecuniary damage and MDL 3,600 for non-pecuniary damage, while rejecting his request to oblige the Ministry to conclude a contract with him.", "17. On 26 March 2002 the Court of Appeal quashed that judgment and rejected the applicant's claims. The court found that, while the applicant's authorship of the relevant photograph had been clearly established, he had been compensated by the judgment of 24 March 1999. Since the court had not prohibited the use of the photograph in future and since the applicant himself had not requested such a prohibition, the identity cards already issued or any cards issued in the future were no longer covered by the Copyright and Related Rights Act 1994 (\u201cthe 1994 Act\u201d) (no.293-XII) (see paragraph 19 below). Accordingly, the applicant could not allege an infringement of his rights.", "18. On 16 October 2002 the Supreme Court of Justice essentially repeated the reasons given in the judgment of the Court of Appeal and rejected an appeal by the applicant on points of law. While confirming the applicant's intellectual property rights in respect of the photograph he had taken, it added that an identity card was an official document which could not be subject to copyright.", "19. The relevant provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act (no. 293-XI) of 23 November 1994 read as follows:", "\u201cSection 4", "(4) The author's rights do not depend on the property right over the material object in which the relevant protected work is embodied.
