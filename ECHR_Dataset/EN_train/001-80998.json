A., accused Valeriu Matei, the then Vice-President of Parliament and President of one of the political parties represented in Parliament, of corruption and, together with a mafia gang, of protecting several companies allegedly involved in criminal activities. He stated, inter alia, that:", "\u201c...Mr Matei should have been arrested as he has committed both a criminal offence and a minor administrative offence... A criminal file concerning protecting criminals will be sent to the Prosecutor's Office and to the court... These companies [which were suspected of being involved in criminal activities] are being protected by the criminal gang headed by M. and by Mr Matei from Parliament...\u201d", "6. On 30 March 1999 Flux published an article entitled \u201cThe anti-corruption war: General N.A. versus President Matei.

The article contained a word-by-word account of the televised broadcast of 27 March 1999 and the newspaper's commentary.", "8. On 30 April 1999 Valeriu Matei brought a civil defamation action against Flux and argued that a large number of N.A.'s statements published by Flux were untrue and defamatory of him. The title of the article was not among those statements.", "9. On 20 February 2003, by a final judgment, the Court of Appeal found that the statements complained of by Valeriu Matei were not defamatory of him, inter alia, because Flux had simply reproduced N.A.'s statements. However, it found that the following part of the article's title was defamatory of Valeriu Matei: \u201cN.A. claims that Valeriu Matei is providing political protection to a mafia clan\u201d. The court found that no such sentence had been pronounced by N.A. during the broadcast of 27 March 1999 and that the newspaper had not adduced evidence to prove that Valeriu Matei was a member of a mafia clan. The court ordered the newspaper to pay the plaintiff 3,600 Moldovan Lei (MDL) and to issue an apology within fifteen days. The newspaper was also ordered to pay the court fees.", "10.
