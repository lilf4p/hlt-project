The applicant was born in 1976 and lives in Toru\u0144. As it appears from the documents submitted, he is currently detained in the Toru\u0144 Remand Centre.", "6. On 29 August 2002 the applicant was detained and subsequently remanded in custody by the Che\u0142mno District Court on charges of rape and murder by a detention order of 31 August 2002. The latter was upheld on 18 September 2002 by the Toru\u0144 Regional Court.", "7. On several occasions, namely 25 November 2002, 25 February, 28 May, 29 September 2003 and 21 January 2004 the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention was prolonged. The Toru\u0144 Regional Court relied in its decisions on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences and on the severity of the likely sentence. According to its reasoning, the applicant\u2019s detention was the only measure which could secure the proper conduct of the proceedings in view of the extensive body of evidence which was to be considered in the case. The court stressed that the evidence already collected in the case, including mechanoscopic and olfactory expert opinions, comparative hair analysis, testimonies of witnesses and an experimental reconstruction of the crime scene indicated a high probability that the applicant had committed the crimes. Moreover, a psychiatrist\u2019s examination and the observation of the applicant in a mental institution had been ordered by the court, as well as a genetic and chemical comparative analysis of available evidence. The court further added that the applicant had a previous criminal record.", "8. The applicant submitted that his appeals against some of the above decisions were dismissed by the Gda\u0144sk Court of Appeal on 18 December 2002, 18 March, 11 June 2003 and 25 February 2004.", "9.

On 10 July 2003 the first hearing in the applicant\u2019s case was scheduled for 20 August 2003; however the start of the trial had to be postponed, since the applicant\u2019s counsel had asked the court to relieve him of his duties. The newly ex officio appointed lawyer informed the court that he was not able to fulfil his duties, as he had earlier been appointed as counsel of the auxiliary prosecutors \u2013 the victim\u2019s parents. The Toru\u0144 Regional Bar immediately appointed another lawyer at the request of the court.", "11. On 1 August 2003 the applicant\u2019s counsel requested that the composition of the court to hear the applicant\u2019s case be decided by the drawing of lots.", "12. On 28 November 2003 the court scheduled the first hearings for 22 and 23 December 2003.

On 24 May 2004 the applicant requested the withdrawal of the presiding judge. His motion was dismissed by the Toru\u0144 Regional Court on the same day.", "15. Between 21 September and 23 November 2004 the Toru\u0144 Regional Court held 7 hearings. On 25 November 2004 the applicant\u2019s detention on remand was extended until 28 February 2005.", "16.

The applicant, the prosecutor, as well as the auxiliary prosecutors, appealed.", "19. On 30 May 2006 the Gda\u0144sk Court of Appeal quashed the judgment and remitted the case for re-examination to the Toru\u0144 Regional Court. The proceedings are still pending. The applicant is still in detention in respect of the charges against him.", "20. On 16 May 2002 the applicant was sentenced to 4 years and 6 months\u2019 imprisonment for double rape.", "21. On 5 February 2003 the Regional Court upheld the first\u2013instance judgment.", "22. As it transpires from the Government\u2019s submissions, which were not contested by the applicant, he was serving the sentence imposed between 10 June 2003 and 9 February 2004, as well as between 29 February 2004 and 9 September 2007.", "23.
