He advised the applicant to apply to a court for a declaration of nullity of the transaction and for compensation for the pecuniary damage.", "On 29 January 1998 the Nizhegorodskiy District Court of Nizhniy Novgorod found for Zh. It held that the sale of the Artelnaya Street flat had been void ab initio. Zh. retained title to that flat but was ordered to repay the purchase price to the applicant.

It found that Zh. was responsible for the fact that the applicant had not received in good time the amount due to her under the judgment of 29 January 1998. Moreover, although the applicant had become aware of the sale of the October Boulevard flat long before the judgment of 29 January 1998 was issued, she had not sought alternative interim measures. Hence, the Registration Directorate was not liable for the damage incurred by the applicant through Zh.\u2019s persistent failure to repay the purchase price.", "On 2 October 2001 the Nizhniy Novgorod Regional Court upheld the judgment, relying on the following grounds:", "\u201cAs the charging order in respect of Zh.\u2019s flat on the October Boulevard was issued on 13 September 1996, whereas Zh. sold the flat on 16 September 1996, at the moment of the sale the charging order had not yet become effective (the time-limit for lodging an appeal had not expired) and therefore Zh. could sell the flat; moreover, the court rightly found that at the moment of the sale [of the flat] the judgment debt had not yet arisen. The judgment was given on 29 January 1998, but only became effective in April 1998.", "Between the date the judgment became effective and the date the enforcement began Zh. could dispose of the contested flat. Thus, it appears from the case file, even before Zh.\u2019s claim was granted, [the applicant] had become aware of the sale of the flat but had failed to undertake any measures.\u201d", "The Regional Court confirmed the findings of the District Court as to the absence of the fault on the part of the Registration Directorate and Registration Agency.", "Article 133 of the RSFSR Code of Civil Procedure of 11 June 1964 (effective until 1 February 2003) provided that a judge could order an interim measure at the request of a party or of his own initiative. Interim measures may include, in particular, a charging order in respect of the defendant\u2019s property (Article 134).", "An interim measure was to be implemented immediately in accordance with the procedure set out for enforcement of judgments (Article 137). An appeal lay against the decision indicating an interim measure; the lodging of an appeal did not suspend the implementation of the measure (Article 139).", "A State agency or a State official shall be liable to a citizen for damage caused by their unlawful actions or failures to act. Such damage is to be compensated for at the expense of the federal or regional treasury (Article 1069 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation)."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
