In 1996 the T association and another association founded the Techno-Z FH Forschungs- und Entwicklungs-GmbH (hereafter \u201cTechno-Z FH\u201d). This non-profit company was to promote and offer scientific support to the development of the information and communication society by conducting research projects and scientific studies in this field, by offering training, organising public presentations, editing publications and carrying out projects with other similar institutions. Techno-Z FH was sponsored by, inter alia,the Region of Salzburg.", "7. In May 1999 Mr Dollh\u00e4ubl, chairman of the T association at the time, was dismissed.

At the 1998 audit the auditors almost fell off their chair. Bruck had no valid employment contract at that time; according to his old contract, he would have earned a gross salary of approximately ATS 72,000. But the \u201cmedia-professor\u201d had transferred himself ATS 80,000 per month and a further \u201cpremium\u201d of ATS 10,000. It was not possible to ascertain by which right Bruck was helping himself to a total of ATS 90,000 per month... But this was not enough: Bruck had also financed his wanderlust. For 1997 alone he charged ATS 392,170.24 for business trips. And for 1998 another ATS 400,000 were provided for Bruck\u2019s business excursions. That\u2019s a good thousand [schillings] per day...But even with this, [Bruck\u2019s] financial avarice was not satisfied: a high six-figure sum for \u2018royalties\u2019, a kind of premium, was added.

Moreover at a slightly higher salary than other employees in the company ...\u201d", "16. On 21 October 1999 Mr Bruck was dismissed from his post as managerial director.", "17. Referring to the above statements, Mr Bruck instituted proceedings in the Vienna Regional Criminal Court (Landesgericht) under Sections 8a and 6 of the Media Act (Mediengesetz) claiming compensation and publication of the judgment.", "18. The case was subsequently delegated to the Salzburg Regional Court, which held a hearing at which evidence was heard from Mr Bruck, the T association\u2019s managerial director, its chairman and his deputy at the time of the events, the commercial director of Techno-Z FH at the time of the events, the four auditors in question and the journalist who had written the articles at issue.", "19. On 6 April 2001 the Regional Court, sitting as a single judge, dismissed Mr Bruck\u2019s claim. It found that the impugned statements consisted partly of value judgments with a sufficient factual basis and partly of true statements of fact. It noted that the auditors Mr Dollh\u00e4ubl and Mr Kittl had established in a report of March 1998 serious shortcomings in the book-keeping and accounting system of Techno-Z FH. They found that there had been no composite book-keeping for the year 1997 and that this system did not correspond to the principles of proper bookkeeping under the Book-keeping Act (Rechnungslegungsgesetz). The management board of the T association had taken note of this report with thanks and consternation. Despite that report the financial status of the company had been unclear at the time because of missing data. The management board had subsequently decided to appoint a commercial director in addition to Mr Bruck in order to guarantee a solid accounting system and management of public finances.", "20. A further report, by an external firm of business auditors commissioned by Mr Bruck, although more favourable, had also established shortcomings in the book-keeping and accounting system and had made recommendations for improvements. For instance, contrary to the company agreement, investments over a certain amount had been made without the authorisation of the company owners. Furthermore, a bank account for a certain project had been registered in Mr Bruck\u2019s name. Therefore, the articles\u2019 statement that Mr Bruck was lax about the finances of Techno-Z FH was true.", "21. The court further noted that Mr Bruck\u2019s former contract had expired at the end of December 1997 and, although the main features of a new contract had been discussed, there had been no agreement on its fundamental aspects. Therefore, at the time of the audit in March 1998 Mr Bruck did not actually have a valid employment contract and the payouts, although not considered as arbitrary and tolerated, had taken place without any legal basis. Mr Bruck had not contested the amount of the sums mentioned in relation to his salary and expenses for business trips. The notions \u201cwanderlust\u201d and \u201cbusiness excursions\u201d and \u201cfinancial avarice\u201d, \u201cexpense account profiteer\u201d, \u201crip-off merchant\u201d and \u201cso-called media expert\u201d and the statement that the finances in the company were \u201cadventurous\u201d were permissible value judgments. The fact that Mr Bruck had wrongly calculated royalties had been proven by the audit report of Mr Dollh\u00e4ubl and Mr Kittl. The statement that Mr Bruck had used financial tricks was therefore also true. Mr Bruck had in fact once exceeded the credit line of the company and had acknowledged that Mr Kittl had not been paid his fee. His argument that Mr Kittl had not been commissioned by Techno-Z FH was questionable and, in any event, did not exclude the possibility that another motive for the refusal to pay Mr Kittl had been revenge, which, moreover, appeared obvious in view of the consequences of his report. Mr Kittl had actually requested the opening of bankruptcy proceedings against Techno-Z FH. It was true that Mr Bruck\u2019s idea of providing every household in Salzburg with free internet access would have allowed children to access pornographic sites. Mr Bruck had employed his daughter in his company at a slightly higher salary per hour than other employees.", "22. The court noted, lastly, that the applicant company could rely on Article 10 of the Convention, particularly as there was substantial public interest in the subject matter because public funds were at stake.", "23. On an appeal by Mr Bruck, the Linz Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht), having held a hearing and sitting as a bench of three judges, quashed that judgment on 25 July 2002. It found that the Regional Court had left essential evidence unconsidered and had given pseudo-reasons for its findings. In addition to the facts established by the Regional Court and referring to the statements of the witnesses made before that court, the Court of Appeal set out the following background to the case:", "24. Mr Bruck was a former honorary professor at the Salzburg University and academic director of a technical college. In his function as managerial director of Techno-Z FH he had had responsibility, in particular, for acquiring research and development subsidies from national, European and international bodies in which task he was highly successful. The travel expenses for the corresponding business trips had never been challenged and appeared reasonable in the light of their development over the years and in relation to the travel expenses of the company\u2019s other employees.", "25. After Mr Bruck\u2019s former contract had expired at the end of December 1997, he was able to base his salary claim on an oral agreement of 23 December 1997 which was recorded in a note for the file and provided for a base amount of 80,000 Austrian Shillings (ATS) and a premium depending on any surplus produced by the company, this to be paid as monthly instalments of ATS 10,000. The taking of a decision on Mr Bruck\u2019s contract was repeatedly adjourned because no agreement on the concrete calculation of the company\u2019s surplus could be reached.", "26. While it was true that Mr Kittl and Mr Dollh\u00e4ubl\u2019s report of March 1998 established shortcomings in the accounting system, criticised the fact that Mr Bruck\u2019s salary was paid without any underlying contract or decision and that royalties for the year 1996 had been wrongly calculated, that report appeared partial and subjective: Mr Kittl had previously praised the accountancy and organisation of Techno-Z FH. Furthermore, Mr Kittl and Mr Dollh\u00e4ubl had been present when the basic agreement on Mr Bruck\u2019s further contract had been reached on 23 December 1997. Lastly, Mr Kittl and Mr Dollh\u00e4ubl had simply noted the lack of vouchers book-keeping in 1998 without questioning the reason for it, namely a computer crash as established by the subsequent audit by an external accounting firm. The report by that firm, commissioned by Mr Bruck, found that the accounting system and management of public finances corresponded to the average standard of a private institution and remarked critically that the company had not adapted its organisation structure to the rise of its business turnover fast enough. It did not confirm the serious shortcomings outlined in Mr Kittl and Mr Dollh\u00e4ubl\u2019s previous report.", "27. The commercial director was in fact appointed to relieve Mr Bruck who was busy handling other accountancy matters. It was true that in April 1998 Mr Bruck had exceeded the company\u2019s credit line; however, he handed in the corresponding authorisation a few days later and was absolved by the management board as he had demonstrated that the overdraft had been necessary. When drawing up a proposal for a \u201ccitizens\u2019 web\u201d in 1997, Mr Bruck had wished to create a local educational internet and not provide children with access to pornographic internet pages. Furthermore, there was a possibility of locking certain pages of the internet.", "28. Mr Bruck had properly refused to pay Mr Kittl\u2019s fees because it was the T association and not Techno-Z FH which had commissioned him. Mr Kittl\u2019s subsequent request that bankruptcy proceedings be instituted against the company had been unsuccessful because he had not submitted any proof of the company\u2019s insolvency. Mr Bruck had employed several trainees during the holidays, including his daughter, who had been paid between approximately seven and nine Euros (EUR) per hour, while other trainees had been paid EUR seven per hour and some EUR ten per hour. There was no indication of preferential treatment as the amount paid to Mr Bruck\u2019s daughter corresponded to her skills and the activities she had carried out.", "29. The court found that in its overall context the series of articles wrongly accused Mr Bruck of fraudulent conversion, unjustified enrichment and commercial ineptitude. The applicant company\u2019s reporting did not comply with the standards of journalistic diligence as it had not carried out any fair and objective research and had not questioned Mr Bruck. As the majority of the reported events dated back more than a year the journalist concerned had been under no time pressure to research the true facts behind the case. Having regard to the gravity of the criticism levelled at Mr Bruck, who had meanwhile been dismissed in order to get the company and himself out of the applicant company\u2019s firing line, the court ordered the applicant company to pay EUR 14,500 in compensation.", "30. The applicant company subsequently filed a request for rectification of the transcript of the hearing before the Court of Appeal. It submitted that the transcript wrongly reported that the full file (including the transcripts of the examination of the evidence conducted before the Regional Court) had been read out. On 9 January 2003 the Court of Appeal granted this request and rectified the transcript to the effect that the full file had not been read out as, according to the statement of all members of the Court\u2019s bench, the parties had waived their right to have the full file read out.", "31. Section 6(1) of the Media Act provides for the strict liability of the publisher in cases of defamation; the victim can thus claim damages from him. In this context \u201cdefamation\u201d has been defined in Article 111 of the Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch) as follows:", "\u201c1.
