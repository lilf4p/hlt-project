The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Lepoglava.", "5. In October 1998 three persons, R.S., G.C. and I.\u0160., were killed in their house in Kutina, Croatia, and a sum of at least 960,000 Croatian kuna (HRK) was taken from the house.", "6. In April 1999 one M.G. was indicted before the Sisak County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Sisku) on three counts of the above-mentioned murder. He was initially acquitted, but on 1 June 2005 the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) ordered a retrial.", "7. On an unspecified date in 2005 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having committed a car theft in Croatia and placed in detention in Remetinec Prison in Zagreb (Zatvor u Remetincu).", "8. On 29 December 2005 he fell ill and was transferred to Zagreb Prison Hospital. He shared room no. 206 with seven other inmates, including M.G. and S.\u0160. The latter was a former policeman. He had already been sentenced to seven years\u2019 imprisonment for attempted murder but his conviction had not yet become final. On an unspecified date S.\u0160. wrote to the Bjelovar Police Department, informing it that he had knowledge of the circumstances concerning a murder of three persons committed in Kutina.", "9. On 3 March 2006 S.\u0160. gave his evidence before an investigating judge of the Bjelovar County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Bjelovaru). He said that he had overheard conversations between the applicant and M.G. in which they had discussed the murder of three persons of which M.G. had been accused and which had revealed that the applicant had been an accomplice in these crimes. The relevant part of the written record of his statement reads:", "\u201cOwing to health problems I was placed in Zagreb Prison Hospital between 23 November 2005 and 13 January 2006. ... The day after I had been admitted to the Hospital, M.G. arrived and was placed in the same room. His bed was next to mine. ...", "About five to six days after that Nedjeljko Ajdari\u0107 was placed in the same room. ... His bed was next to the one occupied by M.G. so that M.G. was between the two of us. When Nedjeljko Ajdari\u0107 came into the room he exchanged greetings with M.G. and their conversation gave me the impression that they had known each other for years. ...", "M.G. and Nedjeljko Ajdari\u0107 had secret conversations for days. They sat on their beds and talked and since my bed was next to theirs, although they were talking in lowered voices, I could hear what they were saying. I heard Nedjeljko Ajdari\u0107 saying that he had prospered from that money and that his business was going well, and I heard M.G. saying: \u2018We did it all well, only I made a mistake by placing the money into a container\u2019, but he did not explain what container. They also mentioned that about 960,000 Croatian kuna (HRK) had been found in the house, some in foreign currency, and some in HRK. I heard Nedjeljko Ajdari\u0107 saying that he had been afraid to go to the border crossing between Stara Gradi\u0161ka and Bosanska Gradi\u0161ka and that in the end he had crossed [the State border] in Davor, and he also mentioned that he had been accompanied by a woman, but I could not understand whether it had been his wife or the wife of M.G.", "I also heard Nedjeljko Ajdari\u0107 telling M.G. that he had had to walk around in Bosnia for a whole day, in Banja Luka, in order to send a signal from a mobile telephone to Bjelovar, [which would show] that M.G. had been in Bosnia.. Nedjeljko Ajdari\u0107 also mentioned that he had gone to a hill known as \u2018Veseli Brijeg\u2019 in order to send the signal, but he had not succeeded [...] and in the end had sent a signal from the \u2018Motajica\u2019 mountain. When they talked about sending that signal from a mobile telephone, I heard M.G. telling Nedjeljko Ajdari\u0107 that if anything happened, Nedjeljko would testify that he had been in Bosnia and from their conversation I concluded that Nedjeljko Ajdari\u0107 had gone to Bosnia with the mobile telephone of M.G. and that he, by making some telephone calls, had created an alibi for M.G., [in other words], that he had been in Bosnia.", "When I listened to these secret conversations between [M.]G. and Ajdari\u0107 I also heard them mentioning how they had been surprised to find three people in the house and that they had not expected a third person, and that therefore they had waited for a long time in front of the house for someone to come out and take the children away. They also mentioned that they had seen a woman taking the children out of the house, but I did not hear whether they referred to one child only or to more than one.", "I also heard [M.]G. telling Ajdari\u0107 that his wife worked with the military as a dentist or dental technician, I did not understand this very well, and that after the event at issue she had said something in town and that that had contributed most to his discovery and detention.", "From the above-mentioned secret conversations between [M.]G. and Ajdari\u0107, in the course of which they mentioned that they had been surprised to find a third person in the house, I concluded that a financial transaction had taken place in that house and that a third person was involved.", "From their conversations I also concluded that M.[G.] had grown up with the owner of the house, who had had a money exchange office and who had been killed, and I concluded that they had had conflicts.", "I remember that Ajdari\u0107 told [M.]G. that he had not dared to cross the border between Stara Gradi\u0161ka and Bosanska Gradi\u0161ka because of increased security and that therefore he had crossed at Davor by boat or ferry. I also remember that they mentioned that in a container in [M.]G.\u2019s [house] the sum of HRK 460,000 had been found, while the rest of the money had ended up with Ajdari\u0107. Nedjeljko Ajdari\u0107 also told [M.]G. that he had spent his part of the money on opening his car-dealing business in Banja Luka. I also heard Nedjeljko Ajdari\u0107 telling [M.]G. that his company had sold stolen cars and had been involved in life insurance and car insurance and that the wife of Nedjeljko Ajdari\u0107 was also employed there and that there were other employees. I also heard Ajdari\u0107 telling [M.]G. that it was possible to obtain a car through his company, with all the documents, without going to the police.", "I asked Ajdari\u0107 about \u2018Veseli Brijeg\u2019 because I wanted to know something about it and he told me that Roma lived in that area and that was the reason why it was known as \u2018Veseli Brijeg\u2019. I do not know where that place is and I have never been there.", "I also heard Ajdari\u0107 saying that he was afraid of being found out since he had only four months to serve and then M.G. answered that there was nothing to worry about because one witness, a woman who was the key prosecution witness, had changed her testimony and had given a completely different statement than before.\u201d", "10. On 4 April 2006 S.\u0160. gave his evidence at a hearing held before the Sisak County Court in the criminal proceedings against M.G. The relevant part of his statement reads:", "\u201cI am currently detained in Bjelovar Prison because I have been sentenced to seven years\u2019 imprisonment by the Bjelovar County Court on charges of attempted murder and causing a risk to life and assets through dangerous activity, which conviction has not yet become final. Owing to health problems I was sent to Zagreb Prison Hospital where I was placed in room no. 206 between the end of November 2005 and 13 January 2006.", "I saw the accused for the first time in Zagreb Prison Hospital when he was transferred to the same room. Before that he had been in the surgical ward and was transferred to a non-smoking room. I do not recall the exact date when he was transferred to my room, but I remember that it was sometime in December 2005, and as a result we spent a lot of time in the same room. Immediately upon his arrival we started to get to know each other and to talk and I told him right away for which criminal offence I was detained, but at the beginning he did not want to tell me what he was accused of. In our discussions we had an argument about a defence lawyer in the present case, since the same counsel was defending us both, and I did not like the fact that the accused had criticised her.", "Sometime in mid December 2005, I do not remember the exact date, Nedjeljko Ajdari\u0107 was also transferred to the same room from Remetinec Prison. I immediately noticed that the accused and Nedjeljko Ajdari\u0107 greeted each other as if they had known each other for a long time. The bed occupied by Nedjeljko Ajdari\u0107 was in the middle, that is to say, between the one that I occupied and the one occupied by the accused. There were six inmates in the room, and they often changed.", "Since the bed occupied by the accused was next to the one occupied by Nedjeljko Ajdari\u0107 and the distance between the beds was twenty to thirty centimetres, they often talked to each other. They firstly talked about the occupation of Nedjeljko Ajdari\u0107 in Banja Luka. I mostly heard these conversations when lying on my bed reading the newspapers and doing crossword puzzles. I remember clearly that the accused and Nedjeljko Ajdari\u0107 started to discuss the criminal offence Ajdari\u0107 was accused of and I remember that Ajdari\u0107 had bought a car somewhere near Karlovac, which had been stolen, and Ajdari\u0107 and his wife and another person had been arrested on that account. Ajdari\u0107 had stayed in detention while his wife had been released. Ajdari\u0107 said that he had been sentenced to one year\u2019s imprisonment and that he had had four more months to serve, after which he would be released and I remember that he had expressed some fear, and that the accused had comforted him. Also, Ajdari\u0107 said that he had been dealing in smuggled cars, licence plates and car insurance documents and that he had bought a machine in Germany for identifying the codes of expensive cars.", "From their conversations I heard that the accused had family in Banja Luka and that they knew each other from Banja Luka. I also remember that Ajdari\u0107 said that the man from whom he had bought the car had died. He said that it was lucky that he had died because otherwise it would have been discovered how he had committed a criminal offence. Another inmate, J.M., reacted to that story since he knew the man who had died.", "After that the two of them started to talk about the mobile telephone. Ajdari\u0107 said that he had gone to Kutina with S. \u2013 I do not know that person \u2013 and that they had waited for a long time for a woman to return to the house, a woman who had left the house with one child or more children \u2013 I did not understand this very well. I also heard them saying that they had no knowledge about the third person in that house. I remember that they said that they had waited to enter the house, and that the wife of the accused had also been there and that it [sic] concerned a money exchange office where a childhood friend of the accused had worked. From what Ajdari\u0107 was saying, I understood that he was worried and I remember the accused telling him that a woman, who was the key prosecution witness in the proceedings, had changed her statement in their favour. They also discussed the money and I remember Ajdari\u0107 saying that he would pay for the defence of the accused and they also mentioned that the first lawyer who had defended the accused in these proceedings had later on engaged the services of lawyer B.J.", "After I left the [Zagreb Prison] Hospital, I contacted the Bjelovar Police and they asked if I wished to be a witness in the proceedings against the accused and I told them that I firstly wished to consult lawyer B.J, who was both my defence counsel and the defence counsel of the accused. I consulted her and she came to visit me to prison and asked me if I knew anything about the event at issue. I told her that the accused had said that he had been found out as a result of what his wife had been telling [other people] in the town and the lawyer asked me for whom I was working. I told her that I did not work for anyone and that I had decided to testify because of the children who had been left behind. The lawyer told me to be careful what I was saying and that I might be \u2018swallowed by the dark\u2019. She said that when I mentioned the name S.", "I would also like to add that I heard the accused and Ajdari\u0107 saying that later on it had been a problem for them to reach Banja Luka and that Ajdari\u0107 and the wife of the accused had crossed the state border at Davor because the wife of the accused had to return the mobile telephone of the accused back to Croatia, while S. crossed the state border in Stara Gradi\u0161ka. Ajdari\u0107 and the wife of the accused had taken the money and two mobile telephones, while the accused had returned to Bjelovar. They took mobile telephones to Bosnia and Herzegovina because they wanted to send signals to Bjelovar. They mentioned that they had [tried to] send a signal from the Motajica mountain, where the signal had been low, so they had gone to the area known as \u2018Veseli Brijeg\u2019 near Banja Luka and sent a signal from there.", "I also remember that they said that the money had been found in a container, but I do not know if they meant a deep freezer or something else. So, the money had been found in that container, about HRK 450,000.", "I would also like to mention a further detail which I noticed while in the prison hospital. It was a Sunday, visiting time and both the accused and Ajdari\u0107 had visitors. Ajdari\u0107 returned about ten minutes before the accused. The door of the room was open and I saw Ajdari\u0107 waving to someone from the open window in the hall. I approached the window to see who he was waving at and I also asked him about it and he said that he was waving at his wife. I saw the car in which his wife had arrived, it was a Golf, and I asked him how come his wife was driving such a car, since he had been bragging that he dealt in expensive cars, and he told me that the car belonged to someone in Croatia who had driven his wife there for the visit and that that man was carrying money to finance the accused\u2019s defence. I asked him if that person was S. and he told me that it was not my business.", "I have nothing else to add.", "To a question by the Deputy State Attorney the witness answered that from the conversations between the accused and Nedjeljko Ajdari\u0107 he had understood that with his part of the [stolen] money Ajdari\u0107 had opened a \u2018business\u2019 in Banja Luka with five to six employees and that that \u2018business\u2019 was run by his wife and that that was his second wife; he had divorced the first one.", "To a further question by the Deputy State Attorney the witness answered that he had heard the accused saying that his wife was a doctor in dentistry, employed with the military in Bjelovar.", "To a specific question the witness answered that from their conversations he had heard that \u2018Veseli Brijeg\u2019 was a Roma settlement near Banja Luka and that the river Vrbas ran nearby.", "To a further question by the Deputy State Attorney the witness answered that he had got the impression that the accused and Nedjeljko Ajdari\u0107 had known each other from before. The accused had been in detention in Sisak and Ajdari\u0107 in Zagreb. As regards the worries of Ajdari\u0107, they concerned his fear that he would be found out as a perpetrator of the criminal offence at issue during his detention.", "To a further question by the Deputy State Attorney the witness answers that the sending of a signal from a mobile telephone from Bosnia and Herzegovina had been aimed at showing that at that time the accused had been in Bosnia and Herzegovina.", "To a further question by the Deputy State Attorney the witness answered that he had heard that the accused had taken his part of the money to his home and that as a result of what his wife had been telling [people] in Bjelovar, the house had been searched and the police had found the money in a \u2018container\u2019.", "To a further question by the defence lawyer the witness answered that J.M. and V.B. had been in the same room [in Zagreb Prison Hospital] at the same time, as well as a prisoner, R., from Gospi\u0107 Prison who had been transferred from Lepoglava, but that the latter stayed for a shorter time.", "To a further question by the defence lawyer the witness answered that the inmates had often changed beds, sometimes even several times a day. He further stated that the first bed next to the wall had been occupied by M., the bed occupied by him [the witness] had been next to his and that after that he had not changed beds. The bed next to his had been occupied by Ajdari\u0107, which had been next to the one occupied by the accused.", "To a further question by the defence lawyer as to whether the other inmates heard the conversation between the accused and Ajdari\u0107, the witness answered that he did not know, but that he had listened to them because he had been interested. He further stated that sometimes he remembered whole conversations between them, and sometimes only parts.", "To a further question by the defence lawyer the witness answered that the said conversations between the accused and Ajdari\u0107 had mostly taken place in the afternoons, when the inmates had been allowed to watch television in a common room, when the accused and Ajdari\u0107 had stayed in the bedroom by themselves and talked. He would only watch the news and then return [to the room] because he had been interested in what the two had been talking about.", "To a further question by the defence lawyer as to who made the first contact with the police the witness asked whether he had to answer that question and when told that he had to, stated that he had contacted the police through the Bjelovar Prison Administration as soon as he had returned from Zagreb Prison Hospital [to Bjelovar Prison]. He had contacted the police twice, the first time [he had spoken] to a police officer and the second time to someone from the investigation in Sisak, he did not know who.", "To a further question by the defence lawyer the witness answered that he had got the impression that the accused and Ajdari\u0107 had known each other for a long time from the manner of their greeting because they had shaken hands, while the other inmates had not shaken hands and it had taken them longer to get to know each other.", "When asked by the defence lawyer to repeat exactly what the accused and Ajdari\u0107 had said when they talked about the mobile telephone, the witness answered that he could not repeat their exact words, but that he had told [the court] what he had concluded from their conversation.", "To a further question by the defence lawyer the witness answered that when Nedjeljko Ajdari\u0107 had arrived in their room and greeted the accused, J.M. had also been present.", "To a further question by the defence lawyer the witness answered that J.M. had also been present when the accused and Ajdari\u0107 had spoken about the criminal offence committed by Ajdari\u0107 and when they had spoken about the criminal offence committed in Kutina, no one else had been present \u2013 just him, the witness, who had returned from the TV room where he had been watching the news.", "To a further question by the defence lawyer the witness answered that he had not been offered anything by anyone in connection with the criminal offence for which he had been convicted, but which conviction had not yet become final.", "He stated that lawyer B.J. had refused to continue representing him without any explanation.", "To a further question by the defence lawyer the witness answered that he had never been treated in a psychiatric ward and that in the proceedings against him a psychiatric examination had been carried out.

On 26 April 2006 the applicant was indicted in the Sisak County Court on three counts of murder committed together with M.G. in Kutina, Croatia, on 8 and 9 October 1998. The proceedings against the applicant were joined to those already pending against M.G.", "12. At the hearing held on 26 June 2006 S.\u0160. gave his evidence. The relevant part of the written record of the hearing reads:", "\u201cThe witness gave the same evidence as noted in the written record [of the hearing held on] 4 April 2006 and had nothing to add.", "To a question by the Deputy State Attorney the witness answered that from the conversations between the first and the second accused he had not understood how many mobile telephones they had used during the event in question, but he had heard that the signals had been sent from the area known as \u2018Veseli Brijeg\u2019 in Kutina.", "To a further question by the Deputy State Attorney the witness answered that the purpose of sending the signals from mobile telephones had been to make others think that they were all in Bosnia at that time. He also stated that the first and the second accused had mostly spent time together in the evening, after dinner. He himself had also talked to Ajdari\u0107 and asked him how he had managed to do so well in Bosnia and Herzegovina and open his enterprise immediately after the war, to which the second accused had answered that he was a smart person.", "To a further question by the Deputy State Attorney the witness answered that he had heard them mention a place called Hrva\u0107ani, but he did not know whether that was a village, a settlement or a mountain, where they had stopped to have a coffee.

During one visit she had asked him about his stay at Zagreb Prison Hospital at the same time as the first accused. He had told her about what he had heard from the conversations between the first and the second accused, but a much shorter version, after which she had told him to be careful \u2018not to be swallowed by the dark\u2019, and then refused to continue to represent him in the criminal proceedings against him.", "To a further question by the Deputy State Attorney the witness answered that he had heard from the first accused what his wife\u2019s profession was and that she worked with the military and that she had said certain things in Bjelovar owing to which the location of the money had been discovered. The first accused had told him that his wife was a doctor in dentistry, but later on it had turned out that she was a dentist\u2019s assistant.", "To a further question by the Deputy State Attorney the witness answered that he was not giving evidence to hurt anyone, but rather because he had heard that the second accused participated in the criminal offence at issue and he was a foreigner, that is to say, a person from another country, and because by committing the criminal offence at issue he had become rich and ensured his existence by causing damage to others. Also, the second accused had said that it was good that the person from whom they had stolen the car had died, because otherwise their role in the criminal offence would have been discovered as well.", "To a further question by the Deputy State Attorney the witness answered that he had children of his own and was motivated to give evidence by the fact that the deceased had had children, and that now he understood their position, and that of his own children, because of the criminal offences he had himself committed.", "To a question by the defence lawyer of the first accused the witness answered that he had made notes about what he heard from the conversations between the first and the second accused and showed these notes to the court.", "The notes made by the witness are enclosed in the case file.", "The witness stated that these notes were a word play, that is to say, he had mixed up letters in the words.", "To a further question by the defence lawyer of the second accused the witness answered that he had been the first to arrive in room no 206 in Zagreb Prison Hospital, sometime in late or mid November 2005, where he had stayed until 13 January 2006.

Both the applicant and M.G. denied that they had ever met before the applicant\u2019s arrival at Zagreb Prison Hospital in December 2005. M.G. said that during the first few days of their stay in the same room in Zagreb Prison Hospital he and the applicant had had no contact at all and later on had talked about general topics. They had never talked about the criminal offence he had been accused of.

The accountability of witness S.\u0160. as an accused in other criminal proceedings was diminished, but not to a significant extent. It was diminished on account of him being drunk at the time of the crime. Against this background, this court entirely accepts the evidence of witness S.\u0160. as reliable.", "Although there is no material evidence of the participation of the second accused in the criminal offence at issue, and since his participation became known only at the beginning of 2006, there is the evidence given by witness S.\u0160., who stated that the second accused had been a perpetrator of the criminal offence at issue and who described the participation of the second accused in detail. ...\u201d", "18. In his appeal the applicant argued that the evidence given by S.\u0160. had been unreliable owing to his personality disorder and that his statements given before the investigating judge and at the trial were contradictory and illogical. Thus, he said that the applicant and M.G. had had secret conversations and had spoken in lowered voices. If the conversations had been secret, then they would not have been conducted within the hearing of a third person. As regards the placement of their respective beds, in his statement before the investigating judge S.\u0160. said that the bed occupied by M.G. had been in the middle, between the bed occupied by the applicant and the witness, while at the trial he said that the bed occupied by the applicant had been in the middle. As regards the time of the alleged secret conversations between the applicant and M.G., S.\u0160. firstly claimed that they mostly took place in the afternoon and at the hearing held on 26 June 2006 he said that they took place in the evening, after dinner. It was improbable and unconvincing that two perpetrators of such grave criminal offences would discuss the details of these offences in front of a third person. S.\u0160. also mentioned that a woman, the key prosecution witness in the proceedings, had altered her previous statement in favour of the accused. However, there had been no such witness in the proceedings. He also repeatedly stated that a person with the surname S. had also been implicated in the murder of the three people in question. However, the person of that name was actually one of the murder victims. S.\u0160. had no personal direct knowledge of the murders at issue. When giving his evidence at the trial he constantly repeated the phrase \u2018I concluded\u2019 which could not be the basis for the applicant\u2019s conviction. The witness enclosed his so called \u201cnotes\u201d, allegedly made during the conversations between him and M.G. However, these notes were a list of meaningless words. His statement was in contradiction to those given by inmates from the same room, J.M. and N.P. Furthermore, there was no logic to the whole story and he (the applicant) had not even been to Croatia in 1998, but had been living in Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he had run his own business since 1990. He claimed that he had never met M.G. before. Finally, no material evidence found in the house where the murders had been committed had any connection with him. The applicant argued that the findings of the trial court had been completely arbitrary to the point that they ran contrary to common sense and the basic requirements of a fair trial.", "19. The first-instance judgment was upheld by the Supreme Court on 14 March. The relevant part of the judgment reads:", "\u201cThe accused M.G. and Ne\u0111o Ajdari\u0107 in their respective appeals unsuccessfully try to challenge the evidence given by witness S.\u0160. However, contrary to their assertions, the first-instance court gave valid reasons for accepting the statement given by that witness and these reasons have not been called into question by the allegations in the appeals.", "It is firstly to be stated that the statement of witness S.\u0160. is not in contradiction with other evidence as the appellants wrongly claim. Witnesses J.M. and N.P., who gave more details about the circumstances in their room in Zagreb Prison Hospital than witness T.M., said that the accused M.G. and Ne\u0111o Ajdari\u0107 spent more time together than with other inmates, by which they disputed the defence put forward by the accused, in particular the allegation by Ajdari\u0107 that he spoke to M.G. less than to the other inmates. The fact that the other inmates did not hear the conversations described by S.\u0160. does not cast doubt on that part of his statement, because witness J.M. said that he had regularly watched television, that M.G. had mostly stayed in the room with Ajdari\u0107 and that S.\u0160., who had sometimes watched television, would soon return to the room. Thus, witness S.\u0160., as it is indirectly shown from the statement of witness J.M., often had the opportunity to be alone in the room with the accused while the other inmates were watching television and was able to hear the confidential conversations which they had obviously then held.", "The accused M.G. claims in his appeal that it is improbable that the perpetrators of such crimes would meet after seven years in the same room in Zagreb Prison Hospital and that it is excluded that, even if they met in such circumstances, they would discuss the crimes at issue in the presence of a third person. Such behaviour would be contradictory to the profiles of persons who conspired and planned to commit three murders in a professional manner. He also argued that he had been at large for five years and that in that period he would have had every chance to discuss the crimes at issue with the other perpetrator.", "However, [this court finds] that the accidental placement in the same room of persons who committed a criminal offence together cannot be regarded as impossible. The accused Ne\u0111o Ajdari\u0107 was detained in connection with a criminal offence unrelated to the one examined in these proceedings and was placed in Zagreb Prison Hospital, which only has a couple of rooms in each ward. At that time he was not yet a suspect in respect of the criminal offences which were the subject of the proceedings conducted against M.G. and therefore no formal obstacle existed for placing them in the same room.", "On the other hand, although the accused M.G. had indeed been at large between the year 2000 (when his detention was lifted) and the year 2005 (when he was again detained) it is certain that, since an appeal had been lodged against the first-instance judgment acquitting him (that is to say that the criminal proceedings against him were still pending), he had a reason to avoid public and frequent contact with the accomplice, the accused Ajdari\u0107. Finally, if the accused saw each other in that period and discussed the criminal offences they had committed, it is certain that after the judgment acquitting [M.G.] had been quashed and he had been detained, in view of these new circumstances and the development of the proceedings, they had something to discuss during their stay in Zagreb Prison Hospital.", "The description of the conversations between the accused given by S.\u0160. is neither unconvincing nor illogical: the accused G. and Ajdari\u0107, as described by S.\u0160, conducted these conversations when all or at least most of the other inmates were absent, that is to say that they talked in secret as far as it was possible. It is obvious that because the accused talked in lowered voices about the criminal offences in question the witness S.\u0160 did not hear all the details of their conversations. This is precisely why the parts of the statement given by witness S.\u0160 in which he reconstructs the content of these conversations on the basis of the parts of these conversations that he had heard do not fit with the facts established on the basis of the other evidence. Thus, witness S.\u0160 obviously wrongly understood the role of S., whom the accused had mentioned. However, if the evidence given by S.\u0160 had been false, as suggested by the accused M.G. in his appeal, and had relied on facts from the newspapers, he surely would not have mentioned S. in the same context, since this is not shown in the previous proceedings.", "Contrary to the allegations in the appeal by accused M.G., on all three occasions when he gave his statement witness S.\u0160. reproduced the words and sentences from the conversations of the accused in relative detail, and certain illogical details in his statements, stressed in the appeal by the accused Ne\u0111o Ajdari\u0107, actually contradict the argument in that appeal that his statement had been fabricated, that the witness had been following instructions and had been told what to say. The accused did not specify who had [supposedly] instructed the witness and in whose interest that would be. Lastly, had the statement of that witness been fabricated and had he memorised it according to someone\u2019s instructions, it would be expected that the memorised statement would be entirely in accordance with all the other evidence. It is precisely the contradictions about certain events (allegations of witness S.\u0160. about the telephone call on a mobile telephone from Bosnia, participation of S. and similar) that show that his statement was not fabricated and [that he was not] following instructions.", "The accused also point to the character of witness S.\u0160. and stress the part of the psychiatric opinion drawn up in the proceedings against him which states that he has a histrionic personality disorder, on the basis of which [the accused] concluded that he is inclined to fabricating stories. However, the accused ignore other conclusions of that report according to which the intellectual capacity of S.\u0160. is within normal limits and there are no indications of mental illness.", "Against the above background, there was no need for a further psychiatric examination of witness S.\u0160. ...\u201d", "20.

Witness S.\u0160., contrary to the other inmates, was often alone in the room with the accused and was thus able to hear their confidential conversations, which is in accordance with the statements given by witnesses J.M. and N.P., who also gave evidence about the events in Zagreb Prison Hospital, and on whose statements both accused rely in their appeals. They said, inter alia, that the accused had spent more time together than with the other inmates, by which they rebutted the defence argument of the accused, in particular that of Ne\u0111o Ajdari\u0107, who said that he had talked to the accused M.G. the least. Witness J.M. also confirmed that the accused and witness S.\u0160. had not watched television regularly because the accused M.G. had mostly stayed in the room, while the accused Ne\u0111o Ajdari\u0107 and witness S.\u0160. had watched television only occasionally.\u201d", "21.
