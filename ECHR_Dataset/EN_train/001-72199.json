Article 418 of the Civil Code, as applicable until 18 December 2001 (see \u201cC.

The absence of the establishment of guilt by way of a criminal conviction or in a decision given in disciplinary proceedings shall not exclude the State Treasury\u2019s liability for damage if such proceedings cannot be instituted in view of the [statutory] exception to prosecution or disciplinary actions.\u201d", "19. On 1 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on amendments to the Civil Code and other statutes (Ustawa o zmianie ustawy \u2013 Kodeks cywilny oraz niekt\u00f3rych innych ustaw) (\u201cthe 2004 Amendment\u201d) entered into force.

On 4 December 2001 the Constitutional Court (Trybuna\u0142 Konstytucyjny) dealt with two constitutional complaints in which the applicants challenged the constitutionality of Article 417 and 418 of the Civil Code. They alleged, in particular, that those provisions were incompatible with Articles 64 and 77 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.", "On the same day the court gave judgment (no. SK 18/00) and held that Article 417 of the Civil Code was compatible with Article 77 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution in so far as it provided that the State Treasury was liable for damage caused by the unlawful action of a State official carried out in the course of performing his duties. It further held that even though Article 418 of the Civil Code was compatible with Article 64 of the Constitution, it was contrary to Article 77 \u00a7 1 since it linked the award of compensation for such damage with the personal culpability of the state official concerned, established in criminal or disciplinary proceedings.", "22.

The Constitutional Court\u2019s opinion on the consequences of the repeal read, in so far as relevant:", "\u201cThe elimination of Article 418 of the Civil Code from the legal system ... means that the State Treasury\u2019s liability for an action of a public authority consisting in the issue of unlawful decisions or orders will flow from the general principles of the State liability laid down in Article 417 of the Civil Code. This, however, does not rule out the application in the present legal system of other, not necessarily only those listed in the Civil Code, principles of the State liability laid down in specific statutes.\u201d", "23.

It lays down various legal means designed to counteract and/or redress the undue length of judicial proceedings.", "A party to pending proceedings may ask for the acceleration of those proceedings and/or just satisfaction for their unreasonable length under section 2 read in conjunction with section 5(1) of the 2004 Act.", "Section 2, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:", "Section 5 provides, in so far as relevant:", "\u201c1.
