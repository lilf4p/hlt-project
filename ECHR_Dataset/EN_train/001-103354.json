The applicant was born in 1958. He lived at the Baikonur space launch site in Kazakhstan which is rented by, and under the administration of, the Russian Federation and is under joint Kazakh-Russian jurisdiction.", "7. From December 1983 to January 2004 the applicant served as a military officer in the Soviet (later Russian) Army at the Baikonur site. On 8 April 1986 he received security clearance and was granted access to information concerning rocket test launches, including the military unit responsible, launch parameters and test results, which were classified as top secret.", "8. On 1 September 1999 the applicant signed a standard contract concerning access to State secrets, which provided in the relevant part as follows:", "\u201cPursuant to the State Secrets Act and other normative regulations concerning the protection of State secrets, of which I am aware, I take upon myself an obligation to keep confidential any information constitutive of State secrets and accept a temporary restriction on my rights which may affect:", "the right to go abroad for a period of five years ...\u201d", "9.

On 24 November 2004 the applicant asked the passports and visas service of the Baikonur police department to issue him with a travel passport (\u0437\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442).", "11.

On 24 May 2005 the Military Court of the 26th Garrison rejected the applicant's complaint. It found that the refusal to issue a travel passport had been lawful because the applicant had previously had knowledge of State secrets during his service in the military. Access to State secrets had not been granted to him against his will, and he had received a pay rise on that ground. Furthermore, the applicant did not need a travel document to return to Russia or to go to the Kaliningrad Region, his identity document (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442) was sufficient for these purposes.", "14.

Section 2 provides that the right of a Russian citizen to leave the Russian Federation may only be restricted on the grounds of, and in accordance with, the procedure set out in the Act. Section 15(1) provides that the right of a Russian national to leave the Russian Federation may be temporarily restricted if he or she has had access to especially important or top-secret information classified as a State secret and has signed an employment contract providing for a temporary restriction on his or her right to leave the Russian Federation. In such cases the restriction is valid until the date set out in the contract, but for no longer than five years from the date the person last had access to especially important or top-secret information. The Interagency Commission for the Protection of State Secrets can extend this period up to a maximum of ten years.", "18.

The laws of the founding members of the Council of Europe have not restricted the right of their nationals to go abroad for private purposes since the inception of the organisation. The Schengen Agreement, which was originally signed on 14 June 1985 by five States and has, to date, been implemented by twenty-five States, has removed border posts and checks in much of the Western part of Europe and abolished any outstanding restrictions on European travel.", "22. Many other Contracting States, including, in particular, the former Socialist countries, repealed restrictions on international travel by persons having knowledge of \u201cState secrets\u201d, a common legacy of the Socialist regime, during the process of democratic transition (for example, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland). Among the Council of Europe States, with the exception of Russia, Azerbaijan was the last to abolish such a restriction in December 2005. Nevertheless, three member States (Armenia, Azerbaijan and Ukraine) provide for temporary restrictions on permanent emigration \u2013 but not on international travel for private purposes \u2013 for persons who have had access to State secrets.", "23.

The permissible limitations which may be imposed on the rights protected under article 12 must not nullify the principle of liberty of movement, and are governed by the requirement of necessity provided for in article 12, paragraph 3, and by the need for consistency with the other rights recognized in the Covenant.", "...", "8.

Since international travel usually requires appropriate documents, in particular a passport, the right to leave a country must include the right to obtain the necessary travel documents.

Article 12, paragraph 3, clearly indicates that it is not sufficient that the restrictions serve the permissible purposes; they must also be necessary to protect them. Restrictive measures must conform to the principle of proportionality; they must be appropriate to achieve their protective function; they must be the least intrusive instrument amongst those which might achieve the desired result; and they must be proportionate to the interest to be protected.", "...", "16. States have often failed to show that the application of their laws restricting the rights enshrined in article 12, paragraphs 1 and 2, are in conformity with all requirements referred to in article 12, paragraph 3. The application of restrictions in any individual case must be based on clear legal grounds and meet the test of necessity and the requirements of proportionality.
