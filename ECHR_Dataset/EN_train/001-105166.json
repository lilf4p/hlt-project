The authorities emphasised that the applicant had to undergo psychiatric observation at the hospital and that a number of expert reports had to be obtained.", "On an unspecified date the applicant was indicted for murder, namely, intentionally strangling his former wife.", "On 16 November 2001 the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment and 8 years\u2019 deprivation of public rights.", "Pending appeal, on 8 May 2002 the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) dismissed a request by the applicant to lift the preventive measure and decided to further extend his detention.", "On 23 July 2002 the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Court of Appeal quashed the judgment in the part concerning the deprivation of public rights and upheld the remainder of the judgment.", "On 8 October 2003 the Supreme Court (S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy) quashed the first and second-instance judgments and remitted the case to the Regional Court.", "In a separate decision of 8 October 2003 the Supreme Court extended the applicant\u2019s detention, relying on the likelihood that a severe penalty would be imposed.", "On 16 December 2003 the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Court dismissed a request by the applicant for the preventive measure in question to be lifted and decided to further extend his detention. To justify the applicant\u2019s protracted detention the court reiterated the grounds which had previously been relied on and noted, in addition, that the applicant\u2019s chronic illness or his family situation did not warrant his release on humanitarian grounds. This decision was upheld by the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Court of Appeal on 20 January 2004.", "Similarly, on 23 June 2004 the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Court dismissed a request by the applicant for the preventive measure in question to be lifted and decided to further extend his detention.", "Subsequently, the applicant\u2019s detention was extended by decisions of the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Court of 20 October 2004 and 11 January and 28 February 2005.", "To justify the extension of the applicant\u2019s detention the courts relied on the original grounds given.

The applicant maintained that his health had significantly deteriorated since his arrest. He did not, however, specify what ailments he was currently suffering from and did not provide any medical records to support that submission.", "The applicant submitted that he had complained to the penitentiary authorities about different aspects of his detention but had never received any reply.", "The file contains a copy of a letter issued by an unspecified authority on 16 October 2007. It is confirmed in the letter that the applicant had lodged numerous complaints with the administration of Bydgoszcz Fordon Prison and \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Remand Centre. It is further explained that the applicant\u2019s complaints that the authorities had subjected him to electric shocks and caused him to have auditory and visual hallucinations were considered manifestly ill-founded.", "A detailed description of the relevant domestic law and practice concerning general rules governing conditions of detention in Poland and domestic remedies available to detainees alleging that their conditions of detention are inadequate are set out in the Court\u2019s pilot judgments given in the cases of Orchowski v.
