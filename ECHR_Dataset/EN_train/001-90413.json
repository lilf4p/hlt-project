During the medical expert examination of [the applicant] the following injuries were discovered: a bruise on the left side of the lumbar region, abrasions on the right shoulder-blade and the right side of the parietal region of the head.", "3.2. These injuries were caused as a result of traumas to the indicated body parts by a blunt firm object having a narrow, possibly elongated surface: cannot be considered as causing damage to health.", "3.3. The type, character and intensity of those injuries allow the conclusion that they were caused within three to five days before the expert examination, thus not excluding the possibility that they were caused ... on 7 August 2001.", "3.4. It is impossible to assess those injuries with a view to determining whether they were caused as a result of a fall or an impact (impacts) with a certain object, as the circumstances of the alleged \u201cfall\u201d are unknown.\u201d", "15.

After [he] was told that the lawyer\u2019s presence was not necessary in this case, [the applicant] again refused to provide any explanations and did not substantiate his refusal.", "Therefore, it is impossible to establish the circumstances of the event.", "On the basis of the abovementioned....

At the police station he had been questioned by police officers, Mr S., Mr M. and Mr Ye. During the interrogation the police officers, Mr S. and Mr Ye., had beaten [the applicant], hitting him on the head, in particular on the ears and the back of the head, and on the right side of the back and kicking him in the groin. Mr M. had not taken part in the beatings. Following the beatings, [the applicant] had written a confession statement.", "Mr S., who was questioned on the facts, stated that on 7 August 2001 he, together with Mr Ye. and Mr M., had talked to [the applicant] in an investigation room of the Oktyabrskiy District police station; [the applicant] had been arrested on suspicion of use of counterfeit notes. [The applicant] had voluntarily provided an explanation of the circumstances leading to his arrest. No moral or physical pressure had been applied to [the applicant]. After having talked to [the applicant], Mr S. and Mr Ye. had left, and Mr M. had stayed with [the applicant].", "Mr Ye. gave identical statements.", "Mr M. gave statements similar to those of Mr S. and Mr Ye., adding that after Mr S. and Mr Ye. had left the room, [the applicant] had been apprised of his [rights] guaranteed by Article 51 of the Russian Constitution and the circumstances mitigating the punishment had been explained to him. [The applicant] had expressed a wish to write a confession statement... pertaining to his crime: a sale of counterfeit US dollars.", "During confrontation interviews in which [the applicant] participated... Mr S., Mr M. and Mr Ye. confirmed their statements.", "As follows from expert report no. 785 issued on 13 August 2001, [the applicant] had a bruise to the left side of the back, abrasions to the right shoulder-blade and the right side of the head, which could not be considered as causing damage to [his] health.", "As follows from statements by Mr P. and Mr A., police officers... from the Lipetsk Town Police Department, who had taken part in [the applicant\u2019s] arrest on 7 August 2001, when [the applicant] had been brought to the Oktyabrskiy District police station, he had lost consciousness in the duty unit and had fallen from his own height on to the concrete floor. After he had regained consciousness, [the applicant] had explained that he had had a heart attack and had asked for medicines. They think that [the applicant] faked the fainting.", "Mr Za., a police officer...from the Lipetsk Town Police Department, who had also taken part in [the applicant\u2019s] arrest, gave identical statements.", "During an examination of [the applicant] by an otolaryngologist... on 9 August 2001, no signs of an ear trauma were discovered.", "There is entry no. 1110 made on 9 August 2001 in the registration log... of the temporary detention facility of the Lipetsk Town Police Department concerning [the applicant] in which he noted that \u201che had inflicted a slash wound to his own right forearm and a bruise to the left side of the body on 8 August 2001 in the Oktyabrskiy District police station. He had had no complaints about the state of his health.\u201d That entry had been made by [the applicant]; [the fact] is corroborated by his signature.", "In his statement made to the Oktyabrskiy District Prosecutor [the applicant] asked for an additional medical examination because he had sustained a kidney injury and had spent ten days \u2013 from 12 to 22 August 2001 \u2013 in the Lipetsk Regional Hospital undergoing treatment. Taking into account those circumstances, a forensic medical examination was performed with a view to determining the severity of the injuries sustained by [the applicant] and establishing a causal link between the sustained injuries and [the applicant\u2019s] stay in the Lipetsk Regional Hospital where he had been diagnosed with \u201ca kidney injury\u201d.", "As follows from report no. 7320 of the forensic medical examination issued on 7 December 2001, [the applicant\u2019s] stay in the hospital for the treatment of an injury to the right kidney was not connected to [his] injury sustained on 7 August 2001, as the initial examination had not established bruises on the chest and back, although they had been recorded on admission to the Lipetsk Regional Hospital. Thus, it can be concluded that those injuries could have been sustained by [the applicant] after his examination by the medical expert on 9 August 2001.", "Taking into account the above-mentioned, it should be concluded that during the inquiry [the investigator] did not obtain any objective data showing that the actions of the police officers contained elements of a criminal offence, and thus there are no grounds for quashing the decision of 19 October 2001 by which an institution of criminal proceedings was refused.\u201d", "22. The applicant learned about the decision of 7 December 2001 at the trial.", "23. The applicant was additionally charged with theft and forgery of documents. On 7 December 2001 the authorised period of his detention expired. Five days later he was committed to stand trial before the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Lipetsk.

On 10 January 2002 the Oktyabrskiy District Court found the applicant guilty of theft of documents and use of counterfeit currency, acquitted him of the remaining charges and sentenced him to five years and six months\u2019 imprisonment. The District Court based its judgment, in particular, on the applicant\u2019s testimony, statements by witnesses, a record of the search on the applicant\u2019s person and seizure of the hundred-dollar notes, and an expert opinion indicating that the notes were counterfeit. Having examined the expert report of 13 August 2001, the hospital report of 12 August 2001, extracts from the detention facility\u2019s registration logs pertaining to the applicant\u2019s admission on 8 August 2001 and the prosecutor\u2019s decisions of 19 October and 7 December 2001, the District Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment complaint as unsubstantiated.", "26. The applicant\u2019s lawyer lodged an appeal statement, complaining, in particular, that the applicant had been beaten up by the police officers after the arrest.", "27. On 7 February 2002 the Lipetsk Regional Court upheld the judgment. The Regional Court found that the District Court had lawfully concluded that the fact of the ill-treatment had not been proven. Several police officers testified that the applicant had fallen in the police station and had hit his head.", "28. The RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure (in force until 1 July 2002, \u201cthe CCrP\u201d) established that a criminal investigation could be initiated by an investigator upon the complaint of an individual or on the investigative authorities\u2019 own initiative when there were reasons to believe that a crime had been committed (Articles 108 and 125). A prosecutor was responsible for general supervision of the investigation (Articles 210 and 211). He could order a specific investigative action, transfer the case from one investigator to another or order an additional investigation. If there were no grounds to initiate a criminal investigation, the prosecutor or investigator issued a reasoned decision to that effect, which had to be notified to the interested party."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
