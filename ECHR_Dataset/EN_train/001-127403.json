The applicant was born in 1945 and lives in Bitola.", "6. On 2 December 2002 an article was published in the daily newspaper Utrinski Vesnik entitled \u201cThe uncle was stealing, Jovan was standing guard\u201d (\u0412\u0443\u0458\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043b, \u0408\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0447\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043b \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0430).

The uncle started the engine of the tractor [inside] and drove it out of the courtyard, while his helpers warned the church housekeeper, who was upset, to step aside. During the violent disturbance, the dismissed bishop Jovan drove around waiting for the outcome...", "... On the basis of an anonymous tip-off concerning the break-in, police stopped the tractor from leaving Gevgelija. The owner of Voskresenie, [the applicant], produced documents [showing] that Voskresenie owned the tractor! Only dismissed bishop Jovan knew how the tractor, which was a donation by Japan to Gevgelija\u2019s church co-operative, happened to belong to a private company from Bitola ... (R.P.)\u201d", "7. The applicant submitted a letter to the newspaper the next day, in which he requested that it publish a retraction given the false allegations that he had stolen the tractor. In this connection he submitted a copy of a certificate issued by the Ministry of the Interior confirming that the tractor had been returned to him. He alleged that in the absence of a retraction, he would be perceived as a criminal in Bitola, a small town where people knew each other. The newspaper did not publish anything in this regard.", "8. On 31 December 2002 and after several verbal requests, the applicant submitted a letter to the newspaper seeking information about the identity of the journalist (R.P.), whose initials appeared at the end of the article.", "9.

The complaint was made against B.T., editor-in-chief of the newspaper and R.P., the journalist responsible.

In reply, the applicant specified his complaint and informed the trial court that all his attempts to get the newspaper to reveal the identity of the journalist responsible had been to no avail.", "11. During the proceedings the applicant was represented by a lawyer practicing in Bitola. The applicant alleged (without providing any evidence in support) that the first hearing had been scheduled for 23 September 2003; however, the parties agreed that between 10 October 2003 and 16 January 2007, the trial court had fixed twenty-three hearings, of which twenty were adjourned owing to the absence of either B.T., his representative or the journalist responsible. The trial court made several unsuccessful attempts to secure B.T.\u2019s attendance with the assistance of the police. The applicant or his representative attended all the hearings scheduled.", "12. At a hearing on 6 September 2005, the trial court requested that the newspaper reveal the identity of R.P., the presumed author of the article.

K.J. did not attend any of the four hearings scheduled between 19 September 2006 and 16 January 2007, despite the fact that the court had summoned him to do so. At the January hearing, the trial court stayed (\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0440\u0430) the proceedings because the prosecution had become time-barred.

The Assembly deplores the fact that in a number of member states prosecution for defamation is misused in what could be seen as attempts by the authorities to silence media criticism ...", "13. The Assembly consequently takes the view that prison sentences for defamation should be abolished without further delay. In particular it exhorts states whose laws still provide for prison sentences \u2013 although prison sentences are not actually imposed \u2013 to abolish them without delay so as not to give any excuse, however unjustified, to those countries which continue to impose them, thus provoking a corrosion of fundamental freedoms ...", "17.

Under section 379, if a court rejects an action for lack of competence or on another ground unrelated to the merits of the claim, and if the claimant resubmits that claim within three months of the decision becoming final, the limitation period is considered to have been suspended by the first action. This applies if a court or competent authority advised the person concerned to pursue his or her claim by means of a separate civil action.", "25. After the limitation period has been suspended, it starts running again and the time elapsed before the suspension is deemed to fall within the statutory limitation period.

Section 101 provided that the court was responsible for deciding a civil-party claim. If the court found the accused guilty as charged, the victim could be awarded full or partial compensation.

It further regulates the procedure regarding claims for compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary loss sustained as a result of the insult or defamation, as well injunctions the court can order if parties so request.", "43. The Government submitted a copy of a final judgment of 21 December 2010, in which the courts accepted a compensation claim concerning defamatory statements the defendant (a journalist) had made in a weekly newspaper. The compensation claim was brought after criminal proceedings instituted by the claimant against the defendant had been stayed because of the absolute limitation period. In the judgment, the courts found that the termination of the criminal proceedings had not been binding on the civil courts in respect of the claimant\u2019s action for damages (\u041f1.\u0431\u0440.5466/10).", "44. They further provided a copy of a judgment in which the Supreme Court dismissed a legality review request (\u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0448\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430) lodged against final judgments rendered in civil proceedings. It concerned a dismissal by the lower courts of an action for damages brought eight years after an alleged crime had been committed and after the criminal courts had acquitted the alleged offender. The Supreme Court found that the statutory limitation period for compensation claims relating to an alleged crime started to run from the moment the victim had lodged a civil-party claim in the criminal proceedings. Since the victim had not made such a claim, the fact that he had instituted the criminal proceedings had not suspended the running of the statutory limitation period concerning the compensation claim (\u0413\u0437\u0437.\u0431\u0440.35/2007 of 9 and 18 October 2007)."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
