This Constitution entered into force on 8 November 2006.", "30. The right to a survivor\u2019s pension shall be granted, inter alia, to family members of a deceased insured person who had paid the relevant contributions for at least five years, as well as to family members of a person who had already been granted a pension (Article 27). Eligible family members shall include, inter alios, the married partner (bra\u010dni drug) of the deceased (Article 28 \u00a7 1). The right to a survivor\u2019s pension shall likewise apply to a divorced partner (bra\u010dni drug iz razvedenog braka), where a court had already established his or her right to maintenance in the course of the divorce proceedings (Article 28 \u00a7 2).", "31.

When the question of the possibility to grant cohabitants equal rights in respect of the survivor\u2019s pension was raised, the State Secretary in the Ministry for Labour and Social Policy, who was at the same time the head of the working group on pension reform, was quoted as having said, \u201cit is hard to prove the existence of such partnerships\u201d; \u201c[i]ntroducing this right would mean a higher number of retired persons, and an increase in expenses\u201d (Ms R.T., in a statement to the \u201cPress\u201d newspaper, 14 January 2011).", "35.

Article 9 \u00a7 2 provides that the deceased\u2019s children and married partner shall inherit equal shares of his or her estate.", "43. This Act makes no reference to cohabitants. The \u010ca\u010dak District Court, however, found that one cohabitant does not have the right to inherit the property of the other following his or her death (judgment of 18 April 2007, G\u017e. No. 454/07).", "44.

Cohabitants and married partners enjoy equal treatment as regards, inter alia, the following: (a) deciding on whether to donate their deceased partner\u2019s organs to medical institutions for educational purposes (the Health Protection Act, Zakon o zdravstvenoj za\u0161titi; published in OG RS nos. 107/05, 72/09, 88/10, 99/10, 57/11 and 119/12; Article 226); (b) the assessment of whether an official can be deemed to be in a conflict of interest (the Prevention of Conflicts of Interest Act, Zakon o spre\u010davanju sukoba interesa pri vr\u0161enju javnih funkcija; published in OG RS no. 43/04, Article 4); (c) an official\u2019s obligation to report his or her property and financial status to the Anti-Corruption Agency (the Anti-Corruption Agency Act, Zakon o Agenciji za borbu protiv korupcije, published in OG RS nos. 97/08, 53/10 and 66/11, Article 43 \u00a7 2); and (d) various procedural contexts, civil and criminal (see the Code of Criminal Procedure, Zakonik o krivi\u010dnom postupku, published in the Official Gazette of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia nos. 70/01 and 68/02, as well as in OG RS nos. 58/04, 85/05, 115/05, 49/07, 20/09, 72/09 and 76/10, Articles 56, 61 \u00a7 6, 68 \u00a7 2, 98 \u00a7 1 (1) and 364 \u00a7 2; see also the Civil Proceedings Act, Zakon o parni\u010dnom postupku, published in OG RS nos. 72/11, Articles 67 \u00a7 1 (3) and 249 \u00a7 1).", "46. The Foreigners Act (Zakon o strancima; published in OG RS no. 97/08) provides that temporary residence (longer than ninety days) may be granted to immediate family members for reasons of family reunification (Article 26 \u00a7 1 (3)). This includes, inter alios, married partners (Article 32 \u00a7 2). In practice, however, cohabitants have the same rights.", "47. There is no possibility, according to Serbian legislation, to officially register a cohabiting partnership, nor does there exist an equivalent of, or a document similar to, the family record book.", "48. On 30 June 2011 the Constitutional Court rejected a motion seeking, inter alia, to have Article 28 of the Pensions and Disability Insurance Act declared unconstitutional. It did so because it lacked the power to legislate (\u201cUstavni sud ... ne stvara normu ... [, on] ... nema ulogu i ovla\u0161\u0107enje tzv. pozitivnog zakonodavca ...\u201d). In its reasoning, however, the Constitutional Court further opined as follows:", "\u201c... [T]he Constitutional Court notes that the Constitution ... has established that cohabitation is equal to marriage in accordance with the law ... [It has therefore] ... decided to send a letter ... to the Parliament in which it will point out the need for the contested provisions of Article 28 ... to be brought in line ... with the Constitution and ratified international instruments.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
