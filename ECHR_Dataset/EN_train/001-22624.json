He complained about toothache. Two dentists working there, D.K. and A.M., provided the applicant with necessary care, including implantation of fillings. In spite of that treatment, the applicant continued to complain about toothache and three of his teeth were pulled out.", "On 10 and 27 February 1998 Ceporex pills (antibiotic) were prescribed to the applicant. The expiry date of the pills was October 2001.", "The applicant still continued to complain about toothache and asked that some other teeth be pulled out. Having doubts as to the applicant\u2019s allegations, A.M. sent the applicant to an oral surgeon on 20 March 1998. He decided that there was no need to pull out more teeth. After that the applicant stopped visiting the dental clinic.", "According to the applicant he did not receive proper dental care. Instead, he had continuously been given wrong medication and treated with medication which was useless and old. Due to this improper treatment he suffered immense pain and had to have four teeth removed.", "He once received Ceporex pills and once Amoxil pills (both antibiotics).

As a consequence he had suffered strong pain and also contracted gastritis. He alleged further that S. K., the director of the LSP, had abused his office and official authority in so far as he had allowed that the inmates in the LSP receive unhealthy food of low quality.", "The Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office interviewed D.K. and A.M., examined the applicant\u2019s medical documentation and on 6 July 1998 dismissed the above complaint, stating that the applicant had failed to show a reasonable suspicion for his allegations.

The investigating judge of that court instructed the applicant that for the offence allegedly committed by D.K. and A.M. he had to file a motion for prosecution (optu\u017eni prijedlog) with the competent municipal court. Concerning the allegations against S.K. the investigation judge examined the reports on the control of the quality of food served to the inmates in the LSP and did not find inadequacy in the quality of food.
