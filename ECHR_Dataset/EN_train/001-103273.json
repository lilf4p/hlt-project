The applicants are Ukrainian nationals residing in the hamlet of Vilshyna in the Lviv region.", "7. The first to fifth applicants are members of an extended family residing in a house owned by the first applicant (the Dubetska-Nayda family house). This house was built by the family in 1933.", "8. The remaining applicants are members of an extended family residing in a house constructed by the sixth applicant (the Gavrylyuk-Vakiv family house). This house was built by him in 1959. It is unclear whether a permit for construction of this house was obtained in 1959. Subsequently the house was officially registered, to which a property certificate of 1988 is witness.", "9. The applicants' houses are located in Vilshyna hamlet, administratively a part of Silets village, Sokalskyy district, Lviv Region. The village is located in the Chervonograd coal-mining basin.", "10. In 1955 the State began building, and in 1960 put into operation, the Velykomostivska No. 8 coal mine, whose spoil heap is located 100 metres from the Dubetska-Vakiv family house. In 2001 this mine was renamed the Vizeyska mine of the Lvivvugillya State Holding Company (\u201cthe mine\u201d; \u0428\u0430\u0445\u0442\u0430 \u00ab\u0412\u0456\u0437\u0435\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430\u00bb \u0414\u0425\u041a \u00ab\u041b\u044c\u0432\u0456\u0432\u0432\u0443\u0433\u0456\u043b\u043b\u044f\u00bb). In July 2005 a decision was taken to close the mine as unprofitable. The closure project is currently under way.", "11. In 1979 the State opened the Chervonogradska coal processing factory (\u201cthe factory\u201d; \u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e-\u0437\u0431\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0447\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430 \u0444\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u00ab\u0427\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430\u00bb) in the vicinity of the hamlet, initially managed by the Ukrzakhidvugillya State Company. In 2001 the factory was leased out to the Lvivsystemenergo Closed Joint Stock Company (\u0417\u0410\u0422 \u00ab\u041b\u044c\u0432\u0456\u0432\u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0433\u043e\u00bb). Subsequently the Lvivsystemenergo CJSC was succeeded by the Lviv Coal Company Open Joint Stock Company. In 2007 a decision was taken to allow the factory to be privatised. It is not clear whether the factory has already been privatised.", "12. In the course of its operation the factory has piled up a 60-metre spoil heap 430 metres from the Dubetska-Nayda family house and 420 metres from the Gavrylyuk-Vakiv family house. This spoil heap was not subject to privatisation and remained State property.", "13. According to a number of studies by governmental and nongovernmental entities, the operation of the factory and the mine has had adverse environmental effects.", "14. In particular, in 1989 the Sokalskyy District Council Executive Committee (\u201cthe Sokalskyy Executive Committee\u201d; \u0412\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0456\u0442\u0435\u0442 \u0421\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0457 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0457 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438) noted that the mine's and the factory's spoil heaps caused continuous infiltration of ground water, resulting in flooding of certain areas.", "15. According to an assessment commissioned by the State Committee for Geology and Mineral Resource Utilisation, jointly with the Zakhidukrgeologiya State geological company (\u0414\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0456\u0442\u0435\u0442 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0435\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0456\u0457 \u0442\u0430 \u0432\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044e \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0440; \u0414\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0435 \u0433\u0435\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0456\u0447\u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0456\u0434\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0454\u043c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u00ab\u0417\u0430\u0445\u0456\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0440\u0433\u0435\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0456\u044f\u00bb) in 1998, the factory was a major contributor to pollution of the ground water, in particular on account of infiltration of water from its spoil heap. The authors of the assessment contended, in particular, that:", "\u201cAll the coal-mining industry operational in the region for over forty years has been negatively affecting the environment: spoil heaps from the mines and the coal-processing factory have been created, from which dust with a high concentration of toxic components spreads into the atmosphere and the soil ... systems of water drainage of the mines ... and cesspools... of the coal-processing factory are sources of pollution of surface and underground waters ...", "Rocks from the spoil heaps contain a variety of toxic heavy metals, leaching of which results in pollution of soils, surface and underground waters ...", "Very serious polluters ... are cesspools of mining waters and factory tailing ponds ..., which in the event of the slightest disturbance of the hydro-insulation cause pollution of surface and ground waters ...", "The general area of soil subsidence is about 70 square kilometres... the deepest subsidence (up to 3.5 metres) corresponds to areas with the most mining activity...", "During construction of the water inlets ... deep wells were drilled which reached those [mineralised] waters. All this inevitably affected the health of people living in the area, first of all the children ...", "Extremely high pollution levels ... were found in the hamlet of Vilshyna, not far from the coal-processing factory and mine no. 8 spoil heaps, in the wells of Mr T. and Mr Dubetskyy. We can testify that even the appearance of this water does not give grounds to consider it fit for any use. People from this community should be supplied with drinking-quality water or resettled ...\u201d", "16. In 2001 similar conclusions were proposed in a white paper published by Lviv State University.", "17. On 20 April 2000 the Chervonograd Sanitary Epidemiological Service (\u201cthe Sanitary Service\u201d; \u0427\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043c\u0456\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043d\u0456\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0435\u043f\u0456\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0456\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0456\u0447\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0431\u0430) recorded a 5.2-fold excess of dust concentration and a 1.2-fold excess of soot concentration in ambient air samples taken 500 metres from the factory's chimney.", "18. On 1 August 2000 the Sanitary Service sampled water in the Vilshyna hamlet wells and found it did not meet safety standards. In particular, the concentration of nitrates exceeded the safety limits by three- to five-fold, the concentration of iron by five- to ten-fold and that of manganese by nine- to eleven-fold.", "19. On 16 August 2002 the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources (\u041c\u0456\u043d\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0435\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0456\u0457 \u0442\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u0435\u0441\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0456\u0432) acknowledged in a letter to the applicants that mining activities were of major environmental concern for the entire Chervonograd region. They caused soil subsidence and flooding. Heavy metals from mining waste penetrated the soil and ground waters. The level of pollution of the soil by heavy metals was up to ten times the permissible concentration, in particular in Silets village, especially on account of the operation of the factory and the mine.", "20. On 28 May 2003 factory officials and the Chervonograd Coal Industry Inspectorate (\u0427\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0433\u0456\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0447\u043e-\u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0456\u0447\u043d\u0430 \u0456\u043d\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0446\u0456\u044f \u0437 \u043d\u0430\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434\u0443 \u0443 \u0432\u0443\u0433\u0456\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0456\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0456) recorded infiltration of water from the foot of the factory's spoil heap on the side facing Vilshyna hamlet. They noted that water flowing from the heap had accumulated into one hectare of brownish salty lake.", "21. In 2004 the Zakhidukrgeologiya company published a study entitled \u201cHydrogeological Conclusion concerning the Condition of Underground Waters in the Area of Mezhyriccha Village and Vilshyna Hamlet\u201d, according to which in the geological composition of the area there were water-bearing layers of sand. The study also indicated that even before the beginning of the mining works the upper water-bearing layers were contaminated with sodium and compounds thereof as well as iron in the river valleys. However, exploitation of the mines added pollution to underground waters, especially their upper layers.", "22. On 14 June 2004 the Lviv Chief Medical Officer for Health (\u0413\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0430\u043d\u0456\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043b\u0456\u043a\u0430\u0440 \u041b\u044c\u0432\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0457 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0456) noted that air samples had revealed dust and soot exceeding the maximum permissible concentrations 350 metres from the factory, and imposed administrative sanctions on the person in charge of the factory's boiler.", "23. In September 2005 Dr Mark Chernaik of the Environmental Law Alliance Worldwide reported that the concentration of soot in ambient air samples taken in Vilshyna hamlet was 1.5 times higher than the maximum permissible concentration under domestic standards. The well water was contaminated with mercury and cadmium, exceeding domestic safety standards twenty-five-fold and fourfold respectively. According to the report, the hamlet inhabitants were exposed to higher risks of cancer and respiratory and kidney diseases.", "24. The applicants first submitted that their houses had sustained damage as a result of soil subsidence caused by mining activities and presented an acknowledgement of this signed by the mine's director on 1 January 1999. According to the applicants, the mine promised to pay for the repair of their houses but never did so.", "25. Secondly, the applicants alleged that they were continuing to suffer from a lack of drinkable water. They contended that until 2009 the hamlet had no access to a mains water supply. Using the local well and stream water for washing and cooking purposes caused itching and intestinal infections. The applicants presented three photographs reportedly of the water available to them near their home. One photo entitled \u201cwater in a well in Vilshyna hamlet\u201d pictured a bucket full of yellow-orange water near a well. The second photo entitled \u201ca stream near the house\u201d pictured a small stream of a bright orange colour. The third photo entitled \u201cdestruction of plant life by water from the coal-processing factory waste heap\u201d depicted a brownish lake with many stumps and several dead bushes in the middle of it.", "26. The applicants further contended that from 2003 the Lvivsystemenergo CJSC had been bringing, at its own expense, drinkable water into the hamlet by truck and tractor. However, this water was not provided in sufficient quantity. In evidence of this statement, the applicants presented a photograph picturing five large buckets of water and entitled \u201cweekly water supply\u201d.", "27. The applicants further alleged that the water supply was not always regular. In support of this argument they produced letters from the Sokalskyy District Administration dated 9 July 2002 and 7 March 2006, acknowledging recent irregularities in supply of drinking water.", "28. Thirdly, some of the applicants were alleged to have developed chronic health conditions associated with the factory operation, especially with air pollution. They presented medical certificates which stated that Olga Dubetska and Alla Vakiv were suffering from chronic bronchitis and emphysema and that Ganna Gavrylyuk had been diagnosed with carcinoma.", "29. Fourthly, the applicants contended that their frustration with environmental factors affected communication between family members. In particular, lack of clean water for washing reportedly caused difficulties in relations between spouses. Younger family members sought to break away from the older ones in search of better conditions for their growing children.", "30. The applicants, however, did not relocate. They alleged that they would not be able to sell houses located in a contaminated area or to find other sources of funding for relocation to a safer community without State support. In evidence, the applicants presented a letter from a private real estate agency, S., dated September 2009, stating the following:", "\u201csince in Vilshyna hamlet ... there has been no demand for residential housing for the past ten years because of the situation of this hamlet in technogenically polluted territory and subsidence of soil on its territory ... it is not possible to determine the market value of the house.\u201d", "31. In November 1995 the Sanitary Service ordered the factory to develop a plan for management of the buffer zone.", "32. On 5 June 1996 the Sanitary Service found that the factory had failed to comply with its order and ordered suspension of its operation. In spite of this measure, the factory reportedly continued to operate, with no further sanctions being imposed on its management.", "33.

On 14 April 2003 the Lviv Regional Administration (\u041b\u044c\u0432\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0430\u0434\u043c\u0456\u043d\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0456\u044f) noted that the overall environmental situation had not improved since the Ecological Safety Commission's decision of 7 April 2000, as no funds had been allocated by the State Budget for implementation of the relevant measures.", "35. On 27 January 2004 the Sanitary Service found that the mine had failed to comply with its instruction of 4 December 2003 as to the development of a plan for management of the buffer zone, and ordered suspension of its operation. However, the mine reportedly continued to operate.", "36. On 13 July 2005 the Marzeyev State Institute for Hygiene and Medical Ecology (\u0406\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0442 \u0433\u0456\u0433\u0456\u0454\u043d\u0438 \u0442\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0457 \u0435\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0456\u0457 \u0456\u043c. \u041e. \u041c. \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0437\u0435\u0454\u0432\u0430 \u0410\u041c\u041d \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438) developed a management plan for the factory buffer zone. The authors of the report acknowledged that the factory was polluting the air with nitrogen dioxide, carbon oxide, sulphuric anhydride and dust. They noted, however, that according to their studies ambient air samples taken more than 300 metres from the factory did not contain excessive pollution. The plan provided for implementation of a number of measures aimed at improvement of the hydro-insulation of the spoil heap, as well as reduction of its height to 50 metres. The authors concluded that in view of such measures it was possible to establish a general buffer zone at 300 metres for the entire factory site.", "37. Later in the year the Ministry of Health (\u041c\u0456\u043d\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043e\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438 \u0437\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432'\u044f) approved the Marzeyev Institute's plan, on an assumption that the height of the spoil heap would be reduced by August 2008.", "38. On 29 April 2009 the Sanitary Service fined the factory director for failing to implement the measures in the factory buffer zone management plan.", "39. On 20 December 1994 the Sokalskyy Executive Committee noted that eighteen houses, including those of the applicants, were located within the factory spoil heap 500-metre buffer zone, in violation of applicable sanitary norms. It further allowed the Ukrzakhidvugillya company to resettle the inhabitants and to have these houses demolished. The Committee further obliged the company director to provide the applicants with housing by December 1996. This decision was not enforced.", "40. In 1995 the Sokalskyy Executive Committee amended its decision and allowed the residents to keep their former houses following resettlement for recreational and gardening use.", "41. On 7 April 2000 the Ecological Safety Commission noted that eighteen families lived within the limits of the factory buffer zone and commissioned the Ministry of Fuel and Energy and local executive authorities to ensure their resettlement in 2000-2001. The names of the families appear not to have been listed.", "42. In December 2000 and 2001 the applicants enquired of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy when they would be resettled and received no answer.", "43. In 2001 the Lviv Regional Administration included resettlement of eighteen families (names not listed) from the factory sanitary security zone in their annual activity plan, indicating the State budget as the funding source and referring to the Ecological Safety Commission's decision of 7 April 2000.", "44. On 12 June 2002 the Ecological Safety Commission noted that its decision of 7 April 2000 remained unenforced and ordered the Sokalskyy District Administration, the Silets Village Council and the factory to work together to ensure the resettlement of families from the factory spoil heap buffer zone by the end of 2003.", "45. In June 2002 the applicants, along with other village residents, complained to the President of Ukraine about the non-enforcement of the decisions concerning their resettlement. The President's Administration redirected their complaint to the Lviv Regional Administration and the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources for consideration.", "46. On 16 August 2002 the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources informed the Vilshyna inhabitants in response to their complaint that it had proposed that the Cabinet of Ministers ensure prompt resettlement of the inhabitants from the factory buffer zone in accordance with the decision of the Ecological Safety Commission of 7 April 2000.", "47. On 14 April 2003 the Lviv Regional Administration informed the applicants that it had repeatedly requested the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Fuel and Energy to provide funding for the enforcement of the decision of 7 April 2000.", "48. On 23 July 2002 the Dubetska-Nayda family instituted civil proceedings in the Chervonograd Court (\u041c\u0456\u0441\u0446\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0434 \u043c. \u0427\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430) seeking to oblige the factory to resettle them from its buffer zone. Subsequently the Lvivvugillya State Company was summoned as a codefendant.", "49. The first hearing was scheduled for 28 October 2003. Subsequent hearings were scheduled for 12 November and 18 December 2003, 26 and 30 April, 18 May, 18 and 30 June, 19 July and 22 December 2004, and 25 November, 6, 20 and 26 December 2005. On some four occasions hearings were adjourned on account of a defendant's absence or following a defendant's request for an adjournment.", "50. On 26 December 2005 the Chervonograd Court found that the plaintiffs resided in the mine's buffer zone and ordered the Lvivvugillya State Company holding it to resettle them. It further dismissed the applicants' claims against the factory, finding that their house was outside its 300-metre buffer zone.", "51. This judgment was not appealed against and became final.", "52. On 3 May 2006 the Chervonograd Bailiffs' Service initiated enforcement proceedings.", "53. On 19 June 2006 the Bailiffs fined the mine's director for failing to ensure the enforcement of the judgment. The latter appealed against this decision.", "54. On 26 June 2006 the director informed the Bailiffs that the mine could not comply with the judgment. It neither had available residential housing at its disposal nor was it engaged in constructing housing, as it had received no appropriate allocations from the State budget.", "55. The judgment remains unenforced to the present date.", "56. On 23 July 2002 the Gavrylyuk-Vakiv family, similarly to the Dubetska-Nayda family, instituted civil proceedings at Chervonograd Court seeking to be resettled outside the factory buffer zone.", "57. Subsequently the factory was replaced by the Lvivsystemenergo CJSC as a defendant in the proceedings.", "58. The first hearing was scheduled for 29 September 2003. Subsequent hearings were scheduled for 6, 17 and 30 October 2003, and 15 and 30 April, 18 May, 18 and 21 June 2004.", "59. On 21 June 2004 Chervonograd Court dismissed the applicants' claims. The court found, in particular that, although the plan for management of the factory buffer zone was still under way, there were sufficient studies to justify the 300-metre zone. As the plaintiffs' house was located outside it, the defendant could not be obliged to resettle them. Moreover, the defendant had no funds to provide the applicants with new housing. The court found the decision of 1994 concerning the applicants' resettlement irrelevant and did not comment on subsequent decisions concerning the matter.", "60. On 20 July 2004 the applicants appealed. They maintained, in particular, that the law provided that the actual concentration of pollutants on the outside boundaries of the zone should meet applicable safety standards. In their case, the actual level of pollution outside the zone exceeded such standards, as evidenced by a number of studies, referring to the factory operation as the major source of pollution. Furthermore, the decision of the Sokalskyy Executive Committee of 1994 could not have been irrelevant, as it remained formally in force.", "61. On 28 March 2005 the Lviv Regional Court of Appeal (\u0410\u043f\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0446\u0456\u0439\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0434 \u041b\u044c\u0432\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0457 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0456) upheld the previous judgment and agreed with the trial court's reasoning. In response to the applicants' arguments concerning the actual pollution level at their place of residence, the court noted that the hamlet was supplied with imported water and that in any event, while the applicable law included penalties against polluters, it did not impose a general obligation on them to resettle individuals.", "62. On 23 April 2005 the applicants appealed on points of law, relying on essentially the same arguments as in their previous appeal.", "63. On 17 September 2007 the Khmelnytskyy Regional Court of Appeal (\u0410\u043f\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0446\u0456\u0439\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0434 \u0425\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0457 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0456) dismissed the applicants' request for leave to appeal on points of law.", "64.
