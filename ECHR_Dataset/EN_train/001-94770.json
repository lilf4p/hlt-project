He was represented before the Court by Mr J. Hemelaar, a lawyer practising in Leiden.", "On 30 October 2008 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having committed criminal offences. Because he refused to identify himself he was detained pursuant to Article 61a of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Wetboek van Strafvordering) in order for his identity to be established. On 31 October 2008 he was released and handed over to the Aliens Police (vreemdelingenpolitie), who held him (ophouding) for the same purpose, pursuant to Article 50 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 4 of the Aliens Act 2000 (Vreemdelingenwet 2000). After this measure had been extended for forty-eight hours, the applicant was placed in aliens\u2019 detention with a view to his expulsion (vreemdelingenbewaring).
