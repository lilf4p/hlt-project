M.P. started with the construction work immediately thereafter.", "11. On 7 August 1998, on the basis of an on-site intervention, the Inspectorate of the Vo\u017edovac Municipality (\u201cthe Municipality\u201d) concluded that M.P. was not performing the construction work in line with the building permit.

On 15 December 1998 the second-instance authority quashed this decision, remitting the case for re-consideration.", "17. On 13 July 1999 the Municipality dismissed M.P.'s request for a new building permit, finding that his plan did not satisfy the requirements prescribed by the relevant domestic legislation.", "18. On the same date, a technical report noted that \u201cfollowing the recent precipitation\u201d and the construction work undertaken by M.P. the applicants' property had been seriously damaged.

On 22 May 2003 and 11 June 2004 the applicants lodged submissions opposing the said legalisation.", "23.

Such an order shall declare that the decision has become enforceable and determine the means and object of the enforcement.", "29. Article 271 provides, inter alia, that enforcement proceedings shall be terminated ex officio if the enforcement title itself has been repealed in the meantime. These proceedings shall, however, be stayed \u201cif it is established\u201d that an interim decision, which was being executed, has subsequently been replaced by a contradicting separate \u201cdecision in respect of the main issue\u201d.", "30.

This authority shall have sixty days to advise the owner about the relevant conditions for the \u201clegalisation\u201d of the construction in question, as well as the documents needed in this regard. The owner himself shall then have another sixty days to comply with this instruction.

On 17 May 2005 the First Municipal Court (Prvi op\u0161tinski sud) in Belgrade ordered the Municipality of Stari Grad to pay the plaintiff a specified amount of compensation on account of the lost rent. The court relied, inter alia, on Article 172 of the Obligations Act and explained that the plaintiff had been unable to lease his flat for a certain period of time as a result of the Municipality's failure to evict a protected tenant from the flat in question (XVIII P br. 9031/04). On 16 March 2006 this judgment was upheld by the District Court (Okru\u017eni sud) in Belgrade (G\u017e. br. 12872/05).", "38. On 21 February 2006 the Municipal Court in Novi Sad ordered the respondent State to pay the plaintiff a specified amount of compensation for the breach of his rights guaranteed under Article 5 of the Convention (P br. 1848/05). On 8 November 2006 this judgment was upheld by the District Court in Novi Sad (G\u017e. br. 3293/06). Based on such jurisprudence, the Government maintained that the Serbian courts were willing to directly apply the Convention, as well as the Protocols thereto.", "39. Under Article 25 \u00a7 1 if a builder was aware of the fact that he was building on land owned by another, or was not aware of this but the land's owner had immediately expressed his opposition to the work undertaken, the latter shall have the right to: (i) seek recognition of his ownership of the building erected; (ii) request that this building be demolished; or (iii) seek compensation from the builder for the usurped land, based on its market price.", "40.
