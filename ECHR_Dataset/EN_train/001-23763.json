Ms Ermannov\u00e1 systematically looks for and initiates conflicts with inhabitants. This is proved by a number of minor offences concerning the cohabitation with other inhabitants, which were dealt with by the municipal office.

It found that the applicant had not shown that she had a contractual relationship with Ms H. which would have obliged her to meet a specific financial obligation. The court found therefore that there was no need to re-hear Mr P. and Ms P. or to watch a video recording of Ms H.\u2019s children sitting in the baby seats and wearing the clothes in question.", "The District Court made no reference in its judgment to the statement issued by the Municipal Office.", "On 24 September 1998 the Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 Regional Court (krajsk\u00fd soud), upon the applicant\u2019s appeal, quashed the judgment of the District Court and remitted the case with a binding opinion that the applicant, in order to be successful in the proceedings, had to prove that there was an agreement between her and Ms H., in the sense that the applicant would sell children\u2019s clothes and baby seats for an agreed price, and that Ms H. had asked her father to order the goods. To that effect, the Regional Court instructed the District Court to re-hear the applicant, Ms H\u2019s father and another witness.", "By judgment of 27 July 1999 the District Court, having taken additional evidence in accordance with the Regional Court\u2019s instruction, dismissed the applicant\u2019s action for damages. It held, inter alia, that:", "On 19 January 2000 the Regional Court upheld this judgment endorsing the reasoning of the lower court in the main.", "On 29 July 1997 the applicant sued the municipality before the Prague Regional Court (krajsk\u00fd soud), seeking the protection of her personal rights within the meaning of section 11 et seq. of the Civil Code. She claimed that the information contained in the mayor\u2019s statement did not correspond to the reality, that it was of a defamatory nature and that it interfered with her dignity and civil reputation. She further claimed that the municipality should be ordered to present a written apology and an undertaking to refrain, in future, from committing similar interferences.", "The Regional Court requested the District Court to submit the court file concerning the applicant\u2019s action for damages, from which it appeared that the Municipal Office had submitted its statement upon the District Court\u2019s request, with a view to obtaining an official opinion on the reputation and credibility of both parties to the proceedings.", "It further requested the Pod\u011bbrady Town Office (m\u011bstsk\u00fd \u00fa\u0159ad) to submit the case files relating to minor offences involving the applicant\u2019s family which had been dealt with by the Municipal Office. It established from the documents before it that the applicant and her children had had a number of disputes with their neighbours, a local family and three other persons, and that the administrative proceedings had been, for the most part, discontinued.", "The Regional Court also had before it a case file with a claim brought by Ms H.\u2019s father against the applicant, in which he alleged that the latter had verbally abused him. These proceedings had also been discontinued.", "On 2 December 1998 the Regional Court, after having heard the parties and examined the aforesaid documentary evidence, dismissed the applicant\u2019s action. In its view, the municipality had not unjustifiably interfered with the applicant\u2019s right to the protection of her personal rights, as it had fulfilled the obligation imposed on it by the District Court pursuant to Article 128 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The court further noted that the municipality had not misused its power when issuing the statement, the content of which was in substance truthful, and which the applicant could challenge in the course of the proceedings for damages.", "On 6 January 1999 the applicant appealed, arguing that the Regional Court had not assessed the evidence correctly and that, consequently, had wrongly dealt with the factual and legal issues of the case.", "On 8 April 1999 the Prague High Court (vrchn\u00ed soud), admitting in evidence a decision of the Town Office of 27 August 1997 and the text of note no. 6 published in a local newsletter in March 1999, found the applicant\u2019s appeal unsubstantiated. It held, inter alia, that it had not been proved that the municipality did not believe that the information about the applicant\u2019s reputation contained in its statement was incorrect or that it had intended to damage the applicant.", "On 15 November 1999 the Supreme Court (Nejvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed soud) rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law (dovol\u00e1n\u00ed) in which the applicant challenged, inter alia, the lower courts\u2019 finding that the content of the mayor\u2019s statement had not been published, and claimed that the local newsletter had reported that the District Court had requested the Municipal Office to submit an appraisal of her, and that local deputies had suggested that the appraisal be based on a previous one to which new relevant facts should be added.", "On 21 June 1999 the applicant filed a constitutional appeal (\u00fastavn\u00ed st\u00ed\u017enost) alleging, inter alia, a violation of Article 10 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms (Listina z\u00e1kladn\u00edch pr\u00e1v a svobod) and Articles 6 and 8 of the Convention, in that the statement of the municipality containing its opinion about her reputation and credibility had been used in the court proceedings held in public and published in the local newsletter.", "On 24 February 2000 the Constitutional Court (\u00dastavn\u00ed soud) rejected the applicant\u2019s constitutional appeal as manifestly ill-founded. Although it expressed certain doubts as to the suitability of requesting third persons to issue statements on the reputation and credibility of an individual pursuant to Article 128 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Constitutional Court considered, in particular, that the municipality had acted on the District Court\u2019s request under this provision and, having regard to the actual situation in the municipality and relations between inhabitants, it had done it the way which was hardly violating the principle of social proportionality. It was indisputable that between 1997 and 1998 the applicant and members of her family had been involved in eighteen proceedings relating to minor offences. The fact that these proceedings had eventually been discontinued was, in the court\u2019s view, irrelevant. It further noted that the statement issued by the mayor, and subsequently approved by the municipal board of representatives (zastupitelstvo obce), reflected the prevailing opinion of the local inhabitants.", "1.
