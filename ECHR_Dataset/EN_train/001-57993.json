SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 11;No violation of Art. 6-1;No violation of Art. 13;No violation of P1-1", "JUDGES": "R. Pekkanen", "TEXT": ["9. From the summer of 1987 until the end of the summer of 1990 the applicant owned the summer restaurant Ihrebaden at Ihreviken, Tingst\u00e4de, on the island of Gotland. The applicant further owned - and continues to own - the youth hostel Lummelunda at Nyhamn, Visby, also on Gotland. The restaurant\u2019s employees numbered less than ten. They were engaged on a seasonal basis, but had the option of being re-employed the following year. The applicant\u2019s ownership of the restaurant and youth hostel was direct and entailed his personal financial liability (enskild firma).", "10. As the applicant was not a member of either of the two associations of restaurant employers, namely the Swedish Hotel and Restaurant Entrepreneurs\u2019 Union (Hotell- och Restaurangar - betsgivaref\u00f6reningen - \"HRAF\", which is affiliated to the Swedish Employers\u2019 Confederation (Svenska Arbetsgivaref\u00f6reningen - \"SAF\")) and the Employers\u2019 Association of the Swedish Union of Restaurant Owners (Svenska Restaurat\u00f6rsf\u00f6rbundets Arbetsgivaref\u00f6rening - \"SRA\"), he was not bound by any collective labour agreement (kollektivavtal) between the two associations and the Hotel and Restaurant Workers\u2019 Union (Hotell- och Restauranganst\u00e4lldas F\u00f6rbund - \"HRF\"). Nor was he obliged to subscribe to the various labour-market insurance schemes (Arbetsmarknadsf\u00f6rs\u00e4kring) developed through agreements between SAF and the Swedish Trade Union Confederation (Landsorganisationen).", "It was, however, open to the applicant to accede to a collective agreement by accepting a substitute agreement (h\u00e4ngavtal). He could also subscribe to insurance schemes with Labour-Market Insurances or any of the other ten or so insurance companies in the field.", "11. In late June or early July 1987 he refused to sign a separate substitute agreement with HRF. He referred to his objections of principle regarding the system of collective bargaining. He also emphasised that his employees were paid more than they would have been under a collective agreement and that they themselves objected to his signing a substitute agreement on their behalf.", "The substitute agreement proposed to the applicant included these terms:", "\"Parties: [The applicant] and [HRF]", "Term of validity: From 1 July 1987 up to and including31 December 1988, thereafter for one year at a time, unlessnotice is given two months prior to the expiry of the[agreement]", "...", "As from the [above] date, the most recent agreement between[the employers\u2019 association] and [HRF] shall be applied between[the applicant and HRF]. Should [the employers\u2019 association]and [HRF] subsequently reach a new agreement or agree to amendor supplement the [present] agreement, [the new agreement,amendments or supplements] shall automatically apply as fromthe day on which [it or they] [has or have] been [agreed upon].", "...", "1. [The employer shall] [on his employees\u2019 behalf] subscribeto and maintain [five different] insurance-policy schemes withLabour-Market Insurances, ... as well as other possibleinsurance-policy schemes which [the employers\u2019 association andHRF] might later agree upon.", "2. [The employer shall] issue employment certificates on aspecial form ... A copy shall be sent to [HRF].", "3. [The employer shall] only employ [workers who are members]of or [have] requested membership of [HRF]. In the event ofre-employment the provisions of section 25 of the EmploymentProtection Act (lag (1982:80) om anst\u00e4llnings-skydd) shallapply.", "4. [The employer shall] deduct on a monthly basis a part ofthe salary of employed members of [HRF] corresponding to theirmembership fees, and pay [the deducted part] to [HRF].", "...\"", "12. On 16 July 1987, during further negotiations with the applicant, HRF proposed another substitute agreement, which he also rejected:", "\"Subject: The signing of a collective agreement regarding [therestaurant] Ihrebaden ... and the Lummelunda youth hostel.", "1. Having regard to the forthcoming end of the [season of1987] the parties agree on the following procedure replacing the signing of a collective agreement.", "The enterprise agrees to comply, during this season ..., with the collective labour agreement (`the green nationalagreement\u2019) between [HRAF] and [HRF], this including the obligation to subscribe to [certain] insurance schemes(avtalsf\u00f6rs\u00e4kringar) with Labour-Market Insurances.", "2. The enterprise also agrees to [comply with] [the]collective labour agreement ... during the next season ...,either by way of membership of the employers\u2019 union or bysigning a ... substitute agreement ...\"", "13. Had the applicant accepted a substitute agreement, it would have applied not only to those of his employees who were unionised but also to those who were not.", "In the summer of 1986, one member of HRF was employed by the applicant. In 1987 he employed another member of that union and also two persons who were respectively members of the Commercial Employees\u2019 Union (Handelsanst\u00e4lldas F\u00f6rbund) and the Union of Municipal Workers (Kommunalarbetaref\u00f6rbundet). In 1989, one member of the latter union was employed by the applicant.", "14. Following the applicant\u2019s refusal to sign a substitute agreement, HRF, in July 1987, placed his restaurant under a \"blockade\" and declared a boycott against it. Sympathy industrial action was taken the same month by the Commercial Employees\u2019 Union and the Swedish Food Workers\u2019 Union (Svenska Livsmedelsarbetaref\u00f6rbundet).", "In the summer of 1988 sympathy action was also taken by the Swedish Transport Workers\u2019 Union (Svenska transportarbetaref\u00f6rbundet) and the Union of Municipal Employees (Kommunaltjenestemannaf\u00f6rbundet). As a result deliveries to the restaurant were stopped.", "15. One of the persons employed by the applicant at Ihre baden who was member of HRF had publicly expressed the opinion that the industrial action was unnecessary, as the salary and working conditions in the restaurant were not open to criticism.", "According to the Government, the union action had its background in a request for assistance in 1986 by an HRF member employed by the applicant. In the view of the union, the applicant paid his employees approximately 900 Swedish kronor (SEK) a month less than what they would have received under a collective agreement. He did not pay his staff holiday compensation as provided for in the 1977 Annual Leave Act (semesterlagen 1977:480), nor salary during lay-offs due to poor weather conditions as required by the 1982 Employment Protection Act and he did not sign a labour-market insurance until 1988.", "16. In August 1988 the applicant, invoking the Convention, requested the Government to prohibit HRF from continuing the blockade and the other trade unions from continuing their sympathy action and to order the unions to pay compensation for damages. In the alternative, he requested that compensation be paid by the State.", "17. By a decision of 12 January 1989 the Government (Ministry of Justice) dismissed the applicant\u2019s request. The Government stated:", "\"The requests for a prohibition of the blockade and thesympathy action as well as compensation for damage from thetrade unions concern a legal dispute between private subjects.According to Chapter 11, Article 3, of the Instrument of Government [Regeringsformen which forms part of theConstitution], such disputes may not be determined by anypublic authority other than a court of law, except by virtueof law. There is no provision in the law which authorises theGovernment to examine such disputes. The Government will not,therefore, examine these requests on the merits.", "The claim for damages is dismissed.\"", "18. The applicant applied to the Supreme Administrative Court (Regeringsr\u00e4tten) for review under the 1988 Act on Judicial Review of Certain Administrative Decisions (lag (1988:205) om r\u00e4ttspr\u00f6vning av vissa f\u00f6rvaltningsbeslut - \"the 1988 Act\"). On 29 June 1989 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the application on the ground that the Government\u2019s decision did not concern an administrative matter involving the exercise of public power, which was a condition for review under section 1 of the Act.", "19. On 15 September 1989 the Swedish Touring Club (Svenska turistf\u00f6reningen - \"STF\"), a non-profit-making association promoting tourism in Sweden, terminated the membership of the applicant\u2019s youth hostel, referring to a lack of cooperation and the applicant\u2019s negative attitude towards STF. As a result, the hostel was no longer mentioned in STF\u2019s catalogue of youth hostels in Sweden. In 1989 about half of the youth hostels in Sweden were enrolled in STF.", "20. The applicant brought proceedings in the District Court (tingsr\u00e4tten) of Stockholm. He contested what he considered to be his personal exclusion from STF, alleging that it had been caused by HRF threats that it would take industrial action against other youth hostels enrolled in STF if his hostel was not excluded. He also challenged STF\u2019s termination of the membership of his youth hostel.", "STF accepted, inter alia, that although the termination of the membership contract concerning the applicant\u2019s youth hostel had not been prompted by the conflict between the applicant and the trade unions, this conflict might have affected the timing of the decision. STF also referred to an opinion of the Competition Ombudsman (ombudsmannen f\u00f6r n\u00e4ringsfrihet) of 14 November 1989 to the effect that the termination of the contract in question would have only a very limited impact on his business.", "21. By a judgment of 8 May 1991 the District Court rejected the applicant\u2019s action on both points. It found, inter alia, that the applicant had not shown that he had been personally excluded from STF by virtue of the termination of STF\u2019s contract concerning his youth hostel. It also found that he had not shown that the contract had been financially significant to his business. Reference was made to the Competition Ombudsman\u2019s finding.", "22. The applicant appealed to the Svea Court of Appeal (Svea hovr\u00e4tt) which, on 6 March 1992, upheld the District Court\u2019s judgment. The Court of Appeal found, inter alia, that STF\u2019s termination of the contract concerning the youth hostel had entailed the expiry of the applicant\u2019s personal membership of STF. This, however, had not been tantamount to his exclusion, given that he could have continued or renewed his membership. Moreover, although the contract had been of appreciable significance to the applicant\u2019s business, STF\u2019s termination of the contract could not be considered unreasonable.", "23. At the beginning of 1991 the applicant sold his restaurant due to his difficulties in running his business which had allegedly been caused by the industrial action. The restaurant was bought by a person who signed a collective agreement with HRF. He continued, together with his family, to run the youth hostel in Lummelunda.", "Following the above, the union action was terminated.", "24. On 9 November 1991 the applicant requested the Government to support his application to the Commission. On 12 December 1991 the Government decided not to take any action in respect of the request.", "25.
