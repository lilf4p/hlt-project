SAN MARINO", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Civil proceedings;Article 6-1 - Reasonable time);Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - award", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["4. The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Pesaro (Italy).", "5. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "6. By a writ filed on 11 March 1993 C.R., a bank, brought proceedings against Mrs Tierce before the Commissario della legge (\u201cthe Commissario\u201d) seeking termination of her lease and an eviction order against her for non-payment of her rent. On 26 March 1993 the Commissario authorised the commencement of the action against the applicant and summoned the parties to appear on 7 April 1993. As the applicant did not attend the hearing the case was listed for 7 May 1993. On 29 April 1993 the applicant deposited with the registry a bankbook (libretto al portatore), mentioning a sum to be handed over to the claimant bank if it were to accept a settlement out of court.", "7. On 13 May 1993 C.R. claimed the sum in question, the Commissario ordered notification of the claim to the applicant and gave her five days to file her submissions. On 3 June 1993, as Mrs Tierce had not filed any observations, C.R. repeated its claim of 13 May.", "8. On 17 June 1993 C.R. declared that it did not wish to withdraw its action, even if it obtained the sum concerned. On the following day the Commissario gave the applicant five days to file submissions.", "9. At a hearing on 9 September 1993 the applicant confirmed her offer of 29 April 1993 and asked for the money to be attached to guarantee payment. C.R. objected, seeking the applicant\u2019s eviction. On the same day the Commissario scheduled a hearing for 7 October 1993, which was later put back by one week because he had another engagement, for the attempt to reach a friendly settlement prescribed by law in eviction cases (section 21 of Law no. 26 of 20 February 1991); when that attempt came to nothing the Commissario opened the first of two time-limited stages for adducing evidence, each waivable by the claimant (primo termine probatorio \u2013 see paragraph 22 below). On 30 October 1993 he opened the second such stage (secondo termine probatorio).", "10. On 9 December 1993 the applicant asked the Commissario to open the first of two further time-limited stages waivable by the defendant (primo termine reprobatorio), and he did so on 10 December 1993. On 23 December 1993 the applicant asked for evidence to be taken from a witness. The Commissario listed a hearing for that purpose to take place on 17 February 1994, but on that date the witness failed to appear. On 3 March 1994 the applicant filed documents, and on 21 March 1994 the Commissario asked her to inform him whether she wished to maintain her request for witness evidence to be taken. On 25 March 1994, at the applicant\u2019s request, the Commissario listed a new hearing for that purpose to take place on 28 April 1994, later adjourned to 20 May 1994 on account of another engagement. As the witness failed to appear, the Commissario fixed a new hearing for 14 June 1994, that being the last opportunity to hear the witness. On 8 September 1994 C.R. asked the Commissario to declare that the witness could no longer be called, having failed to appear within the time allowed; on 13 September 1994 the Commissario allowed that application.", "11. On 22 September 1994 Mrs Tierce requested the opening of the next time-limited stage (secondo termine reprobatorio); the Commissario complied with that request on the following day. On 6 October 1994 Mrs Tierce asked for evidence to be taken from another witness, who was examined on 1 December 1994.", "On 15 December 1994 the applicant asked the Commissario to open the fifth and last time-limited stage for the completion of the evidence-taking (termine di controprova), which he did the next day. On 3 February 1995 the Commissario observed that the time allowed for the last stage of the presentation of evidence had expired. On 16 February 1995 the applicant asked for the return of a cheque that she had previously deposited with the registry. On the next day the Commissario gave C.R. five days to make its final submissions. On 2 March 1995 C.R. asked Mrs Tierce to vacate the premises, as her lease had expired on 31 December 1994. On 13 March 1995 the Commissario gave the applicant five days to submit her observations.", "12. On 9 March 1995 C.R. had again applied to the Commissario for an eviction order against the applicant, as it needed the building in order to carry on its own business there. On the next day the Commissario scheduled a hearing for 6 April 1995 for the attempt to reach a friendly settlement prescribed by Law no. 26 of 20 February 1991.", "On 24 March 1995, at the request of C.R., with no objection on the applicant\u2019s part, the two cases were joined on account of the connection between them as regards their subject matter and the identity of the parties.", "13. On 6 April 1995 Mrs Tierce declared that she was prepared to vacate the premises in exchange for compensation. The case was adjourned for thirty days to give the parties time to reach an agreement on that point.", "On 22 June 1995 the applicant requested the opening of the statutory five-week period for the submission of objections (termine statutario per rispondere ed eccepire), and the Commissario allowed that application on the following day. On 5 October 1995, as the applicant had not raised any objection, C.R. requested the opening of the first termine probatorio. On the following day the Commissario observed that the time allowed for the applicant to lodge objections had not yet expired. On 19 October 1995 the applicant asserted that her lease had not yet run out.", "On 20 October 1995 the Commissario gave C.R. five days to submit observations. On 26 October C.R. contested Mrs Tierce\u2019s assertion. On the next day the Commissario gave Mrs Tierce five days to submit observations.", "14. On 8 February 1996 C.R. again sought an order for the applicant\u2019s eviction, and the Commissario gave her five days to submit observations. On 22 February 1996 the applicant confirmed what she had asserted on 19 October 1995, and on the following day the Commissario gave C.R. five days to submit observations.", "On 7 March 1996 C.R. requested the opening of the second termine probatorio (thus waiving the right to the time allowed for the first stage). On the following day the Commissario gave Mrs Tierce five days to submit observations and opened the second stage. On 14 March 1996 C.R. filed documents. On 21 March 1996 the applicant submitted that C.R.\u2019s assertions were ill-founded in fact and in law, and on the following day the Commissario gave C.R. five days to submit observations.", "On 11 April 1996 C.R. requested the opening of the first termine reprobatorio, and on 15 April 1996 the Commissario decided to close the proceedings on account of the parties\u2019 inaction. On 18 April 1996 C.R. again requested the opening of the first termine reprobatorio. The next day the Commissario rescinded his decision of 15 April 1996 as having been taken on the basis of a mistake as to the facts and opened the first termine reprobatorio. On 25 April 1996 C.R. asked for a date to be fixed for oral argument and the examination of one witness; on the following day the Commissario arranged a hearing for that purpose, to be held on 20 June 1996. On 15 May 1996 the witness indicated that he could not attend the hearing on the date chosen. On 13 September 1996, at C.R.\u2019s request, the Commissario decided to hold a new hearing on 26 September 1996, on which date evidence was taken from the witness. On 3 October 1996 C.R. asked for a date to be fixed for the presentation of oral argument; on the following day the Commissario set the case down for hearing on 17 October 1996.", "On that day C.R. withdrew its request for an adversarial hearing and requested the opening of the second termine reprobatorio. On the following day the Commissario gave the applicant five days to submit observations. On 7 November 1996 C.R. again asked the Commissario to open the second termine reprobatorio, and he did so on 8 November 1996. On 28 November 1996 C.R. asked for evidence to be taken from a witness; on the following day the Commissario arranged a hearing for that purpose to be held on 13 February 1997, at which the witness gave evidence.", "15. On 27 February 1997 Mrs Tierce requested the opening of the termine di controprova, and the Commissario allowed that application on the following day. On 13 March 1997 the applicant filed documents and asked for an expert report and the convening of an arbitration board. On the following day the Commissario gave C.R. five days to file observations. On 20 March 1997 C.R. requested Mrs Tierce\u2019s immediate eviction and asked for a witness to be called; on the following day the Commissario arranged a hearing for that purpose to be held on 8 May 1997, when a witness gave evidence. On 15 May 1997 C.R. asserted that it had not received instructions from the judge about the appointment of an expert, and the applicant repeated her request for the convening of an arbitration board and confirmed the appointment of her expert. On 26 May 1997 the Commissario asked C.R. to appoint its expert and on 19 June 1997 the applicant asked the Commissario to repeat his request of 26 May 1997. On 30 June 1997 the Commissario gave C.R. five days to file observations. On 18 September 1997 the applicant again asked for an arbitration board to be convened and an expert appointed. On the following day the Commissario asked C.R. to specify how much the applicant owed it. On 23 October 1997 the applicant repeated her request of 18 September 1997. On the following day the Commissario observed that C.R. had not expressed an opinion on either the convening of an arbitration board or the expert report. On 6 November 1997 C.R. indicated the amount of the applicant\u2019s debt and on the following day the Commissario gave her five days to file observations.", "16. On 11 December 1997, noting that all five time-limited stages for the presentation of evidence had expired, C.R. requested the opening of the time-limited stage for the filing of final submissions (termine ad allegare); the Commissario allowed that application on 15 December 1997.", "On 19 February and 12 March 1998 C.R. and Mrs Tierce filed their final submissions.", "The Commissario reserved judgment (irrotulazione) at a hearing on 26 March 1998.", "17. In a judgment of 28 August 1998 the Commissario ordered the applicant to vacate the premises with immediate effect.", "18. On 22 October 1998 Mrs Tierce appealed to the judge of civil appeals (Giudice delle appellazioni civili) and on 30 October 1998 she summoned C.R. On 3 November 1998 the Commissario authorised the summons and a hearing was set down for 10 December 1998 so that the parties\u2019 lawyers could enter an appearance.", "On 3 December 1998, as the first-instance judgment was enforceable with immediate effect, C.R. asked for the applicant to be evicted, which was done on 22 February 1999.", "On 29 April 1999 the applicant asked the Commissario to open the first termine probatorio, which he did the next day. On 20 May 1999 she asked for C.R. to be served with the decision to open the previous stage.", "On 23 September 1999 C.R. asked the Commissario to open the second termine probatorio, which he did on 27 September 1999.

On 27 January 2000 C.R. asked the Commissario to open the second termine reprobatorio, and he did so on 2 February 2000. On 24 February 2000 C.R. asked for the sum recorded in the bankbook (deposited by the applicant on 29 April 1993) to be checked and the accrued interest added; this was done by the registrar on 8 March 2000.", "On the following day C.R. requested the opening of the termine di controprova, and the Commissario complied in a decision of 13 March 2000. On 16 March 2000 C.R. asked for that decision to be rescinded, as the decision of 2 February 2000 had not yet been served. The Commissario allowed the above application on 17 March 2000. On 23 March 2000 C.R. again asked for the decision of 2 February 2000 to be served. On 6 April 2000, C.R. indicated that it wished to have evidence taken from two witnesses and the Commissario set down a hearing for that purpose on 25 May 2000, but the witnesses failed to appear. On 29 June 2000, at C.R.\u2019s request, the Commissario arranged for a new and final hearing to be held on 12 October 2000 for the witnesses to be examined; only one witness gave evidence on that occasion.", "On 19 October 2000 Mrs Tierce asked the Commissario to fix the termine di controprova, which he did on 20 October.
