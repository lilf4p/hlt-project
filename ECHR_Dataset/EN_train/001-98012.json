Parties to the proceedings are to be notified of the time and place of the hearing, but their failure to attend it does not preclude the court from deciding upon the issue (Article 112 \u00a7 2). The necessary procedural act in respect of which the procedural term has expired, such as lodging a complaint, or submission of documents, must be performed simultaneously with the lodging of the request for restoration of the term (Article 112 \u00a7 3). The court's ruling on the restoration of (or refusal to restore) the procedural term may be appealed against (Article 112 \u00a7 4 as in force at the material time).", "41.
