It ordered the prosecutors to adopt relevant measures in respect of those irregularities.", "36. The applicant's mother, acting on his behalf, and the applicant himself, lodged separate appeals in cassation with the Supreme Court.

The court found that the applicant was accused of a particularly serious crime (aggravated hooliganism) punishable by the deprivation of liberty for a term of over ten years and that if the applicant remained at liberty he might seek to evade investigation and trial and obstruct the establishment of the truth in the case.", "41. By a decision of 12 November 2001, the maximum period of the applicant's detention was extended for four months. Tarasha Court put forward similar reasons for the applicant's continued detention as were contained in its decision of 14 September 2001.", "42. Subsequently, the applicant's continued pre-trial detention was ordered by Tarasha Court decisions of 18 January, 22 May and 22 August 2002 and 12 March 2003, and of the Court of Appeal of 4 June and 2 December 2004, according to which that there were no grounds for changing the preventive measure applied in respect of the applicant.", "43. For the same reasons, the applicant's requests of 12 August 2002, 11 March 2003 and 27 May 2004 for release from detention raised at court hearings in his case were rejected by Tarasha Court on 12 August 2002 and 11 March 2003 and by the Court of Appeal on 27 May 2004 respectively. On 21 March 2003 the Court of Appeal refused to consider the applicant's appeal against the decision of 11 March 2003, holding that procedural decisions adopted in the course of a trial, including decisions concerning preventive measures, were not subject to appeal.", "44. The applicant's request for release, which he had lodged with the Tarasha Court on 22 January 2002, was not considered on the merits, the applicant having been informed by a letter from that court that the matter had already been determined in its decision of 18 January 2002.", "45. The applicant's requests for release were mainly based on the following arguments: after the incident on 12 September 2001 the applicant had not tried to run away and had made no attempts to obstruct the collection of evidence or to destroy it; the charges against him were groundless; he was detained for a long period of time after his arrest in September 2001; and he had health problems for which he could not receive adequate treatment while in detention. In his submissions before the courts, the applicant suggested that he could be released on an undertaking not to abscond.", "46. Relying on the same arguments, the applicant appealed against the decision of 12 March 2003 (see paragraph 42 above). In its decision of 28 May 2003 the Court of Appeal acknowledged the applicant's appeal, though it did not elaborate on the matter.", "47. According to the applicant, on 24 November 2003 he lodged with the Court of Appeal an appeal in cassation against the decisions of 12 March and 28 May 2003, though this was not considered by the courts. The applicant did not provide a copy of his appeal in cassation. The Government submitted that the applicant had not appealed in cassation against the decisions of 12 March and 28 May 2003.", "48. The applicant was detained in the ITT until 11 September 2002, when he was placed in the SIZO. On 7 June 2005 he was transferred to the Colony.", "49. According to the applicant, on 20 January 2001 he became ill and was seen by an ambulance paramedic, who was not competent to establish a diagnosis or prescribe treatment. The applicant raised this matter before Tarasha Court in one of his requests for release, but to no avail. The applicant provided no further details of the incident on 20 January 2001.", "50. During his detention in the SIZO and the Colony the applicant underwent medical checks, including X-ray examinations and blood tests, on 12 September 2001, 11 September 2002, 18 April and 24 October 2003, 17 May, 7 June and 20 August 2005, and 26 June 2006. There were no serious health issues noted by the doctors examining the applicant.", "51. The applicant requested medical assistance on three occasions, namely on 14 September and 28 October 2005 and 27 April 2006. He was diagnosed with bronchitis and periodontitis, for which he was treated by doctors.", "52. On 27 June 2006 the applicant was examined by a medical panel composed of a prison doctor, a general practitioner, a dentist and a psychiatrist. They concluded that the applicant was \u201cpractically healthy\u201d and that his state of health had not deteriorated since his arrival at the Colony. An additional medical examination of the applicant on 12 December 2006 confirmed those conclusions.", "53. According to the applicant, in the Colony he was at risk of contracting tuberculosis, as prisoners suffering from that condition were detained in the same building as the applicant, though on another floor. He also stated that between September and October 2005 the building had not been sufficiently heated and he had had no warm clothes. The applicant alleged that the light in the Colony was inadequate, but provided no further details.", "54.
