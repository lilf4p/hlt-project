On 29 April 2003 the first applicant requested the Kompaniyivsky District Police to take Vasiliy Mikhalkov, born in 1963, her son and the brother of the second and third applicants, to a sobering-up facility because of his severe alcohol intoxication. Two police officers, S. and P., arrived in response to her call. According to the first applicant, they mocked and kicked Vasiliy Mikhalkov, notwithstanding the first applicant's protests, dragged him into their police car and took him to the police station.", "7.

On 2 June 2003 this decision was quashed and the case remitted for further inquiry.", "10. On 9 June 2003 a post-mortem forensic assessment of Vasiliy Mikhalkov's body confirmed the earlier conclusion concerning the cause of his death. It was also established that the abdominal injury could have resulted from a fall on to a blunt object, such as a kerb or a concrete pole. Other injuries found on his arms, legs and buttocks could have resulted from his body being dragged.", "11. Following this assessment, on 10 June 2003 the Kompaniyivsky District Prosecutor's Office took a fresh decision not to initiate criminal proceedings.", "12.

This investigation is currently under way.", "13. The applicants have provided no documents concerning the course of the investigation, maintaining that they had been denied access to the case file and any meaningful opportunity to participate in the proceedings, regardless of their repeated complaints to various authorities, including the General Prosecutor's Office. By way of response, the General Prosecutor's Office kept forwarding their complaints to the Kirovograd Regional Prosecutor's Office, which assured the applicants, without providing any details, that the criminal proceedings were well under way. On several occasions the first applicant requested a meeting with the employees of the Prosecutors' Office to discuss the progress of the case; however, her requests were not accommodated.", "14. On 16 December 2003 the first applicant lodged a complaint with the Pechersky District Court of Kyiv, seeking to oblige the General Prosecutor's Office to ensure meaningful monitoring of the proceedings and to address omissions by the local authorities. She claimed, in particular, that there was sufficient evidence to charge two named police officers with abuse of position and a violent assault on her son.", "15.

They further provided summaries of the findings of the expert assessments.", "17. According to the Government's submissions, the expert assessment of 23 October 2003 established that Vasiliy Mikhalkov's death had been directly caused by the internal abdominal injury and acute haemorrhage. These injuries could have resulted from his fall.", "18. On 12 December 2003 a further expert assessment confirmed the results of the previous assessments.", "19. On 12 May 2004 a further expert assessment established that the injury had been inflicted by the impact, of considerable force, of a blunt object with limited contact surface, possibly a booted foot, hitting the applicant's abdomen at an acute angle.
