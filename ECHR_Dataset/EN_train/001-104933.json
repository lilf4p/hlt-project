The applicant was born in 1925 and lives in Zagreb.", "5. On 11 December 2000 the public utility company V.O., basing its case on unpaid bills for water supply services, instituted enforcement proceedings against the applicant in the Zagreb Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Zagrebu) seeking payment of the debt.", "6. On 24 January 2001 the Court issued a writ of execution (rje\u0161enje o ovrsi) ordering the applicant to pay the amounts sought. However, since the applicant challenged the writ by objecting to it on 19 March 2001, the court set it aside. As a consequence, the enforcement proceedings were, pursuant to the relevant legislation, transformed into, and resumed as, regular civil proceedings.", "7. The applicant, who has a formal education as a lawyer but is not an advocate, represented himself in the proceedings.", "8. On 15 November 2005 judge J.G.F. of the Zagreb Municipal Court delivered a judgment ruling for the plaintiff.", "9. On 27 December 2005 the applicant appealed against the firstinstance judgment. Section 357 of the Civil Procedure Act provides that an appeal to a second-instance court has to be lodged through a firstinstance court. Under section 358 of the same Act the first-instance court conducts a preliminary examination of the appeal and may declare it inadmissible if it finds that it does not meet certain procedural requirements, for example if it finds that it was lodged outside the statutory time-limit. It is, however, not authorised to decide on the merits of the appeal. Therefore, the applicant submitted his appeal intended for Zagreb County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Zagrebu) to Zagreb Municipal Court. In his appeal he wrote, inter alia:", "\u201cAfter twenty months of waiting ... on 15 November 2005 the second hearing was held, at which, in substance and without hearing [the parties] (apart from stating that the parties were present and that they maintained their positions) the impugned judgment was rendered.", "It is indicative to mention here that the judge, before dictating the operative provisions of the judgment, asked the defendant whether \u2018he would pay this\u2019 to which the defendant replied \u2018where did you get that idea?\u2019 [\u2018\u0161to Vam pada na pamet? \u2018]and asked whether she had examined the case file.... The judge angrily turned sideways in her chair and dictated the operative provisions of the judgment in the name of the Republic of Croatia to the typist, using a funny expression [navode\u0107i komi\u010dan izraz] that the parties were asking for a reasoned judgment \u2013 as if in adversarial proceedings judgments without reasons or instruction on remedies available against them existed. Unfortunately, the court did not record these dialogues between the judge and the defendant in the minutes. What judicial professionalism this is! [Kakva li je ovo suda\u010dka profesionalnost!]", "It is evident from the above-mentioned that in these proceedings no hearing was held in accordance with the law, which amounts to breaches of section 354 paragraph 2 subparagraphs 6 and 11 of the Civil Procedure Act. Apart from this, from the contested judgment or the transcripts of the hearings it cannot be discerned whether the court took any evidence ... for which reason the judgment could not be satisfactorily reasoned ...", "Instead of referring to the evidence taken and assessing its evidentiary value, the court immediately ... states on what basis it arrived at the contested findings, from which it is clear that it accepted all arguments of the plaintiff ...\u201d", "10. After it carried out the preliminary examination of the appeal, Zagreb Municipal Court forwarded it together with the case file to Zagreb County Court.", "11. On 3 April 2007 Judge M.P. at Zagreb County Court delivered a judgment dismissing the applicant\u2019s appeal and upholding the first-instance judgment.", "12. On 24 July 2007 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the second-instance judgment. On 21 January 2010 the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) declared his constitutional complaint inadmissible. It found that even though the applicant relied in his constitutional complaint on the relevant Articles of the Constitution guaranteeing the right to a fair hearing and equality before the law, he had not substantiated his complaint by any constitutional law arguments but had merely repeated the arguments raised in the proceedings before the ordinary courts. Therefore, the Constitutional Court had been unable to examine the merits of his constitutional complaint.", "13. After it had completed the preliminary examination of the applicant\u2019s appeal of 27 December 2005 in the above proceedings, on 4 January 2006 Judge J.G.F. at Zagreb Municipal Court issued a decision whereby it fined the applicant 500 Croatian kunas (HRK) for contempt of court. The relevant part of the decision read as follows:", "\u201cI. The defendant Nikola \u017dugi\u0107 from Zagreb ... is hereby fined 500 [Croatian] kunas because in his appeal of 27 December 2005 he insulted the court by stating: \u2018It is indicative to mention here that the judge, before dictating the operative provisions of the judgment, asked the defendant whether \u2018he would pay this\u2019, to which the defendant replied \u2018where did you get that idea?\u2019 and asked whether she had examined the case file....

What judicial professionalism this is!\u2019", "...", "In the appeal of 27 December 2005 the defendant, insulted the court by, inter alia, [using] the words quoted in the operative provisions of this decision.", "It would follow from the quoted text that during the main hearing the court communicated with the parties in an improper way, that the judge behaved improperly and that she does not know the law. All this constitutes contempt of court and the statements quoted exceed the limits of necessary respect for the court, even attempting to call into question the knowledge and expertise of the judge at issue, which is an impermissible way for the parties to communicate with the court because it represents a direct insult to the judge as a person, implying that she is ignorant and incompetent to exercise the duty of a judge.", "When imposing the fine the court took into account the fact that the defendant insulted not only the court as an institution, but also the judge as a person, on account of which he had to be fined pursuant to section 110 taken in conjunction with section 10 of the [Civil Procedure Act].\u201d", "14. On 16 January 2006 the applicant lodged an appeal against that decision arguing, inter alia, that his statements had been arbitrarily interpreted by the first-instance court, that they had not been insulting, and that he had not had any intention of insulting anyone.", "15. By a decision of 3 April 2007 Judge M.P. at Zagreb County Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal and upheld the first-instance decision. The relevant part of that decision read as follows:", "\u201cIn this court\u2019s view, the finding of the first-instance court that in his appeal the defendant insulted the court by making the above statements is correct ... It is to be noted that by the statements made in the appeal the defendant demonstrated disrespect for the court, which undoubtedly represents an improper way for the parties to communicate with the court, and exceeds the limits of a civilised and fair relationship with the court as an institution of a society.\u201d", "16. On 24 July 2007 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the second-instance decision. On 25 October 2007 the Constitutional Court declared his constitutional complaint inadmissible on the ground that the contested decision did not concern the merits of the case and as such was not susceptible to constitutional review.", "17. On 21 May 2008 the Zagreb Municipal Court of its own motion issued a writ of execution by garnishment of a part of the applicant\u2019s pension with a view to collecting the above fine. The applicant appealed and the proceedings are currently pending before the Zagreb County Court.", "18.
