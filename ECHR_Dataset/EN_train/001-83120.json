The applicant was born in 1967 and is presently serving a prison term in \u0160ibenik Prison.", "6. Following a series of criminal convictions for drug abuse, the applicant was sent to serve the sentence in Lepoglava State Prison (Kazneni zavod Lepoglava) on 11 November 2002. On 29 July 2004 he was transferred to Gospi\u0107 Prison.", "7. While the applicant was serving a prison term in Lepoglava State Prison, the prison authorities instituted disciplinary proceedings against him on an unspecified date. The hearings were held on 10 and 13 October 2003. Both the applicant and his counsel were present at the hearings. The applicant and four witnesses gave evidence in person. In the Head of the Disciplinary Proceedings' decision of 14 October 2003 it was established that on 19 July 2003 the applicant had held closed the door of cell no. 9 and had thus prevented a member of the prison staff from entering the cell and performing his duties. The applicant's conduct was found to be in breach of section 145 \u00a7 3(10) of the Enforcement of Prison Sentences Act (Zakon o izvr\u0161avanju kazne zatvora) and he was sentenced to seven days' solitary confinement suspended for three months. The decision was served on the applicant on 17 October 2003 at 2.45 p.m. It was also served on his counsel on an unspecified date. The applicant's counsel lodged an appeal against the decision on Monday, 20 October 2003.", "8. In a decision of 27 October 2003 the Vara\u017edin County Court judge responsible for the execution of sentences declared the appeal inadmissible as being out of time. The judge held that the time-limit for an appeal was forty-eight hours and that the time-limit had expired on 19 October 2003 at 2.45 p.m. despite the fact that this day had been a Sunday. The time-limit could not be extended to the first working day, since it had been fixed in hours.", "9. During his stay in Gospi\u0107 Prison the prison authorities opened disciplinary proceedings against the applicant. The prison authorities found that on 16 August 2004 the applicant had attempted to smuggle illegal drugs into the prison via a letter sent to him by his girlfriend, which constituted a disciplinary offence under section 145 (3)(11) of the Enforcement of Prison Sentences Act. In his decision of 2 November 2004 the Head of Disciplinary Proceedings imposed on the applicant a disciplinary measure consisting of a restriction on his movement inside the prison and frequent contacts with the outside world for a period of three months, including a ban on receiving postal parcels, starting from 2 November 2004.", "10. In an appeal of 16 November 2004 the applicant, inter alia, alleged that he had not attended the final hearing before the prison disciplinary authorities because his lawyer had not been present. The applicant also alleged that the notes of that hearing had not been served on him. He further stated that his counsel would elaborate on these issues in a separate appeal. On 16 November 2004 counsel lodged a separate appeal whereby he contested the findings of the applicant's guilt and the severity of the disciplinary measure imposed. On 18 November 2004 the Gospi\u0107 County Court judge responsible for the execution of sentences dismissed the appeal. The decision analysed in some detail the evidence presented in the disciplinary proceedings but made no mention of the procedural defects complained of by the applicant.", "11. The applicant submitted that he had firstly been put in cell no. 5 in Unit 1. However, later on he had been moved to Unit 2. He alleged that the room had been very damp, and the mattresses old and torn so that bare wire stuck out. The bed sheets and pillowcases had been dirty and the blankets old and foul smelling. No daylight entered the cell and the electric light had to be switched on all day. He had been locked in his cell for twenty-one hours per day, with no contact with other prisoners or the outside world. He had been allowed two one-hour walks and one hour of exercise in a gym per day, both without the presence of any other prisoner. The rest of the time he had had to spend locked alone in his cell. He had not had regular access to a bathroom or running water and his access to sanitary facilities had been left to the discretion of the prison guards. The heating had been inadequate and the food of low quality. No toiletries had been provided to the applicant and no permanent doctor had been on duty in the prison. Only one doctor (a paediatrician) had come once in a while for an hour at a time.", "12. According to the Government, the main building of the Gospi\u0107 Prison was built in 1878 and renovated in 1995. It comprised two units. The first (\u201cUnit 1\u201d) consisted of five-bed cells and the other (\u201cUnit 2\u201d) of two-bed cells, each equipped with a toilet. Inmates shared a communal bathroom. Unit 1 had a communal living-room. Disinfection and rat extermination were performed regularly. Inmates' clothes and bed sheets could be washed in the prison laundry every day. The bed sheets were changed once a week.", "13. On 29 July 2004 the applicant had arrived at Gospi\u0107 Prison. He had been put in Unit 1, under the \u201csemi-open\u201d prison regime until 24 September 2004 when he had been moved to Unit 2, under a higher security regime, to a cell measuring 3.75 x 3.5 metres and sanitary facilities measuring 2 x 1.6 metres, which he had shared with another inmate. In November 2005 he had been moved back to Unit 1 to a cell measuring 7.15 x 3.7 metres with sanitary facilities measuring 1.6 x 1.5 metres, which he had shared with three to four inmates at times. He had stayed there until 17 March 2006 when he had been moved back to Unit 2 due to an incident involving a fight with another inmate. He had stayed there until May 2006 when he had been transferred to Pula Prison. During his stay in Unit 2 the applicant had been locked in his cell save for one hour in the mornings when he had been allowed to go out in the courtyard and for two hours between 8 and 10 p.m. when he had been allowed to watch television, read or play games in a common room. During his stay in Unit 1 the applicant worked for four hours per day.", "14. According to the applicant, on 17 March 2005 he had been injured by another prisoner who had struck him twice on the head. He had been taken to a doctor to whom he had complained of general sickness, dizziness and heavy thirst. However, the doctor had only prescribed painkillers and had not made any further examinations. The applicant had asked that an X-ray examination be carried out at his own expense, but this had been refused. He further alleged that he had a bruise under his left eye.", "15. According to the Government the applicant had been seen by the prison doctor the very same day and the following day. The doctor had prescribed painkillers. Following the applicant's further complaints of backache, he had been taken to the Gospi\u0107 General Hospital and seen by a specialist. An X-ray examination had been carried out but no fractures had been identified. The applicant had been prescribed further painkillers to be taken orally and a soothing gel. The Government submitted a copy of the medical report from the Gospi\u0107 General Hospital to confirm their submissions.", "16. On 14 September 2004 the applicant petitioned the Gospi\u0107 County Court judge responsible for the execution of sentences, complaining about the prison conditions and also alleging that a postal parcel sent to him by his parents on 30 August 2004, containing three cartons of cigarettes, two magazines on motor cars and one notebook, had never been delivered but had instead been returned to his parents, who had informed the applicant about it.", "17. On 21 September 2004 the judge requested the Gospi\u0107 Prison authorities to comment on the complaint concerning the alleged non-delivery of the parcel. In his letter to the prison authorities of 24 September 2004, the judge noted that a prison governor was allowed to temporarily prohibit a prisoner from receiving parcels for health and security reasons and that the prisoner in question should be informed about such a decision and the reasons for it. The applicant received a copy of the letter.", "18. The applicant again petitioned the Gospi\u0107 County Court judge responsible for the execution of sentences on 21 October 2004, repeating his complaints about the prison conditions and further asserting that six to eight letters he had sent to various persons had never been delivered. The judge replied to the applicant's allegations by letter of 8 November 2004 stating that the Gospi\u0107 Prison authorities had informed him that all his letters had been properly forwarded and instructed the applicant to send future letters via registered mail only. As to the applicant's complaints concerning the prison conditions, the judge expressly stated that he had no jurisdiction to supervise the running of prisons.", "19. Following the incident of 17 March 2006, the applicant was moved back to Unit 2, and the Prison Governor ordered that disciplinary proceedings be instituted against him. On an unspecified date the applicant appealed against that decision, alleging that he had been attacked by another inmate who had struck him twice on the head. The applicant further complained that the medical assistance provided to him had been insufficient since the doctor had only prescribed him painkillers and had not made any further examinations. His request that an X-ray examination be carried out at his own expense had been refused. On 23 March 2006 the Gospi\u0107 County Court judge responsible for the execution of sentences dismissed the applicant's appeal on the ground that the decision to place the applicant under the \u201cclosed prison regime\u201d had been based in law and was a consequence of his conduct, which had endangered the order and security in the prison. No comment was made about the applicant's allegations concerning the lack of adequate medical assistance.", "20. The applicant appealed against the judge's decision on 27 March 2006 to a three-judge panel of the Gospi\u0107 County Court. In his appeal he complained about the conditions in Unit 2 (see paragraph 11 above). The panel dismissed the applicant's appeal on 28 March 2006 on the ground that the only way to prevent further unacceptable behaviour on his part had been his isolation. They made no remarks concerning the applicant's complaint about the conditions in Unit 2.", "21.
