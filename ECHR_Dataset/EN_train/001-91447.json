The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Sweden.", "7. On 26 February 1996 the applicant arrived in Russia from Azerbaijan. In April 2001 he asked the St. Petersburg City Representation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to grant him refugee status. Four months later refugee status was granted and the applicant was informed of his right to move to Sweden.", "8. On 10 September 2001 the acting chief of the Gyandzha Town police department of the Republic of Azerbaijan faxed a letter to the chief of the St. Petersburg City police department asking him to arrest the applicant. The letter read as follows:", "\u201c[We] seek your order to arrest a criminal, [the applicant], wanted by us for having committed a crime (theft of State property) under Article 88-1 of the Criminal Code of the Azerbaijan Republic... criminal case no. 10/295.

Guseynov, who subsequently became a leader of the opposition to the Government of Mr G. Alieyev in Azerbaijan, and due to the fact that he worked with an Azeri national, Mr Z. Ismaylov, whose case was examined by the Prosecutor General\u2019s office last summer, the UNHCR has grounds to conclude that the true reasons for the warrant issued by the Azeri authorities are [the applicant\u2019s] work with and close ties to the above-mentioned Azeri political figures.", "As we were informed by the St. Petersburg City Department of Visas and Registration where [the applicant] lives and with whom he lodged his application for a visa, the Azeri authorities lodged a request for [the applicant\u2019s] extradition.", "The UNHCR is concerned that if [the applicant] is expelled to Azerbaijan, there will be a danger of a violation of Article 33 \u00a7 1 of the UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees... and of the Russian Law of 25 October 1999... by the Russian Federation. Article 33 of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees forbids an expulsion of persons to a country where their lives and freedom will be threatened by a persecution on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.\u201d", "The UNHCR Representation in Moscow sent a similar letter to the St. Petersburg City Prosecutor.", "10. On 19 September 2001 police officers arrested the applicant pursuant to the faxed letter of 10 September 2001 and placed him in the temporary detention unit of the St. Petersburg City and Leningrad Region Department of the Interior (\u0418\u0412\u0421 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0413\u0423\u0412\u0414 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430 \u0438 \u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438). A police investigator issued a report on the applicant\u2019s arrest. The report represented a two-page printed template, in which the dates, the applicant\u2019s name, and the grounds for his arrest were filled in by hand. The relevant part read as follows (the pre-printed part in plain script and the part written by hand in italics):", "\u201cI, [the police investigator], ... on the basis of the order of the prosecutor of the Republic of Azerbaijan Mr A.

The applicant insisted that he had not been informed about the reasons for his arrest and he had not been given a certified copy of the arrest warrant. He was later served with a translation of the warrant which was attached to the letter of 10 September 2001. The applicant further alleged that the conditions of his detention in the unit had been very poor.", "12. On 20 September 2001 the Moscow Regional Representation of the UNHCR sent a letter, on the applicant\u2019s behalf, to the head of the St. Petersburg police department, complaining about the applicant\u2019s arrest with a view to extradition and seeking additional information on the case.", "13. On 24 September 2001 the UNHCR Representation retained a lawyer, Ms O. Tseytlina, to represent the applicant. On the same day Ms Tseytlina arrived at the detention unit for a meeting with the applicant, but she was not allowed to see him. Two days later Ms Tseytlina complained to the St. Petersburg City Prosecutor that she had been barred from seeing her client.", "14. On 1 October 2001 Ms Tseytlina lodged an application with the Dzerzhinskiy District Court of St. Petersburg seeking the applicant\u2019s release and complaining that he had been unlawfully arrested and detained. A copy of the lawyer\u2019s complaint bears the stamp of the Dzerzhinskiy District Court showing that it received the complaint on the same day it had been sent. On the following day Ms Tseytlina was allowed to visit the applicant.", "15. The Government, relying on a letter issued by the deputy President of the Dzerzhinskiy District Court, submitted that on 9 October 2001 the District Court had forwarded Ms Tseytlina\u2019s complaint to the St. Petersburg City prosecutor\u2019s office finding that the Prosecutor General had the exclusive jurisdiction to examine extradition matters. Ms Tseytlina complained to the St. Petersburg City Court about the transfer of her complaint to the prosecution authorities. The City Court forwarded that complaint to the Dzerzhinskiy District Court. The District Court decided to examine the merits of the application for release and the lawyer\u2019s complaints and fixed the first hearing for 20 December 2001.", "16. On 5 October 2001 the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office received a request for the applicant\u2019s extradition from the Prosecutor General of the Azerbaijan Republic. The Azeri authorities stated that the applicant was suspected of having committed aggravated robbery with the aim of acquiring State property on 1 September 1993.", "17. On 22 October 2001 the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation, relying on Article 33 \u00a7 1 of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, dismissed the request for the extradition. The Prosecutor General stressed that the applicant had been granted refugee status and that he had been allowed to take up permanent residence in Sweden. The Prosecutor also noted that the St. Petersburg City Prosecutor\u2019s office had been given an order for the applicant\u2019s immediate release.", "18. According to the Government, the Prosecutor General\u2019s order reached the prosecutor\u2019s office of the Tsentralniy District of St. Petersburg on 25 October 2001.

On 20 December 2001 the Dzerzhinskiy District Court adjourned for one week the proceedings concerning the examination of the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention to allow the prosecutor to examine the case file. The following hearing listed for 27 December 2001 was also rescheduled for 4 February 2002 to obtain additional documents from the parties.", "21. On 8 February 2002 the Dzerzhinskiy District Court dismissed Ms Tseytlina\u2019s complaint concerning the applicant\u2019s detention. The District Court held that the detention was lawful. The applicant was detained at the request of the Azerbaijani authorities with a view to his extradition. Criminal proceedings were instituted against him in Azerbaijan, he absconded and his arrest was authorised. The Azerbaijani authorities requested the applicant\u2019s extradition in good time and submitted all necessary documents in compliance with the requirements of the Minsk Convention on Legal Assistance in Civil, Family and Criminal Cases of 22 January 1993. The applicant was released after the extradition request had been dismissed.", "22. Mrs Tseytlina lodged an appeal statement. She complained that the applicant\u2019s arrest had not been authorised as required by domestic law, that the faxed letter from the chief of the police department could not have served as the legal basis for the arrest, that the Russian authorities had not issued any detention order in respect of the applicant, that he had not been promptly informed about the reasons for his arrest and that there had been no legal grounds for the applicant\u2019s detention between 22 and 25 October 2001.", "23. On 26 February 2002 the St. Petersburg City Court upheld the decision of 8 February 2002. The City Court held:", "\u201c...

His remand in custody was authorised (the detention order of 29 May 1995).", "On 20 September 2001 [the applicant] was arrested on the basis of the warrant issued by the Republic of Azerbaijan with the view to his extradition in accordance with the Minsk Convention of 22 January 1993 on Legal Assistance in Civil, Family and Criminal Cases (thereafter \u2013 the Convention)...", "The Azerbaijani officials had submitted the request for the [applicant\u2019s] arrest... on 10 September 2001 and, thus, the court correctly held that the [applicant\u2019s] detention was lawful.", "...the period of [the applicant\u2019s] detention in the temporary detention unit of the St. Petersburg City and the Leningrad Region Department of Interior amounts to thirty-five days (between 20 September and 25 October 2001) and conforms to the requirements of Article 62 \u00a7 1 of the Minsk Convention, which indicates that a person arrested pursuant to Article 61 \u00a7 1 of the Minsk Convention shall be released if no request for extradition is received within one month of the arrest.
