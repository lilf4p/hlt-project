On 3 July 2009 Mr B. lodged a complaint with the police to the effect that the applicant had robbed him of a mobile phone on 22 June 2009 (the applicant had then been at liberty subject to an undertaking not to leave his town of residence \u2013 see paragraph 7 above).", "12. On 3 July 2009, at about 7 p.m., the applicant was summoned to the Shevchenkivskyy District Police Station no. 2 (\u0422\u0412\u041c-2 \u0428\u0435\u0432\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0420\u0423 \u0413\u0423\u041c\u0412\u0421 \u0443 \u043c. \u041a\u0438\u0454\u0432\u0456) by a telephone call. According to him, he could not refuse given that he was bound by the undertaking not to leave the town, which also implied his obligation to obey any police summonses. As the applicant further submitted, he was arrested in the police station upon his arrival there without any explanation.

The investigator considered that if the applicant remained at liberty, there was a risk that he would abscond or hinder the investigation.", "18. On the same date, having upheld the investigator\u2019s reasoning, the Shevchenkivskyy Court remanded the applicant in custody for two months.", "19. On 31 August 2009 the court extended the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention to three months, having taken into account \u201cthe volume of investigative measures still to be undertaken\u201d.", "20.

According to the applicant, on the morning on 4 July 2009 his mother had received a phone call from a person who had been detained in the same police station and released that morning. The applicant had asked him to pass a message to her stating that he was detained there and that he had been questioned and ill-treated by the police.", "28. As further submitted by the applicant, his mother had contacted the police station in order to verify that information, but was told that her son was not there. She had therefore complained to the police and the prosecution authorities about his disappearance.", "29. According to the Government, on 4 July 2009 the police had notified the applicant\u2019s mother about his arrest and invited her to come to collect his belongings, which she did. She also signed a receipt to that effect.", "30. On 8 July 2009 the applicant was taken to the Kyiv Pre-Trial Detention Centre (the SIZO) (\u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043b\u0456\u0434\u0447\u0438\u0439 \u0456\u0437\u043e\u043b\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0440). His medical examination, which was carried out on the same day, did not reveal any injuries, and the applicant did not mention to the doctors that he had been ill-treated. His only complaint was about epigastric pain (see also paragraph 51 below).", "31. On 13 July 2009 the applicant\u2019s mother complained to the police and to the prosecution authorities about the alleged ill-treatment of her son in police custody.

On 5 August 2009 the Investigative Unit of the Kyiv Main Police Department (\u0421\u0423 \u0413\u0423\u041c\u0412\u0421 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u0432 \u043c\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0456 \u041a\u0438\u0454\u0432\u0456) completed its internal inquiry into the matter. As noted in the inquiry report, on 4 July 2009 the applicant\u2019s mother had signed a receipt confirming that she had collected her son\u2019s belongings from the police station. She had therefore been aware of his arrest. Furthermore, there was no evidence that any coercion had been used on the applicant. Accordingly, his allegation of ill-treatment was found to be without basis.", "35. On 16 August 2009 the SIZO doctors, acting on the instruction of the prosecution authorities, examined the applicant to establish if there were any traces of the alleged ill-treatment. None was discovered.", "36. On 21 August 2009 the Shevchenkivskyy District Prosecutor\u2019s Office refused to institute criminal proceedings in respect of the applicant\u2019s allegation of ill-treatment considering it unfounded since there was no evidence of any criminal behaviour by the police in relation to him.", "37.

The SIZO governor explained those transfers by the fact that the applicant had often been held in the SIZO medical unit, given his poor state of health.", "43. On four occasions the applicant was placed in a disciplinary cell for keeping prohibited items (in three cases a mobile telephone and in one case cash): on 14 July 2010, 22 October 2011, 12 December 2011 and 29 February 2012.
