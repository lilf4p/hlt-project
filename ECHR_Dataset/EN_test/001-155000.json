The applicants were born in 1962, 1967, 1989, 1996, 1998, 1942, 1944, 1946, 1947, 1949, 1955, 1957 and 1960 respectively, and live in Larnaca, Nicosia and Famagusta. The first and second applicants are husband and wife. The third, fourth and fifth applicants are their children. The sixth to thirteenth applicants are the five brothers and three sisters of the first applicant.", "7. On 1 December 2000 a Turkish Cypriot named \u00d6mer Gazi Teko\u011ful was arrested by the police of the Republic of Cyprus in possession of two kilograms of heroin. His arrest brought protests from the authorities of the \u201cTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\u201d (\u201cTRNC\u201d), who alleged that he had been unlawfully arrested in the buffer zone controlled by the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (\u201cthe UNFICYP\u201d), where neither the Greek Cypriot nor the Turkish Cypriot side was allowed to exercise authority. There were reports that Mr Teko\u011ful\u2019s vehicle had allegedly been found abandoned by the Turkish Cypriot authorities inside the United Nations (\u201cUN\u201d) buffer zone, with its engine running and headlights on. The Republic of Cyprus authorities maintained that the arrest had been effected within their jurisdiction just outside the buffer zone.", "8. On 8 December 2000 Mr Teko\u011ful was charged with drug possession and smuggling, and was remanded in custody by the Larnaca District Court in the Republic of Cyprus.", "9. According to a report of the UN Secretary General dated 30 May 2001 on the UN operation in Cyprus, UNFICYP\u2019s own investigation into the incident had not yielded sufficient evidence to confirm or refute either version of the events regarding the arrest of Mr Teko\u011ful.", "10. In the meantime, on 20 March 2001 Mr Teko\u011ful was sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment by the Larnaca Assize Court on various drugrelated charges, but was subsequently pardoned by President Clerides and released on 28 September 2001.", "11. The first applicant is a building contractor. At the time of the events giving rise to this application, he owned a construction company, Panicos Tsiakkourmas and Company Ltd., which employed workers from both sides of the island.", "12. Like many other Greek Cypriot contractors employing Turkish Cypriot workers, the first applicant picked up his Turkish Cypriot workers each morning from a caf\u00e9 (\u201cRabiye\u2019s caf\u00e9\u201d) located in the Sovereign Base Area (\u201cSBA\u201d) of Dhekelia in the vicinity of the Pergamos checkpoint, where people crossed from the \u201cTRNC\u201d to the SBA. The first applicant would collect his Turkish Cypriot workers from the caf\u00e9 every weekday morning at approximately 5.45 to 6 a.m. and would drive them to work. At the end of the working day, he would drop them off at the same location.", "13. The events that took place on the morning of 13 December 2000, which resulted in the first applicant\u2019s detention by the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities, are disputed between the parties. They will therefore be presented separately.", "14. At approximately 5.30 a.m. on 13 December 2000 the first applicant left his house in the village of Livadhia in Larnaca to collect his Turkish Cypriot workers from Rabiye\u2019s caf\u00e9 in his red Chevrolet double-cabin pickup, as he did every workday. Since it had rained heavily the night before, parts of the road were flooded, which forced him to drive slowly. The heavy rain had stopped by the morning, but it was still drizzling when he left the house.", "15. On the main road from Pyla to Pergamos leading to Rabiye\u2019s caf\u00e9, the first applicant noticed five to six metres ahead of him a white Isuzu pickup with the registration number UJ 100, which he recognised as belonging to a fellow Greek Cypriot contractor (V.Z.). As he was driving slowly behind that vehicle in the left-hand lane, the first applicant noticed further down the road another car, a red Renault, which had pulled up on the left side of the road just before the exPergamos camp junction, approximately 500 metres before Rabiye\u2019s caf\u00e9. The bonnet of the red car was open and two men in civilian clothes were checking the engine.", "16. The white pickup driving in front of the first applicant slowed down as it approached the red Renault and the driver rolled down his window to talk to the two men. While one of the men continued to check the car\u2019s engine, the other one waved the driver of the white pickup to move along.", "17. As the first applicant approached the stationary red Renault, another car, a white Renault which he had not previously noticed, emerged from the junction on the left-hand side and started heading towards him at full speed. The first applicant swerved his car to the right to prevent a collision and then applied the brakes. The white Renault also stopped right in front of his car and four men in civilian clothes leapt out. The first applicant then noticed that the white Isuzu pickup travelling ahead of him had also stopped, probably to check what was happening behind. In a matter of seconds, one of the men who had leapt out of the white Renault opened his driver\u2019s door, shouted some words in Turkish and put a gun to his forehead, while another tried to pull him out of the car. When the first applicant resisted, holding tight to his unfastened seat belt, the man holding the gun hit him on the head above the left ear with the handle of his gun, which caused him to fall down on the road into a puddle of rainwater measuring 20 to 25 cm, in a semi-conscious state as a result of the force of the blow. The men kicked and punched him on the ground, and twisted and bit his hands to force him to let go of the seat belt, while the first applicant called for help. After receiving some forceful kicks below the pelvis and to the ribs, which were so strong that he thought his ribs were broken, he let go of the belt and rolled on the ground. The four men then picked him up by the arms and legs and dragged him to the white Renault, which was a left-hand drive car. The first applicant estimated that the whole ordeal, which had started at approximately 5.45 a.m., had lasted less than three minutes, and it had been witnessed by the driver of the white Isuzu pickup travelling ahead of him.", "18. Once inside the car, with both his arms twisted behind his back, the first applicant received another strong kick from the man who was holding him by the right arm. The man holding the pistol sat in the front passenger seat and continued to point the pistol at him. They then started driving towards the Pergamos checkpoint. When the first applicant noticed that the right passenger door of the car was not fully closed, he started pushing the man to his right with his shoulder so that they would fall out of the car. As they were passing Rabiye\u2019s caf\u00e9, the first applicant saw a group of people standing outside and called out for help from the slightly open door, but he could not manage to attract their attention.", "19. When the car reached the Pergamos checkpoint, the first applicant noticed that the barrier, which was normally down, had been lifted so that they were able to drive straight through to the \u201cTRNC\u201d without slowing down. After driving in the occupied area for a while, the man sitting to the first applicant\u2019s left placed a rope around his neck and tied his hands behind his back with the ends of the same rope, which prevented him from moving. When the applicant asked whether they were going to kill him, the same man answered yes and then the man sitting in the front passenger seat punched him in the face, which damaged his teeth and caused his mouth to bleed.", "20. The first applicant could not understand the conversation in the car, which was in Turkish, except for the word \u201cpolice\u201d, which was uttered frequently. Since he had lived in the occupied area until he was twelve years old, he recognised that he was being driven towards Famagusta. Once they reached the Famagusta industrial area, the car stopped, and the man sitting in the front passenger seat took off his sock and taped it around the first applicant\u2019s eyes, and then taped his mouth. A couple of minutes later, the first applicant heard another car drive up to them. He was quickly transferred to the other car, with his hands still tied behind his back with the rope that ran around his neck. After driving for another five to seven minutes the second car stopped and he was taken out of the car. He was subsequently taken into a building and put in a room on his own, where he waited for quite some time with his eyes and mouth taped, and his hands tied behind his back.", "21. After a while, someone untied the rope around the first applicant\u2019s hands and neck, but left his hands cuffed behind his back, and removed the tape from his mouth. He was then asked personal questions regarding himself and his family, including whether he had any relatives working in the police force or the army. No one explained to him where he was or why he was being held. The person who spoke to him alternated between broken Greek and English. His captors then made him sit in front of an electric heater so that he might dry, as his clothes were all wet from falling into the puddle of water outside his car during the struggle prior to his abduction.", "22. When his captors eventually removed the sock from his eyes, the first applicant noticed that he was in an office, and the time was 11.55 a.m. Three men in civilian clothes, whom he had not seen before but later discovered to be Subinspector \u00dc.\u00d6. and police sergeants R.\u00d6. and H.M., were standing in front of him. When he asked them in Greek why he had been seized, one of them replied in broken Greek that he had been arrested for drug possession. They then gave him a fresh set of clothes and shoes and asked him to change out of his wet clothes. The first applicant suspected that he was in a police station, but his captors continued to conceal his whereabouts and the identity of the three persons interrogating him.", "23. After changing into new clothes, the first applicant was led out of the building by the three men. In the reception area of the building, he saw police officers in uniform, which reinforced his assumption that he had been taken to a police station. He was subsequently taken to a hospital in Nicosia by two of his interrogators.", "24. The first applicant was first examined by a doctor at the hospital in the presence of the two men who had taken him there. As the doctor did not speak English or Greek, they relied on the officers\u2019 interpretation to communicate. The first applicant explained to the doctor that he was diabetic and asked the doctor to check his blood sugar levels. Tests showed that his blood sugar level had increased considerably, so the doctor prescribed him an antidiabetic drug. The first applicant also tried to tell the doctor that he was suffering from pain in his pelvis and ribs, and in particular that the pain in the ribs was making it difficult to breathe, but the doctor paid no attention to his grievances and merely registered the swelling in his head and some redness on his chest and back, without examining the injuries in his mouth or lower body.", "25. The first applicant was subsequently referred to a radiologist, who Xrayed his chest and head. He was also examined by a specialist in pulmonary diseases. He was then taken for a drug test. When the first applicant refused to take the drug test and requested to see UN doctors instead, one of the men escorting him punched him in the stomach. It is not clear whether a drug test was subsequently performed on the first applicant.", "26. Following the examinations at the hospital, which lasted about two hours, the first applicant was taken to another building, where he was again placed in an office. In that office, the men handling him showed him a black plastic bag with Turkish writing on it, and told him that the bag contained the drugs recovered from him. However, after some discussion among themselves, one of them went out of the room and came back with another black plastic bag, which bore no writing, and placed the drugs allegedly recovered from him in the new bag. They then placed the bag in a plastic container and sealed it before his eyes.", "27. At approximately 5.30 p.m., the first applicant was taken to yet another small office in a nearby building. There were six men in the office, including the two who had been escorting him and two interpreters. The men were speaking to each other in Turkish, without translating for him, and drinking tea; the first applicant did not understand where he had been taken. One of the interpreters then told him in broken Greek that he was before a judge, who had charged him with possession of drugs, and that he would be placed in custody for eight days. For the brief period he was in that room, the first applicant was not given the opportunity to respond, apart from stating that he had no involvement with drugs, or to ask questions; he was not informed of his rights, nor was he asked whether he wanted the assistance of a lawyer.", "28. The first applicant was subsequently taken to the Atat\u00fcrk Square police station (referred to as the \u201cSaray police station\u201d) in Nicosia and placed in a very small cell, measuring approximately 1.80 by 1.20 metres, where he stayed for the next eight days. The cell was very cold, damp and mouldy in parts, because there was no glass in the small window. Despite the cold, he was given only one filthy blanket to keep warm. There were, moreover, no shower facilities in the police station. As for the toilets, they were very dirty; no soap or toilet paper was provided and the toilet did not flush. The first applicant had to call an officer each time he needed to use the toilet, and on many occasions he was not let out of his cell to go to the toilet, despite his need to urinate frequently on account of his diabetes. He solved the problem by urinating in a plastic bottle inside his cell. The first applicant further stated that he had not been given any food at the Saray police station and that he had had to purchase food from the canteen with his own money.", "29. The first applicant claimed that the next day, a Turkish Cypriot detainee at the Saray police station approached him and told him in Greek that the police had asked him to confess to being the person who would pick up the drugs that the first applicant had intended to hide in the \u201cTRNC\u201d, but that he had refused to collaborate with the police.", "30. At 3 p.m. on 14 December 2000 the first applicant was visited by a UN inspector and a doctor. The inspector issued an incident report following the visit, the relevant parts of which read as follows:", "\u201cDuring the visit the prisoner, who is a diabetic, stated that he had no complaints in relation to how he had been treated by the TCPE [Turkish Cypriot Police Element] but that he had been assaulted i.e. punched and kicked by six civilians and had been threatened with a gun by them a short time before his arrest by the TCPE. He stated that his arrest had occurred in the Dekelia [sic.] area.", "Since his arrest he had been taken to the Hospital by the TCPE where he was administered some drugs for his diabetes. He requested the UN to secure his own clothes for him, to deliver his Diabetes Monitoring Kit to him and also to arrange a visit for his wife. He further stated that he did not do anything and that he was kidnapped at Dekelia. He was in a distressed state.", "He consented to a medical examination by the UN doctor who found a number of tender areas with no bruising.\u201d", "31. On 15 December 2000 the first applicant was visited at the Saray police station by a Turkish Cypriot lawyer, Mr M. Aziz, who was appointed by his family to represent him. The meeting was monitored by a number of police officers. On 16 December 2000 another Turkish Cypriot lawyer, Mr G. Mente\u015f, visited him and they met, once again, in the presence of police officers. The first applicant claimed that all his subsequent meetings with his lawyers at the Saray police station had been held in the presence of police officers or other prison authorities.", "32. The Government\u2019s version of the events is based on the incident reports prepared by Sub-inspector \u00dc.\u00d6., who allegedly led the operation for the first applicant\u2019s arrest.", "33. According to Sub-inspector \u00dc.\u00d6.\u2019s report, on 12 December 2000 he received a tip-off call from a police informant, informing him that a Greek Cypriot named \u201cPanayotis\u201d would enter the \u201cTRNC\u201d through the SBA of Dhekelia the next morning with narcotics, which he would hide in a predesignated spot just outside the Turkish cemetery to the west of the Pergamos checkpoint, to be picked up by a contact from the \u201cTRNC\u201d.", "34. At approximately 4.45 a.m. on 13 December 2000 Sub-inspector \u00dc.\u00d6., accompanied by police sergeants R.\u00d6. and H.M., took their positions in the vicinity of the drop-off point to wait in ambush. At around 6.05 a.m., before daybreak, they saw someone approaching on foot from the direction of the SBA, approximately seventy metres to the west of the Pergamos checkpoint. It was believed that this person, who was later identified as the first applicant, had crossed the ditch which ran along the boundary between the \u201cTRNC\u201d and the SBA and which was filled with rainwater at the relevant time, and then jumped over the wire fence between boundary stones nos. 96 and 97, where parts of the fence had shrunk. As the first applicant was walking towards an olive tree in the designated area, Sub-inspector \u00dc.\u00d6. came out of his hiding place and ordered him to stop, in Turkish. Upon hearing that order, the first applicant started to run back towards the SBA; however, the two police sergeants caught up with him and seized him after a struggle, during which the applicant fell to the ground. The sub-inspector then grabbed the package that the first applicant was holding in his hands, which was wrapped in a black plastic bag. In the meantime, Sergeant H.M. informed the first applicant in Greek that they were police officers and told him that he had entered \u201cTRNC\u201d territory without permission. He also asked the first applicant to identify himself and to explain what he was carrying in the plastic bag. The first applicant gave his name and stated that he was innocent. The police officers then handcuffed him and placed him in the police car. Once inside the car, the police officers opened the plastic bag and found two plates of cannabis resin wrapped in a white cloth and a Greek newspaper. Sergeant H.M. informed the applicant once again, in Greek, that he had entered \u201cTRNC\u201d territory without permission and that he had in his possession prohibited drugs.", "35. At approximately 6.50 a.m. the first applicant was taken to the Famagusta (Gazima\u011fusa) police headquarters for an identity check, where he was also questioned about where he had obtained the drugs and to whom he was taking them in the \u201cTRNC\u201d. The first applicant remained silent in response to those questions.", "36. At approximately 8.30 a.m. Sub-inspector \u00dc.\u00d6. and Sergeant H.M. went to the narcotics bureau of the Nicosia (Lefko\u015fa) police headquarters to inform their superiors of the first applicant\u2019s arrest, while the first applicant stayed at the Famagusta police headquarters under the supervision of Sergeant R.\u00d6.. After going to the narcotics bureau, Sub-inspector \u00dc.\u00d6. and Sergeant H.M. went back to the scene of the incident, where Subinspector \u00dc.\u00d6. sketched a map of the area and another sergeant took photographs. Sub-inspector \u00dc.\u00d6. also took a soil sample from the area for forensic analysis.", "37. At approximately 11.30 a.m. Sub-inspector \u00dc.\u00d6. and Sergeant H.M. went back to the Famagusta police headquarters, and took the first applicant\u2019s clothes and shoes as evidence.", "38. At approximately 12.50 p.m. the first applicant was taken to the Dr Burhan Nalbanto\u011flu State Hospital (\u201cthe Nicosia State Hospital\u201d) for a general medical examination. After the examination, he was taken to the narcotics bureau of the Nicosia police headquarters, where the material which was obtained from him earlier and which was believed to be cannabis resin was sealed in his presence, to be dispatched to the laboratory for further examination. The first applicant\u2019s shoes, together with the soil sample collected from the area where he was believed to have crossed into the \u201cTRNC\u201d, were also sealed before his eyes for forensic analysis.", "39. Later the same evening, the first applicant was brought before the \u201cTRNC\u201d Nicosia District Court, where the presiding judge ordered his remand in custody for eight days to facilitate the police investigation. The hearing was held in the judge\u2019s office and the applicant was assisted by two interpreters.", "40. According to the detailed incident report prepared by Sub-inspector \u00dc.\u00d6., on the night of 13 December 2000 various measures were taken in the area where the first applicant had been arrested to catch the person who was supposed to pick up the drugs, but no one showed up.", "41. The analysis report of 18 December 2000 drawn up by the Ministry of Health and Environment of the \u201cTRNC\u201d confirmed that the substance allegedly seized from the first applicant was cannabis resin, in the amount of 1.1 kilograms.", "42. According to the report of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the \u201cTRNC\u201d dated 2 January 2001, various different kinds of soil were found under the first applicant\u2019s shoes, while the muddy specimen found on the heel appeared to be the most recent. The amount of soil extracted from the heel was not found to be sufficient for a comprehensive analysis. Nevertheless, the limited examinations conducted revealed that the sample obtained from the shoes resembled the sample obtained from the scene of the incident, without, however, being identical. The report indicated that variations in soil properties could be due to the depth from which the soil sample had been obtained, or whether it had been obtained from a fertilised part of the land or not.", "43. On 21 December 2000 Sub-inspector \u00dc.\u00d6. informed the first applicant of the charges against him, which were the possession of 1.1 kilograms of cannabis resin and its unlawful import into the \u201cTRNC\u201d. The first applicant, who was provided with an interpreter, used his right to remain silent, merely stating that his lawyer would defend him. However, he refused to sign a written statement to that effect.", "44. Later the same day, the first applicant was brought before the \u201cTRNC\u201d Nicosia District Court for a bail hearing, where he was represented by two lawyers, Mr M. Aziz, a local lawyer practising in \u201cTRNC\u201d, and Mr P. Brogan, who practised at the English Bar. He was also assisted by an interpreter. At the hearing, the prosecution requested the court to order the first applicant\u2019s detention until the trial in view of the risk of his absconding, and called Subinspector \u00dc.\u00d6. as a witness.", "45. The first applicant\u2019s counsel pleaded in favour of his release, and also argued that he had not been arrested in \u201cTRNC\u201d territory as alleged, but had been abducted from SBA territory by unknown persons and then taken to the \u201cTRNC\u201d after being badly beaten. The assault had left injuries on his body, as documented in various medical reports. The first applicant did not make any additional comments on his alleged ill-treatment, but merely stated that he would appear for trial if he were released on bail.", "46. Sub-inspector \u00dc.\u00d6. denied the allegation that the first applicant had been assaulted and stated that the injuries observed on his body might have been caused as a result of the resistance he had shown to his arrest.", "47. At the end of the hearing, the \u201cTRNC\u201d Nicosia District Court refused the first applicant\u2019s bail request on the weight of the arguments presented by the prosecution and ordered his pre-trial detention for a period not exceeding three months. The District Court indicated in this connection that it had not found the first applicant\u2019s statement that he would appear for trial if released on bail to be credible and reliable, but it did not comment on his counsel\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment. The first applicant was transferred to the Nicosia Central Prison after the hearing.", "48. It appears that on 30 January 2001 the first applicant appeared before the court for another bail hearing. The Court has not been provided with the minutes of that hearing, but it appears that the hearing was adjourned until 8 February 2001 on account of the first applicant\u2019s deteriorating health, and that he was transferred to hospital for treatment for high blood sugar levels (see paragraphs 106-109 below for further details).", "49. On 6 February 2001 the charges against the first applicant were lodged with the Famagusta District Court.", "50. On 8 February 2001 the Famagusta District Court convened for a preliminary inquiry in the case, which lasted until 15 February 2001, during which period the District Court sat for six full days. The first applicant was present throughout the hearings and was represented by both his lawyers. He was also assisted by interpreters.", "51. During the preliminary inquiry the prosecution called five witnesses: the three police officers who had allegedly arrested the first applicant, namely Sub-inspector \u00dc.\u00d6. and police sergeants H.M. and R.\u00d6.; another police officer who had interpreted the formal charges against the first applicant; and the forensic chemist who had analysed the drugs allegedly seized from him. The first applicant, on the other hand, called one witness, Mr J.C., the UN Liaison Officer in Cyprus at the material time.", "52. The Famagusta District Court first heard the prosecution witnesses, who gave testimonies consistent with the incident reports and presented evidence against the first applicant, including a sketched map indicating where the applicant had crossed into the \u201cTRNC\u201d and where he had been captured, photographs of the relevant areas taken a few hours after the arrest, the drugs allegedly recovered from the applicant, and the clothes and shoes he had been wearing on the relevant day, which were soiled with mud on account of the struggle on the ground, as well as copies of the medical reports drawn up following his arrest.", "53. The prosecution witnesses were subsequently cross-examined by the defence counsel, who challenged the veracity and credibility of their testimonies in the light of the first applicant\u2019s account of events, according to which he had been kidnapped from his car in SBA territory and had then been handed over to the \u201cTRNC\u201d police. The defence counsel accordingly asked detailed questions about the tip-off call which Sub-inspector \u00dc.\u00d6. had allegedly received the day before the first applicant\u2019s arrest and the identity of the police informant; the planning of the ambush and the weather conditions on the relevant morning; the route that the first applicant had followed to reach the \u201cTRNC\u201d; the exact point from which he had allegedly crossed into \u201cTRNC\u201d territory; and the paperwork undertaken by the police subsequent to the first applicant\u2019s arrest. The responses received appeared to be consistent with the earlier testimonies and did not reveal new evidence, apart from some factual details, such as the height of the border fence, which, according to the prosecution witnesses, was approximately 110 centimetres at the point of crossing but yielded when pressed, details of the conversation with the police informant, and the notes taken by the arresting officers in their police notebooks prior to and after the operation.", "54. Sub-inspector \u00dc.\u00d6. was asked why he had not submitted the package of drugs allegedly recovered from the first applicant for a fingerprint examination, to which he responded that he had seen no need for such an examination as he had taken the package directly from the applicant\u2019s hands himself. He further maintained that no examination had been made of the footprints identified on the terrain, as the first applicant had apparently slipped and had not left very clear marks.", "55. Sub-inspector \u00dc.\u00d6. was also asked whether he had recorded the tip-off he had received from his informant. He responded that he had recorded both the tip-off call and the subsequent operation conducted on the morning of 13 December 2000 for the first applicant\u2019s arrest in his police notebook, which had been submitted to the court as evidence.", "56. On the last day of the preliminary inquiry the defence counsel called Mr J.C. as the defence\u2019s sole witness. Mr J.C. stated that he had been appointed by the UNFICYP as a Civil Affairs Police Liaison Officer. His duty was to liaise between the Greek and the Turkish Cypriot sides on policing and humanitarian issues. He explained that on 3 December 2000 his contact person on the Turkish side on humanitarian issues, Mr M.\u0130., who was the head of the Directorate on Consular Affairs and Minorities Issues of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Defence of the \u201cTRNC\u201d, had called him for a meeting. During the meeting, Mr M.\u0130. had told Mr J.C. that he wanted to protest, through the UN, about the recent arrest of \u00d6mer Gazi Teko\u011ful by the Greek Cypriot police in the UN buffer zone. Mr M.\u0130. had allegedly told him that if \u00d6mer Gazi Teko\u011ful was not released before noon on 4 December 2000, Greek Cypriots from Pyla, a mixed village located in the UN buffer zone, would start disappearing. M.\u0130. had added that if the Greek Cypriot police had adopted a new policy of kidnapping suspects from the buffer zone, the Turkish Cypriot police would respond in the same manner.", "57. In response to the objections of the prosecution regarding the admissibility of Mr J.C.\u2019s testimony as evidence, the Famagusta District Court held that it would accept Mr J.C.\u2019s testimony not as evidence as to the truth of the statement allegedly made by Mr M.\u0130., which would be against the rule on hearsay evidence, but only as evidence of the fact that a meeting had taken place between Mr M.\u0130. and Mr J.C.", "58. On the basis of the testimonies and other evidence presented before it, on 15 February 2001 the Famagusta District Court decided that there were sufficient grounds to commit the first applicant for trial before the Famagusta Assize Court. It also prolonged the first applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention.", "59. The first applicant claimed that during the preliminary inquiry, he had seen one of his abductors amongst the audience, but that the latter had managed to leave the court room before he had had the chance to point him out to his lawyer.", "60. The first applicant\u2019s trial commenced in the Famagusta Assize Court on 23 February 2001. He attended all of the hearings together with his two lawyers. He was also provided with an interpreter.", "61. In addition to the five witnesses who had testified at the preliminary inquiry, the prosecution called as witnesses a forensic police officer, a \u201cTRNC\u201d military officer stationed in Pergamos, the three doctors who had examined the first applicant on 13 December 2000 and the agricultural engineer who had analysed the soil obtained from the first applicant\u2019s shoes. The evidence provided by the prosecution witnesses, including during crossexamination, was, in general, consistent with the previous testimonies and official reports.", "62. During his cross-examination Sub-inspector \u00dc.\u00d6. was asked a number of questions regarding the identity of his informant, which he refused to answer. However, he gave detailed information about the telephone conversation he had had with the informant, and also about his \u201cexploratory visit\u201d to the estimated drug drop-off point in the evening of 12 December 2000 together with the informant. Subinspector \u00dc.\u00d6. also stated that he had informed his supervisor about the information he had received from his informant prior to the operation conducted on 13 December 2000, while keeping the identity of the informant secret. However, he had not alerted the local police and military officers in Pergamos in order to protect the secrecy of the operation. In response to a question as to why no one had been left at the drop-off point following the first applicant\u2019s arrest to capture the latter\u2019s contact person in the \u201cTRNC\u201d, Sub-inspector \u00dc.\u00d6. stated that he had suspected his informant to be that contact person and that, in any event, a unit had been stationed at the dropoff point on the night of 13 December 2000 to catch any suspects.", "63. During his cross-examination Dr E.A., who had conducted the initial medical examination of the first applicant after his arrest, was asked to provide details of the findings of his medical report (see paragraph 24 above). Accordingly, he indicated that on the relevant morning he had observed a swelling with a diameter of 4 centimetres on the left side of the first applicant\u2019s head, as well as redness measuring 0.5 cm by 4-5 cm behind the right ear, redness measuring 8-10 cm across the chest, and two areas of redness measuring 3-5 cm by 3-4 cm on the back, all of which appeared to have been sustained only hours before the examination. He stated that the swelling observed above the first applicant\u2019s left ear could have been caused by blunt-force trauma or by the impact of falling on a stone or similar hard object. He also confirmed that the examination had been conducted in the presence of two persons in civilian clothes, whom he had perceived to be police officers and who had also acted as interpreters between the first applicant and himself. He added that although he had raised the question specifically, the first applicant had not expressed any complaints of bodily injury, apart from stating that he was diabetic. The police, on the other hand, had explained that there had been a scuffle during his arrest.", "64. Dr \u0130.A., who had examined the first applicant after Dr E.A. for any pulmonary problems, stated that the first applicant had presented symptoms of bronchitis. He had therefore prescribed medicine to him for that purpose but had not noted any other injuries or marks on his face or torso. He also indicated that the examination had been conducted in the presence of another person in civilian clothes, whom he assumed to be a police officer.", "65. Dr H.K., a general surgeon, stated before the court that he had also examined the first applicant on the relevant day in response to his complaints of abdominal pain, but had not identified any causes for such pain. In response to a question from the first applicant\u2019s lawyer, he stated that a blow to the abdomen could cause pain in that area. He added that if the blow was strong, it would also leave a mark, but he had not noted any such marks on the first applicant\u2019s abdomen.", "66. On 23 March 2001, after the close of the case for the prosecution, the first applicant was called to make his defence statement. His sworn testimony was largely in line with the account of events he subsequently submitted to the Strasbourg Court, including the detailed allegations of his abduction and illtreatment. However, he did not claim before the trial court that his abduction had been witnessed by the driver of a certain white Isuzu pickup.", "67. Following the first applicant\u2019s statement and crossexamination, the defence called seventeen witnesses to testify in support of its case, including a number of SBA police officers. The pertinent witness statements are summarised below.", "68. Mr G.H. stated that he had left his house in Larnaca to go to work at approximately at 5.30 a.m. on the morning of 13 December 2000. While on his way to Pergamos to pick up his Turkish Cypriot workers, he had overtaken the first applicant\u2019s car, which was heading in the same direction. When asked whether he had actually seen the applicant in the car, G.H. answered in the negative and indicated that he had only identified the car from its number plate. Moreover, he had been unable to tell whether there had been only one person or more in the car. G.H. claimed that as he had approached Pergamos, he had noticed a stationary white car on the left-hand side of the road, with its bonnet open and a man examining its engine. Shortly afterwards, he had noticed a red car with a number plate starting with a \u201cZ\u201d, parked to the right of the white car. He had driven past those cars without stopping, but while driving by, he had heard a man shouting. He had assumed that it was the driver of the white car calling for help with his car. He had arrived at Rabiye\u2019s caf\u00e9 where his workers were waiting for him at approximately 5.45 a.m., had a coffee and then left with his workers. As he was driving past the spot where he had seen the two Renault cars previously, he had noticed the first applicant\u2019s car parked oddly, almost in the middle of the road and facing towards the roadside, with its driver\u2019s door open, its engine running and its headlights on. The two other cars, on the other hand, had gone.", "69. On the morning of 13 December 2000, as he was driving to Pergamos to pick up his Turkish Cypriot workers from Rabiye\u2019s caf\u00e9, Mr A.G. had noticed a red car with a red \u201cZ\u201d number plate parked on the left side of the road just before the junction leading to the ex-Pergamos camp. It had looked like the police cars that were used by the \u201cTRNC\u201d police in Pyla. The red car was facing Pergamos with its bonnet open, and there were two men standing in front of it. He had then noticed, on the opposite side of the road by the cypress trees, a white car, which had flashed its headlights at him. He had driven past both cars without stopping and arrived at Rabiye\u2019s caf\u00e9 at approximately 5.40 to 5.45 a.m. He had left the caf\u00e9 at approximately 6 a.m. and while driving past the place where he had previously seen the two cars, he had noticed that those cars had gone but this time the first applicant\u2019s car was parked on the right side of the road, facing the wrong direction, with its engine running, and its headlights and wipers on. The driver\u2019s door was also open.", "70. Mr N.M. left his house at approximately 5.30 a.m. on 13 December 2000 to pick up his Turkish Cypriot workers at their designated caf\u00e9 by the Pergamos checkpoint. A red double-cabin pickup, which he later learned belonged to the first applicant, was driving approximately seventy metres ahead of him in the same direction. When he saw that part of the road was flooded, N.M. first turned his car around to return home, as he thought the weather would not be suitable for construction work that day, but then changed his mind and resumed his journey to Pergamos. On reaching the junction leading to the ex-Pergamos camp sometime between 5.40 and 5.50 a.m., he noticed the first applicant\u2019s car parked in the right-hand lane of the road, facing slightly to the right. He also saw someone getting out of that car and walking towards the fields on the right. There was no one else in the car, but the engine was running. The driver\u2019s door and both rear passenger doors were open. He also noticed three or four other people approximately twenty metres further down in the fields to the right, but did not see any other cars in the vicinity. He then heard someone yelling \u201cLet me go!\u201d in Greek from the direction of the fields, but was too scared to get out of the car to see what was going on, and drove back home.", "71. While driving towards Pergamos to pick up his Turkish Cypriot workers at approximately 6.05 a.m. on the morning of 13 December 2000, Mr Yiannis Tsiakkourmas saw his brother\u2019s car parked just before the junction leading to the ex-Pergamos camp. He noticed that the engine was running and the wipers were on, the driver\u2019s door was open, but his brother was not around. His phone and bag were, however, in the car. He drove to Rabiye\u2019s caf\u00e9 to ask about his brother, and when he found no further information he took two of his Turkish Cypriot workers with him and drove back to the place where he had found the first applicant\u2019s car. He then went to the SBA police to report his brother missing. Upon returning to the place of the incident, and prior to the arrival of any SBA police officers, he asked one of his Turkish Cypriot workers to move the car to avoid causing any accidents. The car was accordingly parked in a safer spot on the left side of the main road.", "72. On the morning of 13 December 2000, while driving to Pergamos to pick up his Turkish Cypriot workers, Mr S.E. saw a red Chevrolet doublecabin pickup, which he later learned was the first applicant\u2019s car, parked in the right-hand lane of the road approximately 500 metres from Rabiye\u2019s caf\u00e9, slightly facing the left-hand side of the road and with the driver\u2019s door open. When he reached the caf\u00e9, one of the first applicant\u2019s Turkish Cypriot workers approached him and said that his boss had still not arrived. S.E. let the worker call the first applicant from his mobile phone, but the first applicant did not answer. S.E. then left the caf\u00e9 with his workers. As he was driving past the first applicant\u2019s car again, he saw three or four people standing by it, including the first applicant\u2019s brother, Yiannis Tsiakkourmas.", "73. Three other Greek Cypriot builders, Mr H.Z., Mr A.S. and Mr M.T., also gave similar accounts to that of S.E. regarding the location of the first applicant\u2019s car.", "74. Detective Sergeant P.P., a Greek Cypriot, was the chief investigating officer appointed by the SBA police to investigate the first applicant\u2019s alleged abduction. He stated that at approximately 6.30 a.m. on the morning of 13 December 2000, he had seen Yiannis Tsiakkourmas at the SBA police station, reporting his brother missing. When he went to the scene of the incident at around 7 a.m., he found the first applicant\u2019s red Chevrolet pickup, which had already been moved from its original position, at the exPergamos camp junction, on the left-hand side of the main road from Pyla to Pergamos. He noticed that the car key was still in the ignition, and there was a handbag and a mobile phone inside the car. He and a couple of other officers searched the vicinity for signs of the applicant, with the help of a sniffer dog, but found no clues to indicate his whereabouts. He claimed that in some parts of the fields by the side of the main road, the mud was 30 to 40 centimetres deep, which made walking in the fields very hard. He then instructed Sergeant N. to go to the Pergamos checkpoint to enquire whether the first applicant had been detained by the \u201cTRNC\u201d police that morning. The answer was negative.", "75. Detective Sergeant P.P. presented to the trial court a map he had sketched on 3 January 2001, covering the area between boundary stones nos. 96 and 97 where the first applicant was alleged to have crossed into the \u201cTRNC\u201d, as well as some photographs that the SBA police had taken in the area. The sketched map indicated a stream, with a barbed-wire fence to its north, marking the boundary between the SBA and the \u201cTRNC\u201d. About fifteen metres from the barbed wire was an olive tree in an uncultivated field, which was the alleged drop-off point for the drugs the first applicant was accused of smuggling. According to the map, the barbed-wire fence in the relevant area was 120 to 140 cm high on average, but P.P. acknowledged that the fence had deformed and sunk in certain parts, which was also evident in some of the photographs. Moreover, there was a small hole measuring 6 by 20 cm at the bottom of the fence adjoining the field. According to P.P., the approximate depth of the stream on the relevant date was two and a half to three metres.", "76. In the cross-examination, the prosecution argued that the exact location where the first applicant had been captured, including the deformed wire fences where he had crossed into the \u201cTRNC\u201d, had intentionally not been photographed by the SBA police, so the photographs submitted to the trial court as evidence were irrelevant and misleading. Moreover, the wire fence on the SBA-\u201cTRNC\u201d border was not barbed throughout, contrary to P.P.\u2019s suggestion. The prosecution claimed that the investigation conducted by the SBA police had lacked independence and impartiality.", "77. Mr N.P., a Greek Cypriot superintendent in the SBA police service, testified that at approximately 1.30 a.m. on 13 December 2000 he had received a call at the police station stating that some of the roads in the SBA of Dhekelia had been flooded because of the heavy rain that night. He therefore left the police station to check the roads and instruct the rerouting of certain roads as necessary. At approximately 5 a.m. he drove past the area where the first applicant\u2019s vehicle was later found abandoned. Although the heavy rain had stopped by that time, it was still drizzling and the road in the relevant area was covered with three to five inches of water. By 6 a.m. the rain had stopped completely.", "78. When shown the photographs which the \u201cTRNC\u201d police had allegedly taken in the area later that morning, Mr N.P. said that the ground looked too dry, so those photographs could not have been taken on 13 December 2000.", "79. Sergeant A.E.N. was a Turkish Cypriot working in the SBA police force. At approximately 6.25 a.m. on the morning of 13 December 2000, he crossed from the \u201cTRNC\u201d to the SBA through the Pergamos checkpoint to report to his work station. As he was approaching the ex-Pergamos camp junction on the main road from Pergamos to Pyla, he noticed a stationary car further down his lane, facing his direction. Since the headlights of the car were bothering his eyes, he flashed his lights, but there was no reaction. As he approached, he saw that the stationary car was a red pickup and the driver\u2019s door was open. When A.E.N. pulled up by the red car to see what was going on, he noticed that the car\u2019s engine was also running, although there was no one inside it. Once he reached the police station he reported what he had seen and was accordingly instructed to go back to the place of the incident for further investigation. When A.E.N. went back at approximately 7.10 a.m., he found that Yiannis Tsiakkourmas and two Turkish Cypriot workers had moved the red pickup and had parked it about 25 metres down the road leading to the ex-Pergamos camp.", "80. Mr D.J.W. was a search-dog trainer in the British armed forces. At approximately 8.15 a.m. on the morning of 13 December 2000 he was deployed to track the first applicant\u2019s whereabouts with his dog. When he arrived there were six SBA police officers at the scene of the incident. He first explained to the trial court how the tracking process worked in general and stated that the dog could only track one person at a time, and would follow the freshest track in the area. On that morning, they had started the search at the place where the first applicant\u2019s car was first found. They had covered the 400-metre perimeter, but had not been able to find any tracks. Since the recent rainfall had made the ground wet, it would not have been possible to walk on the grass by the asphalt road without leaving footprints, but they had found no such marks, which meant that the first applicant had not left the area on foot.", "81. The defence lastly called Mr J.C. as a witness, to testify on his exchange with Mr M.\u0130., an officer of the \u201cTRNC\u201d Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The trial court, however, ruled that Mr J.C. could not testify on the content of Mr M.\u0130.\u2019s statements in view of the rules on hearsay evidence.", "82. At the hearing held on 10 April 2001, the first applicant\u2019s lawyer, Mr P. Brogan, told the trial court that while the defence had a number of Turkish Cypriot witnesses who wished to testify in favour of the defence, mainly to confirm the sighting of the abandoned vehicle, it had not been possible to secure their attendance as those witnesses were being intimidated by the Turkish Cypriot authorities. According to submissions made by the applicants, the President of the Court responded in a hostile manner and requested proof of service of witness summonses on the relevant Turkish Cypriot persons, but the exchange between the President and the defence counsel was not included in the minutes of the hearing.", "83. At the hearing held on 11 April 2001, the first applicant\u2019s other lawyer, Mr M. Aziz, informed the trial court that the defence still had eight more witnesses to call. However, since they had not managed to duly serve those witnesses with official summonses, and most of them had no further information to share with the court than that already presented, they had decided to relinquish their right to call those witnesses and to close the defence case. The President of the Court asked in return why the said witnesses had not been served with a \u201cshort summons\u201d to secure their attendance and stated that the court was very sensitive to this issue in view of Mr P. Brogan\u2019s allegations of witness intimidation made at the previous hearing. Mr M. Aziz stated in response that he had no information as to the factual basis of Mr P. Brogan\u2019s allegations of intimidation and that he did not mean to blame any State officials for the non-attendance of the Turkish Cypriot witnesses.", "84. On 26 April 2001 the Famagusta Assize Court delivered its judgment against the first applicant, which reads as follows:", "\u201cThe legislation, the testimonies and the evidence presented have been assessed [by the court] comprehensively.", "[The court] has carefully observed the prosecution witnesses, as well as the defendant and his witnesses during their depositions.", "While there are some small discrepancies between the testimonies of ... prosecution witnesses, their statements were mainly found to be credible, accurate and reliable.", "On the other hand, [the court] has not found the testimonies of the defendant and his witnesses to be credible, accurate and reliable. Moreover, we decided that these testimonies were not likely to be true, on the basis of the principle of \u201cbalance of probabilities\u201d.", "Since all witness testimonies and the evidence presented to the court are in the case file, we find it unnecessary to cite them one by one in our judgment.", "We believe that on the basis of the testimonies and evidence they presented, the prosecution have proven, beyond reasonable doubt, both charges against the defendant.", "Consequently, the defendant is found guilty of both charges brought against him.\u201d", "85. The first applicant was sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment on the first count, with no sentence on the second count. The Famagusta Assize Court, however, ruled that he be released from prison in view of the time he had already spent on remand.", "86. The medical examinations conducted on 13 December 2000 in the aftermath of the first applicant\u2019s arrest have been outlined in paragraphs 63 65 above. According to the information and documents provided by the parties, he underwent further medical examinations throughout his detention in the \u201cTRNC\u201d, the details of which are as follows.", "87. The day after his arrest, on 14 December, the first applicant was examined by a UNFICYP medical officer, Dr S.T., at his request. It appears that a \u201cTRNC\u201d official in civilian clothes supervised the examination and took notes.", "88. According to the information in the case file, the first applicant told Dr S.T. that he had been punched and kicked at the time of his arrest and that he felt acute pain in his ribs and pelvis. The first applicant claimed before the Court that he had been prevented from saying more as the \u201cTRNC\u201d official supervising the examination had told him to keep quiet.", "89. When conducting a physical examination, the doctor noted a slight swelling above the first applicant\u2019s left ear; a graze behind the right ear and the right side of the back; and tender areas on the right side of the chest and the left side of the back, behind the neck, and around the tail bone and the right hip. No handcuff marks were noted on his wrists.", "90. It appears from Dr S.T.\u2019s notes that the first applicant indicated that he had been treated well after being handed over to the uniformed police on 13 December 2000, and that he was being given his diabetes medication. Dr S.T. noted that the applicant\u2019s diabetes was the type that could usually be controlled by diet (type-2 diabetes) and further remarked that arrangements had been made for a blood glucose monitoring kit to enable him to monitor his diabetes. There were, however, no remarks regarding the first applicant\u2019s intimidation by the \u201cTRNC\u201d official supervising the examination.", "91. On 28 December 2000 Dr S.T. made an unannounced visit to the central prison to check on the first applicant. During the visit he also performed a blood sugar test. In a report he issued the next day, Dr S.T. indicated that although the applicant\u2019s blood sugar level was somewhat high (\u201c197 g/dL\u201d), it was still within the normal range for him \u2013 he had informed the doctor that his levels were usually around \u201c200g/dL\u201d. The doctor also noted that the applicant\u2019s request for a special diet for his diabetes was being met by the prison authorities. In conclusion, Dr S.T. was satisfied that the applicant was receiving adequate treatment for his diabetes and was being allowed to monitor his blood sugar levels.", "92. Dr S.T. visited the first applicant again on 19 and 23 January 2001, together with a Turkish Cypriot doctor, H.S., to check his physical state and blood sugar levels. In his report dated 23 January 2001, Dr S.T. made the following remarks:", "\u201cIn my opinion a good standard of medical care is being given. However, because of Mr. Tsiakkourmas\u2019 mental state and the stress he is under, his diabetic control is poor. There is also a question as to whether or not he is complying fully with his treatment.\u201d", "93. Dr S.T. also visited the first applicant on 16 February and 9 April 2001 for routine medical checks and noted that he was in reasonable health. In his latter report dated 9 April 2001, Dr S.T. also stated that the first applicant had made no complaints of ill-treatment by the prison staff.", "94. On 8 January 2001 the first applicant was examined by Dr G.P., a Hungarian specialist in internal medicine and endocrinology practising in Limassol, in relation to his diabetes. The doctor noted that his blood sugar level was \u201c340 mg/dL\u201d and that he had lost a considerable amount of weight since his imprisonment. He then concluded his report as follows:", "\u201cThe obvious weight loss and marked hyperglycaemia without any other signs of concomitant disease can only be explained by a rapid metabolic deterioration that followed his imprisonment. The initial and ongoing stress situation, the involuntary immobilisation of a formerly physically active person in association with marked depression are factors which increase both hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance in the diabetic person and lead to catabolism. The present treatment is obviously insufficient to prevent further worsening.", "If his immediate return to his normal environment and daily activities is not achievable at present, I suggest this:", "1. Glimepiride (Amaryl) 1.0 mg tablet to be taken twice daily", "2. Metformin (Glucophage, Lipha) 500 mg tablet once daily", "3. Diabetic food (food to be taken at least five times daily, no added sugar) with adequate water consumption", "4. Regular daily physical exercise", "5. Blood glucose testing three times daily", "If these measures do not improve his diabetes control significantly in few days\u2019 time or signs of further deterioration are detected, the commencement of insulin treatment and/or hospitalisation should be considered. His physical state should also be followed up to decide if medical treatment is necessary.\u201d", "95. On 15 January 2001 Dr G.P. saw the first applicant once again at the Nicosia State Hospital, together with Dr H.S. and a UNFICYP medical officer, R.K. Dr G.P. noted his findings as follows:", "\u201cThe patient was in a very bad mood ... and he mentioned that he didn\u2019t want to comply with further medical assistance from whatever side. ... [He said that] he took this tablet [Amaryl] only once daily and didn\u2019t take the other tablet [Glucophage] recommended during my first visit.", "His physical examination was carried out by Dr H.S. in our presence.... His blood sugar was 349 mg/dL.... I advised an abdominal ultrasound examination which was carried out without delay by the X-ray department in our presence. Multiple small stones were found in both kidneys without any other pathological findings.", "After these I tried to convince him to comply with our medical recommendations ...", "The main problem now seems to be the lack of compliance with the medical recommendations.", "His parodontitis [sic.] and the presence of small renal stones are also warning signs that his diabetic control must be improved otherwise a progressing inflammation in the mouth and a urine infection can worsen his diabetes with severe acute consequences. To avoid this, a proper compliance with the medical recommendations seems to be absolutely important.", "In this situation a psychiatric exploration is also necessary, carried out by a doctor who speaks Greek as a mother tongue ... This exploration may help break his present denial of medical care and provide further opinion [on] how to proceed with his medication.\u201d", "Dr G.P.\u2019s findings coincided with the separate report prepared by the Turkish Cypriot doctor, H.S.", "96. On 25 January Dr G.P. saw the first applicant for the third time and noted his findings as follows:", "\u201c... He complained of regular gastric pain ... He confirmed that he was taking the anti-diabetic drug according to the last recommendation.", "... I took his blood sugar, which was 199 mg/dL in the fasting state this time.", "We recommended hospitalisation for a better blood sugar stabilisation and followup. The idea was rejected by Dr H.S. who suggested a more frequent blood sugar monitoring to show if his blood sugar levels can be diminished, if required, with an elevated anti-diabetic dose without bringing him out of the prison. On my fears that the patient may have a stress mediated gastric ulceration that can progress into perforation or bleeding he promised to arrange a gastroscopy on 30 or 31st January next week.\u201d", "97. On 15 March 2001 Dr G.P. examined the first applicant for the fourth and the last time, in the presence of Dr H.S. and a UNFICYP medical officer, and made the following notes:", "\u201c... He has not performed a blood sugar test since weeks but in general he felt somatically fit. Sometimes he does not take the Amaryl tablet in the evening when he \u2018feels alright\u2019.", "... I took his blood sugar, which was 191 mg/dL ... non-fasting.", "There was an agreement among all three doctors present that it was time to carry out new laboratory and ECG tests. However, the patient denied all these and allowed only the aforementioned blood sugar test ...", "His explanation was that he felt helplessness, nobody wanted to help him to take him out of prison, he didn\u2019t even ask for my visit or for any other medical help in the future. He also said that he would stop tablet taking on Monday and would start a hunger strike. I tried to explain to him that in his health situation this would be really dangerous, could lead to sudden worsening of his status. I could not convince him to abandon this idea, that he should comply with the medical suggestions to remain fit ...", "His anger and negativistic attitude to health care can be signs of deepening depression.\u201d", "98. On 12 January 2001 the first applicant was examined by another UNFICYP medical officer, Dr R.K., who made the following findings after his visit:", "\u201cMr. Tsiakkourmas ... suffers from diabetes type II for about four years.", "The patient was found in a good physical condition but seemed to be depressive ...", "His blood sugar level [was] 220 mg/dL ...", "The drugs recently prescribed by Dr G.P. are available at prison, but he refuses to take any other drugs than prescribed by his \u2018own doctor\u2019. There is also the possibility to monitor the bodyweight and to check the blood sugar level three times a day, as recommended, but the patient refuses this as well, because he wants to avoid to be pricked too often and in his opinion doing this every two or three days seem to be sufficient. The perfect therapy plan developed by Dr G.P. is not accepted by the patient!", "...", "His blood sugar level is too high and has to be properly adjusted, but there is no acute danger to his life. The main problem at this moment seems to be the fact that he refuses any other medication prescribed or monitoring recommended than from his own doctor.\u201d", "99. Dr R.K. issued the following \u201cinter-office memorandum\u201d on 16 January 2001 in relation to the first applicant\u2019s health situation:", "\u201c1. Dr. H.S., the [Turkish Cypriot] responsible doctor at Nicosia General Hospital North, is an endocrinologist and seems to be very competent and cooperative. All necessary drugs and means to carry out recommended tests (blood sugar level, blood pressure, weight etc.) and supportive measures (physical exercise, diet etc.) are available at the hospital as well as at the prison.", "2. The main problem at this moment is the patient\u2019s unwillingness to follow the therapy plan for understandable reasons (lack of trust of foreign doctors, depressive situation ...).", "...\u201d", "100. After his visit on 25 January 2001 Dr R.K. noted that the first applicant had still not been taking the recommended medication regularly.", "101. According to the documents submitted by the respondent Government, the first applicant was also regularly examined by Turkish Cypriot doctors.", "102. On 3 and 8 January 2001 a Turkish Cypriot doctor, whose name cannot be discerned from the reports, examined the first applicant and measured his blood sugar levels. He also prescribed medication for his diabetes, including 1mg of Amaryl.", "103. On 15 January 2001 Dr H.S. examined the first applicant in the presence of Dr G.P., Dr M.K. and a UN officer at the Nicosia State Hospital and noted the following in his report:", "\u201cTsiakkourmas suffers from type-2 diabetes and takes Amaryl (1mg), twice a day. While his diabetes was controlled through diet previously, currently he is hyperglycaemic.", "It was noticed during the examination that Tsiakkourmas was stressed and depressed ... The right lumbar region was sensitive to percussion and there was pain upon deep palpation at the right hypochondriac region ... The results of the examination of the extremities were normal.", "His blood sugar level was 347 mg/dl ...", "Based on these results, his gallbladder and kidneys were examined in ultrasound. His gallbladder was empty and no stones were noted; there were stones in both kidneys. Liver, spleen, urinary bladder and prostate were normal.\u201d", "Based on his findings, Dr H.S. recommended that the first applicant continue with his medication and special diet, exercise daily, measure his glucose levels regularly and be brought to the hospital for examination by him twice a week. He also recommended the first applicant\u2019s referral to a psychiatrist.", "104. It appears that Dr H.S. continued to examine the first applicant regularly throughout his detention. In his report dated 22 January 2001, he noted that the first applicant had refused to be examined and had stated that he had not been taking his medication.", "105. On 25 January 2001 the first applicant was examined by a Turkish Cypriot psychiatrist, Dr \u0130.T., with the assistance of an interpreter. The doctor noted no pathologies, apart from the applicant\u2019s distress. She stated in her report that she had offered to prescribe the first applicant a tranquiliser, but he had rejected it.", "106. On 30 January 2001 the first applicant was admitted to the Nicosia State Hospital for closer monitoring of his health. He was kept there until 5 February 2001.", "107. After visiting the first applicant at the hospital on 1 February 2001, Dr R.K. noted his improved physical condition. According to his report dated 6 February 2001, the first applicant\u2019s state of health continued to improve after his discharge from the hospital. Similarly, when he visited the first applicant on 20 and 28 February 2001 and 27 March 2001, Dr R.K. found him in a \u201csufficient health condition\u201d, although his psychological state appeared to have deteriorated. Dr R.K. stressed to the first applicant that if he had any health problems, he should approach the prison authorities and ask to be seen by a doctor.", "108. Following his discharge from the hospital the first applicant was also visited twice by Dr S.T. for routine medical checks (on 16 February and 9 April 2001). Dr S.T. noted that he was in reasonable health and also stated that he had made no complaints of ill-treatment by the prison staff.", "109. On 18 April 2001 the first applicant was examined by another UNFICYP medical officer, Dr J.G., who also found him to be in a very satisfactory state of health. Dr J.G. indicated that the first applicant continued to take the prescribed anti-diabetic drugs regularly, and that he had been receiving the proper diet. He also noted that the first applicant had been performing physical exercises and was allowed to get books and newspapers.", "110. The first applicant submitted a medical report dated 11 May 2001 issued by his dentist. The report stated that he was suffering from serious problems with his upper anterior teeth, including abscessed gums, and had a scar on his lower lip, which was consistent with a powerful blow to the face.", "111. The first applicant also submitted other medical certificates that he had obtained from various doctors approximately six months after his release from prison, including one from his own doctor. According to those reports, while the first applicant\u2019s diabetes appeared to be under control by that time, he continued to suffer psychologically.", "112. It appears from the information in the case file that the first applicant was allowed to receive visitors twice a week during his detention on remand, including from his friends, and was granted one hour for each visit. His allegation that he was not given permission to make telephone calls was denied by the Government.", "113. Following special permission sought by the second applicant (the first applicant\u2019s wife), the first applicant was authorised to receive visits from his family on 15 April 2001, Easter Sunday, although it was not an ordinary visit day.", "114. The parties disagreed as to whether the family visits in the Nicosia Central Prison were monitored. The applicants claimed that a prison officer had stood guard in or by the visit room during most visits, whereas the Government maintained that the applicants had been able to meet and communicate out of the sight of the authorities.", "115. The parties submitted photographs and sketched maps of the scene of the incident and its vicinity, as well as various documents concerning the events and evidence that unfolded following the detention of the first applicant by \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities. Those documents, in so far as they are relevant, are summarised below.", "116. The Government submitted four pages from the police notebook of Sub-inspector \u00dc.\u00d6., including two handwritten entries.", "117. The first of those entries, which was made at 6.30 p.m. on 12 December 2000, read as follows:", "\u201cAccording to the information I received, at approximately 5.30 a.m. on the morning of 13 December 2000 a Greek Cypriot will enter the TRNC via Pergamos to hide illicit drugs in the empty lot located by the border crossing, to be picked up by his accomplice on this side. The superintendent put me in charge of taking the necessary precautions in the area. I informed sergeants R.\u00d6. and H.M..\u201d", "118. The second entry was made at 7.10 a.m. on 13 December 2000, after the arrest of the first applicant, and described the circumstances in which the latter had been captured with drugs as follows:", "\u201cAt 6.05 a.m. we captured a Greek Cypriot coming from the SBA on the lot by the cemetery located next to the Pergamos Gate, together with sergeants R.\u00d6. and H.M.. I took the bag he was carrying. Upon checking the bag, I found what I believed to be two plates of cannabis resin wrapped in newspaper. The defendant was informed by sergeant H.M., who acted as the interpreter, that he was being arrested for having made an unauthorised entry into the TRNC and possessing illicit drugs. The defendant said \u201cI am innocent\u201d. I learned from Sergeant H.M. that the person\u2019s name was \u201cBanayodis Giryagu\u201d [sic.]. We transferred Banayodis Giryagu to the Gazima\u011fusa Security Directorate. At 6.45 a.m. I interrogated [him] with the help of sergeant H.M. [to find out] where he had found the drugs in his possession and who he was taking them to. I could not get any responses. I left the detainee in Gazima\u011fusa under the control of sergeant R.\u00d6.. I am now leaving for Lefko\u015fa together with the evidence.\u201d", "119. After being informed about the discovery of the first applicant\u2019s car in SBA territory, in a seemingly abandoned state with his briefcase and mobile phone left inside the car, the SBA police promptly started an investigation into his whereabouts. The forensic examinations conducted in and around the car, including with the help of a sniffer dog, did not yield any results. The police and the military in the \u201cTRNC\u201d initially denied any knowledge of the first applicant; it was not until 10.25 a.m. that the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities informed the SBA police that the first applicant was in their custody, having been found in possession of drugs in \u201cTRNC\u201d territory.", "120. On the basis of the information received from the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities, the SBA police searched the first applicant\u2019s car for traces of drugs and fingerprints. It appears that they found no traces of drugs, and no further information was provided regarding fingerprints. Over the next couple of months, they also interviewed some 104 people in an attempt to shed light on the events of 13 December 2000. Amongst the interviewees were the first applicant\u2019s Turkish Cypriot workers, his fellow Greek Cypriot contractors, including those who later testified before the Famagusta Assize Court, members of the SBA police force, and the residents of the houses in the area where the first applicant\u2019s car had been found and where he had allegedly crossed into the \u201cTRNC\u201d.", "121. A number of interviewees attested to having seen the first applicant\u2019s car on the morning of 13 December 2000 parked in an odd manner on the main road from Pyla to Pergamos, albeit with some inconsistencies as to its position and state, such as whether and which doors of the car were open, which way it was facing and whether the engine was running. Some others who had taken the same road around the relevant time stated that they had not noticed anything out of the ordinary or seen the first applicant\u2019s car. A number of persons approached for statements, including some Turkish Cypriots, refrained from giving statements altogether because they were afraid to talk for political reasons.", "122. Of the 104 people interviewed, only two, G.H. and A.G., who also subsequently testified before the Famagusta Assize Court, had seen the Renault cars that had allegedly been used for the first applicant\u2019s abduction. Although A.G. stated before the Assize Court that he had seen two Renault cars, one white and one red (see above paragraph 69), he had not mentioned anything about a white car in his earlier statement to the SBA given on 19 December 2000. Moreover, the sketched plan attached to G.H.\u2019s statement, indicating the respective positions of the red and the white Renault cars and the car of the first applicant, did not fully correspond to the statements given by the other witnesses and the first applicant himself, nor did it match his subsequent statement before the Assize Court, particularly as to where the red Renault car had been parked vis-\u00e0-vis the white one.", "123. Amongst all those interviewed, only one person \u2013 a Greek Cypriot builder, Mr N.M., who also subsequently appeared before the Famagusta Assize Court as a witness \u2013 claimed to have witnessed anything suggesting an abduction on the relevant morning. In his statement to the SBA police on 18 January 2001, N.M. said that at approximately 5.50 a.m. on the morning of 13 December 2000, he had seen a red double-cabin pickup parked on the main Pyla-Pergamos road, with no other cars around it, and a man running from that car towards the field on the right side of the road. There were three or four other men in the field, who were pulling someone by the hands and arms towards the east side of the field, and he heard that man yelling \u201cLet me go!\u201d.", "124. On 16 December 2000 the SBA police interviewed Mr V.Z., the owner of the white Isuzu pickup with registration number UJ 100, which the first applicant claimed had been travelling in front of him towards Pergamos on the relevant morning. V.Z. stated that on the morning of 13 December 2000, his car had been driven by a Turkish Cypriot worker of his, whose name he did not reveal for safety reasons (but who will be referred to as \u201cX\u201d hereinafter). According to what V.Z. had heard from X, as he was driving from Pergamos to Pyla on the morning of 13 December 2000, X had noticed two civilian cars, one red and the other white, blocking the way of a doublecabin pickup that had been coming from the direction of Pyla (that is, the opposite direction to him). As he approached, he saw three or four persons running from one of the vehicles towards the pickup and by the time he was driving past those vehicles, they were pulling the driver out of the pickup, while three or four other people were sitting inside the other vehicle. V.Z. stated that X had not seen anything more because he had driven past without stopping. Allegedly, a couple of days after the incident the first applicant\u2019s nephew, Kyriacos Tsiakkourmas (who himself is an applicant before the Court), and an SBA police officer managed to track down X. Yet, apart from their allegations, there is no evidence in the case file to demonstrate that any contact was actually made with X or that X confirmed V.Z.\u2019s testimony.", "125. As for the interviews conducted with the residents of the area, it appears from their testimonies that none of them had seen anyone around on the morning of 13 December 2000. They had certainly not seen anything suggesting an arrest or abduction on the road. Some of them confirmed that the depth of the stream by the border fences, which the first applicant had allegedly crossed to enter the \u201cTRNC\u201d, had been around eighty centimetres to one metre on the morning in question. It further appears from the documents submitted by the applicants that after finishing the interviews with the residents of the area around the Pergamos Gate, an SBA officer set off to walk from the point of the alleged crossing into the \u201cTRNC\u201d to the point of the alleged abduction in order to measure the time it would have taken the first applicant to walk that distance. According to the officer\u2019s notes, the relevant path could be covered in ten minutes at a normal pace.", "126. The applicants also submitted various SBA police reports regarding the investigation conducted into the first applicant\u2019s alleged abduction. The report dated 15 December 2000 stated the following:", "\u201cOn 14.12.00 Panicos\u2019 [the first applicant\u2019s] wife, accompanied by a Turkish Advocate, visited him in custody in the Controlled Area of Northern Cyprus. It has been confirmed by both parties that Panicos alleges that at the location of his abandoned vehicle he saw a vehicle with the bonnet open and two men with their attention fixed on the engine compartment. He stopped to offer assistance, and at this point he was bundled into their vehicle and driven from the SBA into the controlled site via Pergamos gate. This was against his will. He was then driven around for approximately one hour, given a parcel and pushed out of the vehicle at an unknown location. Approximately five minutes passed and then a Turkish Cypriot Police car arrived. He went to them for assistance and was arrested for allegedly being in possession of a parcel of controlled drugs\u201d.", "127. In another report prepared on 16 December 2000, SBA sergeant P.P. noted that the first applicant\u2019s nephew, Kyriacos Tsiakkourmas, had given him some information that he had received from his uncle\u2019s Turkish Cypriot lawyer regarding the alleged abduction. The relevant parts of the report read as follows:", "\u201cPanicos also told his solicitor that following his abduction he was taken to a place where there were airplanes. During the journey the persons who abducted him were beating him up. On arriving at the aeroplane place (suspected to be Erdjian Airport [sic.]) the persons who abducted him dragged him out of the vehicle, threw a bag to him and left. Following that Turkish Police arrived at the said place and arrested him.\u201d", "128. In a report prepared on 5 January 2001, SBA sergeant P.P. noted that the \u201cPolitical Section\u201d of the TRNC Police Plain Clothes Unit used two unmarked civilian vehicles, a red Renault and a white Renault, to patrol the area of Pyla and Pergamos. In his opinion, those vehicles had also been used for the abduction of the first applicant.", "129. In their report issued on 23 January 2001, the SBA police made the following conclusions:", "\u201cTurkish Cypriot Police Officers maintain that they arrested Tsiakkourmas inside the Turkish Controlled Area about 70 yards west of Pergamos Gate.", "If this account is accepted then Tsiakkourmas must have abandoned his vehicle, engine running, lights on and driver\u2019s door open, almost in the middle of what was then a fairly busy road. He must have left his briefcase and mobile telephone and (carrying a large quantity of cannabis) walked 500 metres across a muddy field, climbed a 1.5 metre high fence and crossed a 4 metre wide ditch. An SBA Police Officer will state that there was water to a depth of one metre in the ditch that morning. He thereafter must have tried to hide the cannabis under a 1 metre high olive tree (the only one in the area described by the Turkish Police). (This in an area with which Tsiakkourmas would be unlikely to be familiar \u2013 inside the Turkish Controlled Area). All of this he must have accomplished knowing that his employees were waiting for him at 0545 hrs, as they had been doing for the past ten years, at the Pergamos Check Point.", "...", "Notwithstanding the fact that it is often much more difficult to prove innocence rather than guilt it is submitted that, in spite of the statements of the Turkish Cypriot Police to the contrary, all other available evidence indicates that Panicos Tsiakkourmas was taken from his vehicle at the locus where that vehicle was abandoned \u2013 well within the Eastern Sovereign Base Areas. Other than the statements of the Turkish Cypriot Police Officers there is absolutely no evidence \u2013 forensic or historical \u2013 to indicate that Tsiakkourmas had \u2013 or ever has had \u2013 illegal drugs in his motor vehicle or in his possession.\u201d", "130. Some members of the SBA police also appeared before the Famagusta Assize Court as defence witnesses. Their statements have been noted above (paragraphs 74-79 above). In a separate affidavit he sent to the Court, SBA sergeant P.P. stated that various Turkish Cypriot witnesses who had wished to testify before the Assize Court for the defence had been intimidated by the Turkish Cypriot authorities. Sergeant P.P. claimed that some of those witnesses had personally told him that they had been questioned and threatened by the Turkish Cypriot police. The Court notes that it cannot be inferred from the case-file that these allegations were brought to the attention of the Assize Court.", "131. On 24 January 2001 the SBA police conducted a reconstruction of the first applicant\u2019s alleged abduction on the basis of the evidence available to them. The reconstruction was also recorded on video. It appears that a number of \u201cTRNC\u201d police officers also watched the reconstruction.", "132. The SBA police were not permitted to interview the applicant during his detention in the \u201cTRNC\u201d. However, following his release they took a statement from him, which was consistent with his account of the events submitted to the Court. They also showed him the video of the reconstruction exercise. According to the records of the SBA police, the first applicant recognised two of the bystanders in the reconstruction video as his abductors. Upon investigation, it was established that one of the persons recognised by the applicant was police officer E. of the Famagusta Intelligence Service and the second one was police officer \u00dc., who worked at the Pergamos police station. Arrest warrants were subsequently issued against those persons on 7 June 2001 on suspicion of the offence of abduction. There is no further information in the case file on this matter, nor is it clear whether this information was shared with the Turkish Cypriot authorities.", "133. There is no information in the case file to suggest that the Government of the United Kingdom lodged any protests with the Turkish Government in relation to the alleged abduction of the first applicant from SBA territory.", "134. On 7 July 2001 the applicant\u2019s Turkish Cypriot lawyer, Mr M. Aziz, gave the following information to Mr Rauf Denkta\u015f, the President of the \u201cTRNC\u201d at the material time, regarding the allegations of witness intimidation during the trial of the first applicant before the Famagusta Assize Court:", "\u201cAt the close of the case by the Prosecution, the defense summoned 17 witnesses. The names of all the Greek, English and Turkish witnesses that were summoned were given to me by P. Brogan, the co-defense lawyer, after consultation with the British Sovereign Bases Police. However, due to reasons out of my knowledge, the names of some additional witnesses were withheld from me. An attempt was made to call these witnesses at the last minute. The names of these witnesses were given to me at the last minute. I issued the necessary summonses through the Registrar\u2019s Office of the Famagusta District Court. All the witnesses listed in the attached paper were issued with summons [17 witnesses in total] and these were brought to the Court to testify. Although the 3-4 witnesses whose names were given to me late were issued with summonses, these could not be served by the Court bailiff in time.", "On the last day of the trial, I gave the Court the information I got from the English lawyer that these 3-4 witnesses had actually wanted to come to the Court but had been threatened or hindered. The Court asked me whether [they] had been summoned, in which case the court could order their presence. I told the Court that the summonses had not been served yet. As there was no service of the summons, the judge, under the Criminal Procedure Law and the related Regulation, could not order the arrest of these witnesses. As a result, the defense closed its case (without calling these additional witnesses) after calling 17 witnesses listed in the attached paper.", "The reason a proper service of the summonses could not be done was the concealment of the names of these witnesses even from me till the last minute, and our attempt to summon them without applying for a short service order from the Court. As a defense lawyer, as well as not personally having seen the witnesses, I got to know about their identities just before the issuing of the summons, the day before in the afternoon, and issuing a summons the same day, I sent it by hand to the British Sovereign Bases Police. It is not again in my knowledge whether these witnesses were personally served with these summonses. We produced no evidence that they had been duly served. For this reason, the claims that the witnesses for defense had been prevented or threatened are not in my knowledge. Nothing was done to put such an allegation before the Court in the form of evidence.\u201d", "135. On 17 July 2001 that letter was conveyed by Mr Rauf Denkta\u015f to Mr Edward Clay, the British High Commissioner to Cyprus at the relevant time.", "136. On 8 January 2001 Mr Rauf Denkta\u015f sent the following letter to the UN Secretary General regarding the alleged abductions of the first applicant and of Mr Teko\u011ful.", "\u201cI understand that letters of protest about the arrest by the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus police of one Panicos Tsakourmas [sic], aged 39, while in possession of drugs is being circulated in all directions by the Greek Cypriot leadership. It is alleged that the said Tsakourmas was abducted by Turkish Cypriots in retaliation to \u201cthe arrest\u201d by the Greek Cypriot police of Turkish Cypriot \u00d6mer Gazi Teko\u011ful at Pyla, a mixed village.", "Both Tsakourmas and the Turkish Cypriot \u00d6mer Gazi Teko\u011ful, aged 42, are in custody pending their trial in respective courts, one in the Greek side and the other before the Assize Court to be held in February in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Both sides allege that they were kidnapped by the police of the other side. Naturally, it is the relevant courts which will have to decide these issues. The allegation that Tsakourmas was arrested in retaliation to the unlawful arrest of Teko\u011ful is strenuously denied by the three policemen involved.", "But the case of Teko\u011ful is a clear case of abduction by Greek Cypriot policemen who, concealing their identity, pretended to be a good friend of Teko\u011ful until the day he was abducted by them.", "...", "On 1 December 2000, at about 2040 hours [Teko\u011ful] had started his car, parked outside a Turkish coffee shop in Pyla, in order to go home when the two Greek Cypriot \u201cfriends\u201d approached his car and beckoned him to enter their car for a chat. As soon as Teko\u011ful entered their car, he was hit on the head, and driven away in the direction of Larnaca. Shortly, four other Greek Cypriot policemen joined them and Teko\u011ful was taken into custody while his car, outside the coffee shop in Pyla, continued to run. Some hours later, the family was informed by neighbours about the car and Teko\u011ful\u2019s father took it away.", "In the mixed village of Pyla, under United Nations control, the rule is that if anyone is arrested by either side, the United Nations should immediately be informed. This was not done in the case of Teko\u011ful. The family was informed about the said \u201carrest\u201d 12 hours after the abduction.", "Teko\u011ful\u2019s Greek Cypriot advocate Andreas Constantinou made this statement to the Cyprus Mail, on 28 December 2000.", "\u2018I believe the police lied in their statements and I told the Attorney-General this when they said Teko\u011ful was arrested in the free areas, if they arrested him in free areas why didn\u2019t police show us the car?\u2019", "All in all it is clear that Teko\u011ful was abducted in line with the well-known, and long practiced Greek Cypriot policy of harassing Turkish Cypriots. Abduction of wellknown or popular Turkish Cypriots had stopped for some time, but it appears that the practice is coming back unless United Nations authorities in Pyla take stern steps in this matter.", "In view of growing publicity about the Tsakourmas\u2019 case I thought I should give this information to you for a fair appraisal of the situation.\u201d", "137. A report prepared by the SBA police on 17 December 2000 noted the following:", "\u201cOn 17/12/2000 at 1220 hrs, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf DENKTA\u015eH [sic.] visited Pyla village...", "...", "He was then interviewed by the Media. Amongst others he stated about TSIAKKOURMAS case:", "- He only knows that the arrest was affected within TCAs [Turkish Cypriot Administration].", "- The arrest of TSIAKKOURMAS cannot be characterised that it occurred in retaliation to the arrest of the T/Cypriot, because everybody knows that he is employing about 15 Turkish Cypriot workers.", "- No negotiations are taking place for an exchange between the two prisoners. The matters are in the hands of the Courts.\u201d", "138. According to another report of the SBA police dated 12 January 2001, Mr Rauf Denkta\u015f had allegedly said in a meeting with Sir David Hannay, Britain\u2019s Special Envoy to Cyprus at the time, that he would be prepared to release the first applicant on bail if \u00d6mer Gazi Teko\u011ful were also granted bail, because both suspects were suffering from health problems.", "139. The applicants submitted as evidence an affidavit made by Mr J.C. before a notary public in Dublin, Ireland, on 10 December 2001. The relevant parts of his affidavit read as follows:", "\u201cOn the morning of Sunday 3.12.2000 at approximately 9.30 a.m., I received a telephone call whilst in my apartment within the UN compound in the UN Headquarters in Nicosia. The telephone call ... was from Mr M.\u0130. Mr M.\u0130. wanted to meet the Chief of Mission of UNFICYP. He did not tell me the reason ... I was unable to contact the Chief of Mission. Mr M.\u0130. then wished to speak to the Special Adviser to the Chief of Mission who was also Head of the Civil Affairs Branch. I failed to make contact with the Special Adviser and informed him accordingly. He was very agitated and I agreed to meet him to discuss what he described was a serious matter ...", "Mr M.\u0130. was very agitated and very concerned about the arrest of \u00d6mer Gazi Teko\u011ful who, he alleged, was arrested in the UN buffer zone in the Pyla area. \u00d6mer Gazi Teko\u011ful is a Turkish Cypriot, who was arrested by the Police of the Republic of Cyprus on the night of Friday 1.12.2000 being found in possession of a substantial amount of the illegal drug heroin.", "... he [Mr M.\u0130.] told me to take down a protest about \u00d6mer Gazi Teko\u011ful\u2019s arrest. As he spoke, I noted his protest in my notebook.", "...", "I then read out to Mr M.\u0130. the protest that he made in the format that I would present it which was as follows:", "159. The Court notes that the parties presented different accounts as to how the first applicant came to be under the control of the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities. While the Government contended that he had been caught in possession of drugs after having illegally crossed into the \u201cTRNC\u201d, the first applicant consistently claimed that he had been abducted within the SBA territory by \u201cTRNC\u201d agents in civilian clothes and had then been detained in the \u201cTRNC\u201d on the basis of fabricated charges of drugs smuggling.", "160. According to the submissions of the Government, the location of the first applicant\u2019s arrest was an issue that had been taken up and examined scrupulously by the \u201cTRNC\u201d courts. The first applicant\u2019s lawyers had subjected the main prosecution witnesses to extensive cross-examination, and the prosecution had likewise cross-examined the witnesses called by the first applicant. After hearing those witnesses, the domestic courts had accepted the version of the facts as presented by the prosecution. It had accordingly been established that the first applicant had entered the \u201cTRNC\u201d illegally from the SBA, between boundary stones nos. 96 and 97 separating the British bases from the TRNC. He had apparently left his car in SBA territory, but the location of the arrest was within the borders of the TRNC. There were a few witnesses who had allegedly seen the first applicant\u2019s car on the relevant morning; however, none of the passers-by had witnessed his arrest. Moreover, it was the Government\u2019s opinion that the evidence given by the defence witnesses was far from coherent, even on the issue of the original location of the first applicant\u2019s car.", "161. Referring to the separate investigation conducted by the SBA police into the circumstances of the first applicant\u2019s detention, the Government further maintained that that investigation had been based on a \u201creconstruction\u201d of the incident and on statements taken from persons who could not be described as \u201cindependent\u201d and detached from the adverse political atmosphere prevailing in southern Cyprus, bearing in mind that this was a highly publicised case at the time. Moreover, the statements taken by the SBA were not subjected to the scrutiny of a court of law.", "162. As to whether there was any link between the arrest of the first applicant and that of \u00d6mer Gazi Teko\u011ful, the Government contended that the reason why the two names had been pronounced together was that both men had gone through similar experiences and that the incidents had taken place within a very short span of time. During both the preliminary inquiry and the subsequent hearing before the Famagusta Assize Court, the first applicant\u2019s lawyers had insisted on the alleged link between the two incidents. For that purpose, they had called the UN Liaison Officer in Cyprus at the material time, Mr J.C., to testify as to what Mr M.\u0130., the Director of Consular and Minority Affairs at the TRNC Foreign Ministry, had allegedly told him and they had protested when the said evidence was not allowed to be included in the case file for being hearsay. The Government could not understand, however, why the defence had not called Mr M.\u0130. directly as a witness so that he could testify on the content of his alleged statement, especially given that the domestic courts had the authority to compel M.\u0130. to testify.", "163. The Government of Cyprus stated for its part that the evidence of a connection between the abduction of the first applicant and the earlier arrest of Mr Teko\u011ful was overwhelming. They referred in particular to the formal protest made by Mr M.\u0130. to the UN Liaison Officer, Mr J.C., and maintained that the first applicant had been targeted randomly in execution of the threat made in that protest. This was further evidenced by the numerous appeals made by the Turkish Cypriot side for the exchange of the applicant for \u00d6mer Gazi Teko\u011ful, including by Mr Denkta\u015f himself.", "164. Furthermore, the exhaustive and independent inquiry conducted by the SBA police also supported unequivocally the conclusion that the first applicant had indeed been abducted within the territory of the SBA. The Government of Cyprus maintained that where the accounts of the parties were diametrically opposed, the Court had to give conclusive weight to independent evidence, which had been provided by the SBA investigation report in the instant case. They added that while the respondent Government had claimed that the \u201cTRNC\u201d courts had thoroughly examined the allegations of both sides, what took place before those \u201ccourts\u201d was not in any way determinative of the way in which the Strasbourg Court should approach the evidence and did not constrain the Court in its fact-finding exercise.", "165. In cases in which there are conflicting accounts of events, the Court is inevitably confronted, when establishing the facts, with the same difficulties as those faced by any first-instance court (see, for instance, ElMasri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no. 39630/09, \u00a7 151, ECHR 2012). In this connection, the Court emphasises that it is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role, and that it must be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case. As a general rule, where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court\u2019s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and it is for the latter to establish the facts on the basis of the evidence before them. Though the Court is not bound by the findings of domestic courts and remains free to make its own assessment in the light of all the material before it, in normal circumstances it requires cogent elements to lead it to depart from the reasoned findings of fact reached by the national judicial authorities, particularly where, as in the present case, the Court has not itself had the benefit of examining the relevant witnesses and forming its own assessment of their credibility (see Erdo\u011fan and Others v. Turkey, no. 19807/92, \u00a7 71, 25 April 2006, and Austin and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39692/09, 40713/09 and 41008/09, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2012).", "166. Turning to the facts before it, the Court notes that following the preliminary inquiry held between 8 and 15 February 2001, the Famagusta Assize Court commenced criminal proceedings against the first applicant on 23 February 2001. During the three-month trial that ensued, the Assize Court was presented with a substantial body of evidence about the events of 13 December 2000, including oral testimony and documentary and photographic evidence submitted by both parties. Relying on that evidence, on 26 April 2001 the Assize Court ruled for the first applicant\u2019s conviction for drug-related crimes. It held that, having carried out a comprehensive examination of the testimonies and documentary evidence presented to it, the \u201ctestimonies of the prosecution witnesses had been found to be credible, accurate and reliable\u201d, whereas the \u201ctestimonies of the defendant and his witnesses had lacked credibility, accuracy and reliability\u201d. The Assize Court thus accepted the facts as presented by the prosecution and convicted the first applicant on that basis.", "167. While the Court has no reason to suspect that the trial court\u2019s admission or assessment of the evidence before it was arbitrary per se, it notes that the Famagusta Assize Court provided no reasoning in relation to its findings of fact and assessment of evidence (see paragraph 84 above). The Court, therefore, cannot determine whether the judgment of the domestic court, which had not only the means but also the principal duty to clearly establish the facts contested by the parties, was the result of a fair and comprehensive consideration of the contradictory arguments before it, or whether it ruled in favour of the official version of the events presented by the prosecution following a perfunctory assessment that did not give sufficient regard to the first applicant\u2019s serious claims. The absence of such reasoning not only has implications vis\u00e0-vis certain procedural rights of the applicant, which will be examined in further detail below, but also detracts from the reliance which might otherwise have been placed on the trial court\u2019s judgment by the Court. In these circumstances, the Court is compelled to make its own assessment of the facts on the basis of the evidence before it.", "168. The Court reiterates in this connection that in assessing evidence in this context, it has adopted the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d. However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard: as applied by the Court, it has an autonomous meaning (see Mathew v. the Netherlands, no. 24919/03, \u00a7 156, ECHR 2005IX for further details). According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion is intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake. The Court is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a Contracting State has violated fundamental rights (see, amongst others, Mathew, cited above, \u00a7 156).", "169. In the light of the foregoing principles, and the gravity of the allegations submitted by the applicants, the Court will subject the evidence presented by the parties to careful scrutiny in order to come to a conclusion regarding the circumstances in which the first applicant was apprehended on 13 December 2000.", "170. The Court notes at the outset that the first applicant was not able to present a direct and reliable eyewitness to corroborate his account of the events. He claimed before the Court that the driver of the white Isuzu pickup with registration number UJ 100, who had been driving ahead of him on the morning in question, must have witnessed his abduction. However, he made no such claims during the domestic proceedings, nor, to the Court\u2019s knowledge, was any attempt made to call that person as a witness.", "171. The Court notes that the only defence witness who claimed to have seen what took place on the relevant morning, a Greek Cypriot contractor named Mr N.M., contradicted the first applicant\u2019s account of the events. In his statement before the Famagusta Assize Court, N.M. claimed that on the morning of the incident, he had seen a man getting out of a red pickup parked on the main Pyla-Pergamos road, which was the only car around. Three to four other men were in the fields to the right side of the road. One of them was being dragged by the arms and pleading to be let go (see paragraph 70 above). According to the account presented by the first applicant, however, there were at least two other cars on the road that had been used for his abduction, and after a struggle, he had been transferred directly from his car to the red Renault. Moreover, the first applicant made no mention of being dragged across the field by the side of the road, as alleged by N.M. The Court observes that the first applicant made no attempt to offer an explanation for N.M.\u2019s conflicting account.", "172. As for the other witnesses called by the first applicant during the domestic proceedings, including a number of SBA police officers, the Court notes that they mainly provided information as to the location and the state in which the first applicant\u2019s car had later been found in the SBA, and that there were some inconsistencies as to its exact location and state. Only two witnesses, Mr G.H. and Mr A.G., who were apparently driving a few minutes ahead of the first applicant on the morning in question, claimed to have seen the red and the white Renault cars that were allegedly used to orchestrate the first applicant\u2019s abduction. However, the descriptions they provided in relation to those cars were somewhat inconsistent: whereas G.H. claimed that there was a white Renault parked on the left-hand side of the road with its bonnet open, and a red Renault to the right of that white car, A.G. stated that the car parked on the left-hand side of the road with an open bonnet had been a red Renault, and that the white Renault had been waiting on the opposite side of the road by some cypress trees and had flashed its lights at him. Even more striking was the fact that in his earlier statement to the SBA police on 19 December 2000 \u2013 that is, only six days after the incident \u2013 A.G. had not mentioned anything about a white car, which is hard to explain considering his later claim that that car had flashed its headlights at him. Moreover, as already mentioned in paragraph 122 above, the statement of G.H. before the Famagusta Assize Court did not match his earlier statement to the SBA police.", "173. While the Court is ready to accept that some of the discrepancies noted above, in particular those concerning the exact state in which the first applicant\u2019s car was found, may be explained by the differences in the subjective assessments of individual witnesses and the passage of time, it considers in any event that the establishment of the location and the circumstances in which the car was found, despite the many valid questions it raises, does not on its own shed light on the circumstances in which the first applicant was detained. Similarly, the fact that the sniffer dog found no traces belonging to the first applicant around his abandoned car or any other traces in the fields, although it must certainly have been taken into account by the trial court in its consideration as to how the first applicant had reached \u201cTRNC\u201d territory, does not as such rebut the Government\u2019s allegations regarding his capture, particularly in view of Mr N.M.\u2019s conflicting statement that he had seen a number of persons in the fields, whose tracks the dog did not pick up either. The Court stresses in this connection that the evidence presented by the applicants is not even sufficient to establish whether the first applicant himself was driving his car on the relevant morning or whether he was alone in the car.", "174. Although the applicants alleged that a number of important Turkish Cypriot witnesses had been unable to testify in the first applicant\u2019s favour on account of the threats to which they had been subjected, the Court cannot make a conclusive finding on that issue either, particularly in view of the statements of Mr M. Aziz, the first applicant\u2019s lawyer, to the trial court and to Mr Rauf Denkta\u015f suggesting his unawareness of such intimidation (see paragraphs 83 and 134 above, respectively), and given that there were no real attempts to substantiate the allegations of witness intimidation before the trial court during the criminal proceedings.", "175. The Court also observes that although the first applicant referred in his application before the Court to a Turkish Cypriot detainee who had allegedly been asked by the \u201cTRNC\u201d police to falsely admit to being his drugs contact in the \u201cTRNC\u201d (see paragraph 29 above), the evidence in the case file indicates that he did not draw that serious allegation to the attention of his lawyers or the domestic courts, nor did he subsequently reiterate it in his statement to the SBA police following his release.", "176. The Court further takes note of the separate investigation conducted by the SBA police into the circumstances of the first applicant\u2019s detention, which resulted in a finding that he had been \u201ctaken from his vehicle at the locus where that vehicle was abandoned \u2013 well within the Eastern Sovereign Base Areas\u201d (see paragraph 129 above). The Court observes in this connection that according to the documents submitted to it, the SBA police interviewed more than a hundred people within the framework of that investigation, and that it found the opportunity to review all of those interviews. As explained in detail in the \u201cFacts\u201d section, amongst the interviewees were the defence witnesses who subsequently appeared before the Famagusta Assize Court, a number of Turkish Cypriots who either worked for the first applicant or knew him otherwise, some other Greek Cypriot builders who had used the Pyla-Pergamos road on the relevant morning, as well as the residents of some of the houses in the vicinity. Even though the assessment of the SBA police may appear plausible having regard to the place where the applicant\u2019s car was found and the latter\u2019s state as well as the official information about the place of the applicant\u2019s arrest, this assessment does not constitute sufficient evidence in support of the applicant\u2019s account of events (see also paragraph 187 below).", "177. The Court observes in the first place that none of the residents of the area where the first applicant allegedly abandoned his car in the SBA or crossed into the \u201cTRNC\u201d had seen anything suspicious on the morning in question. Similarly, none of the other Greek or Turkish Cypriot persons interviewed provided any additional information to that subsequently presented to the Famagusta Assize Court. Some of them had no information to share with the SBA police, other than the rumours they had heard; some others stated that they had not seen anything suspicious, not even the first applicant\u2019s car, even though they had also used the Pyla-Pergamos road at around 6.30 to 7 a.m. that morning. Others, however, attested to having seen the first applicant\u2019s abandoned car, although again with some inconsistencies as to its location and state \u2013 such as which way the car was facing, whether its engine was running, whether and if so which doors of the car had been left open and whether the headlights were on. The Court stresses at this juncture that the car had been moved to another spot following the instructions of the first applicant\u2019s brother prior to the arrival of the SBA police officers at the scene of the incident. Therefore, the official SBA records only included second-hand information on where and in what condition the first applicant\u2019s car had originally been found, instead of photographs or other such direct evidence.", "178. In the Court\u2019s opinion, four statements made to the SBA police are worth a special mention. The first three of those statements, made by N.M., G.H. and A.G. have already been discussed in detail in paragraphs 171 to 172 above. The fourth statement that the Court wishes to highlight is that of Mr V.Z., the Greek Cypriot contractor who owned the aforementioned white Isuzu pickup with registration number UJ 100, whose statement has been summarised in paragraph 124 above. The statement given by V.Z. regarding his employee X\u2019s alleged witnessing of the first applicant\u2019s abduction does not correspond to the latter\u2019s testimony. Whereas the first applicant alleged that the white Isuzu had been travelling ahead of him in the direction of Pergamos, and had actually stopped by the red Renault car and talked briefly to the persons standing in front of that car before driving away towards Pergamos, V.Z. claimed that X was travelling from Pergamos to Pyla, namely in the opposite direction, and had driven past the cars in question as the first applicant was being dragged out of his car, without stopping. The Court also finds it curious that although V.Z. informed the SBA police of X\u2019s alleged eyewitness account as early as 16 December 2000, neither V.Z. himself, nor Kyriacos Tsiakkourmas or the SBA police officer who had allegedly tracked X down had been called as witnesses by the defence during the subsequent criminal proceedings against the first applicant before the Famagusta Assize Court.", "179. The Court also notes the contradictions in some SBA police reports regarding the circumstances in which the first applicant was abducted. While the first applicant had claimed during the domestic proceedings and subsequently before the Court that he had been forced to stop after his car had been intercepted by a white Renault on his way to Rabiye\u2019s caf\u00e9 (see paragraphs 17 and 66 above), according to an SBA report dated 15 December 2000, he claimed that he had been forced out of his vehicle only after he had willingly stopped to offer assistance to a car which appeared to have an engine problem (see paragraph 126 above). Moreover, although the first applicant stated before the domestic courts and the Strasbourg Court that his abductors had personally handed him over to the Turkish Cypriot police and that he had not seen the drugs which he was accused of smuggling until later in the day at the police station (see paragraphs 20 and 26 above), two SBA police reports dated 15 and 16 December 2000 noted that the first applicant had been arrested by the Turkish Cypriot police after his abductors had abandoned him in the vicinity of an airport with a package of drugs (see paragraphs 126 and 127 above).", "180. Apart from taking witness statements, the SBA police also conducted a crime-scene investigation. It has already been mentioned above that the sniffer dog was not able to find any tracks in the vicinity of the car that could have shed light on the events, nor were any traces of prohibited substances found inside the car. The Court also notes, however, that whereas the doors and the windows of the car were dusted for fingerprints, there is no information to suggest that foreign fingerprints were identified on the car, although the first applicant alleged that he had been dragged out of his car by force and his car was subsequently moved from its original location.", "181. Lastly, during the preliminary inquiry the UN Liaison Officer, Mr J.C., made a statement regarding a meeting he had had with Mr. M.\u0130. on 3 December 2000 (see paragraph 56 above). The first applicant relied on that statement to argue that he had been kidnapped in retaliation for \u00d6mer Gazi Teko\u011ful\u2019s earlier arrest by the Greek Cypriot authorities. While the Court has no reason to doubt the independence and impartiality of Mr J.C., it is not prepared to give decisive weight to that untested circumstantial evidence. The Court also notes in this connection that the applicants have failed to respond to the Government\u2019s query as to why Mr M.\u0130. was not summoned to testify before the Famagusta Assize Court, which would have had the power to compel him to attend (see paragraph 162 above).", "182. In support of their arguments the Government chiefly relied on the evidence presented by the prosecution during the domestic proceedings, which consisted mainly of the official incident reports, as well as photographs and sketches of the relevant area where the first applicant had allegedly crossed into the \u201cTRNC\u201d.", "183. Like the first applicant, the Government did not present any eyewitnesses who could attest to their version of the events. According to the testimony of the three police officers from the drugs branch who had allegedly caught the first applicant in flagrante delicto, they were the only ones present at the scene of the incident, apart from the applicant himself. Subinspector \u00dc.\u00d6. claimed during the domestic proceedings that apart from his superintendent and the other two officers who had accompanied him that morning, no other officers or authorities had been informed of the tipoff call that he had received on 12 December 2000 from his informant, nor had advance notice been given to anyone else about the operation, including the officers on duty at the Pergamos checkpoint. Unfortunately, the Court is not in a position to verify the accuracy of any of that information, nor can it turn to the Famagusta Assize Court for such verification. As already indicated above, the Assize Court did not engage in a satisfactory discussion as to the veracity of the evidence before it.", "184. The Court observes from the information in the case file that the forensic evidence submitted by the prosecution during the domestic proceedings was limited to an examination of the mud recovered from the first applicant\u2019s shoe on the date of his arrest, which partially matched the soil sample extracted from the area where he had allegedly crossed into the \u201cTRNC\u201d. No fingerprint examination was conducted on the package of cannabis resin allegedly seized from the first applicant; it was explained that since the package had been taken directly from his hands by Sub-inspector \u00dc.\u00d6. himself, it had been deemed unnecessary to submit it for a fingerprint examination. Moreover, although the area where the first applicant had allegedly crossed into the \u201cTRNC\u201d had been photographed, including a couple of photographs showing footmarks allegedly belonging to the first applicant, it does not appear that any detailed examination was made to match those marks to his footwear.", "185. The Court lastly notes that amongst the evidence submitted by the Government was also the sketched map of the area between border stones nos. 96 and 97, showing the point where the first applicant had allegedly entered the \u201cTRNC\u201d, as well as photographs of the same area. According to those photographs, the top of the fence in the relevant area had no barbed wire and was deformed in some parts, which the Government argued had made it easier for the applicant to jump over.", "186. The Court is of the opinion that the arguments and evidence submitted by the first applicant, albeit inconclusive and inconsistent in some respects, raise serious suspicions about the official account of events presented by the Government, particularly when viewed against the backdrop of the political climate on the island at the material time. The fact that the first applicant was arrested in \u201cTRNC\u201d territory for smuggling drugs only some ten days after the controversial arrest of Mr \u00d6mer Gazi Teko\u011ful by the Greek Cypriot authorities, which apparently led to some strong protests from the Turkish Cypriot side, may cast some doubts on the accusations brought against him. Moreover, whereas the allegation remains that the first applicant entered the \u201cTRNC\u201d between border stones nos. 96 and 97 separating the SBA from the \u201cTRNC\u201d, the Court notes that the domestic authorities, including the trial court, do not appear to have concerned themselves much with how he may have arrived there. Thus, they failed to establish where and in what condition he had left his car and which route he had followed, despite the consistent allegations that the car had been found abandoned on the wrong side of a road with its engine running and doors open.", "187. The Court nevertheless considers that in view of the gravity of the first applicant\u2019s allegation that he was abducted from SBA territory by or with the connivance of \u201cTRNC\u201d agents, it needs very compelling evidence before it can uphold the allegation. In this connection, the Court wishes to emphasise that although it has no reason to doubt the independence of the investigation conducted by the SBA police, the findings that emerged from that investigation were not submitted to the scrutiny of a court of law and thus remain untested.", "188. The Court is mindful of the fact that the difficulties it has encountered in establishing the facts are due, to a large extent, to the domestic judicial authorities\u2019 failure to discharge their duty to subject the evidence before them to a critical and thorough analysis in a reasoned judgment. However, while that significant failure certainly raises procedural issues that will be examined below in particular within the context of Article 5 \u00a7 4, it does not provide a sufficient evidentiary basis to allow the Court to find that the first applicant\u2019s allegations can be considered proven in accordance with the requisite standard of proof under the Court\u2019s case-law.", "189. In view of the foregoing explanations and all the material before it, and while it in no way disregards the seriousness of the allegations made by the first applicant, the Court cannot but hold that there is an insufficient evidentiary basis on which to conclude that the first applicant was kidnapped from SBA territory by, or with the connivance of, \u201cTRNC\u201d agents."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
