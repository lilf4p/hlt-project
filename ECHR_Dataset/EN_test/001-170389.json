On 23 December 2011 the applicants, political activists, participated in a demonstration organised by the political party \u201cPolitics Can Be Different\u2019\u201d (Lehet M\u00e1s a Politika). The demonstrators blocked the entrance of a car park adjacent to the Parliament building by chaining themselves to each other and to concrete columns situated next to the entrance.", "7. Following the incident the Budapest main police department opened criminal investigations against twenty-nine persons, including the applicants, on charges of violation of personal liberty under Article 175(1) of Act no. IV on the [old] Criminal Code.", "8. On 9 March 2012 Parliament enacted Act no. XII of 2012 (\u201cthe Amnesty Act\u201d) (see paragraph 12 below), which entered into force on 10 March 2012.", "9. On 29 March 2012 the Budapest main police department discontinued the criminal investigation against the twenty-nine suspects, pursuant to Article 190 \u00a7\u00a7 1 (e) and 2 of the Code on Criminal Procedure on the grounds that they had been granted amnesty.

The Constitutional Court declared the complaint inadmissible. It reasoned that the complaint did not raise any constitutional-law issues of \u201cfundamental importance\u201d, since it was based on an erroneous interpretation of the law. The Constitutional Court pointed out that the language employed by the Act could not be interpreted as establishing that the applicants had indeed committed the offence. In any event, the complaint was time-barred since it had been lodged outside the statutory 180 days\u2019 time-limit following the entry into force of the legislation."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-2"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
