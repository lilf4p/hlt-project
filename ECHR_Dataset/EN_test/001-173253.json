ROMANIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-3 - Reasonableness of pre-trial detention)", "JUDGES": "Iulia Motoc;Marko Bo\u0161njak;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque", "TEXT": ["4. The first applicant was born in 1992 and is currently serving a prison sentence in Aiud Prison, while the second applicant is his mother and lives in Aiud.", "5. The first applicant was arrested on 24 October 2008 on suspicion of multiple thefts, together with several other accused. He was 15 years old at the time. The prosecutor ordered that he be remanded in custody for ten hours and applied for him to be placed in pre-trial detention for fifteen days.", "6. The Alba-Iulia District Court (\u201cthe District Court\u201d) allowed the prosecutor\u2019s office\u2019s application the same day. The reasons adduced by the court to justify the first applicant\u2019s detention were the strong suspicion that the offences had been committed, as well as the repeated nature and the gravity of the offences.", "7. In assessing the impact on the public the first applicant\u2019s release from detention would have, the court stressed that the acts had allegedly been committed by a significant number of perpetrators over a long period of time. It noted that prior measures against the first applicant, such as a warning and two administrative fines, had been unable to prevent him from committing further thefts.", "8. In an indictment dated 18 November 2008 the prosecutor\u2019s office attached to the District Court charged the first applicant and six other defendants with thirteen counts of theft allegedly committed between 25 April and 9 September 2008.", "9. The first applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention was regularly extended by interlocutory judgments of the District Court.", "10. The reasons adduced by the court were that, although he was a minor, there was a reasonable suspicion that he was guilty of the thefts and would pose a danger to public order, given that he had developed a habit of stealing. His age was not considered to be an argument in favour of his release pending trial. Furthermore, in one of the interlocutory judgments it was mentioned that he did not have an occupation or place of work and thus would be unable to support himself by honest means \u2013 there was therefore a risk that he would continue to commit theft.", "11. The first applicant lodged appeals on points of law against the extension of his detention. He claimed, inter alia, that he was a minor, that he had committed the offences under the influence of his codefendants, who were adults with a criminal record, and that his detention among adults without access to education had had a negative impact on him. He also stated that, under national law and the Court\u2019s case-law, detention of a minor should be a preventive measure of last resort.", "12. The Alba County Court consistently dismissed the first applicant\u2019s appeals, endorsing the reasoning of the lower court for keeping him in detention.", "13. The first applicant lodged a request for his pre-trial detention to be replaced with alternative measures, such as a ban on him leaving town. He said that he had already been detained for 180 days and therefore the initial reasons for extending his detention no longer applied. He also submitted that he had had time to understand the consequences of his criminal behaviour and had changed. The second applicant and the first applicant\u2019s uncle made written statements promising to take responsibility for supervising him if released, and presented to the court a job offer that he could take up if released.", "14. On 15 June 2009 the District Court dismissed the first applicant\u2019s request. It had regard to the gravity of the offences allegedly committed by him, the severity of the sentence that could be applied to him and the risk of him reoffending. The judgment was upheld by the Alba County Court, which dismissed the first applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law for the same reasons.", "15. On 23 November 2009 the first applicant was eventually convicted of theft and sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment by the District Court. On 17 May 2010 an appeal on points of law by him against this judgment was dismissed by the Alba Court of Appeal.", "16. According to information submitted by the Government, the first applicant was detained in prisons for adults between 24 October 2008 and 9 March 2010, but did not share his cells with adult prisoners. Moreover, between 24 October and 24 November 2008 he occupied an individual cell. His contact with adult prisoners was very limited."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
