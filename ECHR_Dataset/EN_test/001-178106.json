THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Pauliine Koskelo;Ksenija Turkovi\u0107", "TEXT": ["1. The applicant, Mr Payam Tamiz, is a British national, who was born in 1989 and lives in Maidstone. He was represented before the Court by Withers LLP, a firm of solicitors based in London.", "2. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr P. McKell of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.", "3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "4. Google Inc. is a corporation registered in the United States and with its principal place of business there. It provides an Internet blog-publishing service via Blogger.com, a platform that allows any Internet user in any part of the world to create an independent blog free of charge. It includes design tools to help users create layouts for their blogs and, if they do not have their own web address, enables them to host their blogs on Blogger.com web addresses.", "5. Blogger.com operates a \u201cContent Policy\u201d which sets out restrictions on what users can do using the service. This makes clear that content such as child pornography, or promoting race hatred, is prohibited. The policy is explained in the following terms:", "\u201cBlogger is a free service for communication, self-expression and freedom of speech. We believe that Blogger increases the availability of information, encourages healthy debate and makes possible new connections between people.", "We respect our users\u2019 ownership of and responsibility for the content they choose to share. It is our belief that censoring this content is contrary to a service that bases itself on freedom of expression.", "In order to uphold these values, we need to curb abuses that threaten our ability to provide this service and the freedom of expression it encourages. As a result, there are some boundaries on the type of content that can be hosted with Blogger. The boundaries we have defined are those that both comply with legal requirements and that serve to enhance the service as a whole.\u201d", "6. In addition, Google Inc. operates a \u201cReport Abuse\u201d feature. There are eight grounds for reporting abuse, including \u201cDefamation/Libel/Slander\u201d. If the user selects \u2018Defamation/Libel/Slander\u2019, a second screen is displayed which makes it clear that the Blogger.com service is operated in accordance with US law, and that defamatory material will only be taken down if it has been found to be libellous (i.e. unlawful) by a court. According to Google Inc., the reason for this policy is that, given the volume of content uploaded by users of the Blogger.com service, it is usually not practicable for it to remove content without first receiving a court\u2019s determination that the content is, in fact, libellous. Google Inc. is not in a position to adjudicate such disputes itself.", "7. On 27 April 2011 a piece appeared on the \u201cLondon Muslim\u201d blog, a blog hosted on the Blogger.com website. It contained a photograph of the applicant and the following text:", "\u201cPayam Tamiz a Tory Muslim council candidate with a 5 o\u2019clock shadow has resigned from the party after calling Thanet girls \u2018sluts\u2019.", "Tamiz who on his Twitter page describes himself as an \u2018ambitious British Muslim\u2019 is bizarrely studying law so one would have thought this Tory prat with Star Trek Spock ears might have engaged the odd brain cell before making these offensive remarks.\u201d", "8. A number of anonymous comments were subsequently posted in response to the publication. Eight of the approximately forty-six comments are set out, as originally posted, in the following paragraphs.", "9. Comment A:", "\u201cI know Mr Tamiz very well and am surprised that it has taken this long for all this to come out, Payam is a known drug dealer in thanet and has been taken to court for theft from his employers tescos in Ramsgate. His whole family are criminals his mother Mrs [L.] has several convictions for theft and shoplifting and got sentenced at maidstone crown court", "28 April 2011 14:53\u201d", "10. Comment B:", "\u201cCan\u2019t deny what he said is true but isn\u2019t this the same Payam Tamiz that use to take girls back to his \u2018houseparties\u2019 practically every weekend with his friends and sleep with them? Hypocritical much?", "30 April 2011 12:28\u201d", "11. Comment C:", "\u201cThe blokes a class A prat not only for the comments he recently made. He may have a few half wits as a following but I speak for the people that have known payam for several years and have been on the reciving end of his abuse a disrespect and his not such a nice person. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be hearing alot more from his past which will paint a true picture of him.", "28 April 2011 23:04\u201d", "12. Comment D:", "\u201cSo Mr Whacker is a violent racist, certainly doesn\u2019t like white people does he?!", "If you\u2019d ever been to Margate you would find the majority are white women, even those from the Eastern bloc. To tar all Margate women with the word slut is very derogatory, how does he know? Does he make a habit of chasing women around? Or as someone implys above, does he sell drugs to them?", "28 April 23:51\u201d", "13. Comment E:", "\u201cI\u2019ve only read that Payams claiming to be 21, I\u2019m sure he told me that his older than that. Fake asylum claim was it. The good old home office and all us wankers that pay tax for waste of spaces like him.", "29 April 2011 01:09\u201d", "14. Comment F:", "\u201cBefore Payam starts to call women sluts it might be an idea for him to look closer to home, how may brothers and sisters has he got, all with different fathers. I thought Muslim men were the one who were meant to have more than one wife, not the women with more than one husband. Is there not a 30 year gap between the ages of his younger to older brother and sister. Look closer to home pal.", "29 April 2011 09:40\u201d", "15. Comment G:", "\u201cThe only reason his callig girls slags is cos he aint getting none himself. And he blames a relationship breakup for his comments, but the only problem with that being is that Payams never had a girlfriend since I known him and thats been a couple of years, that makes him single at the time.", "Poor little Payam, has you giving it the large one to your friends blown up in your face and back fired.", "It couldn\u2019t have happeneded to a better person, his a little snake and he knows it. I\u2019d put my money on him still being a virgin, not being funny but you only got to look at his picture to work that out.", "29 April 2011 21:26\u201d", "16. Comment H:", "\u201cAnd his brothers girl friend is an escort girl, [L.], look closer to home pal.", "29 April 2011 18:43\u201d", "17. According to the applicant, on 28 or 29 April 2011 he used the \u201creport abuse\u201d function to indicate that he considered certain comments on the blog to be defamatory.", "18. On 29 June 2011 he sent a letter of claim to Google UK Ltd (a United Kingdom subsidiary of Google Inc.), which was received on 5 July. In his letter he complained about the blog itself and about comment A. The letter was passed by Google UK Ltd to Google Inc., which responded by email on 8 July 2011 seeking clarification of whether the comment was said to be untrue, since that was not apparent from the terms of the letter. The applicant responded on the same day confirming that comment A was \u201cfalse and defamatory\u201d and introducing a complaint about comment B.", "19. On 19 July 2011 the \u201cBlogger Team\u201d at Google Inc. sent the applicant an email seeking permission to forward his complaint to the author of the blog page and confirming that they would not themselves remove the impugned comments. The applicant gave the necessary permission on 22 July 2011 and complained that comments C, D, E, F and G were also defamatory.", "20. On 11 August 2011 Google Inc. forwarded the letter of claim to the blogger.", "21. On 14 August 2011 the post and all the comments were removed by the blogger. The applicant was informed the following day.", "22. Meanwhile, the applicant sought to bring a claim in libel against Google Inc. in relation to comments A to G. On 10 August 2011 he sent a letter of claim, together with the relevant particulars of claim, to the court and on 22 September 2011 permission was granted to serve the claim form on Google Inc. in the United States. The applicant subsequently incorporated a complaint about comment H into the particulars of claim and served them on Google Inc.", "23. Google Inc. sought to have the permission to serve the claim out of jurisdiction set aside and asked the High Court to declare that it had no jurisdiction to try the claim. It argued that:", "the claim form did not allege that the comments had been accessed by a substantial number of readers in the jurisdiction. There was therefore no \u201creal and substantial\u201d tort (see paragraphs 50-53 below);", "Google Inc. was not a publisher for the purposes of the English law of defamation, but merely a neutral service provider which did not create and had no control over the content users posted on their blogs; and", "even if Google Inc. were to be regarded as a publisher, it would be protected from liability by Regulation 19 of the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 (\u201cthe 2002 Regulations\u201d \u2013 see paragraph 49 below).", "24. On 2 March 2012 the High Court held that it should decline jurisdiction and that the order for service out of the jurisdiction should be set aside.", "25. The judge first considered whether there was any evidence of a \u201creal and substantial tort\u201d within the jurisdiction. He considered each of the comments individually and while he characterised comments C, E, F, G and H as \u201cmere vulgar abuse\u201d to which no sensible person would attach much, if any, weight, he accepted that comments A, B and D were arguably defamatory.", "26. On the question of whether Google Inc. was the \u201cpublisher\u201d, the judge noted that the applicant did not allege that it could be liable for the comments complained of before he notified it of their potential unlawfulness. Consequently, the judge only considered it necessary to assess potential legal liability from the point of notification.", "27. The judge considered it relevant, although not determinative as a matter of law, that Google Inc. promulgated and attempted to follow a wellknown policy of not removing offending material on the basis that it was not in a position to investigate or come to a decision upon any legal challenge. This was partly a question of principle and partly a matter of sheer practicality: on the one hand, Google Inc. regarded itself as providing a platform for the free exchange of information and ideas and would not wish to be seen as a censor; on the other hand, the blogs on Blogger.com contained more than half a trillion words and 250,000 new words were added every minute. It would therefore be virtually impossible for the corporation to exercise editorial control over content.", "28. The judge further noted that one should guard against imposing legal liability in restraint of Article 10 of the Convention where it was not necessary or proportionate to do so. In this regard, he considered the possibility of an action against the authors of the comments and possibly the author of the blog. While he accepted that this approach \u201cmay be regarded as more theoretical than real due to problems of anonymity\u201d, it was an argument that could not simply be ignored. However, the important question was not whether the applicant could identify the authors or bloggers in question, but rather whether he was in a position to establish against Google Inc. the necessary attributes of a publisher.", "29. The judge concluded:", "\u201c38. Google Inc. accepts the responsibility of notifying (albeit not always with great promptitude) the blogger(s) in question. It does not, however, accept that it should investigate every complaint received, whether by way of establishing the facts or obtaining advice on the relevant domestic law or laws that may be applicable. The fact that an entity in Google Inc.\u2019s position may have been notified of a complaint does not immediately convert its status or role into that of a publisher. It is not easy to see that its role, if confined to that of a provider or facilitator beforehand, should be automatically expanded thereafter into that of a person who authorises or acquiesces in publication. It claims to remain as neutral in that process after notification as it was before. It takes no position on the appropriateness of publication one way or the other. It may be true that it has the technical capability of taking down (or, in a real sense, censoring) communications which have been launched by bloggers or commentators on its platform. Yet that is not by any means the same as saying that it has become an author or authoriser of publication. It is no doubt often true that the owner of a wall which has been festooned, overnight, with defamatory graffiti could acquire scaffolding and have it all deleted with whitewash. That is not necessarily to say, however, that the unfortunate owner must, unless and until this has been accomplished, be classified as a publisher.", "39. It seems to me to be a significant factor in the evidence before me that Google Inc. is not required to take any positive step, technically, in the process of continuing the accessibility of the offending material, whether it has been notified of a complainant\u2019s objection or not. In those circumstances, I would be prepared to hold that it should not be regarded as a publisher, or even as one who authorises publication, under the established principles of the common law. As I understand the evidence its role, as a platform provider, is a purely passive one ... I would rule that Google Inc. is not liable at common law as a publisher. It would accordingly have no need to rely upon a defence (statutory or otherwise).\u201d", "30. Finally, the judge said that if, contrary to that view, Google Inc. was to be regarded as a \u201cpublisher\u201d, section 1 of the Defamation Act 1996 (\u201cthe 1996 Act\u201d \u2013 see paragraphs 45-48 below) provided it with a defence, notably because it took reasonable care in passing the complaint on to the blogger once it had been notified. In reaching this conclusion, he accepted that the period between notification and the removal of the offending post was so short as to give rise to potential liability on the part of Google Inc. only for a very limited period with the consequence that its potential liability, if any, would be so trivial as not to justify the maintenance of the proceedings. Alternatively, regulation 19 of the 2002 Regulations would provide Google Inc. with a defence if it were otherwise needed.", "31. The applicant sought leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. He argued that the High Court was wrong to conclude that Google Inc. was not a \u201cpublisher\u201d at common law; that Google Inc. had an unanswerable defence under section 1 of the 1996 Act; and that Google Inc. had an unanswerable defence under regulation 19 of the 2002 Regulations. Although his arguments primarily focused on domestic law, at the end of his written grounds he argued that in interpreting regulation 19 of the 2002 Regulations, the right to freedom of expression in Article 10 of the Convention was not to be prioritised, that reputation was among the rights protected by Article 8, and that Article 8 and 10 rights were to be accorded equal weight.", "32. Leave to appeal was granted and on 14 February 2013 the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal.", "33. With regard to the date of notification, the applicant had submitted that between 29 April 2011 and the letter of claim he had made various telephone calls to Google UK Ltd and sent two letters to that company\u2019s office. However, the Court of Appeal noted that the transcript of the High Court hearing made it \u201ctolerably clear\u201d that he had been content to proceed on the basis that the date of notification of the complaint to Google Inc. fell between 5 July 2011 (when Google UK Ltd received his letter) and 8 July 2011 (when Google Inc. first contacted him by email). The court refused to admit fresh evidence in the form of the letters allegedly sent to Google UK Ltd since these documents could have been submitted for use at the hearing below.", "34. The court further accepted the High Court\u2019s findings as to the nature of the comments and agreed with its conclusion that comments A, B and D were arguably defamatory.", "35. On the question of whether Google Inc. was a publisher, the court noted that the applicant\u2019s pleaded case related to the period after Google Inc. had been notified of the complaint. It considered the High Court judge to have been wrong to regard Google Inc.\u2019s role during this period as a purely passive one and to attach the significance he did to the absence of any positive steps by Google Inc. in relation to continued publication of the comments in issue. It explained:", "\u201c24. By the Blogger service Google Inc. provides a platform for blogs, together with design tools and, if required, a URL; it also provides a related service to enable the display of remunerative advertisements on a blog. It makes the Blogger service available on terms of its own choice and it can readily remove or block access to any blog that does not comply with those terms ... As a matter of corporate policy and no doubt also for reasons of practicality, it does not seek to exercise prior control over the content of blogs or comments posted on them, but it defines the limits of permitted content and it has the power and capability to remove or block access to offending material to which its attention is drawn.", "25. By the provision of that service Google Inc. plainly facilitates publication of the blogs (including the comments posted on them). Its involvement is not such, however, as to make it a primary publisher of the blogs. It does not create the blogs or have any prior knowledge of, or effective control over, their content. It is not in a position comparable to that of the author or editor of a defamatory article. Nor is it in a position comparable to that of the corporate proprietor of a newspaper in which a defamatory article is printed. Such a corporation may be liable as a primary publisher by reason of the involvement of its employees or agents in the publication. But there is no relationship of employment or agency between Google Inc. and the bloggers or those posting comments on the blogs: such people are plainly independent of Google Inc. and do not act in any sense on its behalf or in its name ...\u201d", "36. The court was also very doubtful that Google Inc.\u2019s role was that of a secondary publisher, facilitating publication in a manner analogous to a distributor. It concluded that, in any event, such an argument could get nowhere in relation to the period prior to notification of the complaint in light of a long-established line of authority that a person involved only in dissemination was not to be treated as a publisher unless he knew or ought by the exercise of reasonable care to have known that the publication was likely to be defamatory. Since it could not be said that Google Inc. knew or ought reasonably to have known of the defamatory comments prior to notification by the applicant, Google Inc. could not be viewed as a secondary publisher prior to such notification. The court further found that even if it could be so regarded, it would have an unassailable defence during that period under section 1 of the 1996 Act.", "37. As to Google Inc.\u2019s position after notification, the Court of Appeal took a different view from the High Court. It considered that if Google Inc. allowed defamatory material to remain on a blog after it had been notified of the presence of that material, it might be inferred to have associated itself with, or to have made itself responsible for, the continued presence of that material on the blog and thereby to have become a publisher of the material. However, such an inference could not properly be drawn until Google Inc. had had a reasonable time to remove the defamatory comments. The court considered it open to argument that the time taken to remove the comments after notification \u2013 over five weeks as regards comments A and B \u2013 was sufficiently long to give rise to such an inference. The claim could therefore not be dismissed on the ground that Google Inc. was clearly not the publisher.", "38. It was accordingly necessary to consider the defence under section 1 of the 1996 Act. Here, while the Court of Appeal accepted that the conditions in subsections 1(a) to (c) were plainly satisfied in relation to the period prior to notification of the complaint, it was not persuaded that in the period after notification Google Inc. did not know, and had no reason to believe, that what it did caused the publication of a defamatory statement. The court was therefore not satisfied that, if Google Inc. were considered to be a publisher, it would have an unassailable defence under section 1 of the 1996 Act.", "39. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal found that the High Court was plainly right to conclude that the claim should not be allowed to proceed because both the damage and any eventual vindication would be minimal and the costs of the exercise would be out of all proportion to what would be achieved (in other words, that there had been no \u201creal and substantial tort\u201d). It explained:", "\u201c50. ... The allegedly defamatory comments were posted between 28 and 30 April, soon after the initial blog of 27 April. By the very nature of a blog, they will have been followed by numerous other comments in the chain and, whilst still accessible, will have receded into history. As I have indicated, the earliest point at which Google Inc. could have become liable in respect of the comments would be some time after notification of the complaint in respect of them. But it is highly improbable that any significant number of readers will have accessed the comments after that time and prior to removal of the entire blog. It follows ... that any damage to the appellant\u2019s reputation arising out of continued publication of the comments during that period will have been trivial; and in those circumstances the [High Court] judge was right to consider that \u2018the game would not be worth the candle\u2019. I do not accept [the] submission that various other features of the claim, including the fact that the appellant\u2019s name is relatively uncommon and distinctive in this jurisdiction, undermined the judge\u2019s conclusion.\u201d", "40. It followed that the appeal failed and, in the circumstances, it was unnecessary to consider whether Google Inc. would have had a defence under regulation 19 of the 2002 Regulations.", "41. The applicant sought permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. He argued that the judgment of the Court of Appeal did not strike the correct balance between Articles 6, 8 and 10 of the Convention and unlawfully denied him access to a court and deprived him of the means to vindicate his Article 8 rights.", "42. On 1 July 2013 the Supreme Court refused permission to appeal on the basis that the applicant did not raise an arguable point of law.", "43. In order to become legally responsible for the publication of a defamatory statement, and therefore potentially liable in the tort of defamation, English law requires, as a minimum, knowing involvement in the process of publication of the relevant words: Bunt v. Tilley [2007] 1 WLR 1243. Accordingly, a person whose role is confined to the process of disseminating allegedly objectionable content is not to be treated as a \u201cpublisher\u201d, in the sense required to give rise to potential liability in defamation, unless he knew or ought by the exercise of reasonable care to have known that the publication was likely to be defamatory.", "45. The Defamation Act 1996 amended the law of defamation. Section 1 is headed \u201cresponsibility for publication\u201d and provides, in subsection (1), that a person has a defence in defamation proceedings if he shows that:", "\u201c(a) he was not the author, editor or publisher of the statement complained of,", "(b) he took reasonable care in relation to its publication, and", "(c) he did not know, and had no reason to believe, that what he did caused or contributed to the publication of a defamatory statement.\u201d", "46. Pursuant to section 1(2), \u201cauthor\u201d, \u201ceditor\u201d and \u201cpublisher\u201d have the following meanings:", "\u201c\u2018author\u2019 means the originator of the statement, but does not include a person who did not intend that his statement be published at all;", "\u2018editor\u2019 means a person having editorial or equivalent responsibility for the content of the statement or the decision to publish it; and", "\u2018publisher\u2019 means a commercial publisher, that is, a person whose business is issuing material to the public, or a section of the public, who issues material containing the statement in the course of that business.\u201d", "47. Section 1(3)(e) provides that a person shall not be considered the author, editor or publisher of a statement if he is only involved as the operator of or provider of access to a communications system by means of which the statement is transmitted, or made available, by a person over whom he has no effective control.", "48. Pursuant to section 1(5), in determining whether a person took reasonable care, or had reason to believe that what he did caused or contributed to the publication of a defamatory statement, regard must be had to:", "\u201c(a) the extent of his responsibility for the content of the statement or the decision to publish it,", "(b) the nature or circumstances of the publication, and", "(c) the previous conduct or character of the author, editor or publisher.\u201d", "49. Regulation 19 of the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002, which implemented the provisions of Article 14 of Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council dated 8 June 2000 relating to electronic commerce (see paragraph 55 below), provides:", "\u201cWhere an information society service is provided which consists of the storage of information provided by a recipient of the service, the service provider (if he otherwise would) shall not be liable for damages or for any other pecuniary remedy or for any criminal sanction as a result of that storage where\u2013", "(a) the service provider\u2013", "(i) does not have actual knowledge of unlawful activity or information and, where a claim for damages is made, is not aware of facts or circumstances from which it would have been apparent to the service provider that the activity or information was unlawful; or", "(ii) upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness, acts expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the information, and", "(b) the recipient of the service was not acting under the authority or the control of the service provider.\u201d", "50. Under English law, a claimant normally requires the national courts\u2019 permission to serve proceedings on a defendant who is domiciled outside the jurisdiction. A claimant may apply to the court for permission without giving notice to the prospective defendant. However, if permission is granted, the foreign defendant may apply to have the order set aside.", "51. In Dow Jones & Co Inc v.Yousef Abdul Latif Jameel [2005] EWCA Civ 75 the Court of Appeal held that an application to set aside permission to serve defamation proceedings out of the jurisdiction could be granted on the basis that the publications complained of did not, individually or collectively, amount to \u201ca real and substantial tort\u201d. Although jurisdiction was no longer in issue in that case, the court further noted that it would be an abuse of process to continue to commit the resources of the English court, including substantial judge and possibly jury time, to an action where little was seen to be at stake.", "52. In reaching this conclusion, the court observed:", "\u201cThere have been two recent developments which have rendered the court more ready to entertain a submission that pursuit of a libel action is an abuse of process. The first is the introduction of the new Civil Procedure Rules. Pursuit of the overriding objective requires an approach by the court to litigation that is both more flexible and more pro-active. The second is the coming into effect of the Human Rights Act. Section 6 requires the court, as a public authority, to administer the law in a manner which is compatible with Convention rights, insofar as it is possible to do so. Keeping a proper balance between the Article 10 right of freedom of expression and the protection of individual reputation must, so it seems to us, require the court to bring to a stop as an abuse of process defamation proceedings that are not serving the legitimate purpose of protecting the claimant\u2019s reputation, which includes compensating the claimant only if that reputation has been unlawfully damaged.\u201d", "53. In Mohammed Hussein Al Amoudi v. Jean Charles Brisard And Jcb Consulting International Sarl [2006] EWHC 1062 (QB) the High Court found no basis for concluding that a claimant in a libel action on an Internet publication was entitled to rely on a presumption of law that there had been substantial publication. Rather, the claimant had to prove publication from the Internet either to identifiable third parties or by asking the court to draw an inference based upon facts admitted or proved.", "54. On 28 May 2003, at the 840th meeting of the Ministers\u2019 Deputies, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted a Declaration on freedom of communication on the Internet. According to Principle 6,", "\u201cIn cases where the functions of service providers are wider and they store content emanating from other parties, member states may hold them co-responsible if they do not act expeditiously to remove or disable access to information or services as soon as they become aware, as defined by national law, of their illegal nature or, in the event of a claim for damages, of facts or circumstances revealing the illegality of the activity or information.\u201d", "55.
