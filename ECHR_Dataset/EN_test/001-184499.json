The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Batman. At the time of the events giving rise to the present application, he was the head of the Batman branch of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (DEHAP) and subsequently the Party for a Democratic Society (DTP).", "5. On unspecified dates in 2005 and 2006 the Batman public prosecutor\u2019s office initiated at least four criminal investigations against the applicant. On 18 October 2005, 6 December 2005, 1 February 2006 and 23 March 2006 the applicant made statements before the Batman public prosecutor in relation to his attendance at a number of public meetings.", "6. In particular, when he was questioned on 18 October 2005 the applicant was asked about his participation in an event commemorating a number of deceased members of the PKK (Kurdish Workers\u2019 Party, an illegal armed organisation) held on 22 August 2005. The applicant responded that he had become aware of that event when demonstrators had started to march to the cemetery where the deceased were buried. As he was the head of the Batman branch of DEHAP, he had attended the march in order to keep the demonstrators under control and to prevent any possible disturbances in the town.", "7. When questioned on 6 December 2005, the applicant stated that on 17 August 2005 he had been the head of the DEHAP branch in Batman and that he had not praised the leader of the PKK in his speech. The applicant added that although Abdullah \u00d6calan, the leader of the PKK, was in prison, he was regarded as a political actor by the local population. The applicant\u2019s intention had been to express that social fact and he was against any kind of violence. When the public prosecutor reminded him of the violent acts of the PKK, the applicant once again stated that he was against violence regardless of whom it emanated from.", "8. On 1 February 2006 the Batman public prosecutor asked the applicant why he had referred to the PKK leader as \u201cEsteemed/Mr (Say\u0131n) \u00d6calan\u201d during one of his speeches. The applicant responded that he had used the word \u201cSay\u0131n\u201d as a matter of courtesy. He stated that he had not intended to disseminate propaganda in favour of the PKK or to praise a criminal.", "9. Lastly, on 23 March 2006 the applicant was questioned by the Batman public prosecutor in the context of a criminal investigation opened against him on suspicion of membership of the PKK. He stated that he had participated in several demonstrations and readings of press statements in his capacity as the head of the Batman branch of DEHAP and the DTP, and that he had not committed any offence during those events. He denied the veracity of the allegation that those public meetings had been organised in accordance with the instructions of the PKK. When he was asked about a sentence condemning both the death of Turkish soldiers and PKK members which he had uttered during a speech, the applicant stated that he would utter that sentence again without hesitation. He also stated that the petition campaign entitled \u201cI accept Abdullah \u00d6calan as a political actor\u201d had not been started upon the instructions of the PKK. He accepted that he had demanded an end to the solitary confinement of Abdullah \u00d6calan and addressed the latter as \u201cEsteemed/Mr (Say\u0131n) \u00d6calan\u201d. However, he denied the allegation that he had had the intention of disseminating propaganda in favour the PKK. The applicant contended that he had attended the demonstrations and meetings in question in order to control the crowds and to prevent any possible disturbances. Lastly, he claimed that his aim was to contribute to peace and democracy.", "10. On 23 March 2006 the applicant was brought before the Batman Magistrates\u2019 Court and questioned in respect of his involvement in a demonstration held on 16 February 2006 in Batman. He submitted that he had attended the demonstration with a view to preventing violence, since he was the head of the DTP at the material time. The court ordered the applicant\u2019s remand in custody.", "11. On 24 March 2006 the Batman public prosecutor decided to transfer the investigation to the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor\u2019s office, holding that the offence which the applicant had committed, namely membership of a terrorist organisation and carrying out membership activities, was not within his office\u2019s jurisdiction.", "12. On 26 April 2006 the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor filed an indictment with the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court, charging the applicant and a certain M.G., under Article 220 \u00a7 8 of the Criminal Code, with disseminating propaganda in favour of the PKK on ten occasions. In the indictment the public prosecutor listed a total of ten marches and demonstrations which the applicant had attended. He noted that during those marches and demonstrations, demonstrators had chanted slogans and carried banners praising the PKK and its leader, Abdullah \u00d6calan, and that the applicant had made speeches in Kurdish at nine of those ten assemblies.", "13. On 30 May 2006 the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court held the first hearing on the merits of the case. During the hearing, the applicant contended that he was the head of the Batman branch of the DTP. Although he had participated in the public meetings indicated in the indictment, he had not chanted any slogans or carried banners containing illegal expressions. He further submitted that he had not directed demonstrators to commit any illegal acts. The applicant stressed that in general he attended such public meetings at the request of the security forces, since the latter asked him to be present in order to prevent any possible clashes between themselves and the demonstrators.", "14. During the second hearing held on 18 July 2006 the public prosecutor submitted his observations on the merits of the case. The public prosecutor contended that the applicant had attended various illegal public meetings between 19 February 2005 and 16 February 2006 and that he had made speeches in which he had praised the PKK and its leader. The public prosecutor alleged that those events had been organised either in line with the policies of the PKK or under its instructions with a view to supporting that organisation. Taking into account the intensity, variety and continuity of the applicant\u2019s activities, the public prosecutor considered that the applicant\u2019s acts constituted knowingly and willingly aiding the PKK. He then asked the Assize Court to convict the applicant under Articles 220 \u00a7 7 and 314 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code of membership of the PKK.", "15. On 26 September 2006 the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court held the fourth and the last hearing in the case and convicted the applicant and his coaccused of membership of an illegal organisation under Article 314 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code on the basis of Articles 220 \u00a7 7 and 314 \u00a7 3 of the same Code, finding it established that the applicant had knowingly and willingly aided the PKK.

He stated that he had not directed demonstrators to chant slogans or to carry banners.", "Abdulcelil \u0130mret submitted that he had attended those meetings at the request of the security forces and that the latter had asked him to warn the crowds not to resist them and to work with them with a view to preventing possible disturbances.", "...", "The file contains police reports, photographs and video recordings of the events which the accused attended and the speeches he made.", "On the basis of the evidence in the file, it has been understood that during all the demonstrations and marches held in Batman which Abdulcelil \u0130mret attended, slogans in favour Abdullah \u00d6calan were chanted and the demonstrators carried banners. It has also been understood that the speeches made by the accused praised Abdullah \u00d6calan.", "It is established that the accused attended the public meetings in question and organised them.", "Although the accused submitted that their aim had been to prevent clashes between the demonstrators and the security forces and [that they] had not had the intention of disseminating propaganda in favour of the PKK when they had participated in the demonstrations and marches in question, taking into account the content of the case file and their acts during those meetings, their defence submissions have been found to be baseless.", "As a result of the trial and in the light of the evidence,", "It has been established that Abdulcelil \u0130mret worked as the head of the Batman branch of DEHAP and that subsequent to the closure of DEHAP he was the head of the Batman branch of the DTP.", "He attended ten marches and demonstrations held between 19 February 2005 and 16 February 2006, organised by the above-mentioned political parties. Illegal slogans were chanted and illegal banners were carried during those meetings. In some of those meetings, Abdulcelil \u0130mret read press statements containing expressions praising Abdullah \u00d6calan. All of the marches and demonstrations in question were illegal within the meaning of section 23/b of the Marches and Demonstrations Act (Law no. 2911).", "...", "It has been established that all of those marches and demonstrations were organised in line with the \u2018Democratic Political Struggle\u2019 strategy adopted by the PKK recently; that the media broadcasts in line with the PKK\u2019s strategies had announced those marches and demonstrations prior to them, and that the same media organs had used those demonstrations as propaganda materials after they had been held.", "Abdulcelil \u0130mret and M.G. organised several illegal demonstrations in line with the PKK\u2019s instructions and during those demonstrations they addressed the demonstrators who chanted slogans and carried banners containing expressions in favour of the PKK and Abdullah \u00d6calan. In their speeches the accused praised the PKK\u2019s leader. Taking into account the continuity and nature of their acts, it is considered that those acts went beyond the offence of dissemination of propaganda in favour of a [terrorist] organisation and amounted to the offence proscribed by Article 220 \u00a7 7 of the Criminal Code, that is to say, \u2018knowingly and willingly aiding an illegal organisation without being in the hierarchical structure\u2019.
