The applicant was born in 1944 and lives in K\u0142omnice.", "6. The applicant is proprietor and editor-in-chief of the local weekly newspaper \u201cKomu i Czemu\u201d, published in the Radomsko and Be\u0142chat\u00f3w Districts.", "7. In issue no. 33 of 18 August 2004 the applicant published an article entitled \u201cElegantly wrapped dung\u201d (\u201c\u0141ajno \u2013 elegancko opakowane\u201d). It read, in so far as relevant:", "\u201cA poser is someone who does everything to produce external effects by his conduct, speech and, in particular, with the populism he preaches. He is a numbskull posing as the people\u2019s tribune. The only panacea, or universal cure, for such a person is to recognise his intentions and take up a bloodless fight using arguments. An argument against any kind of tricks by a poser or populist will be always a counterargument based on reality, logic and the opportunity to put one\u2019s intentions into practice.", "I remember when, not so long ago, the author of the proposal to develop a quail farm as a panacea against rural unemployment had a go at me in an accommodating local newspaper, accusing me of malice, a willingness to discredit every good idea, and mindlessness leading to nasty mental disease and many other irreversible disorders of the mind. At the same time he declared that he would continue doing his job, that is, condemning farmers to breeding nice little birds in order to collect their eggs. His boss considered the quail business very important, because it would eliminate the need for viagra. There has not been a sideshow like it in the Radomsko District for a long time. So the time is approaching when pilgrimages of men from all over Poland, and maybe even the European Union, will come to Radomsko to taste quail eggs and later begin procreating.", "I wonder who has gone mad in the district, and why mad ideas, supported by even madder arguments, can be accepted by our officials. But no matter. Every dull boss can be convinced by any rubbish. Once more I want to authoritatively and responsibly declare that neither quail breeding, nor mushroom growing, nor Eternit [a registered trademark for fibre cement], which suddenly seems to have dropped out of the picture, will solve the unemployment problem in the villages of our region. And I will continue calling the actions of dim-witted officials and their dull bosses pretentious and populist, and no numbskull will convince me that I am wrong. ...\u201d", "8. The applicant went on to describe in general terms a local economic development programme, which had been presented to him by a businessman. He finished his article with the following paragraph:", "\u201cThis is not a venture of the quail variety by some smart poser or populist who is able to sell his dull bosses dung nicely wrapped in words. And he actually sells it.\u201d", "9. On 8 March 2005 M.D., the mayor of the Radomsko District (starosta), G.D., the head and spokesperson of the district\u2019s marketing department, and K.H., an employee of that department, lodged a private bill of indictment against the applicant with the Radomsko District Court. In respect of the impugned article, they accused him of defamation committed through the mass media under Article 212 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code. In particular, they alleged that the copious use of words such as \u201cnumbskull\u201d, \u201cdull boss\u201d, \u201cdim-witted official\u201d, \u201cposer\u201d and \u201cpopulist\u201d (\u201cpalant\u201d, \u201cnierozgarni\u0119ty szef\u201d, \u201cprzyg\u0142upawy urz\u0119dnik\u201d, \u201cpozer\u201d, \u201cpopulista\u201d) had defamed them as local government officials. The statements had lowered them in public opinion and undermined the public confidence necessary for the discharge of their duties.", "10. The private prosecutors sought an order requiring the applicant to publish an apology in the weekly newspaper. They further sought reimbursement of their legal costs and payment by the applicant of 5,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) to a charity.", "11. The Radomsko District Court ruled that it did not have jurisdiction in the case, and transmitted the private bill of indictment to the Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski District Court. The trial court held two hearings.", "12. On 8 February 2006 the Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski District Court gave its judgment. It held that the use of the words \u201cnumbskull\u201d, \u201cposer\u201d and \u201cdimwitted official\u201d in respect of K.H., and the use of the words \u201cdull bosses\u201d in respect of M.D. and G.D., had amounted to insult (zniewaga) committed through the mass media, within the meaning of Article 216 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code. The court convicted the applicant under that provision and ordered him to pay a fine of PLN 10,000 (approximately 2,630 euros (EUR)). It also ordered him to reimburse the private prosecutors\u2019 costs (PLN 900, approximately EUR 236) and the costs of the State Treasury (PLN 1,000, approximately EUR 263).", "13. As to the facts, the court observed that, since March 2004, the applicant\u2019s newspaper had been publishing articles which were critical of M.D., the mayor of the Radomsko District, and his officials. The newspaper was particularly critical of K.H.\u2019s initiative to develop quail farming in order to tackle the impoverishment of the local population. K.H. was an official in the district\u2019s marketing department. G.D., the head of the marketing department, was also involved in the implementation of this project. In April 2004 the applicant had published an article in which he had made ironic remarks about K.H.\u2019s initiative. In June 2004 a journalist at the same newspaper had published a detailed article on the same subject. The conflict between the applicant and the private prosecutors had intensified with each successively published article.", "14. The court further noted that, in his article entitled \u201cElegantly wrapped dung\u201d, the applicant had again written about the quail farming. Being aware of the publicity which the initiative promoted by K.H. and G.D. had received, the applicant had decided once again to mock the two officials, as well as their superior, M.D. He had referred to K.H., the author of the initiative, as a \u201cposer\u201d, \u201cnumbskull\u201d and \u201cdim-witted official\u201d, while the idea of quail farming had been referred to as \u201cnicely wrapped dung\u201d. According to the applicant, this kind of \u201cproduct\u201d had been sold to \u201cdull bosses\u201d, that is, first G.D. and then M.D., the mayor of the district.", "15. The trial court rejected the applicant\u2019s argument that the impugned article had been a simple weekly column in which any similarity to actual persons had been purely coincidental. It found that the article in issue had been part of a campaign carried out by the newspaper against the private prosecutors. They had not been mentioned by name, but they had been easily identifiable on account of the publicity generated by the quail farming project and the earlier articles published by the applicant\u2019s newspaper. The court established that there was no doubt that the words \u201cnumbskull\u201d, \u201cdimwitted official\u201d and \u201cposer\u201d had referred to K.H., and the term \u201cdull bosses\u201d to M.D. and G.D.", "16. With regard to the applicant\u2019s criminal responsibility, the trial court noted that a journalist had the right to criticise the actions of public officials, but was not entitled to use media in a manipulative way to wage private wars. The latter behaviour was not only unethical and unprofessional, but also incompatible with the role of the media, which was to serve the State and society. The trial court further held:", "\u201cThe fair criticism and objective coverage, free from personal emotions, which is desired in journalism, gave way to the private interest of the defendant, pursued through expressions which, in common understanding, remain offensive and disrespectful. It is difficult not to agree with the position that the word \u201cnumbskull\u201d (\u201cpalant\u201d) in the analysed context, although its literal meaning is legally irrelevant, fulfils all the criteria of insult within the meaning of Article 216 of the Criminal Code. Of an equally offensive character are the terms \u201cposer\u201d, \u201cdim-witted official\u201d and \u201cdull boss\u201d. It would be hard to find a person who would not feel offended by similar epithets, especially if formulated in the press.", "Incidentally, it should also be noted that the word \u201cdung\u201d used in the title of the article has a cruder equivalent, and undoubtedly that equivalent was meant to describe K.H.\u2019s contribution to the development of local entrepreneurship, which was accepted without reservation by his \u201cdull bosses\u201d. \u201cDull\u201d meaning not sharp, unintelligent, intellectually retarded.", "However, the court found no grounds to hold that the impugned words had the effect of lowering the private prosecutors in public esteem, or undermining the public confidence necessary for the discharge of their duties as local government officials. Accordingly, it would not be justified to classify the applicant\u2019s acts as coming under Article 212 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code. The quoted statements were rather harmful to the private prosecutors\u2019 perception of their dignity, and such, in the court\u2019s view, was the defendant\u2019s intention. By using insulting words in respect of the district officials, Maciej Ziembi\u0144ski intended to derive satisfaction from doing them moral harm. By doing so in a newspaper, he fell within the scope of Article 216 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code, acting unlawfully, reprehensibly, and, in the absence of circumstances capable of precluding or mitigating his guilt, also culpably.\u201d", "17. The trial court noted that the present case involved a conflict between constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech and the right of each citizen to have his reputation protected. However, it found that the applicant\u2019s acts had constituted a blatant abuse of freedom of speech and professional ethics. The court observed that his acts and motivation had been reprehensible, since he had been settling a private conflict with the officials and transgressing basic professional standards.", "18. As regards sentence, the court found that,, it would be disproportionate to impose a prison sentence, and that a fine would be the most appropriate penalty. It imposed a fine of PLN 10,000, which it considered proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the applicant\u2019s guilt.", "19. The applicant appealed. He contested the factual findings of the firstinstance court, in particular that his article had concerned the private prosecutors personally. He argued that the impugned article had presented in a sarcastic light people who achieved personal gain by pretending to work, and their dull bosses who accepted such practices. The applicant emphasised that criticism of the quail farm project as a solution to a decline in agriculture in the region had been entirely legitimate. Lastly, he submitted that public figures such as M.D., the district mayor, and other officials had to accept harsh criticism of their activities.", "20. On 18 April 2006 the Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski Regional Court (\u201cthe Regional Court\u201d) upheld the first-instance judgment. It ordered the applicant to pay PLN 1,000 (approx. EUR 256) in respect of the costs of the appeal proceedings.", "21. The Regional Court held that the lower court had correctly established the facts of the case. It endorsed the trial court\u2019s findings that the words used in the article had been insulting and harmful to the private prosecutors\u2019 dignity. It further held that, although fair criticism of public authorities and officials was socially desirable and legally accepted, the protection afforded by law did not extend to the use of insulting words which offended human dignity.", "22. The judgment was served on the applicant on 29 May 2006."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
