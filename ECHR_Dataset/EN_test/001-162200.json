Moreover, she took care to position herself at a distance from other people who were also present in front of the State Duma.", "6. After about ten minutes, the applicant was approached by police officers, who then took her to the district police station. An arrest record was compiled; the reasons for her arrest are unclear.", "7. According to the applicant, she spent some three hours in the police station and was then allowed to leave.", "8. The Government submitted to the Court a report issued on 11 November 2006 by the senior officer on-duty, Su. The report stated that the applicant and five other people (including A., M. and S.) had been present at 8.30 a.m. in front of the State Duma, holding posters that read \u201cAttention! Psychiatry kills. 7.5 million roubles of public funds spent on the destruction of lives\u201d, \u201cDo not force taxpayers to pay for psychiatrists\u2019 systematic extermination of Russians\u201d, \u201cPsychiatrists need walls to hide their crimes\u201d and other such statements.

As for the applicant, the administrative offence record states that she was accused of \u201ctaking part, together with other citizens, in a demonstration in respect of which no prior notification had been provided to the public authorities\u201d. Her actions were classified under Article 20.2 of the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation (hereinafter \u201cthe CAO\u201d), which regulates the penalties applied to violations of the regulations on public events set out in, inter alia, the Public Assemblies Act.", "10.

According to the applicant, she was not informed of the hearing date until it was too late. Thus, she made no written or oral submissions to the court.", "12. Having examined the file, on 15 November 2006 the judge considered that the applicant had been apprised of the hearing but had refused to sign the summons. The court decided to proceed with the case in her absence and held that she had been afforded but had not used an adequate opportunity to make written or oral submissions. On the same day, the judge found the applicant guilty under Article 20.2 \u00a7 2 of the CAO and imposed a fine of 1,000 Russian roubles (RUB), which was at the time equivalent to 29 euros (EUR).", "13. Referring to the arrest record, the offence record and G.\u2019s report (see above), the court considered that the applicant had participated in a demonstration after which some five people and the applicant had been arrested. In the court\u2019s view, the applicant\u2019s behaviour amounted to participation in a public event requiring prior notification. The justice of the peace then held as follows:", "\u201c[The applicant\u2019s] actions constitute a violation of the regulations on static demonstrations in that no notification had been made [to the competent authority] about the possibility of staging a demonstration ... Thus, this demonstration was held without legal grounds. The court takes into account that the applicant\u2019s presence next to the object being picketed, together with other people, directly discloses the expression of opinions and attitudes, and thus takes the form of a group public event, namely a static demonstration.\u201d", "14. The applicant sought re-examination of the case on appeal by the Tverskoy District Court of Moscow. On 5 December 2006 the court heard the applicant and upheld the judgment of the justice of the peace, concluding that the applicant had taken part in a public event held without prior notification to the competent authority; on 10 November 2006 she had been apprised of the hearing to be held before the justice of the peace but had failed to sign the summons.", "15.

The court held as follows:", "\u201cFollowing the escorting of [the applicant] to the police station no administrative offence case was opened ... [Mr S.] testified that the defendant had shown his identity document and had not expressed his consent to go with the police to the police station ... The police officers acted unlawfully when escorting the applicant to the police station ...\u201d", "The court awarded the applicant RUB 6,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage (approximately EUR 149 at the time).

In the Rostov region they disregard your Decree on social assistance to families. The Russian Government disregards its obligations to issue housing certificates!\u201d", "25. According to the applicant, police officers approached him and ordered him to go to another place where journalists were filming. He arrived there and displayed his poster.

The court then discontinued the case owing to the expiry of the time-limit for prosecution. On 7 February 2012 the Rostov Regional Court upheld the judgment on appeal.", "28. The applicant brought civil proceedings challenging the actions of the police in respect of him. On 4 April 2012 the Town Court dismissed his claims. On 14 June 2012 the Regional Court upheld the judgment on appeal. The appeal court noted that the courts dealing with the administrative offence case had not determined whether the applicant had committed the impugned action (using foul language) and whether he had committed an offence, but had simply discontinued the case on procedural grounds. The appeal court concluded that the above \u201cdid not disclose any unlawfulness\u201d on the part of the law-enforcement officers, while the applicant had not substantiated, in the current case, that their actions had violated or otherwise impeded the exercise of his protected rights or freedoms.", "29.

The applicant agreed to go with the police to the police station.", "34. On 20 July 2012 a justice of the peace convicted the applicant under Article 20.2 \u00a7 2 of the CAO. The court considered that the applicant had held a public event in the form of a meeting (\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433); some five people had gathered but then dispersed after a warning from a police officer. The justice of the peace sentenced the applicant to a fine of RUB 20,000 (approximately EUR 505 at the time), noting that the applicant had committed an offence that was similar to another one for which he had already been convicted earlier the same year. The justice of the peace warned the applicant that his failure to pay the fine would constitute an administrative offence under Article 20.25 of the CAO, which was punishable by a fine of double the amount or up to fifteen days\u2019 detention.", "35. The applicant appealed, arguing that the court had failed to take into account his financial situation when imposing a high fine.", "36. On 21 August 2012 the Kirovskiy District Court of Astrakhan upheld the judgment on appeal.

He was holding a poster saying \u201cAnnul order no. 101 of 27 September 2012 and find its authors liable\u201d. According to the applicant, he was standing some 50 metres away. The Government submitted that the applicant and A. were at \u201cvisual distance from each other\u201d.", "41. Shortly after starting his demonstration, the applicant was approached by a police officer who warned him that he was in breach of Article 20.2 of the CAO. He then escorted the applicant to the police station. It appears that A. was also taken to the police station. According to the Government, it was not possible to draw up an administrative offence record on the spot because the applicant had no identity document on him.", "42. The applicant was allowed to leave the police station after several hours.", "43. In the Astrakhan Region, Law no. 80/2012-FZ of 27 November 2012 set the minimum distance between solo demonstrators at twenty metres.", "44. On 6 December 2012 a justice of the peace held a hearing. A. stated that he knew the applicant; without any concerted plan, they had both gone to the university to stage solo demonstrations; the applicant had not prepared his own poster and so had taken one of A.\u2019s posters; they had placed themselves at a distance of some fifty metres from each other.", "45. On the same day, the justice of the peace convicted the applicant under Article 20.2 \u00a7 2 of the CAO (organisation and holding of a public event without prior notification) and imposed a fine of RUB 20,000 on him. On 5 February 2013 the Sovetskiy District Court of Astrakhan upheld the judgment. The courts considered that the applicant and A. had held a public static demonstration (common logistical organisation, timing and claims disclosing a common goal), which by law required them to notify the local authorities in advance. The courts concluded that the offence impinged upon public order and public security, \u201chaving a significant adverse impact on protected public relations\u201d. According to the Government, the applicant was a \u201cparticipant\u201d in a demonstration with A.", "46.
