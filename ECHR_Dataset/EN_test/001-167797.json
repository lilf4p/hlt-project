The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in C\u0103l\u0103ra\u0219i.", "6. On 26 October 2005 the applicant and her daughter drank water from taps in their apartment and shortly thereafter they felt unwell. On 29 October 2005 the applicant\u2019s daughter, who was twelve at the time, was admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of \u201cserious acute dysentery\u201d. The applicant was admitted to hospital with the same diagnosis on 31 October 2005. She was released from hospital on 13 November 2005, a day later than her daughter.", "7. The applicant lodged a court action against the local utilities provider (\u201cthe provider\u201d), a State-owned company, claiming 100,000 Moldovan lei (\u201cMDL\u201d, approximately 6,700 euros (EUR) at the time) in compensation for the harm caused to her health and for the related inconveniences, including subsequent investigations and disinfection.", "8. On 1 March 2006 the C\u0103l\u0103ra\u015fi District Court found in her favour. It found that various sanitary, medical and technical reports had established that in the vicinity of the applicant\u2019s apartment block the sewage pipe was situated above the drinking water pipe and was leaking. The water pipe had cracked on 26 October 2005 and sewage water had infiltrated the drinking water pipe. The court also established that the pipes had been used since 1977 and that their expected lifespan was fifteen years. A total of five people, all of whom had drunk water from taps connected to the same water pipe, had been admitted to hospital with the same diagnosis at approximately the same time as the applicant. Taking into consideration such elements as the amount of physical and mental suffering caused to the applicant and her daughter, the court awarded her MDL 10,000 (approximately EUR 648 at the time).", "9. The parties appealed. On 26 April 2006 the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Court of Appeal rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal and partly accepted the provider\u2019s appeal. It reduced the award to MDL 5,000 (EUR 310) because it found exaggerated \u201cboth the sum claimed by [the applicant] and that awarded to [her]\u201d.", "10. The parties appealed. On 25 October 2006 the Supreme Court of Justice upheld the judgment of 26 April 2006. It found that the lower court had taken into consideration the nature and seriousness of the mental suffering caused to the applicant, as well as the degree of guilt of the defendant. That judgment was final."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
