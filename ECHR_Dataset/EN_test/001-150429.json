On 11 February 2002, the applicant lodged an action with the domestic courts seeking the withdrawal of the discharge order of 19 June 2001 and the recalculation of his salary rights.", "6. After a first set of proceedings, by a judgment of 30 July 2005 the Mehedin\u0163i County Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s action on the ground that it had not been lodged within thirty days of the communication of the order, as required by law. It held that the applicant\u2019s enquiries to the authorities proved that he had become aware of the discharge order more than thirty days before lodging his action.", "7. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law on the ground that the order of 19 June 2001 had never been communicated to him, and stated that in his letters to the authorities he had in fact been requesting them to communicate to him the reasons for his discharge. Moreover, the authority that had issued the order had an obligation to prove that it had communicated such reasons to him, which it had not done.", "8.

The time-limit for administrative complaint (contestare pe cale administrativ\u0103) runs from this date.", "Having in mind the date on which the applicant was aware of the content of Order no. 231645/19 June 2001, more precisely on 9 September 2001 at the latest, the firstinstance court correctly allowed the exception and found that the action was lodged out of time ...", "The applicable legal norm ... is section 5 of Law no. 29/1990.", "According to section 5 paragraphs 1 and 2 of Law no. 29/1990, an individual who is deemed to have suffered as a result of an administrative act ... is to address himself to the administrative litigation tribunal within thirty days of the communication of the decision or within thirty days of the expiry of the time-limit for the administrative complaint (contesta\u0163ia administrativ\u0103).", "Therefore, [the applicant] should have lodged the action on 10 November 2001 at the latest.\u201d", "9.
