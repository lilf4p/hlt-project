In particular, on 3 August 2011 the Podilskyy District Court of Kyiv ordered further pre-investigation enquiries, stating that it was necessary to carry out an inspection of the scene of the incident with a forensic medical expert. Among other things, the court also stated that detailed drawings and photographs of the site had to be prepared; the expert had to be questioned in order to establish whether the applicant\u2019s son could have fallen from the building and, if so, whether he could have sustained the injuries found on his body; and additional steps had to be taken to identify potential witnesses.", "17. In the last decision of 9 August 2012, the Podilskyy District Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Kyiv refused to open criminal proceedings in relation to the death of the applicant\u2019s son. According to that decision, the man found in the street had been identified, with a high degree of certainty, as the applicant\u2019s son.
