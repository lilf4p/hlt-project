RUSSIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Protection of property (Article 1 para. 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Peaceful enjoyment of possessions)", "JUDGES": "Branko Lubarda;Georgios A. Serghides;Pere Pastor Vilanova", "TEXT": ["5. The first applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Leverkusen, Germany. She is the daughter of the second and third applicants who were born in 1943 and 1942 respectively and lived in Tambov, Russia. The second applicant Ms Galina Zabelina died in 2013.", "6. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "7. On 25 April 2007 Mr P.Z., the brother of the first applicant and the son of the second and third applicants, was charged with large-scale fraud; his name was placed on the list of fugitives from justice. He was accused of embezzling the assets of the companies under his management. The wronged companies filed a claim for compensation in respect of pecuniary damage.", "8. On 12 May 2007 a senior operational officer from the Federal Security Service sent a letter to the investigator in charge of P.Z.\u2019s case to inform him that \u201caccording to the available information, the real estate property owned by [the first applicant] (four flats) and by [the second applicant] (one flat) had been purchased at the expense of their close relative P.Z.\u201d", "9. On 22 May 2007 the investigator asked the Basmannyy District Court in Moscow to authorise attachment of the applicants\u2019 property, including three flats owned by the first applicant, a flat owned by the second applicant, and a car owned by the third applicant. He referred to undisclosed sources allegedly confirming that all that property had been purchased by P.Z.", "10. On 24 May 2007 the District Court issued the requested writs of attachment. It observed that, \u201caccording to the information from the investigation\u201d, P.Z. had used the stolen money to purchase the property which he had registered in the name of his family members. It considered therefore necessary to attach the property which the District Court described as being owned by P.Z. The District Court explained that the application for writs was to be granted because \u201cit [had been] lodged in the framework of a criminal case by the competent official and with the prosecutor\u2019s approval, it [was] well-reasoned and [complied] with the requirements of the Code of Criminal Procedure\u201d.", "11. The applicants filed an appeal. They produced evidence showing that they had paid for the impugned property out of their pocket and that the link to P.Z. was the investigator\u2019s conjecture without basis in fact. They were not defendants in any criminal proceedings or respondents in any civil claim and there were no legal grounds for attaching their property.", "12. On 13 August 2007 the Moscow City Court rejected their appeals, stating that the District Court had \u201ccarefully reviewed the materials enclosed with the investigator\u2019s request and reached the justified conclusion that there were sufficient grounds for seizing\u201d the listed property.", "13. The attachment of the applicants\u2019 property has remained in place to date."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
