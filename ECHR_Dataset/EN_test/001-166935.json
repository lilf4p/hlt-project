The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Sibinj.", "6. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "7. The applicant was a civil servant of the City of Slavonski Brod, working in its Office for Public Relations and Protocol (Grad Slavonski Brod, Ured za odnose s javno\u0161\u0107u i protokol \u2013 hereinafter \u201cthe City of Slavonski Brod\u201d). In 2007 he was suspended from the civil service on account of having been accused of severe breaches of his official duties.", "8. For the duration of his suspension, that is to say between September 2007 and September 2008, the applicant was entitled to monthly salary compensation in the amount of 60% of the salary remitted in the month prior to his suspension from the civil service.", "9. On 5 September 2008 the Osijek Civil Service Tribunal (Slu\u017ebeni\u010dki sud u Osijeku) found the applicant guilty of severe breaches of his official duties and fined him 10% of the salary paid to him in the month in which the said sanction was imposed.", "10. On 14 October 2008, after the applicant lodged an appeal, the Superior Civil Service Tribunal (Vi\u0161i slu\u017ebeni\u010dki sud) amended the impugned decision and fined the applicant 5% of his salary paid in the month in which the said sanction was imposed.", "11. On 3 November 2008 the applicant lodged an application for the reimbursement of the portion of his gross salary \u2013 in the total amount of 78,428.47 Croatian kunas ((HRK), approximately 10,900 euros (EUR) at the time) \u2013 withheld during the suspension period between September 2007 and September 2008, together with accrued default interest running from the date of his suspension until payment of the said portion. He was of the opinion that by withholding 40% of his salary for a period of 12 months and imposing a fine on him the administrative bodies had punished him twice.", "12. By a decision of 17 November 2008 the City of Slavonski Brod dismissed that application.", "13. The applicant then lodged an appeal, which was dismissed as ill-founded by the same administrative body that delivered the above-mentioned decision (that is to say the City of Slavonski Brod). However, in its decision of 22 December 2008 it gave the instruction that the applicant had a right to bring an administrative action against it before the Administrative Court.", "14. On 22 January 2009 the applicant brought an administrative action, in accordance with the City of Slavonski Brod\u2019s ruling.", "15. On 1 January 2012 certain amendments to the Court Act entered into force and the Administrative Court became the High Administrative Court.", "16. By a decision of 4 January 2012 the High Administrative Court, relying on sections 9 and 30(1), point 5, of the Administrative Disputes Act, declined jurisdiction in respect of the subject matter, stating that an ordinary municipal court (redovni, op\u0107inski sud) was the appropriate court to hear the applicant\u2019s case, and declared the applicant\u2019s action inadmissible. This decision was final. On 16 February 2012 it served its decision on the applicant\u2019s representative.", "17. On 12 March 2012 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint. He complained, inter alia, that his right to a fair hearing, in particular his right of access to court, as guaranteed by Article 29 of the Croatian Constitution and Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, had been violated when the High Administrative Court had declared his action inadmissible. In particular, he argued that according to the Supreme Court\u2019s case-law, ordinary municipal courts did not have jurisdiction over disputes arising from legally binding decisions of administrative bodies. He also argued that even if he had brought a civil action, it would have been time-barred because it had taken the High Administrative Court more than three years to declare his administrative action inadmissible.", "18. By a decision of 5 July 2012 the Constitutional Court declared the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint inadmissible on the grounds that the case raised no constitutional issue. On 17 July 2012 it served its decision on the applicant\u2019s representative.", "19. On 6 September 2012 the applicant brought a civil action in the Slavonski Brod Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Slavonskom Brodu) for reimbursement of salary arrears withheld between September 2007 and September 2008.", "20. By a judgment of 20 March 2013 the first-instance court dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim as time-barred. It held, inter alia, that given that the High Administrative Court had declared the applicant\u2019s administrative action inadmissible, it could not be deemed that the statutory limitation period had been interrupted. It relied on section 242(2) of the Civil Obligations Act.", "21. By a judgment of 12 August 2013 the Slavonski Brod County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Slavonskom Brodu) dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal and upheld the first-instance judgment of 20 March 2013."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
