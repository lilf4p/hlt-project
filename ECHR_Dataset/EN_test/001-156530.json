The applicant, Mr Viktors Pancers, is a Latvian national, who was born in 1965 and lives in Riga. He is represented before the Court by Mr A. Vid\u017eups, a lawyer practising in Riga.", "2.

The bill of indictment was finalised on 12 March 2004 and the case was transferred for adjudication to the R\u012bga Regional Court.

The hearings in the first-instance court took place between 10 January and 1 August 2005.", "7. On 1 August 2005 the R\u012bga Regional Court adopted judgment in the criminal case against the applicant and eight other defendants.

On 30 June 2006 the Supreme Court, acting as an appeal court, adopted a decision by which it quashed the first-instance court\u2019s judgment in its entirety and remitted the case to the first-instance court. The appeal court considered that the first-instance court\u2019s judgment had not been adequately motivated and had furthermore relied on evidence which had not been presented during the hearing. The court also ruled on the applicant\u2019s detention on remand and found it necessary to prolong the term of the applicant\u2019s detention for three further months. The operative part of the decision of the appeal court indicated that the term of the applicant\u2019s detention on remand was to be prolonged by three months \u201cstarting from the date of entry into force of the decision\u201d.", "12.

The Senate pointed out that upon identifying procedural flaws in the firstinstance court\u2019s judgment the appeal court itself had a duty to examine the case on the merits and adopt a new judgment.", "15. On 23 October 2007 the Supreme Court started hearings concerning the applicant\u2019s appeal against the judgment of the firstinstance court. The appeal court refused to order the applicant\u2019s release from detention, arguing that his detention had been ordered by the verdict of the firstinstance court.", "16.

In a final decision of 28 October 2009 the Senate of the Supreme Court rejected the appeals on points of law that had been lodged by the prosecutor, the applicant and two of the applicant\u2019s co-defendants.
