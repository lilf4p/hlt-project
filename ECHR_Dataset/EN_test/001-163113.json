De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["11. The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Budapest.", "12. On 22 June 2009, after seventeen years of service (1991-2008) as a judge at the European Court of Human Rights and, subsequently, more than one year\u2019s service as a member of the Budapest Court of Appeal, the applicant was elected by the Parliament of Hungary, by decision no. 55/2009 (VI.24) OGY, as President of the Supreme Court for a six-year term, until 22 June 2015.", "13. In that capacity, the applicant carried out managerial tasks and also had a judicial role, presiding over deliberations which resulted in uniformity resolutions (on case-law consistency) and in guiding resolutions. He was also President of the National Council of Justice. This second function had been added to the tasks of the President of the Supreme Court in 1997 by the Organisation and Administration of the Courts Act (Act LXVI of 1997). As the head of the National Council of Justice, the applicant was under an explicit statutory obligation to express an opinion on parliamentary bills that affected the judiciary, after having gathered and summarised the opinions of different courts via the Office of the National Council of Justice (see paragraph 44 below).", "14. On 13 October 2011 the General Assembly of the Network of the Presidents of the Supreme Judicial Courts of the European Union elected the applicant President of the Network for a two-year term (2011 to 2013).", "15. In April 2010 the alliance of Fidesz\u2013Magyar Polg\u00e1ri Sz\u00f6vets\u00e9g (Fidesz\u2013Hungarian Civic Union, hereinafter \u201cFidesz\u201d) and the Christian Democratic People\u2019s Party (\u201cthe KDNP\u201d) obtained a two-thirds parliamentary majority and undertook a programme of comprehensive constitutional and legislative reforms. In his professional capacity as President of the Supreme Court and the National Council of Justice, the applicant expressed his views on different aspects of the legislative reforms affecting the judiciary, notably the Nullification Bill, the retirement age of judges, the amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the new Organisation and Administration of the Courts Bill.", "16. On 12 February 2011, in relation to the Nullification Bill (subsequently Act XVI of 2011, ordering the annulment of final convictions relating to the dispersal of crowds in the autumn of 2006), the applicant\u2019s spokesman explained to the N\u00e9pszabads\u00e1g newspaper that, in the applicant\u2019s view,", "\u201cthe Bill ordering the annulment of certain judicial decisions delivered in relation to the 2006 riots gives cause for concern, because it violates the right of judges to assess evidence freely. This is a serious constitutional problem. ... the judiciary is examining the Bill only from a professional point of view and distances itself from any kind of political debate. Andr\u00e1s Baka [the applicant], President of the National Council of Justice, hopes that Parliament will choose a legal technique that eliminates the problem of unconstitutionality\u201d.", "17. On 8 March 2011, the day after the Bill\u2019s enactment, Istv\u00e1n Balsai (Fidesz MP, Chairman of the Constitutional, Judicial and Standing Orders Committee of Parliament at the relevant time), responded at a press conference to the criticisms made by the judiciary, and declared: \u201cThe adopted legal solution was said to be unfortunate. Now, I myself find it unfortunate if a member of the judiciary, in any position whatsoever, tries to exert influence over the legislative process in such a way\u201d.", "18. On 24 March 2011, in a speech delivered to Parliament in the course of the debate on the Bill on the Fundamental Law of Hungary (the new Constitution), the applicant expressed his opinion on certain aspects of the proposed constitutional reform which concerned the judiciary, notably the new name given to the Supreme Court \u2013 K\u00faria \u2013, the new powers attributed to the K\u00faria in the field of ensuring consistency in the case-law, the management of the judiciary and the functioning of the National Council of Justice, as well as the introduction of a constitutional appeal against judicial decisions.", "19. On 7 April 2011, in relation to the proposal to reduce the mandatory retirement age of judges (from seventy years to the general retirement age of sixty-two) in Article 26 (2) of the Fundamental Law of Hungary, the applicant, together with other court presidents, addressed a letter to various actors in the constitutional process (the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister, the Speaker of Parliament) in which they pointed out the possible risks to the judiciary posed by the given proposal. Their concern was that, by abolishing the possibility for judges to remain in office until the age of seventy, the proposed rule would force one-tenth of Hungarian judges (274 persons) to end their careers in 2012, earlier than planned, with all the attendant consequences for the functioning of the judiciary and the length of pending proceedings.", "20. On the morning of 11 April 2011 (the day of the vote on the proposals to amend the retirement age of judges), the applicant addressed a letter to the Prime Minister, in which he stressed that the proposal was humiliating and professionally unjustifiable; it infringed the fundamental principles of the independence, status and irremovability of judges; and it was also discriminatory, since only the judiciary was concerned. He refuted accusations of bias in favour of any political ideology within the judiciary, and continued:", "\u201cIt is, however, unacceptable if a political party or the majority of Parliament makes political demands on the judiciary and evaluates judges by political standards.\u201d", "In his letter the applicant asked the Prime Minister to use his influence to prevent Parliament from adopting the proposal. On the same day, however, Parliament adopted the proposal (see Relevant Domestic Law below).", "21. On 14 April 2011, a joint communiqu\u00e9 was addressed to the Hungarian and European-Union public by the plenary session of the Supreme Court, by the applicant in his capacity as President of the National Council of Justice, and by the presidents of regional and county courts. It argued for the autonomy and independence of the judiciary and criticised the new mandatory retirement age for judges and the proposal to modify the model of judicial self-governance embodied in the National Council of Justice. The relevant extracts from the communiqu\u00e9 read as follows:", "\u201cAccording to the proposal, the mandatory retirement age of judges will be reduced by eight years as of 1 January 2012. As a result, the tenure of 228 judges (among them 121 judges responsible for court administration and professional supervision) will be terminated on that same date, without any transition period, since they will have turned 62. By 31 December 2012 a further 46 judges will have to terminate their careers. As a consequence of this decision, the rapidity of judicial proceedings will significantly deteriorate (nearly 40,000 cases will have to be reassigned, which may even result in several years\u2019 delay in judicial proceedings, concerning tens of thousands of persons). The administration of the courts will be seriously hindered, since it is extremely difficult to replace dozens of retiring judges.", "The multiple effect of the forced pensioning-off, with no real justification, of highly qualified judges who have several years of experience and practice, most of whom are at the apex of the hierarchy, will fundamentally shatter the functioning of the court system \u2013 leaving aside other unforeseeable consequences. Moreover, the proposal is unfair and humiliating with respect to the persons concerned, who took an oath to serve the Republic of Hungary and to administer justice, and who have devoted their lives to the judicial vocation.", "It is incomprehensible why the issue of the retirement age of judges is worth regulation in the Fundamental Law. There is only one answer: by including it in the Fundamental Law, there will be no possibility of contesting this legal rule, which violates the fundamental principles of a democratic state governed by the rule of law, before the Constitutional Court.", "Such an unjustified step implies political motivation.\u201d", "22. On 14 June 2011 Bill no. T/3522 on the amendment of certain legislative acts concerning judicial procedure and the judicial system (including the Code of Criminal Procedure) was submitted to Parliament. At the applicant\u2019s request, the Criminal Law Division of the Supreme Court prepared an analysis of the Bill, which was communicated to Members of Parliament. On 4 August 2011, as no substantive changes had been made to the Bill prior to its enactment on 4 July 2011 as Act LXXXIX of 2011, the applicant challenged the Act before the Constitutional Court, on the grounds of unconstitutionality and violation of the obligations enshrined in international treaties, making use of that power for the first time in Hungarian history. The Constitutional Court, in its judgment no. 166/2011. (XII. 20.) AB of 19 December 2011, established the unconstitutionality of the impugned provisions and quashed them (notably, the provision concerning the Attorney General\u2019s right to establish court competence by derogation from the default statutory rules).", "23. Lastly, on 26 October 2011 the applicant addressed to Parliament a detailed analysis of two new Cardinal Bills: the Organisation and Administration of the Courts Bill (no. T/4743) and the Legal Status and Remuneration of Judges Bill (no. T/4744). According to the explanatory memorandum to the Bills, it was proposed that the National Council of Justice be abolished and replaced by a National Judicial Office and a National Judicial Council. The purpose of those proposals was to separate judicial and managerial functions, which had been \u201cunified\u201d in the person of the President of the Supreme Court, who was at the same time president of the National Council of Justice. The proposed reform sought to concentrate the tasks of judicial management in the hands of the president of the new National Judicial Office, while leaving the responsibility for overseeing the uniform administration of justice with the president of the Supreme Court (renamed with the historical appellation \u201cK\u00faria\u201d).", "The applicant also decided to express his opinion directly before Parliament, as permitted by Article 45 \u00a7 1 of Parliamentary Decision 46/1994 (IX.30) OGY on the Rules of Parliament. In his speech, delivered on 3 November 2011, the applicant raised his concerns about the draft legislation. He said that it did not address the structural problems of the judiciary, but left them to \u201cthe discretion of the executive of an external administration (the President of the proposed National Judicial Office, which would replace the National Council of Justice in managing the courts), who [would be] assigned excessive and, in Europe, unprecedented powers, with no adequate accountability\u201d. The applicant referred to those new powers (to appoint judges and court executives, to issue normative orders and to designate the court in a given case) as \u201cunconstitutional\u201d. In this regard, he stated:", "\u201cThis unrestricted, non-transparent and uncontrollable power is unparalleled in contemporary Europe ... The extent and uncontrollability of such centralised authority is without precedent, even in countries where the administration of the judiciary lies with the ministry of justice and even if we think of the socialist dictatorship, in the last years of which K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Kulcs\u00e1r, member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and Minister of Justice responsible for the administration of the judiciary, declared that he would appoint only persons recommended by the professional organs of the judiciary.\u201d", "Finally, the applicant again raised in his speech the issue of the new retirement age for judges, saying that it would have a severe effect on the Supreme Court and that the need to have enough judges at the K\u00faria had not yet been addressed. In this connection, he maintained that the K\u00faria\u2019s main responsibility, that of ensuring consistency in the judicial application of laws, could be met only if that court were able to deliver judgments in an appropriate number and type of cases.", "24. The Fundamental Law of 25 April 2011 established that the highest judicial body would be the K\u00faria (the historical Hungarian name for the Supreme Court). The date of entry into force of the Fundamental Law was scheduled for 1 January 2012.", "25. On 14 April 2011, during a debate on the Fundamental Law, a Fidesz politician, Gergely Guly\u00e1s, MP, declared on the Infor\u00e1di\u00f3 radio station that the President of the Supreme Court would remain the same and that only the name of the institution would change. On 19 October 2011, in an interview on the ATV channel, the State Secretary of Justice, R\u00f3bert R\u00e9p\u00e1ssy, MP, declared that under the Organisation and Administration of the Courts Bill (no. T/4743), the new K\u00faria would have the same function as the current Supreme Court and that only the Supreme Court\u2019s name would change. He said that the legislation \u201cwill certainly not provide any legal ground for a change in the person of the Chief Justice\u201d.", "26. On 6 July 2011, in the \u201cPosition of the Government of Hungary on the Opinion on the Fundamental Law of Hungary adopted by the Venice Commission at its 87th Plenary Session (Venice, 17-18 June 2011, CDLAD(2011)016)\u201d, transmitted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, the Government assured the Venice Commission that the drafting of the transitional provisions of the Fundamental Law would not be used to unduly put an end to the terms of office of persons elected under the previous legal regime.", "27. In the period between 19 and 23 November 2011, members of Parliament submitted several amendments proposing that the applicant\u2019s mandate as President of the Supreme Court be terminated.", "28. On 19 November 2011 Gergely Guly\u00e1s submitted a Bill (no. T/4996) to Parliament, proposing an amendment to the 1949 Constitution (then in force). The amendment provided that Parliament would elect the President of the K\u00faria by 31 December 2011 at the latest. The reasoning of the Bill reads as follows:", "\u201cIn view of the Fundamental Law of Hungary and of the modifications to the court system resulting from that Law, in compliance with the Bill on the Transitional Provisions of the Fundamental Law of Hungary, and with a view to ensuring a smooth transition and continuity in the fulfilment of the tasks of the K\u00faria as from 1 January 2012, this Bill provides that Parliament must elect, by 31 December 2011 and according to the rules laid down in the Fundamental Law, the President of the K\u00faria who is to take office on 1 January 2012.\u201d", "29. On 20 November 2011 two members of the parliamentary majority submitted a Bill (no. T/5005) to Parliament on the Transitional Provisions of the Fundamental Law. Under section 11 of the Transitional Provisions of the Fundamental Law of Hungary Bill, the legal successors of the Supreme Court and the National Council of Justice would be the K\u00faria, for the administration of justice, and the President of the National Judicial Office, for the administration of the courts. Pursuant to section 11(2), the mandates of the President of the Supreme Court and of the President and members of the National Council of Justice would be terminated upon the entry into force of the Fundamental Law. The reasoning of the Bill stated as follows:", "\u201cThe Bill regulates in a comprehensive manner the succession of the Supreme Court and the National Council of Justice and its president, in that the successor body or person shall be different for the respective duties. Having regard to the modifications to the court system, the Bill provides that the term of office of the President of the Supreme Court currently in office, and that of the President and the members of the National Council of Justice, shall be terminated upon the entry into force of the Fundamental Law.\u201d", "30. On 23 November 2011 another Member of Parliament submitted a proposal for an amendment to sections 185 and 187 of the Organisation and Administration of the Courts Bill. While the previous versions of the Bill submitted by the Government (on 21 October and 17 November 2011) provided that the term of office of the court executives appointed before 1 January 2012 would last until the date fixed at the time of their appointment, this last mentioned amendment provided for an exception. It sought to terminate ex lege the mandate of the President and Vice-President of the Supreme Court. The reasoning of the proposal read as follows:", "\u201cThe aim of this proposal for an amendment, submitted before the final vote, is to ensure the compliance of consolidated Bill no. T/4743/116, by amending its transitional provisions, with the Fundamental Law, having regard to Bill no. T/4996 on the Amendment of the Act XX of 1949 on the Constitution of the Republic of Hungary and also to Bill no. T/5005 on the Transitional Provisions of the Fundamental Law of Hungary, both submitted to Parliament.\u201d", "31. On 28 November 2011 Parliament adopted both the Organisation and Administration of the Courts Bill (as Act CLXI) and the Constitution of the Republic of Hungary (Amendment) Bill (as Act CLIX), with the content described above.", "32. On 30 December 2011 the Transitional Provisions of the Fundamental Law Bill was adopted without amendment. The Transitional Provisions were published in the Official Gazette on 31 December 2011.", "33. As a consequence of the entry into force of all these constitutional and legislative amendments, the applicant\u2019s mandate as President of the Supreme Court terminated on 1 January 2012, three and a half years before its expected date of expiry.", "34. The applicant remained in office as president of a civil-law division of the K\u00faria.", "35. In order for a new president to be elected to the K\u00faria in due time, the Constitution of the Republic of Hungary (Amendment) Act (Act CLIX of 2011, adopted on 28 November 2011, see paragraph 31 above) entered into force on 2 December 2011. On 9 November 2011 the Organisation and Administration of the Courts Bill was amended, and an additional criterion for the election of the new president of the K\u00faria was introduced. This provided that he or she would be elected by Parliament from among the judges appointed for an indeterminate term and having served at least five years as a judge (section 114(1) of Act CLXI of 2011 \u2013 see Relevant Domestic Law below). On 9 December 2011 the President of the Republic proposed that Parliament elect P\u00e9ter Dar\u00e1k as President of the K\u00faria and T\u00fcnde Hand\u00f3 as President of the National Judicial Office. On 13 December 2011 Parliament elected those candidates, in line with the proposal by the President of the Republic.", "36. Firstly, the applicant lost the remuneration and other benefits (social security, presidential residence, personal protection) to which a president of the Supreme Court was entitled throughout the period of the fixed presidential term.", "37. Secondly, the legislation dealing with certain post-term benefits for outgoing presidents of the Supreme Court (Remuneration and Allowances Act 2000) was repealed as from 1 January 2012. Section 227(1) of the Legal Status and Remuneration of Judges Act 2011 (as amended on 28 November 2011, in force from 1 January 2012) supplemented this abrogation, and stipulated that the repealed legislation would be applied to any former president of the Supreme Court only to the extent that he or she was entitled to the allowance specified in sections 26(1) and 22(1) (pension supplement for life), had reached retirement age at the time of the entry of force of the Act and had requested the allowance. Since the applicant had not attained retirement age by 1 January 2012, he could not claim payment of that post-function benefit."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1", "6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
