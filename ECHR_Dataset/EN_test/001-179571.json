The applicant claims that on the arrival of the Special Anti-Terrorist Unit he was subjected to physical and verbal abuse. Its members immediately started to kick and beat him indiscriminately all over his body and face. They put a pillowcase over his head, verbally abused him and made threats aimed at his family.

On 15 April 2003 a prison doctor examined him and issued a medical certificate, which contained an extensive list of his injuries. These included large haematomas on the soles of his feet, palms of his hands, face, shoulders and buttocks, as well as conjunctival hyperaemia (redness) on the external parts of his eyes. The certificate also contained a statement that the applicant had been \u201cbeaten in the police station\u201d.", "21.

D.S. gave the names of several of the police officers involved and stated that he had not seen any injuries on the applicant. On the contrary, the applicant had seemed pleased because he had been informed that he would be charged with lesser offences than expected. D.S. also claimed that the applicant had had no complaints about his treatment.", "27. On 13 June 2006 statements were taken from two police officers, R.P. and A.K. Both claimed that they had not participated in the immediate arrest, but had entered the apartment after the members of the Special Anti-Terrorist Unit had already arrested the applicant and his friends. In the apartment they had seen several people dressed in only their underwear, being handcuffed and lying face down. They denied having seen any bruises or injuries on those arrested.", "28.

On 21 March 2007 the applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s complaint of ill-treatment of her son was rejected by the Inspector General\u2019s Service for lack of evidence of a crime.", "31. On 1 July 2007 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint with the First Municipal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office (Prvo op\u0161tinsko javno tu\u017eila\u0161tvo \u2013 \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s office\u201d) against a number of the unknown perpetrators as well as against three police officers identified only by surname.", "32. On 20 July 2007 the prosecutor\u2019s office opened an official inquiry with requests for the police to provide evidence and the names of those involved in the applicant\u2019s arrest and questioning, and an investigative judge to question the applicant. He was interviewed on 9 October 2007.", "33. On 30 November 2007 the Sector for the Internal Control of the Police identified three police officers, V.M., S.P., and Z.K., in connection with the applicant\u2019s arrest and questioning. The officers stated that no violence had ever been used against the applicant. On 27 December 2007 the prosecutor\u2019s office dropped the charges against them for lack of evidence.", "34. At the same time the case against the unidentified police officers remained open because, according to the prosecutor\u2019s office, \u201cit transpired from the evidence gathered that Krsmanovi\u0107 \u0110or\u0111e had sustained injuries while in detention\u201d (iz prikupljenih dokaza utvr\u0111eno je da je Krsmanovi\u0107 \u0110or\u0111e zadobio povrede u periodu dok mu je bio odre\u0111en pritvor). It would appear that the case is still open.", "35. After learning of that decision, on 23 January 2008 the applicant took over the criminal proceedings as a subsidiary prosecutor (o\u0161te\u0107eni kao tu\u017eilac) by requesting to have an investigation opened against V.M., S.P., and Z.K.", "36. On 21 April and 18 November 2008 the investigating judge to whom the case was assigned interviewed three doctors who worked at the prison hospital. On 15 January 2009 he also interviewed the police officers accused of ill-treatment. On 24 March 2009 he refused to open an investigation because there was not enough evidence to prove that the accused had committed the crime they were suspected of. On 23 September 2009 the pre-trial chamber of the First Belgrade Municipal Court upheld the decision of the investigating judge. The applicant appealed. On 13 April 2010 the Belgrade Appellate Court upheld that decision.", "37. On 10 July 2010 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the prosecutor\u2019s office, which was rejected on 11 October 2010.", "38. On 11 July 2010 the applicant also lodged a constitutional appeal. He complained principally about the lack of an effective investigation into the events under Articles 21, 25, 27, 29, 32, 33 and 36 of the Constitution and Articles 3, 6, 13 and 14 of the Convention. On 23 July 2013 his constitutional appeal was rejected by the Constitutional Court, whose decision was served on the applicant on 11 September 2013. The court primarily considered the applicant\u2019s complaints under Article 6 of the Convention and found them to be manifestly ill-founded. As to the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 3 of the Convention, the Constitutional Court found it to be outside its temporal jurisdiction in view of the date of entry into force of the Constitution itself. In respect of the other complaints, the Constitutional Court held, inter alia, that:", "\u201cit is not enough to allege a violation of one\u2019s rights in a constitutional appeal or list the constitutional rights that are considered to be violated and reasons for their violations based on the appellant\u2019s subjective estimation or evaluation, but to put each mentioned reason into a direct relationship with the allegedly violated constitutional right, and a violation or denial of a certain constitutional right has to be caused by an act or action that occurred before the entry into force of the Constitution. This also implies that specific and detailed reasons of the alleged violation of the constitutional right have to be specified in the constitutional appeal, because only a causal link presented in such manner may compel the Court to find a violation or denial of a certain right.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
