De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["5. The applicant was born in 1968 and is currently detained in a prison in Tbilisi.", "6. Prior to the parliamentary election of 1 October 2012, which resulted in a change of power, the applicant, one of the leaders of the then ruling party, the United National Movement (UNM), exercised, for several months in 2012, the function of Prime Minister of Georgia. Prior to that, between 2005 and 2012, he had held the post of Minister of the Interior.", "7. After the political coalition Georgian Dream had won the parliamentary election of October 2012 and formed a new government, the applicant was elected Secretary General of the UNM, which became the major opposition force in the country.", "8. Between 1 November 2012 and 21 May 2013, the date when he was charged with criminal offences and arrested (see paragraph 17 below), the applicant had made five business trips from Georgia to various foreign countries, always returning as scheduled.", "9. On 30 November 2012, when travelling from Georgia to Armenia to attend an international seminar of the European People\u2019s Party, the applicant attempted to cross the Georgian State border at Tbilisi International Airport using an allegedly fake international passport.", "10. After registering the passport in the relevant electronic database, an officer of the Border Police of the Ministry of the Interior of Georgia, Z.D., noticed a discrepancy between the photograph in the passport, which fully matched the applicant\u2019s appearance, and the other data in the travel document, including the name of \u201cLevan Maisuradze\u201d, which differed from the identity information stored about the applicant in the electronic database. The police officer returned the problematic passport to the applicant\u2019s personal assistant, requesting clarification. The assistant immediately brought from the applicant\u2019s office another passport which was issued in the latter\u2019s real name and matched all his other identification data. After checking the authenticity of that second travel document, the applicant was allowed to cross the Georgian border.", "11. The same day, 30 November 2012, a criminal investigation was launched by the Border Police of the Ministry of the Interior into the abovementioned incident. The Chief of the Border Police immediately went to Tbilisi airport to interview the officer, Z.D., who had discovered the allegedly fake passport in the applicant\u2019s possession, in person. As subsequently established by the investigation and confirmed by a number of witnesses, when present at the airport the Chief of the Border Police suddenly received a call from the applicant on his mobile phone. The latter attempted to exert pressure on the Chief by using his status and long-standing personal connections within the hierarchy of the Ministry of the Interior. The applicant demanded categorically that no inquiry be conducted with respect to the incident with the passport and that officer Z.D. never be called to testify as a witness. According to statements subsequently given to the investigation by the Chief of the Border Police, the applicant made career and personal threats and used obscene language during their telephone conversation.", "12. Interviewed on 1 and 7 December 2012 by investigators from the Ministry of the Interior with respect to the incident, the applicant denied presenting to the Border Police a passport under the name of \u201cLevan Maisuradze\u201d, and stated that he possessed only four passports, two ordinary ones and two diplomatic travel documents, all of them issued under his real name.", "13. On 13 December 2012 a new set of criminal proceedings for embezzlement and abuse of official authority were launched against the applicant and the Governor of the Kakheti Region. They both duly appeared before the Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office (\u201cthe CPPO\u201d) on the same day, and were interviewed as witnesses.", "14. On 18 January 2013 a third set of criminal proceedings was instituted at the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of the Ajarian Autonomous Republic in respect of another instance of abuse of official authority allegedly committed by the applicant.", "15. On 13 February 2013 the applicant and the Governor of the Kakheti Region were examined as witnesses in the context of the second set of the criminal proceedings.", "16. On 20 May 2013 all three of the above-mentioned sets of criminal proceedings (see paragraph 11, 13 and 14 above) were joined into one criminal case.", "17. On 21 May 2013 the applicant and the Governor of Kakheti were summoned by the prosecution authority for another interview. At the end of that examination both were arrested.", "18. The applicant\u2019s arrest was linked to a suspicion that he had engaged in vote-buying (Article 164(1) of the Criminal Code), misappropriation of another person\u2019s property (182 \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code), abuse of official authority (332 of the Code of Criminal Procedure), and breach of inviolability of another person\u2019s home (Article 160 of the Criminal Code). As confirmed by the relevant record, the arresting officer duly explained to the applicant, who was assisted by a lawyer of his choice, the nature of the above-mentioned charges against him, as well as his procedural rights. The applicant was also briefed on the reasons for his arrest. Notably, that there existed risks that he, as a particularly influential person who had held several high-ranking State offices in the past, might negatively influence the progress of the investigation, and that, having regard to his previous attempt to cross the State border with a fake travel document, he might abscond from the trial.", "19. On the same day, 21 May 2013, the applicant\u2019s wife left Georgia. A judicially authorised search of the applicant\u2019s apartment was conducted later the same day, the results of which confirmed the discovery of large sums of money in cash (see the subsequent paragraph).", "20. On 22 May 2013 the prosecutor in charge of the applicant\u2019s case applied to Kutaisi City Court for pre-trial detention of the applicant as a preventive measure. The prosecutor first gave arguments in support of the risk that the applicant would abscond. Thus, because he had held the posts of Minister of the Interior and Prime Minister of the country in the past, he had formed a broad and extensive personal network within the country and abroad. The applicant possessed two valid diplomatic passports under his real name, and those travel documents allowed him to use simplified procedures for entering any foreign country as well as other privileges reserved for diplomats. Furthermore, it appeared that the applicant also had a false passport (see paragraph 10 above). Moreover, the prosecutor continued, the fact that the applicant\u2019s spouse had hurriedly left Georgia on 21 May 2013, after the applicant had been summoned by the investigating authority, also gave rise to a suspicion that the applicant might aim to join his wife outside the country. The prosecutor also emphasised the fact that during a search of the applicant\u2019s apartment on 21 May 2013, large amounts of money in cash \u2013 54,200 euros (EUR), 33,100 United States dollars ((USD, some EUR 28,560) and 29,000 Georgian laris (GEL, some EUR 11,270) \u2013 were discovered, which fact further substantiated the suspicion that the applicant might have been preparing to flee the country.", "21. The prosecutor then enumerated arguments in support of the claim that the applicant might hamper the investigation. Again, given that the applicant had held various high-ranking State posts, he had therefore directed and supervised numerous State agents employed in various public agencies. Considering that the impugned offences were closely related to his past activities in public office, and the fact that the majority of the important witnesses had worked under the applicant\u2019s hierarchical subordination, there was a well-substantiated risk that the applicant might influence those people. The prosecutor\u2019s argument was confirmed by reference to the incident of 30 November 2012, when the applicant had managed to identify the mobile phone number of the Chief of the Border Police, placed a call and exerted pressure on the latter in a rude and obscene manner by uttering personal and career threats (see paragraph 11 above).", "22. By a decision of 22 May 2013 the Kutaisi City Court, after holding an oral hearing with the participation of both the co-accused and their lawyers, decided to release the Kakheti Governor on bail, the amount of which was fixed at GEL 20,000 (some EUR 7,770), and to remand the applicant in custody. Article 205 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was mentioned as the legal basis for imposition of the detention in the reasoning part of the decision.", "23. As to the grounds confirming the necessity of the detention measure, the Kutaisi City Court stated that it accepted the prosecution authority\u2019s arguments concerning the risks of absconding and impeding the course of the investigation (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above). Whilst acknowledging that the applicant had proved to be cooperative with the investigation by appearing for interviews, the City Court stated that he could nevertheless use his prominent social position, which emanated from the fact of his having held various high-ranking posts in the past, to hamper the investigation process. The court emphasised that the witnesses who were to be examined had been or still remained under the applicant\u2019s direct hierarchical authority and personal influence. The City Court further specifically noted in that respect that the applicant had already been suspected of an attempt to influence the specific witnesses, the Chief of the Border Police and officer Z.D., within the context of the ongoing criminal proceedings (see paragraph 11 above).", "24. In its decision of 22 May 2013, the Kutaisi City Court indicated, pursuant to Article 208 of the CCP, that a pre-trial conference would open on 15 July 2013.", "25. The applicant appealed against the decision of 22 May 2013, complaining that the imposition of the pre-trial detention had been unreasonable because the Kutaisi City Court had failed to refer to any specific evidence or arguments in support of the supposed risks of hampering the investigation or absconding the trial.", "26. By a decision of 25 May 2013, the Kutaisi Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal as ill-founded, confirming that the lower court had correctly assessed the relevant factual circumstances and applied the legal provisions.", "27. On 2 July 2013 the prosecutor asked the Kutaisi City Court to postpone the opening of the pre-trial conference until 11 September 2013. The prosecutor substantiated his application by the need for certain additional specific investigative measures to be conducted. Both the applicant, represented by three lawyers, and the co-accused Kakheti Governor agreed with that application in part. By a decision of 5 July 2013 the Kutaisi City Court granted the request in part, postponing the date until 23 August 2013.", "28. On 12 August 2013 the applicant\u2019s lawyers sought a further postponement of the pre-trial conference. They argued that the case file was voluminous and more time was needed for the preparation of the defence. The prosecutor objected, indicating that the applicant was attempting to protract the proceedings and leave less time for an examination of the case on the merits. The City Court satisfied, on 14 August 2013, the applicant\u2019s request in full, and a new date for the pre-trial conference was set for 12 September 2013.", "29. On 12 September 2013 the Kutaisi City Court opened the pre-trial conference.", "30. According to a record of a subsequent session of the pre-trial conference held on 25 September 2013, the applicant asked for his pre-trial detention to be replaced by a non-custodial measure of restraint. In support, he referred to the prosecution authority\u2019s failure to indicate any new arguments arguably capable of substantiating the risks of absconding or impeding the investigation. As additional guarantees for his appearance for trial, the applicant referred to the fact that he was the Secretary General of a major political party, that he had made a public pledge to cooperate with the authorities, and that he had never failed to appear before the investigating authorities in the past. As further revealed by an audio record of the relevant court hearing, the applicant argued that his continued detention was no longer necessary, as all the witnesses had already been questioned by the investigating authority. The prosecution authority replied that since the witnesses still had to testify before the trial court, the risk that the accused would exert undue pressure on them was still present. The authority reminded the City Court of the incident with the fake passport, when the applicant had managed to threaten a high-ranking officer of the Border Police (see paragraph 11 above).", "31. The applicant\u2019s request for the termination of the pre-trial detention was examined and rejected by the Kutaisi City Court on the same day, 25 September 2013. Thus, the court, after hearing the parties\u2019 arguments, announced its decision orally, for the audio record. As disclosed by that record, the judge briefly stated, without giving any explanation, that the \u201crequest for the termination of the pre-trial detention should be rejected\u201d.", "32. By a judgment of 17 February 2014, the Kutaisi City Court convicted the applicant of the majority of the charges brought against him. Thus, he was found guilty of vote-buying (Article 164 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code), misappropriation of another person\u2019s property in a large amount (Article 182 \u00a7\u00a7 2 (a), (d), and 3 (b) of the Criminal Code on several counts), and breach of inviolability of another person\u2019s home (Article 160 \u00a7 3 (b) of the Criminal Code). As regards the offence of abuse of official authority (Article 332 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code), it was dismissed by the court as redundant. The applicant was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment.", "33. On 21 October 2014 the Kutaisi Court of Appeal upheld the applicant\u2019s conviction of 17 February 2014 in full. According to the file as it stands to date, the applicant lodged a further appeal on points of law, and the ensuing proceedings are currently pending before the Supreme Court.", "34. According to the applicant\u2019s addendum to the case file after the communication of the present case, on 14 December 2013, at approximately 1.30 a.m., he was unexpectedly removed from his prison cell. The accompanying prison guards covered his head with a jacket, put him into a car, and drove him to an unknown destination. The journey lasted some ten minutes, after which he was escorted into a building. When he was brought inside one of the rooms the guards took the jacket off his head, and he saw two people. One of them was allegedly the Chief Public Prosecutor, O.P., and the other was the head of the prison authority, D.D.", "35. According to the applicant, the Chief Prosecutor offered him a bargain during that meeting. Notably, the applicant was invited to reveal the \u201ctruth\u201d about the circumstances surrounding the death of the former Prime Minister Zurab Zhvania on 3 February 2005 (who, according to an official version of the events, had died in a rented flat from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by an inadequately ventilated gas heater) and, in addition, to provide information about secret offshore bank accounts of the former President of Georgia. The applicant turned down the deal, describing O.P.\u2019s suggestions as a conspiracy theory and nonsense. In reply, the Chief Prosecutor allegedly threatened the applicant that his detention conditions would worsen if he did not agree to cooperate with the authorities. The applicant was returned to his prison cell at around 3 a.m.", "36. On 17 December 2013, during a public hearing before the Tbilisi City Court, which was already examining the merits of the criminal case against the applicant in the presence of the prosecuting authority and media representatives, the applicant made a statement about what had happened on 14 December 2013. He described in detail his night-time conversation with the Chief Public Prosecutor.", "37. On the same day the Prime Minister of Georgia publicly commented that the applicant\u2019s allegations of the night removal from prison for a meeting with the Chief Prosecutor were a sheer lie, that no investigation would be launched in that respect, and that the applicant should instead \u201cconsult a psychiatrist\u201d. Subsequently, paraphrasing another public person\u2019s comment, the Prime Minster made the following remark: \u201cAfter all, what was this story of abducting [the applicant] from the prison all about? Did [the Chief Public Prosecutor] rape him or what?\u2019\u201d In the same vein, the Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office issued an official statement condemning the applicant\u2019s allegations as \u201cuntrue\u201d and \u201cabsurd\u201d.", "38. On 18 December 2013 the Minister of Prisons publicly stated that \u201c[the applicant] was not taken out of the prison ... No investigation has been launched into such frivolous allegations.\u201d The Minister added that recordings made by the prison surveillance systems, which could shed light on whether or not the latter had been taken out of and returned to his cell at the specified times on 14 December 2013, could be made public only if a criminal probe was launched in respect of the applicant\u2019s allegation.", "39. On the other hand, certain other high State officials, such as the President of the Parliament and the Minister of Justice, acknowledged, in the immediate aftermath of the incident of 14 December 2013, that there was a need to launch a thorough and impartial criminal investigation into the issue. On 19 December 2013 the Public Defender of Georgia visited the applicant in prison, where they discussed in detail the incident of 14 December 2013. After the meeting, the Defender made a public statement about the necessity to launch a criminal investigation in order to clarify all the facts, and emphasised that the applicant would be ready to cooperate.", "40. On 20 December 2013 the applicant made a formal request to the Ministry of Prisons, of which the Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office and the Tbilisi City Court were also informed, for the video footage from the prison surveillance system covering the night of 14 December 2013 to be provided to his lawyer. Those recordings would prove the need for a criminal investigation into his unlawful removal from the prison on that night.", "41. On 15 January 2014 the Public Defender again called upon the authorities to investigate the applicant\u2019s allegations. On the same day the Minister of Prisons stated that the recordings from the surveillance system of the applicant\u2019s prison covering the night of 14 December 2003 could no longer be extracted as they had automatically been deleted within twentyfour hours after being recorded.", "42. On 6 March 2014 the applicant submitted a question to the Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office about whether or not a criminal investigation had been launched into the incident of 14 December 2013. On 14 April 2014 the prosecutorial authority informed the applicant that an internal probe carried out by the General Inspection Unit of the Ministry of Prisons had not confirmed the applicant\u2019s alleged irregular removal from the prison. No further details about that probe were given.", "43. On 10 May 2014 a Member of Parliament published certain documents showing that high bonuses were paid in December 2013 to a number of officers of the prison where the applicant was detained. The parliamentarian suggested that those officers were financially rewarded for their association with the applicant\u2019s removal from the cell.", "44. On 19 May 2014 L.M., a chief advisor to D.D., the Head of the Prisons Department, made a public statement confirming the truthfulness of the applicant\u2019s allegations. She stated: \u201c[E]ven a child knows that [the applicant] was taken from his prison cell by D.D.\u201d. She further stated that she had been in contact with a number of agents of the Prisons Department who had confirmed to her, in private conversation, that they had been instructed by D.D. to hide surveillance camera recordings covering the night of 14 December 2013.", "45. On the following day, 20 May 2014, D.D. dismissed L.M. from her position. A few days later, on 23 May 2014, he himself resigned from the post of head of the prison authority.", "46. The applicant submitted numerous newspaper articles containing interviews with various high-ranking officials of the current regime in the country (two successive prime ministers, various ministers, Members of Parliament from the ruling coalition, and so on) as a proof that there was politically motivated persecution against him. He also referred to a number of official statements issued by the international community, which conveyed concern over the initiation of criminal proceedings and arrests of a number of former high-ranking Government officials, including the applicant.", "47. Thus, for instance, the President of the European Commission made a public statement on 12 November 2012, after his meeting with the Prime Minister of Georgia, which included the following passage:", "\u201cThe elections in Georgia were successfully held, and they were recognised as free and fair ... Democracy is more than elections, it is the culture of political relations in democratic environment. In this respect, situations of selective justice should be avoided as they could harm the country\u2019s image abroad and weaken rule of law.\u201d", "48. The European Union High Commissioner for Foreign and Security Policy publicly declared during her visit to Georgia on 26 November 2012 the following: \u201cThe European Union calls on all sides in Georgian politics to uphold European values of democracy, freedom and the rule of law. There should be no selective justice; no retribution against political rivals. Investigations into past wrongdoings must be, and must be seen to be, impartial, transparent and in compliance with due process.\u201d", "49. As an additional proof that the current Government was engaged in persecution of its political opponent, the applicant referred to the following excerpt from a Resolution adopted by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) on 1 October 2014:", "\u201cIt has to be noted that two years on, almost the entire leadership of the former ruling party has been arrested or is under prosecution or investigation: former Prime Minister and UNM Secretary General, [the applicant], former Defence Minister, [B.A.], and former Tbilisi mayor and UNM, campaign manager, [G.U.], are in prison (pre-trial detention). The judicial authorities have charged the former President, [M.S.], and ordered pre-trial detention in absentia, as well as for former Minister of Defence, [D.K.], and former Minister of Justice, [Z.A.].\u201d", "50. On 12 May 2014 the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe published a Report on his visit to Georgia which had taken place from 20 to 25 January 2014. Included in an array of various problematic human rights issues affecting the country the Commissioner also addressed the allegations of undue criminal prosecution of members of the former ruling party, the UNM. The relevant excerpt from the Report as emphasised by the applicant, which passage made a separate reference to the incident of 14 December 2013, reads as follows:", "\u201c37. The cases of [the applicant], [B.A.], and [G.U.] \u2013 all of them members of or associated with the UNM \u2013 were discussed by the Commissioner during his visit. [The applicant] was formerly Prime Minister and Secretary General of the UNM at the time of his arrest on 21 May 2013. He has alleged that on 14 December 2013, he was taken away blindfolded from the prison by unknown individuals and brought to the Penitentiary Department of the Ministry of Corrections where he was threatened by the then Chief Prosecutor ... Human rights NGOs have called for an investigation into the foregoing allegations and expressed concerns that the internal inquiry by the Ministry of Corrections failed to clarify the situation and raised more questions, including regarding the unavailability of video footage from surveillance cameras in the prison. In this regard, the Ministry indicated to the Commissioner that due to the fact that [the applicant] made his complaint only on 17 December \u2013 three days after the alleged events \u2013 the video footage was unavailable because it was automatically overwritten every 24 hours.\u201d", "51. Then, in the relevant concluding part of the Report, the Commissioner made the following call upon the Georgian authorities with regard to the above-mentioned allegations of unduly motivated criminal proceedings:", "\u201c41. The Commissioner wishes to underline that the judicial system should be sufficiently resilient so that its proper functioning is not disrupted by the transfers of power which are characteristic of any true democracy. The persistence of allegations and other information indicative of deficiencies marring the criminal investigation and judicial processes in cases involving political opponents are a cause for concern, as this can cast doubt on the outcome of the cases concerned even when there have been solid grounds for the charges retained and the final convictions. The Georgian authorities must address these issues at the systemic level, in the interests of respecting fair trial guarantees for everyone and in enhancing public trust in the institutions responsible for upholding the law.\u201d", "52. In support of his claim of undue political motivation behind the initiation of the criminal proceedings against him, the applicant also referred to a Report published on 9 December 2014 by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) on its trial monitoring activities in Georgia. The ODIHR had started the relevant trial monitoring project in February 2013, focusing on the follow-up of fourteen sets of criminal proceedings unrelated to each other, conducted against senior officials of the previous government, which included the applicant\u2019s criminal case. After having identified, through the prism of all fourteen criminal cases, a number of shortcomings with respect to the fair trial guarantees \u2013 such as the principle of equality of arms between parties, the presumption of innocence, the perception of undue influence on the prosecution authority by the executive branch of power, and the unreasonable use of preliminary detention \u2013 the ODIHR Report made a number of recommendations to the Georgian authorities on how to improve the system of criminal justice in general.", "53. On 18 December 2014 the European Parliament adopted a Resolution on the endorsement of the Association Agreement between the European Union and Georgia. An excerpt from that Resolution, cited by the applicant himself in support of his claim, read as follows:", "\u201c[European Parliament] expresses concern that numerous officials who had served under the previous government and some members of the current opposition have been charged with criminal offences and are imprisoned or placed in pre-trial detention; expresses concern, also, about the potential, use of the judicial system to fight against political opponents, which could undermine the efforts of the Georgian authorities in the area of democratic reform; recalls that the existence of a valuable political opposition is paramount to the creation of a balanced and mature political system, to which Georgia is aspiring.\u201d", "54. Lastly, the applicant referred to the relevant excerpts from the Resolution on Abuse of Pre-trial Detention in States Parties to the European Convention on Human Rights adopted by the PACE on 1 October 2015. These passages read as follows:", "\u201c7. The following abusive grounds for pretrial detention have been observed in a number of States Parties to the European Convention on Human Rights, namely:", "7.1. to put pressure on detainees in order to coerce them into confessing to a crime or otherwise co-operating with the prosecution, including by testifying against a third person (for example the case of Sergey Magnitsky, in the Russian Federation, and certain cases of opposition leaders in Georgia, such as former Prime Minister, [the applicant]);", "7.2. to discredit or otherwise neutralise political competitors (for example, certain cases of United National Movement (UNM) leaders in Georgia); ...", "11. The root causes of the abusive use of pretrial detention include: ...", "11.4. the possibility of \u201cforum shopping\u201d by the prosecution, which may be tempted to develop different strategies to ensure that requests for pretrial detention in certain cases are decided by a judge who, for various reasons, is expected to be \u201caccommodating\u201d (for example in Georgia, the Russian Federation and Turkey).\u201d", "55. Subsequent to the communication of the present case, the applicant informed the Court for the first time that four additional sets of criminal proceedings had been launched against him. Those new criminal cases were not linked in any manner to the main set of the criminal proceedings which had served as the basis for the imposition of the pre-trial detention initially contested by the applicant in the present case (see paragraphs 3 and 8-33).", "56. In particular, on 28 May 2013 a charge of exceeding of official powers through the threat or use of force (Article 333 \u00a7 3 (b) of the Criminal Code) was brought against the applicant in relation to his role, in his capacity as Minister of the Interior, in the planning and supervision of a violent dispersal of a peaceful demonstration by police forces on 26 May 2011. By a judgment of 27 February 2014, the Tbilisi City Court, having established the fact that the applicant had directly given an order to the police forces to dislodge the demonstrators with an excessive use of force, convicted him of the offence. On 11 August 2014 the Tbilisi Court of Appeals upheld the judgment of the first-instance court, and the proceedings are currently pending, according to the applicant\u2019s latest submissions available in the case file, before the Supreme Court.", "57. On 8 March 2014 CPPO brought new charges against the applicant under Article 332 \u00a7 2 (abuse of authority by a high-ranking State official) and Article 341 (falsification of official records). That new criminal case related to the role of the applicant, in his capacity as Minister of the Interior, in the cover-up of a homicide case which had implicated a number of his close associates, high-ranking officers of the same Ministry, as well as his wife, back in 2006 (see Enukidze and Girgvliani v. Georgia, no. 25091/07, \u00a7 15 and onwards, 26 April 2011). On 20 October 2014 the Tbilisi City Court, having established that the applicant had personally contributed to perverting the course of the investigation in that homicide case, convicted the applicant of the two above-mentioned charges, and the criminal proceedings are currently pending before a court of higher jurisdiction.", "58. On 28 July 2014 the applicant was charged with a new offence under Article 333 \u00a7 3 (b) of the Criminal Code in relation to his role as Minister of the Interior, in the planning and supervision of a police raid on a private television and radio company, Imedi Media Holding, on 7 November 2007 as well as of the subsequent unlawful removal of the broadcasting licence from the company (for more details, see Akhvlediani and Others v. Georgia (dec.), no. 22026/10, 9 April 2013). Finally, on 5 August 2014 yet another charge under Article 333 \u00a7 3 (b) of the Criminal Code was brought against the applicant. He was accused of ordering a number of high-ranking police officers to arrange for ill-treatment of a Member of Parliament in retribution for insulting and libellous statements the latter had publicly proffered against the wife of the President of Georgia. The latter two sets of criminal proceedings are, according to the applicant\u2019s latest factual addendum, still pending before the trial court."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["18", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
