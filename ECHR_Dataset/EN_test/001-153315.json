The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Zagreb.", "6. On 25 April 1992 the applicant married Ms Z.J.", "7. On 9 October 1993 Z.J. gave birth to their son I.R.", "8. In December 1993 Z.J., together with their son, moved out of the flat in which she had lived with the applicant and went to live with her parents. After that she started avoiding contact with the applicant. Prior to the institution of the divorce and custody proceedings in February 1996 (see paragraphs 9-30 below) the applicant saw his son only twice, in January 1994 and in 1995 during Easter holidays. The applicant and Z.J. officially divorced by a court judgment to that effect on 12 February 2002 (see paragraphs 21-22 below).", "9. On 19 February 1996 Z.J. brought a civil action against the applicant in the Zagreb Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Zagrebu) seeking divorce, custody of, and the maintenance for their son.", "10. On 22 April 1997 the court asked the Zagreb Social Welfare Centre (Centar za socijalnu skrb Zagreb, hereafter \u201cthe local social welfare centre\u201d) to prepare a report on the family situation in the Ribi\u0107 family and submit its recommendation as to whom of the parents custody of their son should be awarded.", "11. The Government submitted that the applicant had ignored the local social welfare centre\u2019s calls to attend interviews necessary for the preparation of the report by not collecting the centre\u2019s letters to that effect from the post office. The applicant denied that allegation, noted that the Government had not substantiated it by relevant documents and invited them to do so. He further submitted that while it was true that in the period between 1993 and 2003 he had worked in Ljubljana (Slovenia) on weekdays, he had been staying in Zagreb every weekend. If there had been any problem with the service of the local social welfare centre\u2019s correspondence to him, the centre should have contacted the advocate who had represented him in the civil proceedings in question.", "12. On 7 July 1997 the applicant\u2019s and Z.J.\u2019 legal representatives agreed to temporarily suspend the proceedings (mirovanje postupka) for a period of three months with a view to reaching an amicable solution, which however did not materialise.", "13. Thus, in the further course of the proceedings, on 23 January 1998, the court decided to obtain information on the parties\u2019 income, and scheduled the next hearing for 20 April 1998 with a view to hearing the parties.", "14. However, the hearing scheduled for 20 April 1998 was adjourned because the applicant did not attend it.", "15. At the hearing held on 22 May 1998 the court again decided to hear the parties and invited Z.J. to provide information on her income, something the applicant had already done.", "16. At that hearing and in his written submission of 9 March 1999 the applicant asked the court to issue a provisional measure whereby it would provisionally regulate his contacts with his son. According to the information submitted by the parties, the court did not decide on the applicant\u2019s motion, apparently because under the legislation in force at the material time interim contact orders were in the exclusive jurisdiction of the social welfare centres as administrative authorities (see paragraph 81 below).", "17. At the hearing held on 9 October 1998 the court heard the parties and decided to obtain an opinion from an expert in psychiatry with a view to deciding on custody and access rights. However, since the applicant and Z.J. did not advance the costs of the expert opinion until seven months later, the case-file was not sent to the appointed expert institution before 11 June 1999.", "18. In the course of the preparation of the expert opinion, on 26 February 2000 the applicant met with his son, for the first time since Easter of 1995 (see paragraph 8 above). On the same date the applicant and Z.J. signed an agreement regarding the contact schedule they would propose to the court. In particular, it was agreed to propose to the court that the contacts between the applicant and his son take place in the presence of both parents for two hours on the premises specified by the local social welfare centre and in the presence of a child-welfare professional designated by the centre. In the first three months, the contacts were to take place twice a month, and thereafter every week. After a year the local social welfare centre were to assess the situation and propose further arrangements.", "19. By 3 April 2000 the designated expert institution had finalised the expert opinion, which was received by the court 11 days later. The experts\u2019 recommendation was in line with the parties\u2019 agreement of 26 February 2000, which they endorsed. The experts particularly emphasised the need for the contacts between the applicant and his son to take place in the presence of Z.J. and a child-welfare professional designated by the local social welfare centre.", "20. Since both parties objected to the expert opinion, the court held three more hearings, on 25 May and 14 and 28 September 2001 during which the court heard the psychiatrist who had prepared it. The court also obtained fresh information on the parties\u2019 income with a view to deciding on the maintenance for their son.", "21. On 26 October 2001 the Municipal Court pronounced judgment whereby it: (a) dissolved the marriage between the applicant and Z.J., (b) awarded custody of their son to Z.J., (c) granted the applicant access (contact) rights, and (d) ordered the applicant to regularly pay a certain amount of money as maintenance for his son. The relevant part of that judgment reads as follows:", "\u201cContacts between I.R. and his father Zdenko Ribi\u0107 shall take place twice a month on Saturdays for two hours for the period of two months, and after that once a week on Saturdays in the child\u2019s home in the presence of the mother and a psychologist or social worker. After a year the local social welfare centre may propose changes in the frequency [of contacts].", "...", "Since both parties repeatedly, by their non-attendance and their failure to advance the costs of the expert opinion, caused hearings to be postponed and thereby protracted the proceedings for several years ... each party should bear their own [litigation] costs.\u201d", "22. Following an appeal by both parties, on 12 February 2002 the Zagreb County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Zagrebu) quashed the first-instance judgment in so far as it concerned access rights and maintenance and remitted the case. It upheld the contested judgment in so far as it concerned divorce and custody, which part thereby became final.", "23. In the resumed proceedings, the Zagreb Municipal Court held hearings on 5 July 2002, and on 27 January, 19 March and 12 July 2003.", "24. In addition, on 26 August 2002 the court invited the local social welfare centre to prepare a report and submit its recommendation on the applicant\u2019s contact with his son. In the course of their preparation the expert team of the centre, consisting of a social worker and a psychologist, conducted several joint and separate interviews with the parties. The centre\u2019s experts also contacted the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s school and obtained an opinion on his school performance.", "25. On 7 February 2003 the local social welfare centre submitted its report and recommendation to the court. Its expert team recommended that the contacts between the applicant and his son take place every second Saturday for two hours for the period of three months, and after that every Saturday, in the presence of the mother and a child-welfare professional. However, the centre\u2019s experts suggested that the contacts should not take place in the child\u2019s home as it was not a neutral ground and could give rise to conflicts between the applicant on the one side and Z.J. and her parents on the other. Their report indicated that the applicant\u2019s son was very emotionally attached to his mother, that he did not know his father but wanted to meet him. The expert\u2019s opinion also suggested that the centre impose a child-protection measure of supervision of exercise of parental authority focusing on contacts between the applicant and his son, with a view to facilitating those contacts and assisting the parents in improving communication between them (see paragraph 59 below).", "26. At the hearing held on 19 March 2003 the court heard the parties.", "27. On 4 July 2003 the court rendered a partial judgment whereby it decided on the maintenance for the applicant\u2019s son. At the same time it decided to stay the proceedings in so far they concerned the applicant\u2019s access rights pending the outcome of the concurrent civil proceedings his former wife had instituted against him with a view to depriving him of parental responsibility (see paragraphs 77-78 below). The applicant appealed.", "28. On 3 February 2004 the Zagreb County Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal against the partial judgment on maintenance and upheld it. At the same time it quashed the first-instance decision to stay the proceedings and remitted the case. It held that the applicant had the right to maintain contact with his son as long as he was not deprived of parental responsibility.", "29. In the resumed proceedings, on 23 July 2004 the Zagreb Municipal Court adopted a judgment whereby it again granted the applicant access rights and issued a detailed contact schedule. In particular, the court decided that in the first three months the contacts between the applicant and his son were to take place every second Saturday for two hours on the premises of the local social welfare centre and in the presence of the mother and either a psychologist or social worker designated by the centre. In the next three months the contacts were to be arranged in the same manner but every Saturday, and, after another three months, in the same way but in the absence of the mother. After nine months the applicant were to exercise his access rights for four hours every Tuesday and Thursday in those weeks when the applicant\u2019s son had school in the morning, every second weekend, thirty days of summer and seven days of winter holidays, as well as every second official or church holiday.", "30. On 12 April 2005 the Zagreb County Court dismissed an appeal by Z.J. and upheld the first-instance judgment. The first-instance judgment of 23 July 2004 became final when the second-instance judgment of 12 April 2005 was served on both parties on 29 June 2005.", "31. As Z.J. refused to comply with the above judgment of 23 July 2004 and obstructed the exercise of the applicant\u2019s access rights, on 12 May 2005 he applied for enforcement of that judgment before the Zagreb Municipal Court.", "32. On 25 August 2005 that court issued a writ of execution (rje\u0161enje o ovrsi) whereby it ordered Z.J., at the risk of fine of 3,000 Croatian kunas (HRK), to allow the applicant to exercise his access rights.", "33. On 8 November 2005 the Zagreb County Court dismissed an appeal by Z.J. and upheld the writ.", "34. On 2 December 2005 the local social welfare centre informed the court that Z.J. was not complying with judgment of 23 July 2004 as she had not been bringing the applicant\u2019s son to the scheduled meetings on the centre\u2019s premises where the contacts between him and the applicant were to be arranged. The centre thus asked to court to enforce the judgment through a judicial enforcement officer.", "35. On 22 December 2005 the Zagreb Municipal Court issued a decision whereby it fined Z.J. HRK 3,000 for non-compliance with the judgment of 23 July 2004, and again ordered her, at the risk of further fine of HRK 6,000, to do so within fifteen days. Z.J. appealed but on 21 November 2006 the County Court dismissed her appeal.", "36. In the meantime, on 29 December 2005, Z.J. asked for postponement of enforcement but the Municipal Court dismissed her motion.", "37. Since Z.J. had paid the fine but nevertheless did not comply with the judgment, on 30 November 2006 the Zagreb Municipal Court accepted the applicant\u2019s motion of 27 September 2006 and issued a new writ of execution whereby it ordered a judicial enforcement officer, with the assistance of a pedagogue or a social worker employed with local social welfare centre, and a police officer, to take the applicant\u2019s son from Z.J., or any other person each time the applicant was entitled pursuant to the contact schedule to exercise his access rights, and to return him to her afterwards. Even though the court ordered that the costs of that intervention by the enforcement officer were to be borne by Z.J., it invited the applicant to advance those costs within eight days of the service of the writ.", "38. By a decision of 14 February 2007 the Municipal Court discontinued the enforcement proceedings because the applicant had not advanced the costs. The applicant then first on 7 March 2007 appealed against that decision but, on 29 March 2007 withdrew that appeal and, eventually, on 23 November 2007 withdrew his application for enforcement of 12 May 2005 (see paragraph 31 above).", "39. Accordingly, on 4 December 2007 the Zagreb Municipal Court discontinued the enforcement proceedings.", "40. Meanwhile, on 23 April 2007 the applicant again applied for enforcement of the above judgment of 23 July 2004 (see paragraph 29 above) before the Zagreb Municipal Court.", "41. On 6 December 2007 that court issued a writ of execution identical to the one of 30 November 2006 (see paragraph 37 above).", "42. On 24 December 2007 Z.J. appealed against the writ and on 2 January 2008 sought that the enforcement be postponed.", "43. On 6 February 2008 the Zagreb Municipal Court dismissed Z.J.\u2019s motion for postponement of the enforcement. On 25 February 2008 Z.J. appealed against that decision.", "44. On 28 February 2011 the Municipal Court forwarded Z.J.\u2019s appeals of 24 December 2007 and 25 February 2008 to the Zagreb County Court for a decision.", "45. By a letter of 19 April 2011 the County Court returned the case file to the Municipal Court asking it to correct certain errors in the first-instance proceedings.", "46. In the meantime, on 10 June 2009 the applicant had lodged a request for protection of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time (zahtjev za za\u0161titu prava na su\u0111enje u razumnom roku) with the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske), complaining about the length of the second set of the enforcement proceedings.", "47. On 26 September 2011 the Supreme Court found a violation of the applicant\u2019s right to a hearing within a reasonable time and: (a) awarded him HRK 5,000 in compensation, (b) ordered the Zagreb Municipal Court to correct the errors indicated in the Zagreb County Court\u2019s letter of 19 April 2011 within a month (see paragraph 45 above), and (c) ordered the Zagreb County Court to decide on Z.J.\u2019s appeals of 24 December 2007 and 25 February 2008 within three months upon receiving the case file again from the Municipal Court.", "48. By decisions of 6 March 2012 the County Court dismissed Z.J.\u2019s appeals of 24 December 2007 and 25 February 2008.", "49. Meanwhile, on 9 October 2011 the applicant\u2019s son turned eighteen and became an adult. Accordingly, the above enforcement proceedings became obsolete. Consequently, by a decision of 13 January 2013 the Municipal Court discontinued the enforcement proceedings.", "50. Parallel to the above civil proceedings concerning inter alia custody and access, the local social welfare centre acted in various ways in order to solve the family conflicts.", "51. On 20 March 2003 the local social welfare centre issued a decision whereby it provisionally granted the applicant access rights until the judgment in the above civil proceedings became final, and issued a contact schedule. In particular, the centre decided that the contacts between the applicant and his son were to take place every second Friday for one hour on its premises in the presence of a child-welfare professional for a period of three months. The decision specified that an appeal against it did not suspend its enforcement. On 14 April 2003 Z.J. appealed against that decision.", "52. On 15 April 2003 the centre informed Z.J. of the need to cooperate with it and enable the contacts between the applicant and his son. It warned her that the failure to do so may be considered as dereliction of her duties as a parent calling for more stringent child-protection measures.", "53. On 27 June 2003 the applicant applied to the centre for enforcement of its decision of 20 March 2003.", "54. However, acting on the appeal by Z.J. of 14 April 2003, on 22 September 2003 the relevant Ministry, as the second-instance administrative authority, quashed the centre\u2019s decision of 20 March 2003 and remitted the case. Accordingly, on 3 December 2003 the centre discontinued the administrative enforcement proceedings instituted by the applicant on 27 June 2003.", "55. On 30 October 2003 the applicant applied to the centre to issue a new decision on his access rights.", "56. On 22 December 2003 the local social welfare centre issued a new decision whereby it again provisionally granted the applicant access rights until the judgment in the above civil proceedings became final, and issued a new contact schedule. The decision specified that an appeal against it did not suspend its enforcement. On 19 January 2004 Z.J. appealed.", "57. On 13 July 2004 the relevant Ministry dismissed that appeal and upheld the centre\u2019s decision. Z.J. then brought an action in the Administrative Court against the Ministry\u2019s decision, which that court dismissed on 17 February 2005.", "58. In the meantime, on 15 October 2004 the applicant applied for enforcement of the local social welfare centre\u2019s decision of 22 December 2003 (see paragraph 56 above). However, it would appear that before 29 June 2005, that is, the date on which the judgment of the Zagreb Municipal Court of 23 July 2004 in the above civil proceedings became final (see paragraph 29-30 above) and thus superseded the decision the applicant sought to enforce, the local social welfare centre did not issue an enforcement order or undertake other steps to enforce its decision.", "59. Concurrently with the administrative proceedings described above (see paragraphs 51-58), the local social welfare centre conducted other administrative proceedings. In particular, by a decision of 23 December 2003 the local social welfare centre imposed a child-protection measure of supervision of the exercise of parental authority (see paragraph 82 below) for a period of one year, appointed a supervising officer and drafted a supervision programme.", "60. On 2 February 2004 the supervision officer informed the centre that Z.J. ignored her calls to arrange the first meeting between the applicant and his son in the execution of the centre\u2019s decision of 22 December 2003 (see paragraph 56 above) granting him provisional access rights. On the same day the centre adopted the opinion that the supervision measure should be discontinued as ineffective and that criminal-law measures should be set in motion instead (see paragraph 68 below).", "61. On 1 March 2004 the supervising officer submitted her report to the centre stating that no contacts between the applicant and his son had taken place since the adoption of the centre\u2019s decision of 22 December 2003 (see paragraph 56 above). At the same time she proposed that the contacts between the applicant and his son be arranged on school premises in the presence of a pedagogue.", "62. By a decision of 9 March 2004 the centre discontinued the application of the child-protection measure of supervision of the exercise of the parental authority imposed by its decision of 23 December 2003 (see paragraph 59 above). It stated that the measure was ineffective given Z.J.\u2019s lack of cooperation and that other, more stringent, child-protection measures were warranted. On 17 March 2004 Z.J. appealed against that decision.", "63. On 17 February 2005 the relevant Ministry quashed the centre\u2019s decisions of 23 December 2003 and 9 March 2004 (see paragraphs 59 and 62 above) and remitted the case.", "64. In the resumed proceedings, after having heard the applicant and Z.J. on 19 April 2005, by a decision of 13 May 2005 the centre again imposed the child-protection measure of supervision of the exercise of parental authority for a period of one year, appointed a supervising officer and prepared a programme of supervision. Z.J. appealed.", "65. On 3 June, 4 and 31 July 2005 the supervising officer informed the centre that contacts between the applicant and his son had not taken place due to Z.J.\u2019s lack of cooperation.", "66. On 29 December 2005 the relevant Ministry dismissed an appeal by Z.J. and upheld the centre\u2019s decision of 13 May 2005 (see paragraph 64 above).", "67. The child-protection measure imposed by the centre in its decision of 13 May 2005 expired on 15 May 2006. Monthly reports submitted by the supervising officer suggest that in that one-year period the applicant had not met his son.", "68. On 5 February 2004 the local social welfare centre invited the Zagreb State Attorney\u2019s Office to bring criminal charges against Z.J. for her failure to cooperate with the centre and the supervising officer, obstruction of measures issued by the centre and dereliction of her duties as a parent regarding her son\u2019s contacts with his father.", "69. On 24 March 2004 the Zagreb State Attorney\u2019s Office informed the social welfare centre that, for the time being, there were no grounds to prosecute Z.J. for the criminal offence of obstruction of the child-protection measures defined in section 215 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 84 below) because the decisions whose execution Z.J. allegedly obstructed had not become final.", "70. On 14 April 2004 the applicant filed a criminal complaint against Z.J. with the same State Attorney\u2019s Office accusing her of the same criminal offence.", "71. On 29 September 2004 the State Attorney\u2019s Office dismissed his criminal complaint. In so doing, it advanced the same reasons as those stated in its letter to the social welfare centre of 24 March 2004 (see paragraph 69 above).", "72. On 18 November 2005 the local social welfare centre informed the State Attorney\u2019s Office that decisions whose execution Z.J. had been obstructing had become final and invited the State Attorney\u2019s Office to criminally prosecute her.", "73. On 5 December 2005 the State Attorney\u2019s Office indicted Z.J. before the Zagreb Municipal Court for having been obstructing the court-ordered contacts between the applicant and his son. In particular, she was charged with the criminal offence of obstruction of child-protection measures laid down in section 215 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 84 below).", "74. By a judgment of 24 June 2008 the Municipal Court found Z.J. guilty as charged and convicted her but the judgment was subsequently quashed by the Zagreb County Court following her appeal and the case was remitted.", "75. In the resumed proceedings, by a judgment of 24 January 2011 the Zagreb Municipal Court again found Z.J. guilty as charged and sentenced her to five months\u2019 imprisonment but imposed a suspended sentence with supervision (uvjetna osuda sa za\u0161titnim nadzorom) for a period of three years provided that in that (probation) period she did not commit a further offence. In its judgment the court noted, inter alia, the following:", "\u201cThis court is deeply aware that all decisions and judgments including this one can no longer remedy the harm and evil caused by the conduct of the accused, primarily to her child, who grew up without a father ... However, it can at least emphasise that such behaviour is unacceptable and punishable ... When determining the penalty the court took into account, as aggravating circumstances, the fact that for a number of years the accused deliberately, perfidiously and deceitfully obstructed enforcement of any court decision or decision of the social welfare centre and in so doing behaved arrogantly and acted as if she was untouchable and in that way hindered a healthy and undisturbed development of her son. The court did not find any special mitigating circumstances.\u201d", "76. By a judgment of 16 March 2012 the Zagreb County Court dismissed an appeal by Z.J. and upheld the first-instance judgment.", "77. In 2002 Z.J. instituted non-contentious proceedings against the applicant before the Zagreb Municipal Court with a view to depriving him of parental responsibility for his son.", "78. By a judgment of 2 November 2004 the court dismissed Z.J.\u2019s petition. It held that her claims that the applicant had abandoned his son, grossly neglected his duties as a parent and failed to pay (regularly) for his maintenance were unfounded. In so doing it relied on the report of the local social welfare centre suggesting that it was Z.J. who had obstructed the applicant\u2019s contacts with his son."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
