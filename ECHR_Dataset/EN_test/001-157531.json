The applicant disputed that allegation. Based on the findings of this meeting, on 28 September 2011 the Ciocana Child Protection Committee concluded that A.\u2019s return to her biological family would put her life and health in danger. The Committee decided to place her in the Municipal Children\u2019s Centre and to initiate proceedings to withdraw the applicant\u2019s parental authority.", "13.

On 29 September 2011 the Ciocana Child Protection Service instituted proceedings seeking the withdrawal of the applicant\u2019s parental authority.

In a note dated 7 November 2011 the Municipal Children\u2019s Centre informed the Ciocana District Court that on 30 September 2011 A. had been transferred to the centre and that on 7 October 2011 she had been registered as a child in difficult circumstances.

The applicant had been behaving inappropriately and had an unkempt appearance. The neighbours reported that A. was not attending any pre-school institution, was generally neglected by her family, was usually dirty, and often asked for food. She also alleged that the applicant had been intoxicated when she appeared before the Child Protection Committee at the meeting on 27 September 2011.", "21. In court the applicant argued that she was a single parent and was receiving no support from anyone, including social services. She had financial difficulties, which prevented her from improving her living conditions, which were very basic. She explained that they used wood for heating and that the electricity had been cut off six months previously after an electrical accident. She contended that she cared for her child, supplying her with toys, clothes and shoes, and that A. had been provided with medical assistance by a medical institution other than the local polyclinic, submitting a copy of A.\u2019s immunisation record. She stated her wish to be with A. and her commitment to discharge her parental responsibilities. She referred to the letter of 27 October 2011 (see paragraph 31 below) as evidence that she had requested access to her child, but to no avail. She argued that the incident of 22 September 2011 had not been typical and could not constitute grounds for the removal of her parental authority. She submitted that she had left in order to work in Turkey for a period of only two weeks, after which she had returned to unofficial employment in different jobs, and supplied confirmation that after the incident she had found official employment in Moldova. She also supplied confirmation that she had obtained the documents necessary to enrol A. in a pre-school institution.

Citing neighbours, [the representative of the Child Protection service submitted that] A. was neglected by her mother and grandmother, was not enrolled in a pre-school institution, was often seen wandering around dirty and asking for food. ...[The applicant] was drunk at the meeting on 27 September 2011 of the Child Protection Committee. The Committee concluded that the child\u2019s return to the family would put her life and health in danger.", "... [The applicant] had neither visited nor asked about [A.] since her removal from home, which was evidence of [the applicant\u2019s] indifference towards [A.], and her immoral life style and inappropriate behaviour prove that she is unfit to raise a child.", "On 22 September 2011 a medical examination confirmed [the applicant\u2019s] severe alcohol intoxication. ... On 19 October 2011 the Ciocana prosecutor\u2019s office found [the applicant] guilty, under Article 63 (1) of the Code of Administrative Offences, of failing to discharge her parental duties and fined her 200 Moldovan lei (12.5 euros).", "...

[The applicant] neglected her parental duties, did not appear in court to object, did not take care of the child, did not provide material or emotional support, and had a negative influence on the child through her immoral conduct.\u201d", "25. The applicant appealed, arguing, inter alia, that she had been in legitimate employment since 4 October 2011, was making significant efforts to improve her life and wished to be with A. She referred to the evidence in the file that she had repeatedly attempted to visit her daughter but had been allowed to do so on only two occasions. She referred to the statements of a social worker before the court, according to which there had not previously been any reason to remove the child from the family or to withdraw the applicant\u2019s parental authority and no family support measures had been undertaken. The applicant submitted that she had not attended the last hearing due to health problems.", "26. In the appellate proceedings, the representative of the Ciocana Child Protection Service stated that the applicant had been warned on several occasions that she needed to bring order to her house. She also submitted that A. had described to social services \u201chorrifying\u201d (\u201cde groaz\u0103\u201d) moments experienced with her mother, entire days spent without eating anything and that she had expressed her wish not to be returned to her mother.", "27.

The applicant appealed again, arguing, inter alia, that her rights under Article 8 of the Convention had been violated. She submitted that in 2012, while the proceedings were ongoing, she had cleaned up her house and improved the living conditions. She submitted that she had regularly visited A. at the Municipal Children\u2019s Centre and had brought parcels for her. She denied having been intoxicated at the meeting on 27 September 2011 of the Child Protection Committee and noted that no evidence to support this allegation had been presented. She agreed that, in the light of her difficult material situation, A.\u2019s placement was an appropriate solution if applied in conjunction with measures to provide her with the necessary support, with a view to reuniting the family as soon as possible. She did not agree that the withdrawal of her parental authority was a proportionate measure under Article 8 of the Convention.", "29. On 8 May 2013 the Supreme Court of Justice upheld the previous judgments for identical reasons. That judgment was final.", "30. The applicant complained to the Ciocana prosecutor\u2019s office about A.\u2019s removal from her home on 22 September 2011. On 7 October 2011 the Ciocana prosecutor\u2019s office informed her that A. had been lawfully removed from home and sent to the hospital for medical examination, given that on 22 September 2011 the Ciocana police officers had found the applicant and her mother intoxicated and aggressive, their house in an unsanitary condition and the child A. hungry and looking unkempt. The applicant was informed that A. had been placed in the Municipal Children\u2019s Centre under the care of the Ciocana Child Protection Service and that proceedings had been instituted on 29 September 2011 to withdraw her parental authority.", "31. On 27 October 2011 the applicant submitted a request to visit A., stating that she had not been kept informed about A.\u2019s fate and that all her previous verbal enquiries had been refused.

In a letter dated 17 January 2013 the head of the Municipal Children\u2019s Centre stated that the Ciocana Child Protection Service had placed A. in the care of the centre on 30 September 2011 and had prohibited any visits by the applicant until the end of the court proceedings. The letter confirmed that the applicant had requested visits. Even though her requests had been refused, the applicant had managed to see her child on 1 and 12 August 2012. During the winter holidays, she had brought several parcels with sweets and toys and had asked for further meetings. The applicant had been redirected to the Ciocana Child Protection Service to obtain an authorisation to visit A. before the end of the court proceedings.", "33. In a letter addressed to the Municipal Child Protection Service dated 22 August 2013, the Ciocana Child Protection Service submitted that it was inappropriate to examine the applicant\u2019s request of 1 August 2013 to visit A. because the applicant\u2019s parental authority had been withdrawn, the child was to be placed under a relative\u2019s guardianship and it was for that guardian to decide on the frequency of contact between A. and her biological mother.", "34. On 31 October 2013 H., an aunt, was appointed as A.\u2019s guardian and the beneficiary of her child-care allowance. The applicant\u2019s requests to visit A. were refused by H. on the grounds that she no longer had any parental rights.", "35.
