The record did not list the members of the Civil Division of the Supreme Court that adopted the opinion. According to the applicant, Judge D.I. was a member of the Civil Division that adopted the opinion.", "9. On 26 April 2006 the SJC asked the plenary of the Supreme Court, under section 21 of the State Judicial Council Act of 1992 (\u201cthe 1992 Act\u201d, see paragraph 24 below), to draw up a report on the issue of whether the applicant\u2019s dismissal from the office of judge would be justified.", "10.

On 26 February 2007 a hearing was held before the SJC Commission for determination of professional misconduct by a judge (\u041a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0443\u0442\u0432\u0440\u0434\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0443\u0434\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0444\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430, hereinafter \u201cthe Commission\u201d), set up under section 58 of the 2006 Act (see paragraph 25 below). V.G. was not a member of the Commission. Both the applicant, who was represented by legal counsel, and V.G. submitted their arguments verbally. The Commission also took into account the opinions of the Civil Division and the plenary of the Supreme Court. On 28 February 2007 it drew up a report, which it communicated to the SJC.", "14. On 14 March 2007 the plenary of the SJC, which included only ten of its members, namely eight judges elected by their peers, as well as the then Minister of Justice and Judge D.I., who were ex officio members of the SJC (see Amendment XXVIII to the Constitution, paragraph 23 below), dismissed the applicant from the office of judge for professional misconduct. The SJC found that she had wrongly applied procedural and material law in civil case no. IV P.br. 2904/01, which she had decided out of the established order in which cases should have been dealt with. The dismissal decision referred to the request submitted by the State AntiCorruption Commission and further was based on evidence adduced at the hearing before the Commission, including the opinions of the Civil Division and the plenary of the Supreme Court.", "15. The applicant challenged that decision at second instance, namely before an appeal panel formed within the Supreme Court (\u201cthe Appeal Panel\u201d). Such panels were set up on an ad hoc basis in each separate case. As specified in section 60 of the 2006 Act (see paragraph 25 below), the Appeal Panel was composed of nine judges, of whom three were Supreme Court judges, four Appeal Court judges and two judges from the court of the applicant. On 8 May 2007 the Appeal Panel dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal and upheld the SJC\u2019s decision. The Appeal Panel included Judge L.\u0160., who had adjudicated in another case allegedly related to case no. IV P.br. 2904/01. According to the applicant, her request for the withdrawal of Judge L.\u0160., a copy of which was not produced, was to no avail.", "16. On 19 December 2007 the Constitutional Court rejected (\u043e\u0442\u0444\u0440\u043b\u0430) a constitutional appeal in which the applicant claimed that her dismissal had violated her freedom of conscience, freedom of thought and freedom of public expression. As regards the dismissal, the Constitutional Court found that it had no jurisdiction to review the lawfulness of the SJC\u2019s decision. As to whether the applicant\u2019s dismissal affected her freedom of expression, the court held that a distinction had to be made between exercising the office of judge and that particular freedom. It ruled that the office of judge entailed the right and duty to adjudicate in accordance with the law, and that that right and duty did not form part of the rights and freedoms on which it had competence to decide under the Constitution (\u0423.\u0431\u0440.145/2007).", "17. The applicant submitted copies of several articles published between April and December 2006 in the daily newspapers Vreme and Dnevnik.", "18.
