The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219.", "7. The Anti-Corruption Department of the Prosecutor\u2019s Office (\u201cthe DNA\u201d) started a criminal investigation against the applicant, his wife and three businessmen on suspicion of repeated corruption offences committed in his capacity as mayor of Cluj Napoca.", "8. The prosecutor sought authorisation for the interception of the applicant\u2019s telephone calls. The transcripts of the intercepted telephone calls were admitted as evidence against the applicant.", "9. On 9 November 2011 police officers belonging to the DNA carried out a search at the applicant\u2019s home. They carried out another search at the applicant\u2019s office at Cluj Napoca Town Hall.", "10. The applicant was taken to the DNA\u2019s Cluj headquarters on the basis of a summons to appear before the investigative body.", "11. Newspaper and television crews were present and the events were given widespread media coverage.", "12. At about 8.50 p.m. on the same day the prosecutor ordered the applicant\u2019s remand in custody.", "13. The applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention was ordered by an interlocutory judgment delivered the next day by the Cluj Court of Appeal. The court reasoned that it was necessary to stop the criminal activity of the applicant, who was allegedly preparing to commit a new corruption offence. The court also referred to the seriousness and the continuous nature of the offences. It stressed that the applicant had acted in his capacity as mayor when he had allegedly committed the offences. It concluded that the public would be shocked if the applicant were to be released. In assessing the concrete danger to public order if the applicant were released from detention, the court stressed that the offences had allegedly been committed over a long period of time (starting in 2009, when he had been appointed mayor, until the time of his arrest), that they were repetitive and that the perpetrator was a mayor in charge of protecting legal order. The court pointed out that as the applicant\u2019s wife was under investigation, the applicant having used her law firm to cash the money received as bribes, his release from prison would allow him to influence her position. It concluded that his release from detention would intimidate other persons in possession of information relevant for the investigation.", "14. The applicant appealed. On 21 November 2011 the High Court of Cassation and Justice upheld the above judgment, holding that there were strong indications from the criminal investigation file that the accused had committed the crimes.", "15. The applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention was regularly extended by interlocutory judgments of the Cluj Court of Appeal.", "16. The court reasoned that the extensions were justified on account of the nature and severity of the offences for which the applicant was under investigation, and the fact that he might obstruct the course of justice by intimidating possible witnesses and the persons who had lodged complaints against him.", "17. The applicant lodged appeals against the interlocutory judgments; all the appeals were dismissed by final decisions of the High Court of Cassation and Justice.", "18. The applicant lodged several applications for his release from prison under judicial supervision. He mainly emphasised that he had a stable family, two minor children and an unblemished reputation. He also pointed out that he had been accused of non-violent crimes and had no criminal record.", "19. The Cluj Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s requests on the grounds that the evidence in the file pointed to a strong likelihood that he had committed the corruption-related offences. It held that such offences might attract a prison sentence longer than four years. It also held that releasing the applicant would give rise to a real danger to public order, given the circumstances in which the acts had been committed, and their consequences and social impact.", "20. The applicant appealed, pointing out that his personal situation had changed, in that he was no longer the mayor of Cluj. The appeal court\u2019s decisions were upheld by the High Court of Cassation and Justice.", "21. On 30 November 2011 the investigation against the applicant was extended in connection with other offences allegedly committed by him, namely trading in influence, complicity in and incitement to money laundering, and complicity in and incitement to forgery.", "22. On 22 December 2011 the prosecutor issued an indictment concerning five co-accused, including the applicant and his wife, and the case was registered with the Cluj Court of Appeal. The applicant was charged with passive corruption, and repeated complicity in and incitement to money laundering and forgery.", "23. Following a request lodged by the applicant, the High Court of Cassation and Justice decided on 20 February 2012 to transfer the file to the T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 Court of Appeal in order to avoid any possible partiality on the part of the judges.", "24. According to the latest information, the criminal proceedings are still pending.", "25. Excerpts from conversations between the applicant and other defendants or third parties, which had been obtained through telephone tapping during a criminal surveillance operation conducted prior to the criminal prosecution, were subsequently published in several newspapers before the applicant and his co-accused had been committed for trial.", "26. Even the headlines of the articles published in the press during that period referred to the fact that they contained excerpts of the recorded conversations. Thus on 16 December 2011, the newspaper Evenimentul zilei published an article with the headline, \u201cExclusive: Shocking revelations in the Apostu file. The names of all the persons under investigation and new excerpts from the telephone conversations. Evidence that M. Apostu received clothes as a bribe\u201d (Exclusiv: Dezv\u0103luiri tari din Dosarul Apostu. Surprize mari: numele tuturor celor cerceta\u021bi \u0219i intercept\u0103ri noi. Dovada c\u0103 M. Apostu lua \u0219pag\u0103 \u00een haine).", "27. On 16 November 2011 the newspaper Cancan published an article with the headline, \u201cExcerpts of intercepted phone conversations: Sorin Apostu, the mayor of Cluj, acknowledged that he had at home three telephones with pre-paid cards, in order not to be intercepted\u201d (Stenograme: Sorin Apostu, primarul Clujului, recunoa\u0219te c\u0103 avea \u00een cas\u0103 trei telefoane cu cartele prepl\u0103tite, ca s\u0103 nu poat\u0103 fi interceptate).", "28. On the same day another article containing excerpts of the applicant\u2019s recorded telephone conversations was published on the website of the newspaper National. It started with the following statement: \u201cPure coincidence, the excerpts of the telephone conversations offered for publication in the investigation of mayor Sorin Apostu for corruptionrelated offences stops, with suspense, exactly when the Romanian Prime Minister enters the scene\u201d.", "29. The publication of excerpts from the applicant\u2019s recorded telephone conversations continued after the applicant had been committed for trial.", "30. Other pieces of evidence from the prosecution file were likewise published and commented on in the press. On 18 December 2011 the newspaper Ora de Cluj published an article with the headline, \u201cComplete document. The reasoning of the interlocutory judgment ordering the pretrial detention of mayor Sorin Apostu and businessman C. S.\u201d (Document integral. Motivarea sentin\u021bei de arestare a primarului Sorin Apostu \u0219i a omului de afaceri C. S.).", "31. Several press articles contained excerpts of telephone conversations between the applicant and persons not involved in the criminal proceedings. On 5 February 2012 Ora de Cluj published an article with the headline, \u201cInterception. Three-way conversation: businessman S. D., mayor Sorin Apostu and driver J.\u201d", "32. Many of the press articles referred to aspects of the applicant\u2019s private life without any connection to the criminal proceedings instituted against him. They were based on information found in his criminal file. On 6 February 2012 the newspaper Cancan published an article with the headline, \u201cJuicy details from the private life of mayor Sorin Apostu! The mayor of Cluj, romance with a subordinate\u201d. Only a few days later, on 10 February 2012, the daily newspaper Evenimentul zilei published an article about a search carried out at the home of the mayor\u2019s subordinate with the headline, \u201cBombshell in the \u2018Apostu\u2019 file: five-hour search at home of his supposed sweetheart\u201d.", "33.
