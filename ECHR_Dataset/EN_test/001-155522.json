The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "4. During 1991 and 1992 Serbian para-military forces gained control of about one third of the territory of Croatia and proclaimed the so-called \u201cSerbian Autonomous region of Krajina\u201d (Srpska autonomna oblast Krajina, hereinafter the \u201cKrajina\u201d). The applicants\u2019 father, D.R., lived in Selakova Poljana, a village situated in the Krajina. At the beginning of August 1995 the Croatian authorities announced a campaign of military action with the aim of regaining control over the Krajina. The action was codenamed \u201cStorm\u201d and lasted from 4 to 7 August 1995. Before that action, the vast majority of the population of the Krajina had fled Croatia, initially for Bosnia and Herzegovina, but later many of them went to live in Serbia. Some returned to Croatia after the war. The number of people who fled is estimated at between 100,000 and 150,000.", "5.

On 29 March 2002 the police interviewed the second applicant, who said that a certain M.M. had been staying with her father in Selakova Poljana during the military action \u201cStorm\u201d and that M.M. had told her that on 15 August 1995 her father had gone to his neighbours\u2019 estate to feed their pigs. M.M. had heard him yelling: \u201cYou thieves, why are you stealing?\u201d, followed by three gunshots. M.M. had run away after that and had no knowledge what had happened to the applicants\u2019 father. D.Se. had told the second applicant that the applicants\u2019 father had been buried under a beech tree in his courtyard.
