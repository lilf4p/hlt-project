The applicant, Mr Ethem Sakin, is a Turkish national, who was born in 1961 and is currently serving a prison sentence in the Bolu TType Closed Prison. He is represented before the Court by Mr C. Yetkiner, a lawyer practising in Istanbul.", "2. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) are represented by their Agent.", "3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "4. On 4 January 2010 the applicant was taken into pre-trial detention at the Bilecik M-Type Closed Prison (\u201cBilecik Prison\u201d), pending the criminal proceedings against him on a charge of murder. He was initially placed in a smoking cell (ko\u011fu\u015f, a multi-occupancy living unit) reserved for inmates in pre-trial detention only.", "5. On an unspecified date in 2011 the Bilecik Assize Court found the applicant guilty on three counts of murder. The applicant appealed against that judgment. There is no further information in the case file as regards the outcome of the appeal proceedings.", "6. According to the information and documents provided by the Bilecik Prison administration, the applicant changed cells a total of seven times during his detention at Bilecik Prison between 4 January 2010 and 26 December 2012. The changes were all effected at the applicant\u2019s request. It appears that two of those changes were made to accommodate his wish to stay in a non-smoking cell, and the remaining changes were made following conflicts with his cell-mates. It further appears that while some of the cells he stayed in were allocated exclusively to inmates in pre-trial detention, others accommodated both those in pre-trial detention and convicts.", "7. On 20 March 2012 the applicant sent a letter to the General Directorate of Prisons and Detention Centres of the Ministry of Justice, requesting his transfer to another prison. He argued that he was not safe in the Bilecik Prison, where he had many enemies. He also mentioned in the same letter that as a non-smoker he was sharing a cell with smokers, and that there were also convicts in his cell.", "8. By a letter dated 9 May 2012 the General Directorate of Prisons and Detention Centres informed the Bilecek public prosecutor\u2019s office that the applicant\u2019s allegations regarding his safety in prison had been found to be groundless. The applicant could, therefore, continue to serve his sentence in conditions \u201csuitable to his status\u201d.", "9. On 1 and 8 January 2013 the applicant sent letters to the Ministry of Justice and the Human Rights Inquiry Committee of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (\u201cthe Human Rights Inquiry Committee\u201d), respectively, alleging that the warden and some other officers at the Bilecik Prison had applied psychological pressure on him. The applicant also complained in his letters about the problem of accommodating smokers with non-smokers and detainees with convicts in the same cells.", "10. On 11 February 2013 the Human Rights Inquiry Committee informed the applicant that his letter had been communicated to the Bilecik office of the General Directorate of Prisons and Detention Centres.", "11. In the meantime, on 26 December 2012 the applicant had been transferred to the \u00c7anakkale E-Type Closed Prison (\u201c\u00c7anakkale Prison\u201d) on disciplinary grounds. The applicant claimed that at the \u00c7anakkale Prison he had been placed in a cell measuring 4.5 by 4.5 metres, with eleven other inmates. According to the information provided by the Government, however, the cell where the applicant stayed measured 5.7 by 5 metres and accommodated nine other inmates.", "12. On 30 May 2013 the applicant sent a letter to the General Directorate of Prisons and Detention Centres to complain about the cramped living conditions at the \u00c7anakkale Prison.", "13. In its reply dated 18 June 2013, the General Directorate of Prisons and Detention Centres informed the applicant that the \u00c7anakkale Prison had a maximum capacity of 704 prisoners, but that it had accommodated only 647 prisoners at the material time. The General Directorate added that two hundred and seven new penal facilities would be set up in the next five years, following which prisoners would be accommodated in more favourable conditions.", "14. Upon receiving the information provided by the General Directorate of Prisons and Detention Centres, on 27 June 2013 the applicant wrote a letter of reply, claiming that the figures provided did not reflect the real capacity of the prison, but the overinflated capacity that resulted from the use of triple bunk beds.", "15. In the meantime, on 11 and 24 June 2013 the applicant had sent similar complaint letters to the \u00c7anakkale Prison Monitoring Board, which in its response of 9 July 2013 informed the applicant that his complaints would be taken into consideration at their next visit to the prison in question.", "16. It appears that on 30 July 2013 the \u00c7anakkale Prison Monitoring Board visited the \u00c7anakkale Prison and met with the applicant. In its letter dated 3 September 2013, the Monitoring Board informed the applicant that his complaints had been taken into consideration and that they would be communicated to the Ministry of Justice in its quarterly interim report.", "17. In the meantime, on 19 August 2013 the applicant had been transferred to the Kocaeli T-Type Closed Prison (no.1) (\u201cKocaeli Prison\u201d) following his request to be closer to his family.", "18. On 23 August 2013 the applicant lodged an individual application with the Turkish Constitutional Court (\u201cthe Constitutional Court\u201d), by post, to complain about the overcrowding problem at the \u00c7anakkale Prison.", "19. By a letter dated 29 August 2013, the Registry of the Constitutional Court informed the applicant that his application could not be registered because he had failed to comply with the procedural rules on the submission of applications set out in section 47(1) of Law no. 6216 on the Establishment and Rules of Procedure of the Constitutional Court of Turkey and section 63 of the Internal Regulations of the Constitutional Court (Anayasa Mahkemesi \u0130\u00e7t\u00fcz\u00fc\u011f\u00fc), which stipulated that individual applications had to be lodged directly with the Constitutional Court in person, or through local courts or representations abroad. Applications submitted by post would not, therefore, be accepted.", "20. On an unspecified date the applicant was transferred to the Bolu TType Closed Prison.", "21. Section 4 of Law no. 4675 on Enforcement Judges lays down the duties of Enforcement Judges as follows:", "\u201c1. To examine and resolve complaints concerning the admission of convicts and detainees to penal institutions and detention centres, [their] placement, accommodation, heating and clothing, feeding, hygiene, [their] medical examination and treatment for the protection of their physical and mental health, [their] relations with the outside world, ... and other such activities.", "2. To examine and resolve complaints concerning the execution of the convicts\u2019 sentences, ... [their] transfer, ...", "...", "4. To examine the reports prepared and communicated by the monitoring boards of penal institutions and detention centres on their observations on the penal institutions and detention centres falling under their jurisdiction, and to rule on any complaints.\u201d", "22. Section 5 of Law no. 4675, governing the application procedure to the enforcement judge, provides as follows:", "\u201c...", "Complaint[s] may be lodged directly with the enforcement judge by way of a petition, or through the intermediary of the office of the public prosecutor or the administration of the penal institution [or] detention centre. Applications lodged other than with the enforcement judge shall be transmitted to the latter at once and within three days at the most. Complaints made orally shall be recorded and a copy [of the record] shall be given to the applicant.", "...\u201d", "23. In accordance with section 6(5) and (6), an objection may be lodged against a decision of an enforcement judge with the local assize court.", "24. The Government submitted fourteen examples of decisions delivered by the Constitutional Court concerning individual applications lodged by prisoners from different prisons. The decision delivered by the Constitutional Court in application no. 2013/2025 is particularly noteworthy on account of its pertinence to the present application. The application in question was lodged on 25 September 2012, only two days after the entry into force of the new remedy before the Constitutional Court. The applicant prisoner complained, inter alia, of the unlawful practices of the prison administration, including placing him in accommodation with smokers despite the fact that he suffered from asthma. The Court observes that the prisoner\u2019s complaints regarding the unlawful practices of the prison administration, including placing him in accommodation with smokers, were declared inadmissible by the Constitutional Court for non-exhaustion of the available remedies, on account of the prisoner\u2019s failure to bring his complaints before an enforcement judge."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
