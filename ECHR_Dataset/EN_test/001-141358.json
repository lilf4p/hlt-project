SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Ann Power-Forde;Ganna Yudkivska;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Mark Villiger;Paul Lemmens", "TEXT": ["1. The first applicant, Mr Guy Bolek, was born in 1989 and the second applicant, Ms Therese Wengo, was born in 1986. The second applicant has a daughter, the third applicant, who was born in 2007. The son of the first and the second applicants, the fourth applicant, was born in May 2012; both parents are his guardians. All the applicants are Congolese nationals and are currently in Sweden. They are represented by Mr P. Varga, a lawyer practising in Stockholm.", "2", "3. The first applicant applied for asylum and a residence permit in Sweden on 11 July 2007. Before the Migration Board (Migrationsverket) he stated the following. He was born and raised in Kinshasa. He had been politically active in the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (MLC) and had worked for the politician Jean-Pierre Bemba. He had received constant threats from supporters of Joseph Kabila. His father had been a colonel in Mobutu\u2019s army but had later joined Jean-Pierre Bemba\u2019s own militia. His father had died in an ambush by Joseph Kabila\u2019s soldiers in March 2007 in Kinshasa. On 27 March 2007 Kinshasa\u2019s governor had announced that everyone who had worked for Jean-Pierre Bemba would be killed and, on the same day, Joseph Kabila\u2019s soldiers had come to his home. His sister had been at home and she had been beaten by the soldiers. Following this, he had fled to Brazzaville and stayed there for two months. When he had returned to Kinshasa and his apartment, everything had been destroyed. He had heard soldiers coming for him but he had managed to flee. A child had found a passport which he had manipulated in order to be able to travel to Sweden.", "4. On 18 June 2008 the Migration Board rejected the request. It found that the first applicant had not substantiated his identity. The Board then considered that his asylum story was marred by credibility issues. For example, he had been unable to state when the elections had been held in 2006. He had also been unaware of the fact that the MLC held several ministerial posts in the government. The Board found that the first applicant had failed to show that he risked persecution in the DRC because of his political activities and, consequently, he was not in need of protection in Sweden.", "5. The first applicant appealed to the Migration Court (Migrationsdomstolen), maintaining his claims.", "6. On 27 May 2009 the Migration Court rejected the appeal. On the same grounds as the Board, the court found that there were reasons to question the first applicant\u2019s statements regarding his political activities. The court also referred to relevant country information and observed that there was nothing to suggest that active members of the opposition risked illtreatment by the authorities because of their political engagement. The court concluded that the first applicant had not substantiated that he risked persecution in the DRC because of his political activities and that he had not shown that he was in need of international protection.", "7. It appears that the first applicant did not appeal to the Migration Court of Appeal (Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen). Hence, the expulsion order became enforceable.", "8. In September 2009 the first applicant requested the Migration Board to reconsider its previous decision, however without invoking any new grounds. The Board rejected the request and, upon appeal, the Migration Court upheld the Board\u2019s decision in full. On 27 October 2009, the Migration Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal.", "9. In January 2013 the first applicant again requested the Migration Board to reconsider its previous decisions. He relied on his ties to the second, third and fourth applicants and stated that he had met the second applicant on New Year\u2019s Eve 2010. They had moved in together in 2011 and the fourth applicant had been born in 2012. He had been responsible for the care of the fourth applicant since the second applicant suffered from mental health problems. In November 2011 he had also, to some extent, taken care of the third applicant when the second applicant had been in hospital.", "10. On 28 January 2013 the Migration Board considered that no new circumstances had been presented which could justify granting the first applicant a residence permit. The Board found that the first applicant had not shown that his relationship with the second applicant was serious. Furthermore, it noted that he had not substantiated his identity. As regards the family ties invoked, the Board found that the situation for the second, third and fourth applicants was not such as to make the expulsion of the first applicant unreasonable. Thus, no grounds had emerged to stay the enforcement of the expulsion order. However, the Board reminded the first applicant of the possibility of having his application for a residence permit, based on family ties, examined at a Swedish mission abroad as well as the possibility to submit the application electronically and ask that it be given priority. In conclusion, the Board considered that there was no reason to deviate from the general rule that an application for a residence permit based on family ties was to be submitted before the alien enters the country. No appeal lay against the Board\u2019s decision.", "11. On 25 February 2013 the first applicant submitted a certificate from Eker\u00f6 municipality, dated 19 February 2013, regarding the fourth applicant. It stated, inter alia, that the expulsion of the first applicant would affect adversely the ties between him and his son and that the second applicant would be unable to take care of their son on her own.", "12. The Migration Board considered this as a request for reconsideration of the first applicant\u2019s case but found that no new circumstances had been presented which could justify granting him a residence permit. No appeal lay against the Board\u2019s decision.", "13. Yet another request for reconsideration was rejected by the Migration Board on 8 May 2013.", "14. The second applicant applied for asylum and a residence permit in Sweden on 26 April 2005. Before the Migration Board she stated the following. She was born in Kisangani. Her parents and siblings had been killed by Kabila\u2019s army in the summer of 1999. After having lived on the streets for six months, she had gone to Kinshasa where she had lived as a street child for three years. Subsequently, a man who had been a tenant at her family\u2019s home had taken her to his own family. She had lived with them until she had left the DRC. During this time, her mental health had deteriorated, partly due to her previous experiences, and partly due to her fear that she would be identified and killed by Kabila\u2019s soldiers. Soldiers used to come looking for her at this place five times a week for approximately two years.", "15. On 22 November 2006 the Migration Board rejected the request. It first found that the second applicant had not substantiated her identity but considered it credible that she came from the DRC. Turning to the second applicant\u2019s individual claims, the Board noted that she had lived in Kinshasa from 2000 until 2005. The Board did not question that the second applicant\u2019s parents and siblings had been killed but found her fear of being identified as a witness to these acts greatly exaggerated. It observed that she had been thirteen years old at the time, that she had not been present when her family was killed and that she had subsequently stayed in the DRC for six years. Moreover, the Board did not consider it credible that soldiers had come looking for her five times a week for two years. In conclusion, the Board found that the second applicant had not substantiated that she was in need of international protection. There were no other grounds for granting her a residence permit in Sweden.", "16. On 16 January 2008 the second applicant applied for asylum and a residence permit in Sweden for her daughter, the third applicant. The third applicant made no individual asylum claims. Her father, X, had a permanent residence permit in Sweden.", "17. On 20 March 2008 the Migration Board rejected the request. It first noted that a paternity investigation had shown that X was not the third applicant\u2019s father. Instead, Y was found to be her father. He was a Congolese man whose asylum claims had been rejected by the Migration Board and the Migration Court. The Board then noted that the third applicant\u2019s asylum claims were the same as her mother\u2019s and that they had already been examined by the Board. The Board considered that there was no reason to deviate from the assessments made in the second applicant\u2019s case. There were no other grounds for granting the third applicant a residence permit in Sweden.", "18. In an official note by the Migration Board, dated 10 October 2008, the following was stated. On 27 August 2008 the second applicant had been admitted to hospital for psychiatric care. Following this, the third applicant had been placed in foster care. On 2 October 2008 the second applicant had been discharged from hospital. She had moved to a social services home, where her ability to take care of the third applicant was being assessed. The social services could not give information about when this assessment would be completed, but it was considered that the second applicant was unable, at that time, to take care of the third applicant without supervision.", "19. The second applicant subsequently made several unsuccessful requests to the Migration Board for reconsideration of her case, during which she stated, inter alia, that she was suffering from recurring suicidal thoughts and that, if she were to be expelled to the DRC, it would amount to a return to a life of homelessness, persecution, torture and other inhuman treatment.", "20. In May 2010 the second applicant again requested the Migration Board to reconsider her case. She maintained her previous claims and added that she had been admitted to hospital for long periods of time and that she was in need of round-the-clock care. It would not be possible to expel her to the DRC without giving her anaesthetics or strong sedatives, which constituted a permanent impediment to her and the third applicant\u2019s expulsion. The second applicant submitted several medical certificates concerning herself and the third applicant.", "21. On 28 May 2010 the Migration Board decided to grant the second and the third applicants permanent residence permits in Sweden. The Board took into account the third applicant\u2019s health status and age and concluded that there were now impediments to expelling her to the DRC. Therefore, she and the second applicant were to be granted permanent residence permits.", "22. On 6 September 2012 the Migration Board decided to grant the fourth applicant a permanent residence permit in Sweden on the basis of the ties to the second applicant.", "23. The basic provisions mainly applicable in the present case, concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in Sweden, are laid down in the 2005 Aliens Act (Utl\u00e4nningslagen, 2005:716). It defines the conditions under which an alien can be deported or expelled from the country, as well as the procedures relating to the enforcement of such decisions. See Imamovic v. Sweden ([dec.], no. 57633/10, 13 November 2012) for a substantive account of the relevant provisions of this Act.", "24. On 1 July 2010 Chapter 5, Section 18, was amended by the following addition: \u201cWhen assessing what is reasonable under the second paragraph, point 5, particular attention shall be paid to the consequences for a child of being separated from its parent, if it is clear that a residence permit would have been granted if the application had been examined before entry into Sweden.\u201d According to the preparatory works, this means that the alien should fulfil all requirements for a residence permit such as, inter alia, holding a valid passport, verified identity and strong family ties (Government Bill 2009/10:137, p. 17).", "25. Chapter 12, Section 18, was also amended on 1 July 2010 by the following addition: \u201cWhen assessing under the first paragraph, point 3, if there is another special reason for a decision not to be executed, particular attention shall be paid to the consequences for a child of being separated from its parent, if it is clear that a residence permit would have been granted ... if the application had been examined before entry into Sweden.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
