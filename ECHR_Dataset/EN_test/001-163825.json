In his letters to the Court the applicant stated that he had been detained in overcrowded cells in Rahova Prison. He had had to share a cell measuring twenty-four square metres with nine other detainees. The furniture and the ten beds in the cell had taken up part of the available living space. Consequently, each detainee had been limited to only half a square metre of living space.", "11. The applicant stated that, even though he was a non-smoker and had been assigned to a non-smoking cell, the prison authorities had also detained inmates who smoked all the time in that cell. He had complained to the prison authorities about it, but they had ignored his complaints. According to him, this problem had lasted until 30 April 2013.", "12. The applicant also stated that some of the detainees who had occasionally shared the cell with him had had contagious diseases, such as hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or had been drug addicts. Also, some of them had suffered from psychological problems and the prison authorities had been aware of their medical conditions. These detainees had either represented a hazard for the other inmates in the cell, or had not allowed them to rest properly.", "13. The applicant further stated that warm water in the shower had only been available two days a week for ninety minutes for all ten detainees in the cell. Also, during the summer, running water had only been available six hours a day and not at all during the night, even if the detainees had needed to use the toilet.", "14.

Different products and methods were used to disinfect cells and remove pests, and such work was carried out by either the prison or specialist firms. Disinfection was carried out daily, according to the characteristics of each area of the prison. The operations carried out to disinfect and remove pests from the applicant\u2019s cell were preventive, and neither he nor the other inmates sharing his cell had requested them. However, no rats or mice had ever been found in the detention cells in Rahova Prison.", "23. Detainees\u2019 diets were determined according to several criteria, including, inter alia, their health and religion. Ingredients had to meet the quality criteria set out by law and had to have quality certificates provided by suppliers. Food was cooked hygienically in the prison kitchen, and stainless steel cooking utensils and equipment were used. Food quality and quantity was also checked by a detainee representative before it was distributed.", "24. The National Prisons Agency finally informed the Government that, during his detention, the applicant had not raised complaints in respect of the conditions of detention.", "25. In his letters to the Court the applicant stated that, as a Muslim, the prison authorities had not offered him an appropriate diet, namely food which did not contain pork. Moreover, when his visitors had brought him food from home, the prison authorities had only allowed him to receive canned food, fruits and vegetables.
