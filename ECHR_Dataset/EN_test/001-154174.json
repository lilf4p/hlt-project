On an unspecified date the company was declared insolvent, and insolvency proceedings commenced. A liquidation commission was accordingly set up.", "5. At some point the applicant was dismissed from the company. She challenged her dismissal in court and claimed salary arrears in two rounds of court proceedings.", "6. On 14 February 2001 the Mirninskiy District Court of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic granted the applicant\u2019s claim in part. The court found that the applicant\u2019s dismissal had been unlawful, ordered the liquidation commission to change the date of the dismissal to the date of the judgment, to modify the grounds for the dismissal and to pay the applicant 121,767.95 Russian roubles (RUB) in salary arrears. On 26 March 2001 the judgment was upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutiya) and entered into force.", "7.

By a final judgment of 5 June 2002 the Supreme Court of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutiya) dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim. The court held that the bailiffs had taken measures to ensure enforcement of the judicial awards in her favour until the company\u2019s liquidation on 17 July 2001. However, the bailiffs had been manifestly unable to obtain enforcement of the awards after the company had ceased to exist.
