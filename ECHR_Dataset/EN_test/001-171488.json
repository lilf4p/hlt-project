It appears that no prior notice was given to the BCEA by the organisers of the demonstration of 26 January 2013. Information about that assembly was disseminated through Facebook or the press.", "7. The BCEA refused to authorise the holding of the demonstration of 17 November 2012, stating in general terms that that assembly was not in accordance with the Law on Freedom of Assembly. The BCEA further stated that the square where the organisers proposed to hold the assembly was a designated public leisure area and that the assembly itself was impractical.", "8.

The participants in the demonstration of 17 November 2012 were demanding democratic reforms in the country and protesting against impediments to freedom of assembly. The participants of the demonstration of 26 January 2013 were condemning the use of force by the police against participants of previous demonstrations.", "10. The applicant attended both demonstrations, but shortly after they had begun the police started to disperse them.

In both cases the applicant was brought before the Sabail District Court on the day of his arrest, 17 November 2012 and 26 January 2013 respectively.", "14.

According to the applicant, in neither case was he given an opportunity to hire a lawyer of his own choice.", "16. The record of the court hearing in the first case shows that the applicant declared that he did not need legal assistance and would defend himself in person.", "17. At the court hearing in the second case a State-funded lawyer was appointed to assist the applicant. According to documents submitted by the Government, the applicant refused the assistance of that lawyer and decided to defend himself in person.", "18. At the hearing in the first case the court did not question any witnesses. In the second case the court questioned two police officers. The police officers testified that they had arrested the applicant because he had staged an unauthorised demonstration.", "19.

In the second case, by a decision of 26 January 2013 the court convicted the applicant under Article 298.2 of the CAO and sentenced him to a fine of 500 manats (AZN).", "21. On unspecified dates the applicant lodged appeals before the Baku Court of Appeal, arguing that his convictions were in violation of his rights because the demonstrations in which he had participated had been peaceful. He also complained that his arrests had been unlawful and that the hearings before the respective first-instance courts had not been fair.", "22. In the first case the applicant was assisted before the Baku Court of Appeal by a lawyer of his own choice. In the second case he was not represented by a lawyer.", "23.
