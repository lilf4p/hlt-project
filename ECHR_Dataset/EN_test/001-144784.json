He submitted that U.H. had lied to him about what they had contained, and that he had only gone to the border area at U.H.\u2019s request. He further confirmed that after his arrest, he had first been taken to the Imishli District Department of the MNS, and then to the Imishli District Hospital, where he had been provided with medical assistance.

According to the applicant, on 4 July 2005 at a hearing before the Assize Court in the course of the criminal trial, he submitted that on 22 March 2005 the MNS agents had shot at his car without first firing a warning shot, as a result of which he had been wounded in the left leg. He further claimed that the agents had not been wearing vests identifying them as officers of the law-enforcement authorities and he therefore could not identify them in the darkness. The applicant also complained that he had not been provided with adequate medical assistance during the first fifteen days of his detention in the MNS detention facility.", "15. The proceedings before the Assize Court ended on 13 July 2005 with a judgment in which the court found the applicant guilty of smuggling and the illegal preparation, possession, purchase, transportation and sale of narcotic substances and sentenced him to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment.
