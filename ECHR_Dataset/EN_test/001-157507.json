Sanitary conditions in the prison were poor, in that there was only one bathroom for each two cells. Thus 150 inmates had to share two water taps and four lavatory pans. The cells were infested with lice and the rations were meagre. The applicant was not given any clothes, any hygiene products or any cutlery by the prison authorities. Tuberculosis-infected inmates were not segregated from the general prison population. Nor were there any other measures in place to prevent the spread of the disease.

There were religious services three times a week.", "The relevant part of the European Prison Rules provides as following:", "\u201c18.1 The accommodation provided for prisoners, and in particular all sleeping accommodation, shall respect human dignity and, as far as possible, privacy, and meet the requirements of health and hygiene, due regard being paid to climatic conditions and especially to floor space, cubic content of air, lighting, heating and ventilation.\u201d", "The relevant part of the Commentary provides as following:", "\u201cThe CPT, by commenting on conditions and space available in prisons in various countries has begun to indicate some minimum standards. These are considered to be 4m2 for prisoners in shared accommodation and 6m2 for a prison cell. These minima are, related however, to wider analyses of specific prison systems, including studies of how much time prisoners actually spend in their cells. These minima should not be regarded as the norm. Although the CPT has never laid down such a norm directly, indications are that it would consider 9 to 10 m2 as a desirable size for a cell for one prisoner. This is an area in which the CPT could make an ongoing contribution that would build on what has already been laid down in this regard. What is required is a detailed examination of what size of cell is acceptable for the accommodation of various numbers of persons. Attention needs to be paid to the number of hours that prisoners spend locked in the cells, when determining appropriate sizes. Even for prisoners who spend a large amount of time out of their cells, there must be a clear minimum space, which meets standards of human dignity.\u201d", "In its Guidance the ICRC outlined the following principles:", "\u201cShared or dormitory accommodation: 3.4 m2 per person, including where bunk beds are used.", "...", "As previously mentioned, space alone is a limited measure of the quality of life and conditions of detention. As such, it is merely a starting point when evaluating the conditions in which detainees are held. Space norms cannot be specified separately from the total environment. The appropriateness of the ICRC\u2019s recommended specifications in any given situation will depend on a number of other factors including:", "the specific individual needs of, for example, sick, old or young prisoners, women and/or people with disabilities;", "the physical condition of the buildings;", "the amount of time spent in the accommodation area;", "the frequency and extent of opportunities to take physical exercise, work and be involved in other activities outside the accommodation area;", "the number of people in the accommodation area (to allow a degree of privacy and avoid isolation);", "the amount of natural light and the adequacy of the ventilation;", "other activities being undertaken in the accommodation area (e.g. cooking, washing, drying);", "other services available (e.g. toilets and showers); and >>the extent of supervision provided.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
