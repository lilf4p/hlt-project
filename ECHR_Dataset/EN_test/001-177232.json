De Gaetano;Georges Ravarani", "TEXT": ["5. The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Budapest.", "6. On 14 April 2010 the applicant notified the police that he planned to organise a demonstration from 2 to 7 p.m. on 17 April 2010 in front of the Venyige Street prison in Budapest, in order to draw attention to the \u201csituation of political prisoners\u201d. Venyige Street is a broad cul-de-sac with a service lane.", "7. On 16 April 2010 the head of the Budapest Police Department banned the demonstration on the grounds that traffic could not be diverted to alternative routes (section 8(1) of the Assembly Act). In the decision, he referred to Article 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 11 of the Convention and Decision no. 55/2001.AB of the Constitutional Court.", "8. On 19 April 2010, within the statutory time-limit, the applicant sought a judicial review of the decision.", "9. On 22 April 2010 the Budapest Regional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s case. It noted that in assessing whether or not traffic could be diverted to other routes, the authority had reckoned on the participation of some 200 demonstrators, as per the applicant\u2019s notification, and that \u2013 after having obtained the opinion of a traffic expert \u2013 it had established that lawful parking and traffic circulation in the neighbourhood would become impossible should the event take place. The court agreed with the police\u2019s decision in that although the right to assembly was a constitutional fundamental right, it was not absolute and must not give rise to a violation of the fundamental rights of others, and could therefore be restricted. The court was satisfied that the decision had been lawful as the police had adequately established the facts, complied with the procedural rules and applied clear assessment criteria, and the assessment of the evidence had been logical."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["11"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["11-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
