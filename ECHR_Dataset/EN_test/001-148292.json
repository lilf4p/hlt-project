The applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy.", "6. On an unspecified date the prosecutor\u2019s office opened a criminal investigation into the activities of a criminal gang allegedly organised by V., a high-ranking police officer at the time. The members of the gang were suspected of numerous thefts of goods and foodstuffs from various storage facilities. One of the episodes under investigation was a fraudulent attempt by the members of the gang to sell scrap metal, which belonged to a private company, to a scrap metal processing plant. According to the official version, the attempt to sell the scrap metal was carried out by V., the applicant, who was also a high-ranking police officer at the time, and G., another member of the gang. On an unspecified date in November 2000 V., the applicant and G. met with M., a director of the scrap processing plant, and fraudulently represented to him that the scrap metal belonged to K. and that they were acting on her behalf. M. agreed to purchase the scrap metal and on 23 November 2000 he sent a group of workers to the company\u2019s site in order to have the scrap metal removed. G.\u2019s boyfriend Yer., another member of the gang, was also present at the site at the time. The removal of the scrap metal was interrupted by B., one of the private company\u2019s directors. Yer. phoned G., who told him to go to the police station to notify V. of the incident. Then both Yer. and G. returned to the site to settle the issue with B., who had complained to the police about the attempted theft of the scrap metal. B. also informed Vosh., the company\u2019s managing director, of the incident. Acting in his official capacity, V. assigned the investigation into the attempted theft of scrap metal to Yem., who decided to question M. However, V. interviewed M. himself and brought Yem. M.\u2019s statement. Yem. questioned K., who submitted that she had nothing to do with the removal of the scrap metal from the company\u2019s premises.", "7. On 8 May 2002 the applicant was arrested and remanded in custody. On 3 December 2002 he was released on bail.", "8. On 9 December 2002 the applicant was formally charged with more than ten counts of financial fraud, theft and embezzlement committed in collusion with eight members of the gang.", "9. The trial opened in January 2003. At the end of the trial the prosecutor dropped all the charges against the applicant except the attempted theft of scrap metal.", "10. The applicant maintained his innocence. The testimony he gave at the trial was summed up as follows in the judgment:", "\u201c... he has known V. since 1996 due to his service in the Ministry of the Interior[.] They have been friends. Since the late nineties he has known G. too, whom he met from time to time at different places and visited her at her home for work purposes. In the summer of 2000, V. asked ... to take him to the site [where the scrap metal was] in order to meet G. G. asked him and V. to help the buyer of the scrap metal to ensure its safety. He and V. promised to ask one of the police patrol teams to secure the scrap metal. They informed accordingly the buyer who arrived later to inspect the scrap metal. He did not talk to anyone about stealing and selling the scrap metal. He did not conspire with such intent and he did not take part in any negotiations about that. He did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the scrap metal or any advance payment. Nor did he take any measures to conceal the crimes committed by G. She falsely accused him of the involvement in the attempted theft of the scrap metal.\u201d", "11. The trial court questioned B., Vosh., and Yem. It further admitted into evidence the statements made by M., Yersh., and K. when questioned by the investigator. As regards witness M., the court noted that he had been away on a business trip and could not attend the court hearing. It considered that this absence amounted to an extraordinary circumstance that would permit the reading-out of his earlier statement. Despite the applicant\u2019s objection, the court dispensed with summoning M. again for questioning and proceeded with the reading-out of his statement. According to the Government, the information concerning M.\u2019s absence was communicated to the court by M.\u2019s wife by telephone.", "12.
