The background facts relating to the planning, conduct and dispersal of the public event at Bolotnaya Square are set out in more detail in Frumkin v. Russia (no. 74568/12, \u00a7\u00a7 7-65, 5 January 2016), and Yaroslav Belousov v. Russia (nos. 2653/13 and 60980/14, \u00a7\u00a7 7-33, 4 October 2016). The parties\u2019 submissions on the circumstances directly relevant to the present case are set out below.", "7. On 6 May 2012 a public demonstration entitled the \u201cMarch of Millions\u201d was held in central Moscow to protest against allegedly rigged presidential elections. The event had been approved by the city authorities in the form of a march followed by a meeting at Bolotnaya Square, which was supposed to end at 7.30 p.m. The march was peaceful and held without any disruptions, but when the marchers arrived at Bolotnaya Square it turned out that barriers installed by the police had narrowed the entrance to the meeting venue, allegedly restricting the space allocated for the meeting. To control the crowd the police cordon forced the protestors to remain within the barriers. There were numerous clashes between the police and protesters. At 5.30 p.m. the police ordered that the meeting finish early and began to disperse the participants. It took them about two hours to clear the protestors from the square.", "8. On the same day the Moscow city department of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation opened criminal proceedings to investigate suspected acts of mass disorder and violence against the police (Articles 212 \u00a7 2 and 318 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code). On 18 May 2012 the file was transferred to the headquarters of the Investigative Committee for further investigation. On 28 May 2012 an investigation was also launched into the criminal offence of organising acts of mass disorder (Article 212 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code). The two criminal cases were joined on the same day.", "9. The applicant took part in the demonstration of 6 May 2012 at Bolotnaya Square. He was arrested on the date indicated below and charged with participation in mass disorder. The applicant was detained and tried on those charges but subsequently exempted from liability under the Amnesty Act.", "10. The applicant is a political activist and a member of an opposition movement called Levyy Front. On 6 May 2012 he arrived at Bolotnaya Square to participate in the demonstration and, according to him, did not take part in any disorder or clashes with the police. After the events in question the applicant continued to live at his usual address and pursue his customary activities, including taking part in authorised public events.", "11. On 10 June 2012 the applicant was detained on suspicion of participation in acts of mass disorder and committing violent acts against the police on 6 May 2012. On 11 June 2012 the Basmannyy District Court of Moscow held a hearing on the investigating authorities\u2019 request to detain the applicant pending the completion of the criminal investigation. In view of the need to provide additional evidence in support of the request, the court adjourned the hearing and authorised the applicant\u2019s detention for seventytwo hours.", "12. On 14 June 2012 the Basmannyy District Court ordered the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention until 10 August 2012. It referred to the gravity of the charges and stated that the applicant\u2019s state of health did not preclude his being detained. The District Court concluded that the applicant, faced with the risk of a prison term, might obstruct the proper administration of justice or abscond.", "13. On 19 June 2012 charges were brought against the applicant under Article 212 \u00a7 2 (participation in mass disorder accompanied by violence) of the Criminal Code. He was accused, in particular, of having thrown an unidentified solid object towards the police.", "14. On 11 July 2012 the Moscow City Court upheld the detention order of 14 June 2012.", "15.

On the same day the District Court granted an extension of the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention until 6 November 2012. It relied on the reasons for and the nature of the crime which had been committed, which gave sufficient grounds to presume that the applicant might reoffend, influence and threaten witnesses and other participants of the criminal proceedings, destroy evidence or otherwise obstruct the proper administration of justice. In addition, the applicant had negative reports related to his place of residence. In particular, he had no permanent employment or family and had been repeatedly brought to administrative responsibility. His state of health was satisfactory and did not warrant his release. Lastly, the court held that in view of the above circumstances the custodial measure could not be replaced by a more lenient preventive measure.", "17. On 12 September 2012 the Moscow City Court upheld the extension order of 8 August 2012.", "18. On 29 October 2012 the Basmannyy District Court examined a new request for an extension of the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention. The applicant argued that his detention was detrimental to his health, in particular his eyesight. He referred again to the personal guarantees of two State Duma deputies in support of his request for a milder preventive measure. On the same day the court extended the applicant\u2019s detention until 6 March 2013.

On 7 November 2012 the charges against the applicant were updated. The classification of the offence remained unchanged. According to the new indictment, between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. on 6 May 2012 at Bolotnaya Square unidentified persons had called those present to move outside the agreed meeting area and to disobey lawful police orders, leading to mass disorder accompanied by violence against public officials. Between 5 p.m. and 10 p.m. that day the applicant had taken part in acts of mass disorder, in particular, he had repeatedly shouted anti-government slogans. During that period of time the participants of the mass disorder threw pieces of tarmac, stones, sticks and other objects at the police, which hit them on various parts of their body. The applicant, no later than at 8 p.m., found a flagpole and threw it at an unidentified police officer, hitting him in the chest.", "20. On 26 November 2012 the Moscow City Court upheld the extension order of 29 October 2012.", "21. On 1 March 2013 the Basmannyy District Court granted a new extension of the applicant\u2019s detention, until 10 June 2013. It stressed the complexity of the case, reiterated the grounds given in the previous orders and noted that the circumstances that had justified the detention order had not changed. The applicant asked to be released on bail and presented personal guarantees from a wellknown writer and two directors of prominent NGOs, but the court considered that a milder preventive measure could not be applied. The Moscow City Court upheld the extension order on 3 April 2013.", "22. On 23 April 2013 the Moscow City Court examined a fresh request to extend the applicant\u2019s detention and set a new term of 6 July 2013 on the same grounds as previously.", "23. On 16 May 2013 the Moscow City Court examined an appeal by the applicant against its decision of 23 April 2013 and reversed it on the grounds that the prosecutor\u2019s office would have enough time to bring an indictment by 10 June 2013, adding that after that date the trial court could consider a new extension of the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention.", "24. On 24 May 2013 the applicant\u2019s criminal case was transferred to the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow for the determination of criminal charges.", "25. On 6 June 2013 that court granted another extension of the applicant\u2019s detention, until 24 November 2013. The decision concerned eleven defendants. Along with the gravity of the charges, the court based its decision on the findings that \u201cthe reasons which had initially warranted the detention have not changed\u201d and that \u201cno other measures of restraint would secure the aims and goals of the judicial proceedings\u201d. The court also pointed out that the applicant\u2019s state of health was not incompatible with his being kept in custody. The Moscow City Court upheld the extension order on 2 July 2013.", "26.

The applicant alleged that he had been constantly exposed to cigarette smoke and that although the window in the cell could be opened, it overlooked a courtyard used for incinerating rubbish and had let in fumes. There was therefore a constant lack of fresh air in the cell, which the ventilation system could not compensate for. Outdoor exercise was limited to one hour per day.
