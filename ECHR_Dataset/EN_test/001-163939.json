The applicant, Mr Franciscus van Velzen, is a Netherlands national, who was born in 1966 and lives in Delft. He is represented before the Court by Mr J.M. Lintz, a lawyer practising in The Hague.", "2. The relevant facts, as submitted by the applicant and apparent from information submitted by the Government at the request of the Judge Rapporteur (Rule 49 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Rules of Court), may be summarised as follows.", "3. The applicant lives on a caravan site. He is not married.", "4. On 3 March 2008 a post office official handed a summons addressed to the applicant to another inhabitant of the caravan site, one Ms D.

Ms D. lives together with the applicant\u2019s brother, on the same caravan site but in a different caravan. Her postal address, which applies to the site as a whole, is the same as the applicant\u2019s.", "6. On 23 April 2008 the limited jurisdiction judge (kantonrechter) of Delft (a local dependency of the Regional Court (rechtbank) of The Hague whose jurisdiction includes minor offences (overtredingen) and small claims) convicted the applicant in absentia of \u201cbeing the person in whose name a motor vehicle is registered for which a vehicle registration certificate has been issued, failing to subscribe to and maintain in force insurance in accordance with the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Liability Insurance) Act\u201d (als degene aan wie het kenteken is opgegeven voor een motorrijtuig waarvoor een kentekenbewijs is afgegeven niet een verzekering overeenkomstig de Wet aansprakelijkheidsverzekering motorrijtuigen sluiten en in stand houden).

On 16 October 2009 the president of the Court of Appeal (gerechtshof) of The Hague gave a decision refusing the applicant leave to appeal. The decision was in the following terms:", "\u201cThe President notes that the appellant did not appear at the first-instance hearing, although the summons was handed to a member of his household on 3 March 2008. The mere fact that the appellant has not made use of the opportunity offered for stating his defence does not justify a hearing on appeal. There is no appearance of any special circumstances that might justify offering him this possibility.", "The President further notes that the appellant essentially wants nothing more than a rehearing of the case. An examination of the case based on the case file has not led the President to expect that a rehearing will lead to any other ruling than that given at first instance.", "The President is not aware of any other reasons for which the interests of the proper administration of justice require the case to be heard in appeal.\u201d", "9.
