CROATIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Jon Fridrik Kj\u00f8lbro;Julia Laffranque;Neboj\u0161a Vu\u010dini\u0107;Paul Lemmens;Georges Ravarani;Ksenija Turkovi\u0107", "TEXT": ["1. The applicant, Ms Ana Maru\u0161i\u0107, is a Croatian national, who was born in 1962. She was represented before the Court by Mr M. Samar\u017eija, a lawyer practising in Zagreb.", "2. The Croatian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms \u0160. Sta\u017enik.", "3. Ksenija Turkovi\u0107, the judge elected in respect of Croatia, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28 of the Rules of Court). On 3 October 2016 the President of the Chamber decided to appoint Georges Ravarani, the judge elected in respect of Luxembourg, to sit as an ad hoc judge (Rule 29 \u00a7 2(a)).", "4. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "5. The applicant was a tenured professor at the University of Zagreb, School of Medicine (Medicinski fakultet Sveu\u010dili\u0161ta u Zagrebu, hereinafter: the Faculty). She was the co-editor-in-chief of the Croatian Medical Journal, an international peer-reviewed journal owned by four Croatian medical schools (the universities of Osijek, Rijeka, Split and Zagreb). The applicant also performed various other functions in different international academic initiatives in the field of medical science.", "6. In 2001 together with J.K.N., the applicant co-authored a textbook on anatomy entitled \u2018Anatomija \u010dovjeka\u2019 [Human Anatomy], which was in use in teaching at the Faculty.", "7. On an unspecified date in 2006 the Office of the Dean received an anonymous letter signed by \u201cstudents of the School of Medicine\u201d alleging that in the applicant\u2019s textbook on anatomy she had plagiarised a textbook written in English by Keith L. Moore, an author from the United States, entitled \u2018Clinically Oriented Anatomy\u2019. Attached to the letter were copies of the relevant parts of the applicant\u2019s and Moore\u2019s books.", "8. On 14 June 2006 the Dean established a special commission to assess the allegations of plagiarism against the applicant.", "9. In a report of 24 October 2006 the commission found that a more appropriate avenue concerning the allegations of plagiarism would be an inquiry by the criminal justice authorities, where a certified court expert would compare and assess the two texts. Stressing, however, that it wished to facilitate the process, the commission explained that it had randomly taken and compared certain parts of the two texts (ten short paragraphs and five tables) and found that they were identical.", "10. With regard to the special commission\u2019s report, the Dean asked the Faculty\u2019s Committee for Research (hereinafter \u201cthe Research Committee\u201d) to assess the report\u2019s findings. The Research Committee consisted of several faculty professors, including Professors M.J. and I.K.", "11. The applicant had a long-lasting conflict with I.K. concerning various issues of academic conduct and integrity. In April and July 2005 the applicant and I.K. respectively lodged complaints before the Court for Integrity of the University of Zagreb School of Medicine (Sud \u010dasti Sveu\u010dili\u0161ta u Zagrebu, Medicinskog fakulteta; hereinafter \u201cthe Integrity Court\u201d) making reciprocal allegations of academically improper conduct.", "12. On 27 November 2006 the applicant reported to the Dean that I.K. had plagiarised parts of an earlier version of the book \u2018Anatomija \u010dovjeka\u2019 when writing his book on anatomy, and that he and M.J. had plagiarised another book on neural sciences when writing their book on the matter.", "13. On 28 November 2006 the Research Committee scheduled a meeting for the assessment of the report for 5 December 2006 and invited the applicant to attend the meeting.", "14. On 5 December 2006 the applicant replied by letter, arguing that the anonymous letter had not been forwarded to her and that the real motive for the allegations of plagiarism against her had to be viewed in the context of similar allegations made by a certain professor, H.B., concerning another article which she had published with her researchers and which had been dismissed as unfounded. The applicant contended that the members of the Research Committee M.J. and I.K. had actively supported H.B.\u2019s allegations against her and she therefore considered that they should withdraw from the case. She also stressed that she had reported I.K. and M.J. to the Dean for plagiarism. The applicant also extensively discussed why she considered that the allegations of plagiarism against her were unfounded. In particular, she contended that at maximum around 10% of her text corresponded to Moore\u2019s book and that this concerned well-known information which could not be stated differently in different textbooks on anatomy.", "15. By a letter of 23 April 2007 the applicant reiterated her above arguments, contending that the allegations of plagiarism against her were unfounded and that the proceedings at issue had damaged her professional academic status.", "16. On 2 July 2007 the Research Committee expressed its view on two reports. Two members of the Research Committee accepted a report prepared by B.L. and expressed their view that probably 25% of the text in the applicant\u2019s book corresponded to the relevant text in Moore\u2019s book, without the necessary references. Seven members of the Research Committee, including M.J. and I.K., accepted a report prepared by I.K. according to which 5,182 lines of the applicant\u2019s text were plagiarised from Moore\u2019s book, which corresponded to 26.66% or, depending on the method of calculation, 21.33% of the overall text. In addition, 22 tables had been plagiarised, which meant that 84.62% of the tables in the book had been plagiarised. One member of the Research Committee abstained.", "17. On 23 July 2007, on the basis of the Research Committee\u2019s findings, the Dean instituted proceedings against the applicant in the Faculty\u2019s Integrity Court in connection with a suspicion that she had plagiarised parts of Moore\u2019s book, by which she had breached sections 3, 8 and 12 of the Code of Ethics (see paragraph 46 below). In support of her allegations, the Dean forwarded to the Integrity Court the Research Committee\u2019s findings and the examples from the applicant\u2019s and Moore\u2019s books.", "18. On 29 October 2007 the applicant complained to the Research Committee that she had several times requested access to the relevant documents on the basis of which its findings had been drafted but had never received a reply. She therefore reiterated her request for access to the relevant documents.", "19. On 5 November 2007 the Integrity Court forwarded the Dean\u2019s submission to the applicant and invited her to respond to the allegations against her. On 9 November 2007 the applicant replied, contending that no supporting evidence had been forwarded with the Dean\u2019s submission. She rejected the accusations of plagiarism.", "20. Meanwhile, the Faculty had commissioned a report from Z., a court interpreter for English, concerning the similarities between the texts in the applicant\u2019s and Moore\u2019s books. In a report of 12 October 2007 the interpreter had analysed various parts and aspects of the two texts and concluded that 35-40% of the first part of the applicant\u2019s book and 20-25% of the second part of the book were literal translations of Moore\u2019s book. In addition, 76% of the tables and the relevant text in the first part and 52% in the second part of the book corresponded to Moore\u2019s book.", "21. At a hearing before the Integrity Court on 12 December 2007, a letter from the co-author of the applicant\u2019s book, J.K.N., was read out. In the letter she explained that she had started to work with the applicant on the updating of a previous edition of the book on anatomy. The applicant had presented her a manuscript and J.K.N. had realised that the information provided had been correct and well presented. She stressed that she had trusted the applicant and that she could not be held responsible for any issues arising from the way the applicant prepared her part of the book. Further to this letter a summary of the special commission\u2019s findings was also read out (see paragraph 9 above). In addition, the findings of the Research Committee\u2019s reports (see paragraph 16 above) and the concluding part of Z.\u2019s report (see paragraph 20 above) were read out as well.", "22. Following the reading out of the materials in support of the accusations against her, the applicant asked to be provided with a copy of these documents, and sought an adjournment of the hearing so she could study the evidence obtained. The Integrity Court dismissed her request on the grounds that the relevant documents had been read out during the hearing.", "23. On the same day the Integrity Court found that the applicant had committed plagiarism and sentenced her to a public reprimand. The Integrity Court considered it established on the basis of the evidence obtained and examined at the hearing that the applicant had plagiarised Moore\u2019s book in a proportion of 35-40% in the first part and 20-25% in the second part of her book. The applicant was instructed that she could challenge the Integrity Court\u2019s decision before the Faculty Council (Fakultetsko vije\u0107e Medicinskog fakulteta Sveu\u010dili\u0161ta u Zagrebu).", "24. On 15 January 2008 the applicant challenged the Integrity Court\u2019s decision before the Faculty Council. She contended in particular that her right to a fair trial had been breached owing to the fact that she had never been provided with the relevant evidence against her and that therefore she had not been able to prepare her case properly. The applicant also argued that Z. was not a properly certified interpreter and that her findings lacked clarity. In addition, the applicant stressed that she had reported M.J. and I.K. for plagiarism. She also considered that the proceedings should have been conducted in accordance with the Regulations on the disciplinary responsibility of teachers, associates and students of the School of Medicine (see paragraphs 49-51 below; hereinafter \u201cthe Disciplinary Regulations\u201d), which had come into force before the proceedings in her case had been instituted.", "25. On 29 January 2008 the Faculty Council dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaints. It stressed that the proceedings had been conducted before the Integrity Court in accordance with its rules and that the disciplinary proceedings under the Disciplinary Regulations were a separate but parallel avenue which could be pursued against a faculty employee for breaches of working duties. The Faculty Council also considered that the applicant had had an effective opportunity to participate in the proceedings and that the Integrity Court had correctly established all the relevant facts concerning the allegations of plagiarism. The decision of the Faculty Council was signed by the Dean.", "26. On 10 March 2008, as no further remedy lay against the Faculty Council\u2019s decision, the applicant lodged a request for protection of constitutionally guaranteed rights under section 66 of the Administrative Disputes Act (see paragraph 57 below) before the Administrative Court (Upravni sud Republike Hrvatske) alleging, inter alia, that her right to a fair trial and respect for her honour and reputation had been breached. She contended in particular that the Integrity Court was not a tribunal established by law, given that the proceedings should have been conducted in accordance with the Disciplinary Regulations. She further argued that she had not had an effective opportunity to participate in the proceedings and to prepare for the case due to the fact that she had never been shown the anonymous letter containing allegations of plagiarism against her and had never been provided with the other evidence on which the findings of plagiarism had been based. Moreover, the applicant complained that she had not had access to the relevant expert report which had been relied upon for her conviction and the conclusions of which had only been read out at the trial. The applicant also challenged the findings of the Faculty bodies concerning the charges of plagiarism.", "27. In April 2008 the reprimand against the applicant was published on the public noticeboard and the Faculty\u2019s website.", "28. On 20 May 2009, on the basis of the parties\u2019 written submissions, the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s request for the protection of constitutionally guaranteed rights. The relevant parts of the decision read:", "\u201cThe appellant lodged a request under section 66 of the Administrative Disputes Act ... alleging that the decision of the Faculty Council, dismissing her appeal and upholding the decision of the Integrity Court applying a public reprimand for the breaches of sections 3, 8 and 12 of the Faculty\u2019s Code of Ethics, infringed [her] rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution ...", "According to section 66 of the Administrative Disputes Act ... a request for the protection of a constitutionally guaranteed right or freedom ... if such a right or freedom has been violated by a final individual act [that is, decision], and no other judicial protection is secured, shall be decided by the [Administrative Court], by applying, mutatis mutandis, the provisions of this Act.", "In the case at issue the impugned decision of the Faculty Council is an individual act under section 66 of the cited Act and thus the appellant was allowed to submit a request for the protection of constitutionally guaranteed rights before the Administrative Court.", "In her request the appellant firstly alleges a breach of Article 5 of the Constitution arguing that in the disciplinary proceedings the Faculty failed to comply with the provisions of the Scientific Activity and Higher Education Act, the Faculty\u2019s Statute and the Regulations on the disciplinary responsibility of teachers, associates and students.", "However, Article 5 of the Constitution, according to the well-established case-law of the Constitutional Court, does not provide for individual rights given that it stipulates the basic principles of constitutionality and lawfulness ... Accordingly, as the said provision of the Constitution concerns a general principle of the legal order of the Republic of Croatia, this court finds that the appellant\u2019s constitutional rights in this respect were not and could not have been breached.", "The appellant invokes Article 14 of the Constitution alleging that she has not been treated equally before the law ...", "... [t]his court has considered the appellant\u2019s arguments from the perspective of Article 14 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution which guarantees equality before the law.", "In view of the above, this court finds that the available materials show that the impugned decision was based on an acceptable application of the substantive law and on its constitutionally acceptable interpretation. The competent bodies, in view of the facts established during the proceedings, provided sufficient reasoning for their decisions, which are not the result of an arbitrary interpretation and application of the substantive law. For these reasons, this court does not accept the appellant\u2019s arguments that she has not been treated equally before the law as guaranteed under Article 14 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution.", "...", "Furthermore, with regard to the complaint of a breach of the right to a fair trial under Article 29 of the Constitution, and in view of the fact that the available materials show that the Integrity Court allowed the appellant to participate in and to follow the proceedings, and that she was able to take all the relevant procedural actions and to use remedies, and being mindful of the fact that the impugned decisions are sufficiently reasoned and adopted in accordance with the relevant procedural law, this court finds that the appellant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial have not been breached.", "...", "In view of the above, the impugned decision was adopted in proceedings which, according to this court, did not breach the appellant\u2019s [constitutional] rights and thus it cannot be held that the decision in question breached any of the protected guarantees under Article 35 of the Constitution, namely the respect for private and family life, dignity, reputation and honour. Accordingly, this right invoked by the appellant has not been breached either.\u201d", "29. On 16 July 2009 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint before the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske), arguing that the Administrative Court had not properly ruled on her complaint of a breach of her constitutional rights. The applicant stressed in particular that the Faculty bodies\u2019 decisions on the allegations of plagiarism against her had not been adopted by a \u201ctribunal\u201d established by law, and that she had not had an effective opportunity to participate in the proceedings with regard to the manner in which the relevant evidence against her had been obtained and used by the Integrity Court. The applicant also stressed that her conviction for plagiarism by the Integrity Court had damaged her professional academic integrity and reputation, which the Administrative Court had failed to rectify.", "30. On 6 June 2012 the Constitutional Court, emphasising that it was not its function to deal with alleged errors of law or fact but to review compliance with the applicant\u2019s constitutional rights, dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaints as unfounded, endorsing the findings of the Administrative Court.", "31. The decision of the Constitutional Court was served on the applicant\u2019s representative on 5 July 2012.", "32. On 28 January 2008 the Ministry of Science, Education and Sports (Ministarstvo znanosti, obrazovanja i \u0161porta; hereinafter \u201cthe Ministry\u201d) conducted an administrative supervision of the Faculty\u2019s acts in the applicant\u2019s case, and found that with the adoption of the Faculty\u2019s Disciplinary Regulations the proceedings against the applicant on charges of plagiarism should not have been conducted before the Integrity Court. It thus considered that the proceedings had not been conducted before a body established by law, and prohibited the enforcement of the decision on the applicant\u2019s responsibility for plagiarism.", "33. On 29 January 2008 the Faculty Council issued an authentic interpretation of the Disciplinary Regulations, by which it explained that the purpose of the Disciplinary Regulations was not to set aside the provisions concerning the functioning of the Integrity Court. It also stressed that the procedure before the Integrity Court and the procedure under the Disciplinary Regulations were two separate parallel procedures and that a case could be processed in either of two ways, depending on the nature of the misconduct at issue. This meant that breaches of ethics would be processed before the Integrity Court, while breaches of work duties would be processed in accordance with the Disciplinary Regulations. In this context, section 9 (1.3) of the Rules of the Integrity Court represented a link between the proceedings under the Rules and the proceedings under the Disciplinary Regulations (see paragraphs 49-51 below).", "34. On 20 May 2009, following an administrative action by the Faculty, the Administrative Court quashed the Ministry\u2019s decision on the grounds that it had overstepped its powers and authorities and unlawfully encroached upon the Faculty\u2019s autonomy as provided under the Scientific Activity and Higher Education Act, the Constitution and the case-law of the Constitutional Court. The Administrative Court explained that the decision of the Integrity Court did not represent a decision which would be susceptible to further administrative supervision.", "35. According to the documents provided by the applicant, in January 2013 she was found not to be eligible for a Fulbright scholarship award because of the public reprimand issued against her on charges of plagiarism. The applicant also explained that as a result of pressure from within the Faculty following her conviction for plagiarism she had had difficulty in being reappointed to the position of tenured professor. She eventually left Zagreb and now works in the University of Split School of Medicine (Medicinski fakultet Sveu\u010dili\u0161ta u Splitu).", "36. The relevant provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia (Ustav Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette, nos. 56/1990, 135/1997, 8/1998, 113/2000, 124/2000, 28/2001, 41/2001, 55/2001, 76/2010, 85/2010 and 5/2014) read as follows:", "\u201cIn Croatia the laws shall comply with the Constitution ...", "Everyone should abide the Constitution and the law and respect the legal order of the Republic of Croatia.\u201d", "\u201cEveryone in the Republic of Croatia shall enjoy rights and freedoms regardless of their race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other belief, national or social origin, property, birth, education, social status or other characteristics.", "All shall be equal before the law.\u201d", "\u201cIn the determination of his rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial court established by law.\u201d", "\u201cEveryone has a right to respect for and legal protection of his private and family life, dignity, reputation and honour.\u201d", "\u201cThe autonomy of the universities shall be guaranteed.", "A university shall independently decide on its organisation and operation, in accordance with the law.\u201d", "37. The relevant part of section 62 of the Constitutional Court Act (Ustavni zakon o Ustavnom sudu Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette nos. 99/1999, 29/2002 and 49/2002) reads:", "\u201cAnyone may lodge a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court if he or she deems that a decision (pojedina\u010dni akt) of a State body, a body of local and regional self-government, or a legal person with public authority, which has decided on his or her rights and obligations, or about a suspicion or accusation of a criminal act, has violated his or her human rights or fundamental freedoms, or his or her right to local and regional self-government guaranteed by the Constitution (hereinafter \u201cconstitutional right\u201d) ...\u201d", "38. The Scientific Activity and Higher Education Act (Zakon o znanstvenoj djelatnosti i visokom obrazovanju, Official Gazette nos. 123/2003, 198/2003, 105/2004, 174/2004, 2/2007 and 46/2007) provides that one of the basic principles governing higher education in Croatia is the principle of autonomy and self-regulation of universities (section 2(3.1)). The employment and academic status of university teachers and other university staff are regulated in sections 31-46.", "39. Section 104 (1) of the Act provides that university teachers and other staff face disciplinary action for breaches of their work duties and other related activities, as well as for causing serious damage to the reputation of the university, in accordance with the relevant university statute. Paragraph 2 of the same section provides that disciplinary responsibility exists only with regard to an offence which was at the time of its commission proscribed under the relevant university acts and for which a sanction has been provided. Under section 112 (7), as in force at the relevant time, the Act provided that the institutions in the higher education system could establish their own ethical boards and adopt their own codes of ethics.", "40. Section 113 provides that overall regulation of the lawfulness of the activities and general acts of the academic institutions is the responsibility of the Ministry.", "41. According to the Statute (Statut Sveu\u010dili\u0161ta u Zagrebu) of 25 February 2005, Zagreb University is a State-funded public institution (section 2). The Statute in section 79 (2) and (3) provides that the Senate of the University shall adopt a code of ethics on the professional and public activity of teachers and other employees and that staff shall face disciplinary action for infringements of work obligations and violations of the code of ethics, in accordance with this Statute and the regulations of the University\u2019s constituent units.", "42. Section 94 of the Statute specifies that failure to meet the requirements of the rules of conduct set forth in the Statute or the statutes of the University\u2019s constituent units or regulations based on them, as well as damage caused to the reputation of the University and its employees, shall be subject to disciplinary responsibility. The disciplinary sanctions are reprimand, public reprimand and dismissal. The description of disciplinary offences and disciplinary procedure shall be determined by the regulations of the University and its constituent units.", "43. The Code of Ethics of Zagreb University (Eti\u010dki kodeks Sveu\u010dili\u0161ta u Zagrebu) of 15 May 2007 in section 2 provides that the aim of the Code of Ethics is to promote the values of academic society as a whole. Paragraph 2 of the same section in conjunction with sections 29-30 explains that ethical boards, established either at the level of the University or its constituent units, shall be competent to give advisory opinions on general or particular issues related to compliance with ethical standards.", "44. Section 2 (3), (4) and (5) of the Code of Ethics further provide that procedures under the Code of Ethics exist independently of any civil, criminal, administrative or disciplinary proceedings. However, if under the Statute a breach of the Code of Ethics also implies disciplinary responsibility, the relevant University or Faculty regulations may need to obtain an opinion from the competent ethical board. The opinion at issue serves to promote the principles established in the Code of Ethics.", "45. The Statute of the School of Medicine (Statut Medicinskog fakulteta Sveu\u010dili\u0161ta u Zagrebu), first adopted on 14 June 2005 with further amendments on 27 October 2010, provides in section 130 that breaches of the relevant University and Faculty acts and conduct damaging the reputation of the University entail disciplinary responsibility which may be sanctioned by a reprimand, public reprimand or dismissal. Detailed provisions in this respect should be provided under the regulations on disciplinary responsibility (section 130).

The consolidated version of the Code of Ethics of the Zagreb University, School of Medicine (Kodeks nastavni\u010dke etike), adopted by the Faculty Council on 29 January 2008, which was, according to an undisputed submission by the Government, applicable at the relevant time, in section 3 obliged faculty teaching staff to carry out their tasks diligently and to have their private lives and conduct bear witness to the integrity of the profession. In section 8 the Code of Ethics emphasised a heightened duty of diligence for teachers when carrying out their duties in respect of the Faculty itself. Section 12 obliged teachers to maintain a heightened awareness of the ethical standards in the interest of their profession, students and the Faculty.", "47. The Rules of the Integrity Court (Poslovnik suda \u010dasti), first adopted in 1997 with further amendments, in their relevant parts provided:", "\u201cThe Integrity Court of the School of Medicine is established in order to protect the proclaimed ethical standards and the ethical standards set out in the Code of Ethics and other general acts which the teachers are obliged to respect when carrying out their activities.\u201d", "\u201c(1) For a breach of the ethical standards under the Code of Ethics, the Integrity Court may pronounce the following sanctions: reprimand, public reprimand, or proposal for the institution of proceedings for the adoption of a disciplinary sanction for serious breaches of work duties.", "(2) In addition to a reprimand or public reprimand, the Integrity Court may suggest to the competent faculty body that proceedings be instituted for the removal of a teacher from the position which he or she occupies in the Faculty.\u201d", "48.

In particular, the Integrity Court had a president, two vice-presidents, five full members and their deputies elected by the Faculty Council. It also had a Registrar (section 2). Any of these could institute proceedings before the Integrity Court, but it could not act on the basis of anonymous submissions (section 3). Cases were to be decided after a preliminary inquiry and a hearing. Respondents could be legally represented and proceedings could be held in their absence if that absence was not justified (sections 4-6). The decisions of the Integrity Court were published in the Faculty\u2019s official gazette (section 10). Appeals against decisions of the Integrity Court could be lodged before the Faculty Council, which could overturn the first instance judgment by adopting its own judgment or could quash it and remit the case for a re-examination (section 11).", "49.

The possible sanctions which may be adopted under the Disciplinary Regulations are: reprimand, public reprimand, or a proposal for dismissal. A fine may also be imposed as an ancillary sanction, and further sanctions are envisaged for discrimination and harassment (section 17). Proceedings under the Disciplinary Regulations are conducted before a committee of three members (section 36). An appeal against the decision of the committee may be lodged before the Faculty Council, which could overturn it by adopting its own decision or could quash it and remit the case for a re-examination (sections 45-46).", "51. The relevant part of the transitional provisions provides:", "\u201cProceedings before the Faculty Court of Integrity instituted before the coming into force of these Regulations shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of general acts as in force at the moment of the lodging of the request [instituting the proceedings].\u201d", "52. The Regulations on the functioning of the Ethical Board (Pravilnik o Eti\u010dkom povjerenstvu, 02-107/15-97) were adopted on 31 January 1997 and were then amended on 1 July 2008. A consolidated version of the text of 6 April 2009 establishes further relevant ethical standards for faculty teachers and other staff (sections 2-4). It also provides that the Faculty Ethics Board shall have the competence to advise the Faculty on matters of ethics and shall work on the development and application of ethical standards. It can also give opinions on matters of ethics and compliance with the relevant ethical standards in individual cases (section 5).", "53.

Section 23 (2) obliges the Integrity Court to inform the Dean and the Faculty Council of all proceedings pending before it in order for them to take further necessary measures as provided under the Regulations.", "54.

According to the conclusion reached at the plenary session of judges of the Administrative Court held on 26 October 1987, an action against an administrative act is to be considered a request for judicial protection within the meaning of section 66 of the Administrative Disputes Act if from the content of the action it transpires that it may concern a breach of rights or freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution. In such cases the Administrative Court could not review every breach of procedural or substantive law but only those that amount to breaches of constitutionally guaranteed rights or freedoms (see further Majski v. Croatia (no. 2), no. 16924/08, \u00a7\u00a7 35-36, 19 July 2011).", "59. According to the Administrative Court\u2019s case-law (judgment no. Zpa-5/2004-5 of 2 December 2004), the requirements for affording judicial protection under section 66 of the Administrative Disputes Act, which must be met in their totality, are: (a) the request has to concern rights or freedoms expressly guaranteed by the Constitution, (b) those rights or freedoms were allegedly breached by a final decision which does not have the characteristics of an administrative act, and (c) the legal system does not provide for another judicial avenue of redress.", "60.

However, the Constitutional Court explained that there are inevitable limits to university autonomy imposed by those who establish, support or supervise the work of universities. These limits are expressed through laws and other regulations determining the functioning of a university. However, such limitations should not disproportionately affect the university\u2019s autonomous status. In this respect the Constitutional Court identified the core aspects of university autonomy, which include, inter alia, the appointment of teachers.", "63.
