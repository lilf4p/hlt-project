GREECE", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Armen Harutyunyan;Kristina Pardalos;Ledi Bianku;Pauliine Koskelo", "TEXT": ["1. The applicant, Mr F.G., is a Greek national who was born in 1946 and lives in Athens. The President granted the applicant\u2019s request for his identity not to be disclosed to the public (Rule 47 \u00a7 4 of the Rules of Court). He was represented before the Court by Ms S. Asimakopoulou, a lawyer practising in Athens.", "2. The Greek Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent\u2019s delegate, Mr K. Georgiadis, Senior Advisor at the State Legal Council.", "3. Mr L.-A. Sicilianos, the judge elected in respect of Greece, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28 of the Rules of Court). The President of the Chamber accordingly appointed Mr Michail Margaritis to sit in his place (Article 26 \u00a7 4 of the Convention and Rule 29 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Rules of Court).", "4. On 3 December 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.", "5. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "6. At the time the events took place the applicant was a legal counsellor at the State Legal Council (\u039d\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039a\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2).", "7. On September 2008, there were three vacant posts at the rank of vice-president of the State Legal Council. The first step of the selection procedure consisted of a proposal by the Minister of Economics and Finance, which included a list of all eligible legal counsellors ranked on the basis of seniority. Among the thirty-six legal counsellors who fulfilled the formal criteria, the applicant was ranked sixth.", "8. At its meeting of 8 September 2008, the Cabinet of Ministers (\u201cthe Cabinet\u201d), following the proposal by the Minister of Economics and Finance, unanimously decided to appoint as vice-presidents to the State Legal Council Mr N.M., Mr D.A. and Mr N.K, who were second, eighth and fourteenth respectively on the list. The reasoning of the decision stated that they \u201c[had] proved superior to the rest of their colleagues under consideration for the posts, as [was] clear from the relevant proposal of the competent Minister, which [had been] accepted by the Cabinet following assessment of each of the eligible legal counsellor\u2019s files and the ministers\u2019 discussion ...\u201d", "9. The proposal of the Minister of Economics and Finance included the qualifications of the eligible staff members, in particular the year of their appointment, their ranking and salary changes, their assignments and disciplinary proceedings and it concluded that:", "\u201c... having assessed all of the above-mentioned facts relating to the service of the persons under consideration, as well as other details of their personal service files and ... their general academic training, their moral character, their diligence and their administrative qualifications; having also taken into account the generally formulated opinion for each one and their seniority ranking, I PROPOSE that the following be chosen and promoted to fulfil the three (3) vacant posts of vice-president of the State Legal Council ... [the names of the three accepted candidates followed, handwritten]\u201d.", "10. From the minutes of the Cabinet meeting it appears that its duration was forty-five minutes and included other items on the agenda as well.", "11. On 10 September 2008, the Presidential Decree by which the procedure was completed was issued and published in the Official Gazette.", "12. On July 2009, the same procedure was followed for filling another two vacant posts to the rank of vice-president of the State Legal Council. Thirty-one legal counsellors were eligible for promotion, including the applicant, who was ranked fourth on the list on the basis of seniority.", "13. At its meeting of 1 July 2009, the Cabinet, following the proposal by the Minister of Economics and Finance, unanimously decided to appoint to the vacant posts Mr B.K. and Mr I.S., who were sixth and tenth respectively on the list. The reasoning of the decision, as well as the Minister\u2019s proposal, were identical to the 2008 procedure.", "14. The duration of the Cabinet meeting was one hour and forty minutes and the agenda included other items as well.", "15. On 2 July 2009, the Presidential Decree by which the procedure was completed was issued and published in the Official Gazette.", "16. On 14 November 2008, the applicant lodged an application for annulment (\u03b1\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03b1\u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2) of the Presidential Decree dated 10 September 2008 with the Supreme Administrative Court (\u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0395\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2), on the grounds of lack of sufficient reasoning in the contested decision and of his having been manifestly superior to two of the three promoted legal counsellors, who had been ranked lower than him on the list and yet had been promoted.", "17. On 13 April 2009, the applicant was informally informed that the State Legal Council had applied to have the case examined by the Plenary of the Supreme Administrative Court and that the President had agreed to grant that request. On the same date, the applicant filed a written submission contesting that decision, relying, on one hand, on the fact that his views on the subject had not been heard prior to the decision and, on the other hand, on the fact that such a referral would result in further delay in the examination of his case. In particular, the applicant maintained that he had only a few years left before he reached compulsory-retirement age and the delay in the examination of his case would further diminish his chances of serving as vice-president of the State Legal Council. From the material in the Court\u2019s possession, it appears that the applicant did not receive a reply to his submission. By a decision of the President of the Supreme Administrative Court dated 21 April 2009, the case was referred to the Plenary of that court.", "18. The date of hearing before the Plenary of the Supreme Administrative Court was scheduled for 25 September 2009. The Court adjourned the hearing until 5 February 2010. On that date, the case was again adjourned on the grounds that there were three pending applications raising similar issues to the case under consideration and it would be better to examine the cases together. The hearing eventually took place on 7 May 2010.", "19. By its judgment no. 1973/2011, published on 20 June 2011 and finalised on 25 August 2011 (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c3\u03af\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae), the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the application for annulment of the Presidential Decree dated 10 September 2008. In its reasoning the court first pointed out that the application for annulment was admissible, as Article 90 \u00a7 6 of the Greek Constitution, which excluded the possibility of applications for annulment of decisions relating to promotions of judges, could not be applied by analogy. It then observed that owing to the State Legal Council\u2019s special institutional role and the nature of the role of its President and vice-presidents, the Cabinet, when choosing the candidates who, in their view, had more substantive qualifications for those posts, enjoyed a wide degree of discretion, without being obliged to provide specific justification for their decisions, except for cases where an omitted candidate had been manifestly superior to the promoted candidates. It then noted that according to the minutes the Cabinet had chosen the candidates to be promoted by taking into account not only the competent Minister\u2019s proposal but also other details from the candidates\u2019 files and following discussion among its members. Lastly, it pointed out that from the material in their possession, the applicant had not been manifestly superior to the promoted candidates.", "20. On 22 October 2009, the applicant lodged an application for annulment of the Presidential Decree dated 1 July 2009 with the Supreme Administrative Court, on the grounds of lack of sufficient reasoning in the contested decision and because he had been manifestly superior to the two promoted legal counsellors who had been ranked lower than him on the list.", "21. By a decision of the President of the Supreme Administrative Court dated 1 March 2010, the case was referred to the Plenary of that court. The hearing was scheduled for 7 May 2010.", "22. By its judgment no. 413/2011, published on 4 February 2011 and finalised on 4 March 2011, the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the application for annulment on the same grounds as those stated in judgment no. 1973/2011 (see paragraph 18 above).", "23. On 13 July 2010, the applicant, following a procedure similar to the one described in paragraphs 6-15 above, was appointed President of the State Legal Council.", "24.
