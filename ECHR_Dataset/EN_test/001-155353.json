At the time of the demise of the USSR, the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (\u201cthe NKAO\u201d) was an autonomous province of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic (\u201cthe Azerbaijan SSR\u201d). Situated within the territory of the Azerbaijan SSR, it covered 4,388 sq. km. There was at that time no common border between Nagorno-Karabakh (known as Artsakh by its Armenian name) and the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (\u201cthe Armenian SSR\u201d), which were separated by Azerbaijani territory, at the shortest distance by the district of Lachin, including a strip of land often referred to as the \u201cLachin corridor\u201d, less than ten kilometres wide.", "13. According to the USSR census of 1989, the NKAO had a population of 189,000, consisting of 77% ethnic Armenians and 22% ethnic Azeris, with Russian and Kurdish minorities. The district of Lachin had a different demographic, the great majority of its population of some 60,000 being Kurds and Azeris. Only 5-6% were Armenians.", "14. In early 1988 demonstrations were held in Stepanakert, the regional capital of the NKAO, as well as in the Armenian capital of Yerevan, demanding the incorporation of Nagorno-Karabakh into Armenia. On 20 February the Soviet of the NKAO made a request to the Supreme Soviets of the Armenian SSR, the Azerbaijan SSR and the USSR that the NKAO be allowed to secede from Azerbaijan and join Armenia. The request was rejected by the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on 23 March. In June it was also rejected by the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan whereas its counterpart in Armenia voted in favour of unification.", "15. Throughout 1988 the demonstrations calling for unification continued. The district of Lachin was subjected to roadblocks and attacks. The clashes led to many casualties, and refugees, numbering hundreds of thousands on both sides, flowed between Armenia and Azerbaijan. As a consequence, on 12 January 1989 the USSR Government placed the NKAO under Moscow\u2019s direct rule. However, on 28 November of that year, control of the province was returned to Azerbaijan. A few days later, on 1 December, the Supreme Soviet of the Armenian SSR and the NagornoKarabakh regional council adopted a joint resolution, \u201cOn the reunification of Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia\u201d. As a result of this resolution a joint budget for the two entities was established in January 1990 and a decision to include Nagorno-Karabakh in the upcoming Armenian elections was taken in the spring of that year.", "16. In early 1990, following an escalation of the conflict, Soviet troops arrived in Baku and Nagorno-Karabakh, and the latter province was placed under a state of emergency. Violent clashes between Armenians and Azeris continued, however, with the occasional intervention by Soviet forces.", "17. On 30 August 1991 Azerbaijan declared independence from the Soviet Union. This was subsequently formalised by means of the adoption of the Constitutional Act on the State Independence of 18 October. On 2 September the Soviet of the NKAO announced the establishment of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (hereinafter the \u201cNKR\u201d), consisting of the territory of the NKAO and the Shaumyan district of Azerbaijan, and declared that it was no longer under Azerbaijani jurisdiction. On 26 November the Azerbaijani parliament abolished the autonomy previously enjoyed by Nagorno-Karabakh. In a referendum organised in Nagorno-Karabakh on 10 December, 99.9% of those participating voted in favour of secession. However, the Azeri population boycotted the referendum. In the same month, the Soviet Union was dissolved and Soviet troops began to withdraw from the region. Military control of NagornoKarabakh was rapidly passing to the Karabakh Armenians. On 6 January 1992 the \u201cNKR\u201d, having regard to the results of the referendum, reaffirmed its independence from Azerbaijan.", "18. In early 1992 the conflict gradually escalated into full-scale war. The ethnic Armenians conquered several Azeri villages, leading to at least several hundred deaths and the departure of the population.", "19. The district of Lachin, in particular the town of Lachin, was attacked many times. The applicants claimed that the attacks were made by troops of both Nagorno-Karabakh and the Republic of Armenia. The respondent Government maintained, however, that Armenia did not participate in the events, but that military action was carried out by the defence forces of Nagorno-Karabakh and volunteer groups. For almost eight months in 1991 the roads to Lachin were under the control of forces of Armenian ethnicity who manned and controlled checkpoints. The town of Lachin became completely isolated. In mid-May 1992 Lachin was subjected to aerial bombardment, in the course of which many houses were destroyed.", "20. On 17 May 1992, realising that troops were advancing rapidly towards Lachin, villagers fled. The following day the town of Lachin was captured by forces of Armenian ethnicity. It appears that the town was looted and burned in the days following the takeover. According to information obtained by the respondent Government from the authorities of the \u201cNKR\u201d, the city of Lachin and the surrounding villages of Aghbulag, Chirag and Chiragli were completely destroyed during the military conflict.", "21. In July 1992 the Armenian parliament decreed that it would not sign any international agreement stipulating that Nagorno-Karabakh remain a part of Azerbaijan.", "22. According to a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report (\u201cSeven Years of Conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh\u201d, December 1994), the capture of the district of Lachin created approximately 30,000 Azeri displaced persons, many of them of Kurdish descent.", "23. Following the capture of Lachin, ethnic Armenian forces continued to conquer four more Azerbaijani districts surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh (Kelbajar, Jabrayil, Gubadly and Zangilan) and substantial parts of two others (Agdam and Fizuli).", "24. On 5 May 1994 a ceasefire agreement (the Bishkek Protocol) was signed by Armenia, Azerbaijan and the \u201cNKR\u201d following Russian mediation. It came into effect on 12 May.", "25. According to the above-mentioned HRW report, between 1988 and 1994 an estimated 750,000\u2013800,000 Azeris were forced out of NagornoKarabakh, Armenia, and the seven Azerbaijani districts surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh. According to information from Armenian authorities, 335,000 Armenian refugees from Azerbaijan and 78,000 internally displaced persons (from regions in Armenia bordering Azerbaijan) have been registered.", "26. According to the respondent Government, the \u201cNKR\u201d controls 4,061 sq. km of the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast. While it is debated how much of the two partly conquered districts is occupied by the \u201cNKR\u201d, it appears that the occupied territory of the seven surrounding districts in total amounts to some 7,500 sq. km.", "27. Estimates of today\u2019s population of Nagorno-Karabakh vary between 120,000 and 145,000 people, 95% being of Armenian ethnicity. Virtually no Azerbaijanis remain. The district of Lachin has a population of between 5,000 and 10,000 Armenians.", "28. No political settlement of the conflict has so far been reached. The self-proclaimed independence of the \u201cNKR\u201d has not been recognised by any State or international organisation. Recurring breaches of the 1994 ceasefire agreement along the borders have led to the loss of many lives and the rhetoric of officials remains hostile. Moreover, according to international reports, tension has heightened in recent years and military expenditure in Armenia and Azerbaijan has increased significantly.", "29. Several proposals for a peaceful solution of the conflict have failed. Negotiations have been carried out under the auspices of the OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) and its so-called Minsk Group. In Madrid in November 2007 the Group\u2019s three Co-Chairs \u2013 France, Russia and the United States \u2013 presented to Armenia and Azerbaijan a set of Basic Principles for a settlement. The Basic Principles, which have since been updated, call, inter alia, for the return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control, an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance, a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh, a future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding referendum, the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence, and international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation. The idea is that the endorsement of these principles by Armenia and Azerbaijan would enable the drafting of a comprehensive and detailed settlement. Following intensive shuttle diplomacy by Minsk Group diplomats and a number of meetings between the presidents of the two countries in 2009, the process lost momentum in 2010. So far the parties to the conflict have not signed a formal agreement on the Basic Principles.", "30. On 24 March 2011 the Minsk Group presented a \u201cReport of the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs\u2019 Field Assessment Mission to the Occupied Territories of Azerbaijan Surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh\u201d, the executive summary of which reads as follows:", "\u201cThe OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs conducted a Field Assessment Mission to the seven occupied territories of Azerbaijan surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh (NK) from October 7-12, 2010, to assess the overall situation there, including humanitarian and other aspects. The Co-Chairs were joined by the Personal Representative of the OSCE Chairman-in-Office and his team, which provided logistical support, and by two experts from the UNHCR and one member of the 2005 OSCE Fact-Finding Mission. This was the first mission by the international community to the territories since 2005, and the first visit by UN personnel in 18 years.", "In travelling more than 1,000 kilometers throughout the territories, the Co-Chairs saw stark evidence of the disastrous consequences of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and the failure to reach a peaceful settlement. Towns and villages that existed before the conflict are abandoned and almost entirely in ruins. While no reliable figures exist, the overall population is roughly estimated as 14,000 persons, living in small settlements and in the towns of Lachin and Kelbajar. The Co-Chairs assess that there has been no significant growth in the population since 2005. The settlers, for the most part ethnic Armenians who were relocated to the territories from elsewhere in Azerbaijan, live in precarious conditions, with poor infrastructure, little economic activity, and limited access to public services. Many lack identity documents. For administrative purposes, the seven territories, the former NK Oblast, and other areas have been incorporated into eight new districts.", "The harsh reality of the situation in the territories has reinforced the view of the CoChairs that the status quo is unacceptable, and that only a peaceful, negotiated settlement can bring the prospect of a better, more certain future to the people who used to live in the territories and those who live there now. The Co-Chairs urge the leaders of all the parties to avoid any activities in the territories and other disputed areas that would prejudice a final settlement or change the character of these areas. They also recommend that measures be taken to preserve cemeteries and places of worship in the territories and to clarify the status of settlers who lack identity documents. The Co-Chairs intend to undertake further missions to other areas affected by the NK conflict, and to include in such missions experts from relevant international agencies that would be involved in implementing a peace settlement.\u201d", "31. On 18 June 2013 the Presidents of the Co-Chair countries of the Minsk group issued a joint statement on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict:", "\u201cWe, the Presidents of the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chair countries \u2013 France, the Russian Federation, and the United States of America \u2013 remain committed to helping the parties to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict reach a lasting and peaceful settlement. We express our deep regret that, rather than trying to find a solution based upon mutual interests, the parties have continued to seek one-sided advantage in the negotiation process.", "We continue to firmly believe that the elements outlined in the statements of our countries over the last four years must be the foundation of any fair and lasting settlement to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. These elements should be seen as an integrated whole, as any attempt to select some elements over others would make it impossible to achieve a balanced solution.", "We reiterate that only a negotiated settlement can lead to peace, stability, and reconciliation, opening opportunities for regional development and cooperation. The use of military force that has already created the current situation of confrontation and instability will not resolve the conflict. A renewal of hostilities would be disastrous for the population of the region, resulting in loss of life, more destruction, additional refugees, and enormous financial costs. We strongly urge the leaders of all the sides to recommit to the Helsinki principles, particularly those relating to the non-use of force or the threat of force, territorial integrity, and equal rights and self-determination of peoples. We also appeal to them to refrain from any actions or rhetoric that could raise tension in the region and lead to escalation of the conflict. The leaders should prepare their people for peace, not war.", "Our countries stand ready to assist the sides, but the responsibility for putting an end to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict remains with them. We strongly believe that further delay in reaching a balanced agreement on the framework for a comprehensive peace is unacceptable, and urge the leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia to focus with renewed energy on the issues that remain unresolved.\u201d", "32. The applicants have stated that they are Azerbaijani Kurds who lived in the district of Lachin, where their ancestors had lived for hundreds of years. On 17 May 1992 they were forced to flee from the district to Baku. They have since been unable to return to their homes and properties because of Armenian occupation.", "33.

Mr Adishirin Chiragov was born in 1947. He lived in the district of Lachin.

He claimed that his possessions included a large furnished house of 145 sq. m, a new \u201cNiva\u201d car, 65 head of small livestock and 11 head of big livestock, and six handmade carpets.", "38.

He claimed that he built a six-bedroom house with a garage on it and lived there with his wife and children until he was forced to leave in 1992. There were also some cattle sheds. He also owned a car repair business called \u201cAuto Service\u201d, a shop and a caf\u00e9, which were situated on a further 5,000 sq. m of land that he owned. In addition, he had 12 cows, 70 lambs and 150 sheep.", "42. Mr Gebrayilov had been unable to return to Lachin since his departure in 1992.

Karabakh Armenian troops \u2013 often with the support of forces from the Republic of Armenia \u2013 captured the remaining Azerbaijani provinces surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh and forced out the Azeri civilian population: the rest of Lachin province, and Kelbajar, Agdam, Fizuli, Jebrayil, Qubatli, and Zangelan provinces.\u201d", "The HRW report presents several pieces of information which point to an involvement of the army of the Republic of Armenia in Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding territories (pp. 67-73). Allegedly, Armenia had even sent members of its police force to perform police duties in the occupied territories. HRW spent two days in April 1994 interviewing Armenian uniformed soldiers on the streets of Yerevan. Thirty per cent of them were draftees in the army of the Republic of Armenia who had either fought in Karabakh, had orders to go to Karabakh or had ostensibly volunteered for service there. Moreover, on a single day in April 1994 HRW researchers had counted five buses holding an estimated 300 soldiers of the Armenian army entering Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenia. Other western journalists had reported to HRW researchers that they had seen eight more buses full of Armenian army soldiers heading for Azerbaijani territory from Armenia. According to HRW, as a matter of law, Armenian army troop involvement in Azerbaijan made Armenia a party to the conflict and made the war an international armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.", "61. Several proposals for a solution to the conflict have been presented within the OSCE Minsk Group. A \u201cpackage deal\u201d proposal of July 1997 set out, under the heading \u201cAgreement I \u2013 The end of armed hostilities\u201d, a twostage process of withdrawal of armed forces. The second stage included the provision that \u201c[t]he armed forces of Armenia will be withdrawn to within the borders of the Republic of Armenia\u201d.", "The \u201cstep-by-step\u201d approach presented in December 1997 also contained a two-stage withdrawal process and stipulated, as part of the second phase, that \u201c[a]ll Armenian forces located outside the borders of the Republic of Armenia will be withdrawn to locations within those borders\u201d. Substantially the same wording was contained in the \u201ccommon state\u201d proposal of November 1998.", "While these documents were discussed in Minsk Group negotiations, none of them led to an agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan.", "62. The applicants referred to statements by various political leaders and observers. For instance, Mr Robert Kocharyan, then prime minister of the \u201cNKR\u201d, stated in an interview with the Armenian newspaper \u201cGolos Armenii\u201d in February 1994 that Armenia supplied anti-aircraft weapons to Nagorno-Karabakh.", "Moreover, Mr Vazgen Manukyan, Armenian minister of defence in 19921993, admitted in an interview with British journalist and writer Thomas de Waal in October 2000 that the public declarations that the Armenian army had taken no part in the war had been purely for foreign consumption (see Thomas de Waal, \u201cBlack Garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan through Peace and War\u201d, New York University Press 2003, p. 210):", "\u201cYou can be sure that whatever we said politically, the Karabakh Armenians and the Armenian Army were united in military actions. It was not important for me if someone was a Karabakhi or an Armenian.\u201d", "63. The annual report of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), \u201cThe Military Balance\u201d, for the years 2002, 2003 and 2004 assessed that, of the 18,000 troops in Nagorno-Karabakh, 8,000 were personnel from Armenia. The 2013 report by the same institute expressed, inter alia, that \u201csince 1994, Armenia has controlled most of Nagorno-Karabakh, and also seven adjacent regions of Azerbaijan, often called the \u2018occupied territories\u2019\u201d (\u201cThe Military Balance\u201d 2002, p. 66; 2003, p. 66; 2004, p. 82; and 2013, p. 218).", "64. Mr David Atkinson, rapporteur of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, stated in November 2004 in his second report to the Political Affairs Committee concerning Nagorno-Karabakh (PACE Doc. 10364):", "\u201cAccording to the information given to me, Armenians from Armenia had participated in the armed fighting over the Nagorno-Karabakh region besides local Armenians from within Azerbaijan. Today, Armenia has soldiers stationed in the Nagorno-Karabakh region and the surrounding districts, people in the region have passports of Armenia, and the Armenian government transfers large budgetary resources to this area.\u201d", "Based on this report, the Parliamentary Assembly adopted on 25 January 2005 resolution 1416 in which it, inter alia, noted:", "\u201c1. The Parliamentary Assembly regrets that, more than a decade after the armed hostilities started, the conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region remains unsolved. Hundreds of thousands of people are still displaced and live in miserable conditions. Considerable parts of the territory of Azerbaijan are still occupied by Armenian forces, and separatist forces are still in control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region.", "2. The Assembly expresses its concern that the military action, and the widespread ethnic hostilities which preceded it, led to large-scale ethnic expulsion and the creation of mono-ethnic areas which resemble the terrible concept of ethnic cleansing. The Assembly reaffirms that independence and secession of a regional territory from a state may only be achieved through a lawful and peaceful process based on the democratic support of the inhabitants of such territory and not in the wake of an armed conflict leading to ethnic expulsion and the de facto annexation of such territory to another state. The Assembly reiterates that the occupation of foreign territory by a member state constitutes a grave violation of that state\u2019s obligations as a member of the Council of Europe and reaffirms the right of displaced persons from the area of conflict to return to their homes safely and with dignity.\u201d", "65. In its report \u201cNagorno-Karabakh: Viewing the Conflict from the Ground\u201d of 14 September 2005, the International Crisis Group (ICG) stated the following in regard to the armed forces in the \u201cNKR\u201d (pp. 9-10):", "\u201c[Nagorno-Karabakh] may be the world\u2019s most militarized society. The highly trained and equipped Nagorno-Karabakh Defence Army is primarily a ground force, for which Armenia provides much of the backbone. A Nagorno-Karabakh official told Crisis Group it has some 20,000 soldiers, while an independent expert [U.S. military analyst Richard Giragosian, July 2005] estimated 18,500. An additional 20,000 to 30,000 reservists allegedly could be mobilised. Based on its population, NagornoKarabakh cannot sustain such a large force without relying on substantial numbers of outsiders. According to an independent assessment [by Mr Giragosian], there are 8,500 Karabakh Armenians in the army and 10,000 from Armenia. ...", "Nevertheless, many conscripts and contracted soldiers from Armenia continue to serve in NK. The (de facto) minister of defence admits his forces have 40 per cent military contract personnel, including citizens of Armenia. He claims that no Armenian citizens are unwillingly conscripted and says 500,000 Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh descent live in Armenia, some of whom serve in the NagornoKarabakh forces. Former conscripts from Yerevan and other towns in Armenia have told Crisis Group they were seemingly arbitrarily sent to NagornoKarabakh and the occupied districts immediately after presenting themselves to the recruitment bureau. They deny that they ever volunteered to go to NagornoKarabakh or the adjacent occupied territory. They were not paid a bonus for serving outside Armenia, and they performed military service in Nagorno-Karabakh uniform, under Nagorno-Karabakh military command. Young Armenian recruits\u2019 opposition to serving in Nagorno-Karabakh has increased, which may help explain an apparent decrease in the numbers being sent to NK.", "There is a high degree of integration between the forces of Armenia and NagornoKarabakh. Senior Armenian authorities admit they give substantial equipment and weaponry. Nagorno-Karabakh authorities also acknowledge that Armenian officers assist with training and in providing specialised skills. However, Armenia insists that none of its army units are in Nagorno-Karabakh or the occupied territories around it.\u201d", "The Armenian Government objected to the report of the ICG, which organisation had no office in Armenia or the \u201cNKR\u201d. Further, the statement on the number of Armenian servicemen in the \u201cNKR\u201d derived from an email communication with Mr Giragosian, who had been contacted by the Government and had given the following declaration:", "\u201cWhile having this opinion I didn\u2019t mean that the people serving in the Nagorno Karabakh armed forces are soldiers. I meant that approximately that number of volunteers are involved in the Nagorno Karabakh armed forces from Armenia and other states according to my calculations. As for the number mentioned by me I can\u2019t insist that it\u2019s correct as it is confidential information and nobody has the exact number. The background for my opinion was that in my opinion many Armenians from different parts of the world participate in the Nagorno Karabakh self-defence forces.\u201d", "66. On 19 April 2007 the Austrian newspaper \u201cDer Standard\u201d published an interview with the then foreign minister of Armenia, Mr Vartan Oskanyan. On the subject of the disputed territories, Mr Oskanyan reportedly referred to them as \u201cthe territories, which are now controlled by Armenia\u201d.", "A few days later the Armenian Embassy in Austria issued a press release stating that Mr Oskanyan had been misinterpreted and that the correct expression was \u201cthe territories, which are now controlled by Armenians\u201d.", "67. On 14 March 2008 the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on \u201cThe Situation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan\u201d (A/RES/62/243). Recalling the 1993 Security Council resolutions (see paragraph 59 above), it contained the following passages:", "\u201cThe General Assembly,", "...", "2. Demands the immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of all Armenian forces from all occupied territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan;", "3. Reaffirms the inalienable right of the population expelled from the occupied territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan to return to their homes, and stresses the necessity of creating appropriate conditions for this return, including the comprehensive rehabilitation of the conflict-affected territories;", "...\u201d", "68. In an interview with Armenia Today, published on 29 October 2008, Mr Jirayr Sefilyan, a Lebanese-born Armenian military commander and political figure who was involved in the capture of the town of Shusha/Shushi in early May 1992 and later continued to serve in the armed forces of both the \u201cNKR\u201d and Armenia, reportedly made the following statement:", "\u201cWe must turn the page of history, as starting from 1991 we have considered Karabakh as an independent state and declared that they should conduct negotiations. Who are we kidding? The whole world knows that the army of the NKR is a part of the armed forces of Armenia, that the budget of the NKR is financed from the budget of Armenia, the political leaders of the NKR are appointed from Yerevan. It is time to consider Karabakh as a part of Armenia, one of its regions. In the negotiation process the territory of Karabakh should be considered as a territory of Armenia and no territorial cession must be made.\u201d", "69. In a resolution of 20 May 2010 on the need for an EU strategy for the South Caucasus, the European Parliament expressed, inter alia, the following:", "\u201c[The European Parliament is] seriously concerned that hundreds of thousands of refugees and IDPs who fled their homes during or in connection with the NagornoKarabakh war remain displaced and denied their rights, including the right to return, property rights and the right to personal security; calls on all parties to unambiguously and unconditionally recognise these rights, the need for their prompt realisation and for a prompt solution to this problem that respects the principles of international law; demands, in this regard, the withdrawal of Armenian forces from all occupied territories of Azerbaijan, accompanied by deployment of international forces to be organised with respect of the UN Charter in order to provide the necessary security guarantees in a period of transition, which will ensure the security of the population of Nagorno-Karabakh and allow the displaced persons to return to their homes and further conflicts caused by homelessness to be prevented; calls on the Armenian and Azerbaijani authorities and leaders of relevant communities to demonstrate their commitment to the creation of peaceful inter-ethnic relations through practical preparations for the return of displaced persons; considers that the situation of the IDPs and refugees should be dealt with according to international standards, including with regard to the recent PACE Recommendation 1877(2009), \u2018Europe\u2019s forgotten people: protecting the human rights of long-term displaced persons\u2019.\u201d", "70. In April 2012 the European Parliament passed a further resolution which, inter alia, noted that \u201cdeeply concerning reports exist of illegal activities exercised by Armenian troops on the occupied Azerbaijani territories, namely regular military manoeuvres, renewal of military hardware and personnel and the deepening of defensive echelons\u201d. The European Parliament recommended that negotiations on the EU-Armenia Association Agreements be linked to commitments regarding \u201cthe withdrawal of Armenian forces from occupied territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh and their return to Azerbaijani control\u201d and \u201ccall[ed] on Armenia to stop sending regular army conscripts to serve in NagornoKarabakh\u201d (European Parliament resolution of 18 April 2012 containing the European Parliament\u2019s recommendations to the Council, the Commission and the European External Action Service on the negotiations of the EU-Armenia Association Agreement).", "71. The applicants submitted that, on various occasions in 2012 and 2013, the Armenian president, the minister of defence and high-ranking military staff visited the disputed territories to inspect troops, attend military exercises and hold meetings with military and other officials in the \u201cNKR\u201d. In July 2013, Armenia\u2019s top army generals and other military officials, including the Armenian minister of defence and the commanders of the armed forces of the \u201cNKR\u201d, held a meeting in Nagorno-Karabakh, focusing on efforts to strengthen the Armenian military.", "72. On 15 January 2013 Armenian president Mr Serzh Sargsyan held a meeting with the leaders of the legislative, executive and judiciary branches of the Republic of Armenia Ministry of Defence. His speech given at the meeting was published the same day on the official website of the president of the Republic of Armenia. It contained, inter alia, the following statements:", "\u201cIt happened that from the first years of independence, the Army has been playing a special role in our society. It was the war, whose spirit was felt all over Armenia \u2013 in some places more than in the others. In those days, every family had a close or a distant relative in the Armenian Army; and the Army was in everyone\u2019s heart. That feeling became stronger when our Army attained victory which was so important, which was vital.", "...", "The ultimate goal of our foreign policy is the final legal formulation of the victory achieved in the aggressive war unleashed by Azerbaijan against Artsakh. The Republic of Nagorno Karabakh must be recognized by the international community since there is no logical explanation as to why the people, who have exercised their legal right for self-determination and later protected it in the uneven war, should ever be part of Azerbaijan. Why the destiny of these people should be defined by the illegal decision once made by Stalin?", "...", "Armenia and Artsakh do not want war; however everyone must know that we will give a fitting rebuff to any challenge. The people of Artsakh will never face the danger of physical extermination again. The Republic of Armenia will guarantee against that.", "...", "Security of Artsakh is not a matter of prestige for us; it is a matter of life and death in the most direct sense of these words. The entire world must know and realize that we, the power structures of Armenia and Artsakh stand against the army which pays wages to the murderers, if that horde can be called army in the first place.\u201d", "73. In an opinion drawn up at the request of the Armenian Government, Dr Hari Bucur-Marcu, a military expert of Romanian nationality, stated that he had found nothing in the Armenian military policy that envisaged any form of control over \u201cNKR\u201d forces nor any indications on the ground that Armenian forces were present or active in the \u201cNKR\u201d. He further concluded that there was no evidence that Armenia exercised control or authority over the \u201cNKR\u201d or its defence force or that Armenian forces exercised any control over the government or governance of the \u201cNKR\u201d. The Government stated that Dr Bucur-Marcu had been given the opportunity to interview senior military officers in Armenia and access their records. By arrangement with the \u201cNKR\u201d Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he had further been able to travel there and to talk to military and political officials and examine documents.", "74.

The Armenian Government asserted that the Armenian conscripts who, pursuant to Article 4 of the 1994 agreement, performed their service in the \u201cNKR\u201d were mainly in the lower ranks and comprised no more than 5% (up to 1,500 persons) of the \u201cNKR\u201d defence force. However, the Government did not rule out the possibility that some Armenian nationals may have served in the \u201cNKR\u201d defence force on a contractual and voluntary basis. Among those serving in the \u201cNKR\u201d defence force, side by side with inhabitants of Nagorno-Karabakh, were also volunteers of Armenian origin from various countries where there is an Armenian diaspora. Allegedly, the Armenian soldiers serving in the \u201cNKR\u201d were under the direct command of the \u201cNKR\u201d defence force, which was the only armed force operational in the \u201cNKR\u201d. The Government maintained that the Armenian conscripts serving in the \u201cNKR\u201d under the 1994 agreement did so in accordance with their own wishes (see, however, the ICG report, paragraph 65 above).", "The Armenian Government further stated that the Armenian army and the \u201cNKR\u201d defence force co-operate in a defence alliance in matters such as intelligence sharing, visits of senior officers, seminars, joint military exercises, parade inspections and the like.", "76. On 11 October 2007 the Court issued a partial decision as to the admissibility of the cases of Zalyan, Sargsyan and Serobyan v. Armenia (applications nos. 36894/04 and 3521/07), which concerns the alleged illtreatment and unlawful detention of three military servicemen. The facts of the case reveal that the applicants had been drafted into the Armenian army in May 2003 and had been assigned to military unit no. 33651, stationed near the village of Mataghis in the Martakert region of the \u201cNKR\u201d. Two servicemen of the same military unit were found dead in January 2004. A criminal investigation into their murders ensued and the applicants were questioned for a number of days in April 2004 in Nagorno-Karabakh \u2013 first at their military unit, then at the Martakert Garrison Military Prosecutor\u2019s Office and finally at the Stepanakert Military Police Department \u2013 before being transported to Yerevan for further proceedings. The officers conducting the questioning of the applicants in Nagorno-Karabakh included two investigators of the Military Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Armenia, an investigator of the Martakert Garrison Military Prosecutor\u2019s Office and an Armenian military police officer. A chief of battalion of the military unit was also present at the first questioning. The applicants were subsequently charged with murder and the criminal trial against them commenced in November 2004 at the Syunik Regional Court, sitting in Stepanakert. The applicants were present at the trial. On 18 May 2005 the court found the applicants guilty of murder and sentenced them to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment.", "77. Similarly, as reported by the human rights organisation Forum 18 as well as HRW, Mr Armen Grigoryan, an Armenian citizen and conscientious objector, was taken from a military recruitment office in Yerevan in June 2004 and transferred to a military unit based in Nagorno-Karabakh. After having fled the unit, Mr Grigoryan was arrested and was eventually, by a court sitting in Stepanakert on 9 June 2005, found guilty of having refused military service and sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment.", "78. Several prominent Armenian politicians have held, at different times, high positions in both the Republic of Armenia and the \u201cNKR\u201d or have otherwise had close ties to Nagorno-Karabakh. The first president of the Republic of Armenia, Mr Levon Ter-Petrosyan, was a member of the Armenian \u201cKarabakh Committee\u201d which, in the late 1980s, led the movement for unification of Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia. He was in April 1998 succeeded as president of Armenia by Mr Robert Kocharyan, who had previously served as prime minister of the \u201cNKR\u201d from August 1992 to December 1994, as president of the \u201cNKR\u201d from December 1994 to March 1997 and as prime minister of the Republic of Armenia from March 1997 to April 1998. In April 2008 Mr Serzh Sargsyan became the third president of Armenia. In August 1993 he had been appointed minister of defence of Armenia after having served from 1989 to 1993 as chairman of the \u201cNagorno-Karabakh Republic Self-Defense Forces Committee\u201d. Furthermore, in 2007 Mr Seyran Ohanyan switched from being the minister of defence of the \u201cNKR\u201d to becoming the commander-in-chief of the Armenian armed forces. In April 2008 he was appointed minister of defence of Armenia.", "79. The applicants claimed that the laws of the Republic of Armenia apply in the \u201cNKR\u201d. However, according to the Armenian Government, between January 1992 and August 2006 the \u201cNKR\u201d adopted 609 different laws, one of the first being \u201cThe Law on the Basis of Nagorno-Karabakh Republic State Independence\u201d. Article 2 of this law provides that the \u201cNKR decides independently all issues concerning the Republic\u2019s political, economic, social and cultural, construction, administrative and territorial division policies\u201d. Also in January 1992, bodies of executive and judicial power were created, including the Council of Ministers (the Government), the Supreme Court and the first instance courts of the \u201cNKR\u201d as well as the \u201cNKR\u201d prosecutor\u2019s office. The \u201cNKR\u201d also has its own president, parliament and police force as well as bodies of local self-government, including administrations governing the territories surrounding the \u201cNKR\u201d, whose representatives are appointed by \u201cNKR\u201d authorities. Presidential and parliamentary elections are held. While several laws have been adopted from Armenian legislation, the Armenian Government maintained that they did not apply automatically, i.e. by decisions of Armenian courts, but were independently interpreted and applied by \u201cNKR\u201d courts, whether in the district of Lachin or elsewhere.", "80. In its 2005 report (referred to above, paragraph 65), the ICG stated the following (pp. 12-13):", "\u201cThe economy of Nagorno-Karabakh was previously integrated into Soviet Azerbaijan\u2019s but was largely destroyed by the war. Today it is closely tied to Armenia and highly dependent on its financial inputs. All transactions are done via Armenia, and products produced in Nagorno-Karabakh often are labelled \u201cmade in Armenia\u201d for export. Yerevan provides half the budget. ...", "Nagorno-Karabakh is highly dependent on external financial support, primarily from Armenia but also from the U.S. and the world-wide diaspora. It cannot collect sufficient revenue to meet its budgetary needs, and in absolute terms is receiving increasing external support. The 2005 budget totalled 24.18 billion drams (some $53.73 million). Locally collected revenues are expected to total 6.46 billion drams (about $14.35 million), 26.7 per cent of expenditures.", "Since 1993 Nagorno-Karabakh has benefited from an Armenian \u2018inter-state loan\u2019. According to the Armenian prime minister, this will be 13 billion drams ($28.88 million) in 2005, a significant increase from 2002 when it was 9 billion drams ($16.07 million). However, Nagorno-Karabakh\u2019s (de facto) prime minister argues that part of this loan \u2013 4.259 billion drams (about $9.46 million) \u2013 is in fact Armenia\u2019s repayment of VAT, customs and excise duties that Armenia levies on goods that pass through its territory, destined for Nagorno-Karabakh. The remainder of the loan has a ten-year repayment period at nominal interest. Though Armenia has provided such loans since 1993, nothing has been repaid. According to the Armenian prime minister, Stepanakert \u2018is not yet in a position to repay... . In the coming years we will need to continue providing this loan to help them continue building their infrastructure ... we do not envision that they will be able to go ahead on their own anytime soon\u2019.", "The U.S. is the only other state that provides direct governmental assistance. In 1998 Congress for the first time designated Nagorno-Karabakh a recipient of humanitarian aid distinct from Azerbaijan. The U.S. money is administered by its Agency for International Development (USAID), which has distributed it to such NGOs as the Fund for Armenian Relief, Save the Children, and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Through September 2004, the U.S. had pledged $23,274,992 to NagornoKarabakh and had spent $17,831,608. Armenian lobby groups have been influential in making these allocations possible.\u201d", "The ICG further stated that the Armenian \u201cinter-state loan\u201d had accounted for 67.3% of the \u201cNKR\u201d budget in 2001 (according to the \u201cStatistical Yearbook of Nagorno-Karabakh\u201d) and 56.9% in 2004 (according to an ICG communication with the director of the \u201cNKR\u201d National Statistical Service).", "81. The loan provided by the Republic of Armenia to the \u201cNKR\u201d for the years 2004 and 2005 amounted to USD 51,000,000. USD 40,000,000 went to rebuilding educational institutions and USD 11,000,000 to help the families of killed soldiers.", "82. The Hayastan All-Armenian Fund was founded by an Armenian presidential decree on 3 March 1992.
