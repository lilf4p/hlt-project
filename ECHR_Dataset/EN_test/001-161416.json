The applicant was born in 1984 and lives in Baku.", "6. The applicant is a well-known civil society activist and human rights defender. He is the Chairman and one of the co-founders of Human Rights Club, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) specialising in the protection of human rights. Human Rights Club was established in December 2010 and has made several unsuccessful attempts to obtain State registration by the Ministry of Justice in order to obtain legal entity status under domestic law. The authorities\u2019 refusal to register Human Rights Club is the subject of another application pending before the Court (see application no. 27309/14). The applicant has collaborated with other NGOs in Azerbaijan on various projects. He is also a member of the Board of Directors of the Republican Alternative Civic Movement (REAL).", "7. The applicant has been involved in the preparation of various reports relating to human rights issues in Azerbaijan. He has also been involved in promoting the adoption of a Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) report on political prisoners in Azerbaijan, and has been working on a consolidated list of political prisoners to be presented to the Council of Europe. He has been a speaker at Council of Europe and United Nations (UN) events, and has submitted shadow reports to UN institutions.", "8. The applicant also coordinated the Sing for Democracy campaign (later renamed Art for Democracy) during and after the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 in Baku, which aimed at drawing attention to human rights violations in Azerbaijan.", "9. During the June 2014 session of the PACE the applicant presented a report on human rights violations in Azerbaijan at the Council of Europe.", "10. In recent years a number of human rights activists, lawyers, politicians, journalists and other government critics have been arrested and/or charged with various criminal offences. Those arrests generated wide publicity and were condemned by a number of international organisations, NGOs and prominent individuals (see, for example, paragraphs 83-84 below).", "11. On 22 April 2014 the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office instituted criminal proceedings under Articles 308.1 (abuse of power) and 313 (forgery by an official) of the Criminal Code in connection with alleged irregularities in the financial activities of a number of NGOs.", "12. While the applicant was away in Kyiv from 6 to 11 July 2014 the Sabail District Court ordered a freezing injunction in respect of his bank accounts on 7 July 2014.", "13. On 29 July 2014, while travelling by train from Baku to Tbilisi, the applicant was stopped during checks at the Azerbaijani-Georgian border. He was informed that he could not leave the country because a travel ban had been imposed on him on 25 July 2014.", "14. On 31 July 2014 the applicant was invited to the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, where he was questioned as a witness in connection with the above-mentioned criminal proceedings (see paragraph 11 above).", "15. On 31 July and 1 August 2014 searches were conducted at Human Rights Club, and a number of documents, mainly related to book-keeping and finance, were seized.", "16. On 2 August 2014 the applicant was again invited to the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office for questioning as a witness. On his arrival at the premises he was arrested and formally charged under Articles 192.2.2 (illegal entrepreneurship), 213.1 (large-scale tax evasion) and 308.2 (abuse of power) of the Criminal Code. The description of charges consisted of a single sentence which was one page long. In particular, it was noted that since June 2010 the applicant, as co-founder and Chairman of Human Rights Club, an \u201corganisation lacking State registration\u201d, and as a project manager in an NGO named International Cooperation of Volunteers, had received a number of grants from the United States of America\u2019s National Endowment for Democracy (NED), various branches of the Open Society Institute Assistance Foundation (OSIAF), Norway\u2019s Stiftelsen Fritt Ord and other donor organisations, pursuant to relevant grant agreements. He was accused of acquiring profit, \u201cby paying money to himself and other people involved in the projects in the guise of salaries and service fees\u201d in the amount of 147,900.85 Azerbaijani new manats (AZN), having acquired that money through, \u201cillegal entrepreneurial activity in respect of grants which, as an official, he had failed to register with the relevant executive authority, even though he had a professional obligation to do so\u201d. He was also accused of avoiding payment of taxes under Articles 218, 219 and 220 of the Tax Code in the amount of AZN 6,162.24, thus causing, \u201csignificant damage to State interests protected by law, bringing about grave consequences\u201d.", "17. On the same day, 2 August 2014, the Nasimi District Court, relying on the official charges brought against the applicant and the prosecutor\u2019s application for the preventive measure of remand in custody, ordered the applicant\u2019s detention for a period of three months. The court justified the decision as follows:", "\u201cTaking into account the gravity of the criminal offences of which the applicant is accused and the possibility of him disrupting the normal course of the investigation by unlawfully influencing people involved in the proceedings or absconding from the investigation if he remains at liberty, the court considers that the preventive measure of remanding him in custody must be applied in his case.\u201d", "18. On 4 August 2014 the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office made a public statement which noted that the applicant had been charged under Articles 192.2.2, 213.1 and 308.2 of the Criminal Code because there was a suspicion that he had committed the criminal offences set out in the abovementioned Articles.", "19. On 4 August 2014 the applicant appealed against the detention order. He argued that there was no \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that he had committed a criminal offence, and that his detention was a punishment for carrying out activities which were protected by the Constitution. He further argued that the court had failed to provide any relevant reasons as to the applicability of grounds which could justify his detention. In particular, as to the risk of absconding, the applicant pointed out that the factual circumstances indicated that there was no such risk. He submitted that he had cooperated with the investigating authorities from the very beginning by appearing for questioning and producing documents whenever he had been required to do so, and that he had returned to the country from a trip to Kyiv knowing that he was under investigation. As to the risk of disrupting the investigation, the applicant argued that the existence of such a risk had not been substantiated. He argued that, on the contrary, he had given to the authorities originals of all documents which could be relevant to the investigation, and therefore was not in a position to tamper with the evidence.", "20. On 8 August 2014 the Baku Court of Appeal upheld the detention order of 2 August 2014 without addressing any of the applicant\u2019s arguments.", "21. On 19 August 2014 the applicant applied to the Nasimi District Court, requesting the substitution of remand with either house arrest or release on bail. Among other things, the applicant highlighted the factual circumstances which supported his argument for less restrictive measures, including the fact that he had returned to the country from Kyiv knowing that he was under investigation and had complied with all orders to produce documents and appear for questioning, and that he, as a human rights defender, was a respected public figure with strong ties to the community.", "22. On 20 August 2014 the Nasimi District Court rejected his application, finding that the grounds justifying his detention, as specified in its decision of 2 August 2014, \u201chad not ceased to exist\u201d.", "23. On 22 August 2014 the applicant appealed, reiterating his arguments in detail. On 28 August 2014 the Baku Court of Appeal upheld the Nasimi District Court\u2019s decision of 20 August 2014.", "24. On 23 October 2014 the Nasimi District Court extended the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention by three months (to 2 February 2015), finding that the grounds justifying his continued detention, \u201chad not ceased to exist\u201d.", "25. On 24 October the applicant appealed, reiterating his previous arguments.", "26. On 29 October 2014 the Baku Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, upholding the extension decision of 14 March 2013 and providing the same reasoning as the first-instance court.", "27. On an unspecified date in December 2014 the applicant applied to the Nasimi District Court, requesting the substitution of remand with house arrest. On 10 December 2014 the Nasimi District Court rejected his application, finding that the grounds justifying his detention, as specified in its decisions of 2 August and 23 October 2014, \u201chad not ceased to exist\u201d.", "28. On 12 December 2014 the applicant appealed against the Nasimi District Court\u2019s decision of 10 December 2014, reiterating his arguments in detail. On 19 December 2014 the Baku Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal.", "29. No further decisions extending the applicant\u2019s detention are available in the case file.", "30. On 12 December 2014 the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office charged the applicant under Articles 179.3.2 (high-level embezzlement) and 313 of the Criminal Code, in addition to the original charges under Articles 192.2.2, 213.1 and 308.2 of the Criminal Code. The description of the allegations against him was slightly expanded, but essentially remained the same as that given on 2 August 2014 (see paragraph 16 above), with additional information alleging that the applicant had falsified various pieces of paperwork and minor contracts for services provided by a number of individuals (presumably in connection with various grant projects) and had not paid them in full as stipulated in the contracts. The new description of charges also included changes to the total amount of the alleged illegal profit obtained by the applicant (AZN 150,170.62) and the alleged amount of unpaid taxes (AZN 6,257.11).", "31. The applicant\u2019s criminal trial began in January 2015. On 16 April 2015 the Baku Court of Serious Crimes convicted him of all charges and sentenced him to six and a half years\u2019 imprisonment and deprivation of the right to hold official positions in State and local authorities and the right to engage in entrepreneurial activity for a period of three years. The conviction is not yet final and the appeal is pending.", "32. Enclosed with his submissions to the Court, the applicant included statements by NED dated 22 October 2014, by the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Baku dated 19 November 2014, by the British Embassy in Azerbaijan dated 12 December 2014, by People In Need dated 12 January 2015, by OSIAF dated 20 and 21 January 2015, by International Bridges of Justice dated 22 January 2015 and by the Fritt Ord Foundation dated 5 February 2015.", "33. All of those statements, addressed \u201cTo whom it might concern\u201d, provided details of the relevant grants and donations awarded to the applicant or Human Rights Club, noted that the applicant had regularly provided the relevant donor with necessary accounting information concerning the expenditure of the funds, and specified that the donor organisations and embassies had every confidence that the funds had been used properly for the relevant projects and initiatives for which they had been awarded.", "34. There is no indication in the case file that the above statements have been sought or taken into account by the prosecuting authorities.", "35. Before and after the applicant\u2019s arrest, numerous articles about him were published in the State media and in the media allegedly close to the government. In those articles, he was described as a spy for foreign interests and \u201ca traitor\u201d. Moreover, a number of politicians from the ruling political party made similar comments about recently arrested NGO activists and human rights defenders in Azerbaijan, without specifically naming the applicant. The following are some examples of such comments.", "36. In January 2012 Yeni Azerbaijan, the official newspaper of the ruling party, ran a piece entitled \u201cNew Target of National Traitors: Eurovision 2012\u201d, which attacked the Sing for Democracy campaign coordinated by the applicant as a campaign against the interests of the country and stated the following:", "\u201cThe blackmail and slander campaign of the Alliance to Protect Political Freedoms, Institute for Peace and Democracy, Institute for Reporters\u2019 Freedom and Safety, and Human Rights Club is based on ugly intentions which are evident from the names of these organisations. These organisations always orchestrate the ugly plans of several interested circles against Azerbaijan and act as mercenaries. The remote control of those who would do anything for money, who easily betray their country and State by launching a black smear campaign in exchange for foreign donations (donations obviously granted for meeting certain interests) is in the hands of those who give the money.\u201d", "37. Around the time of the applicant\u2019s arrest and thereafter, the same newspaper and online news portals affiliated with the authorities published a number of pejorative articles calling the applicant an \u201cAmerican agent\u201d, with headlines such as \u201cAmerican Agent Rasul Jafarov Detained for Three Months\u201d, \u201cThe Rights of Rasul Jafarov, Another Agent, Limited\u201d, and \u201cSearch of the Flat of American Agent Rasul Jafarov\u201d.", "38. On 14 August 2014 A.H., the Chairman of the Legal Policy and State Building Committee of the National Assembly, gave an interview to APA news agency where he commented on the reactions to the arrests of Ms Leyla Yunus, Mr Intigam Aliyev and other human rights defenders and stated:", "\u201c... it is those [international organisations] which made them \u2018well known\u2019. The organisations which have allocated grants to them in non-transparent ways, directing them into various activities, including those against Azerbaijan. These people, some of whom are traitors and some weak-minded, will finally answer before the law.\u201d", "39. On 15 August 2014 A.H., the Head of the Department of Social and Political Issues of the Presidential Administration, stated the following in an interview with Trend news agency:", "\u201cThe most deplorable thing is that such NGOs and individuals and some journalists, relying on foreign circles funding them, placed themselves above the national law, evaded registering their grant projects, filing financial statements, paying taxes and the government\u2019s other legal requirements.\u201d", "40. In an interview published on 2 September 2014 Y.M., a member of parliament from the ruling party, who was also the Director of the Institute of History at the Academy of Sciences, stated the following in respect of the recently arrested NGO activists and human rights defenders:", "\u201cPeople who betray their motherland cannot be forgiven. ... The death penalty should be imposed on such people. Capital punishment must be the gravest punishment for them. Why should traitors be forgiven? ... Therefore, the activities of a number of non-governmental organisations must be investigated very seriously, and if any illegality is discovered, such organisations must be immediately banned and their leaders punished.\u201d", "41. On 3 December 2014 State-owned news agencies published a sixtypage manifesto written by R.M., the Head of the Presidential Administration, entitled \u201cThe World Order of Double Standards and Modern Azerbaijan\u201d. The article accused human rights NGOs operating in the country of being the \u201cfifth column of imperialism\u201d. It postulated that various, mostly US-sponsored, donor organisations such as NED, as well as other foreign organisations, supported political opposition movements in various countries against national governments. For local human rights NGOs, the purpose of such funding schemes was the formation of a \u201cfifth column\u201d inside a country. US taxpayers\u2019 money was spent on preparing a change of political power or forcing existing governments to comply with US political demands.", "42. According to the applicant, in various speeches given in 2014 the President of the State had stated that foreign criticism of the human rights situation in Azerbaijan had nothing to do with human rights, but was politically motivated, and that within the country there were \u201cnational traitors who had sold their conscience to foreign anti-Azerbaijani circles\u201d.", "43. The applicant\u2019s representative, Mr Bagirov, was an advocate and a member of the Azerbaijani Bar Association (\u201cthe ABA\u201d). He was affiliated with Law Office no. 6 in Baku.", "44. In November 2014 disciplinary proceedings were instituted against Mr Bagirov by the ABA on the basis of a letter dated 25 September 2014 from a judge of the Shaki Court of Appeal. In his letter, the judge informed the ABA that Mr Bagirov had breached the ethical rules of conduct for advocates at court hearings held in September 2014 before the Shaki Court of Appeal during criminal proceedings against I.M.", "45. On 10 December 2014 the Collegium of the ABA held a meeting at which it considered the complaint against Mr Bagirov. Following the meeting, the Collegium of the ABA held that Mr Bagirov had breached the ethical rules of conduct for advocates because at the court hearing he had made the following remark about the judicial system, \u201cLike State, like court ... If there were justice in Azerbaijan, Judge [R.H.] would not deliver unfair and partial judgments, nor would an individual like him be a judge\u201d (\u201cBel\u0259 d\u00f6vl\u0259tin bel\u0259 d\u0259 m\u0259hk\u0259m\u0259si olacaq ... Az\u0259rbaycanda \u0259dal\u0259t olsayd\u0131, hakim [R.H.] \u0259dal\u0259tsiz v\u0259 q\u0259r\u0259zli h\u00f6km \u00e7\u0131xarmaz, n\u0259 d\u0259 onun kimisi hakim i\u015fl\u0259m\u0259zdi\u201d). On the same day the Collegium of the ABA decided to refer Mr Bagirov\u2019s case to a court, with a view to his disbarment. It also decided to suspend his activity as an advocate (v\u0259killik f\u0259aliyy\u0259ti) pending a decision by the court.", "46. It appears from documents submitted to the Court that, following Mr Bagirov\u2019s suspension as an advocate, the domestic authorities stopped allowing him to meet the applicant in prison.", "47. On 29 March 2015 Mr Bagirov sent a letter to the Head of the Prison Service of the Ministry of Justice asking for a meeting with six of his clients who were held in detention, including the applicant. He specified in his letter that he was representing those individuals before the Court, and requested a meeting with them in connection with their pending cases. The relevant part of the letter reads:", "\u201cI am writing to inform you that I represent the following individuals, who are detained in the penal facilities and temporary detention centres under your authority, before the European Court of Human Rights.", "I ask you to allow a meeting with these individuals in connection with the progress of their cases based on their applications lodged with the European Court (the numbers of which are stated below):", "...", "6. Jafarov Rasul Agahasan oglu (Baku Detention Facility, application no. 69981/14)", "Attachment: Copies of letters from the European Court and the Azerbaijani government concerning these individuals.\u201d", "48. A copy of the letter was also sent to the Head of the Serious Crimes Department of the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office.", "49. By a letter of 14 April 2015, the Deputy Head of the Prison Service refused to allow Mr Bagirov to meet the applicant in prison. The relevant part of the letter reads:", "\u201cYour request for a meeting in the penal facilities and detention centres with the individuals detained in the penal facilities and with convicted inmates in order to provide them with advocacy services has been considered.", "In explanation, as your advocacy activity at Law Office no. 6 has been suspended by decision no. 29 of 10 December 2014 of the Bar Association of the Republic of Azerbaijan and you have been disbarred, and [as a result of the fact that] as of that date you can no longer practise as an advocate in court and investigation proceedings, it is impossible to grant you access to the penal establishments as counsel.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["18", "34", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
