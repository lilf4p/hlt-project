MONTENEGRO", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 14+8 - Prohibition of discrimination (Article 14 - Discrimination) (Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life;Positive obligations;Article 8-1 - Respect for private life);Non-pecuniary damage - award (Article 41 - Non-pecuniary damage;Just satisfaction)", "JUDGES": "Julia Laffranque;Neboj\u0161a Vu\u010dini\u0107;Paul Lemmens;Robert Spano;St\u00e9phanie Mourou-Vikstr\u00f6m", "TEXT": ["6. The applicant was born in 1960. He currently lives in Belgium, but at the material time lived in Podgorica, Montenegro.", "7. The applicant is a Roma and a Muslim. On an unspecified date in 2006 the applicant and his family moved into an apartment in a building constructed for socially disadvantaged families. According to the applicant, because of constant attacks in which his car and the apartment were damaged, the perpetrators of which were never found, he installed a camera outside his apartment.", "8. On 26 May 2009 the applicant\u2019s next-door neighbour, Y, was watching a kickboxing match between a Montenegrin and a Bosnian contestant on television. The applicant overheard the next-door conversation as the doors of both his and Y\u2019s (adjacent) terraces were open. When the Bosnian kickboxer appeared with his coaches, all of whom were Muslim, Y allegedly said that he would slaughter one of them, and X, another neighbour, made a disparaging reference to the Bosnian kickboxer\u2019s Turkish descent. According to the applicant, X left Y\u2019s apartment at a certain point and went to his car, from which he took a gun. Y said \u201cturn it to the left\u201d, which was the direction of the applicant\u2019s terrace. This was followed by nine to ten gunshots, and Y\u2019s calling out insulting references to the applicant\u2019s \u201cTurkish mother\u201d. X, Y and Y\u2019s family picked up the spent cartridges from the ground afterwards.", "9. On 9 September 2009 three neighbours, V (Y\u2019s wife), S and B, were talking on the next-door terrace. As he was on his terrace, the applicant overheard the conversation. V said that she was fighting \u201ccockroaches, frogs, nits and lice, and all sorts of other things\u201d, which had been brought by \u201cthose dirty gipsies\u201d (\u201cod ovija gabelj\u010dina\u201d). V continued by saying that B and S \u201c[could] use a hammer and a pruning knife (kosijer), and [she] would use an axe\u201d. S replied that \u201cher [people] carried swords\u201d. V said that the axe could serve just as well. S answered \u201cno, no, he is a Muslim, I have a sword\u201d. B said \u201call is fine, whatever is more readily available\u201d (\u201cvalja \u0161to god prije stigne\u201d). V said loudly \u201cAn axe, an axe, a sledgehammer, like the one used on pigs\u201d.", "10. On 15 September 2009 Y was having an argument with M, another neighbour, when X joined and said, among other things, that if he \u201csaw red\u201d, he would \u201ckill both you and your brother here like a dog\u201d (\u201ce \u0107u te ubit ka psa i tebe i brata o\u0111e\u201d), apparently pointing at the applicant\u2019s apartment, adding \u201cdirty gypsy\u201d (\u201ccigane glibavi\u201d) and \u201ctrash\u201d (\u201covo sme\u0107e\u201d). This was witnessed by M\u2019s brother, D. It is unclear from the casefile if the applicant was present during the argument or if he learned about it in some other manner.", "11. On 22 September 2009, the day of Ramadan Bayram, a religious holiday celebrated by the applicant and his family, a large cross was drawn on the applicant\u2019s apartment door, and a large message was written on the wall next to it saying \u201cmove out or you\u2019ll bitterly regret it\u201d (\u201cseli se, usko \u0107e ti bit\u201d). The applicant called the police, who came and took photographs of the cross and the message. The same day the applicant lodged a criminal complaint with the police against the families of X, Y, S and B, and one more family living in the building.", "12. Between 19 and 22 October 2009 the police interviewed X, Y, V, B, M, D, and three other neighbours.", "13. X, Y, V, and B denied the applicant\u2019s allegations. X and Y also denied that they had watched the match together, and Y submitted that everything he had said had been addressed to the Bosnian kickboxer. Both X and Y confirmed that they had heard the shots but said they did not know who had fired them. Y and his children had indeed picked up the spent cartridges from the ground, not in order to hide anything, but because the children found the spent cartridges interesting to play with. Neither X nor Y knew who was responsible for the incident of 22 September 2009, but they suspected the applicant himself.", "14. V submitted that the discussion of 9 September 2009 had referred to another person sought by the police at the time in relation to various attacks, and they had been discussing how they would defend themselves in the event of an attack. B denied that she had been in V\u2019s apartment on that occasion.", "15. M confirmed that during the argument with Y, X had come and said that if he \u201csaw red\u201d he would \u201ckill them, as well as this gypsy\u201d (\u201cnapravi\u0107u d\u017eenaze i vama, a i ovom ciganinu\u201d), pointing in the direction of the applicant\u2019s flat. M had assumed that he had meant the applicant. D confirmed M\u2019s statement.", "16. The other two neighbours were not aware of any conflicts amongst the neighbours, or that anybody ill-treated or insulted the applicant on the basis of his national origin. They had no idea who could be responsible for the incident of 22 September 2009. The third neighbour, N.L., confirmed the applicant\u2019s submissions in relation to another incident (see paragraph 30 (b) below).", "17. On 26 October 2009 the case file was transmitted to the State prosecutor\u2019s office (Osnovno dr\u017eavno tu\u017eila\u0161tvo) in order to assess whether there were any elements of the criminal offence of jeopardising someone\u2019s security (ugro\u017eavanje sigurnosti).", "18. On 18 November 2009 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint with the higher State prosecutor\u2019s office (Vi\u0161e dr\u017eavno tu\u017eila\u0161tvo) in Podgorica in relation to the above events. He filed the complaint against X, Y, V, S and B for incitement to ethnic, racial and religious hatred, discontent and intolerance (izazivanje nacionalne, rasne i vjerske mr\u017enje, razdora i netrpeljivosti, hereinafter \u201chate crime\u201d) in connection with discrimination, racial and otherwise (see paragraphs 38-39 below). He also enclosed relevant video material.", "19. On 24 November 2009 the higher State prosecutor\u2019s office rejected the complaint on the grounds that there were no elements of any hate crime or other criminal offence within its competence. The applicant was notified that he could take over the prosecution as a subsidiary prosecutor and that the case file had already been forwarded to the State prosecution service on 26 October 2009 (see paragraph 17 above).", "20. On 25 November 2009 the State prosecution service issued an official report (slu\u017ebena zabilje\u0161ka) finding that the impugned words of 26 May, as well as those of 9 September 2009, which referred to the use of swords and axes, had not been addressed to either the applicant or anybody close to him, and that the incident of 15 September 2009 could not be considered a threat. It was concluded that none of those three events had involved an element of jeopardising someone\u2019s security, or any other criminal offence subject to public prosecution. The incident of 22 September 2009, however, could be considered as jeopardising security. On 27 November 2009 the State prosecution service asked the police to undertake measures in order to find the perpetrator. At the same time the police were informed that the applicant\u2019s criminal complaint in this regard would be kept until the perpetrator was found, or until 22 September 2012, when the prosecution of that criminal offence would become time-barred. On 31 December 2009 the State prosecutor informed the applicant of this, as well as of the fact that he could file a criminal complaint against a specific person with appropriate evidence (uz valjane dokaze).", "21. On 14 December 2009 the applicant filed an application for an investigation (zahtjev za sprovo\u0111enje istrage) with the High Court (Vi\u0161i sud) in Podgorica. He enclosed the relevant videos, and proposed that the court hear a number of neighbours, including those he suspected.", "22. On 17 March 2010 the High Court dismissed that application for lack of evidence. In particular, the submitted video material was considered to be inadmissible, having been obtained without a prior court order, and the court observed that the suspected neighbours had denied that what they had said related to the applicant. It was further held that the applicant had not submitted any evidence in relation to the incident of 22 September 2009, nor had he called the police at the time to come to the scene and \u201ccollect the necessary material for further analysis\u201d in order to verify his suspicions.", "23. On 26 March 2010 the applicant appealed against that decision. He submitted, in particular, that on 22 September 2009 he had actually called the police, who had only taken photographs of the scene. The fact that they had failed to do what they should have done was in no way his fault, as it was not up to him to tell the police what to do, but only to lodge a criminal complaint, which he had done.", "24. On 31 May 2010 the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal for lack of evidence, in substance endorsing the reasoning of the High Court. In doing so, the court held that the applicant\u2019s objections as to the gathering of evidence by the police \u201ccould not be the subject of [that] court\u2019s assessment\u201d.", "25. On 19 July 2010 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal. He maintained, inter alia, that because of the failure of the domestic authorities to protect him and his family, they had had to move out of the apartment (see paragraph 35 below). He relied on the right to private life, the right to an effective domestic remedy, and the prohibition of discrimination.", "26. On 25 March 2014 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s constitutional appeal. It considered that it should be examined under Articles 6 and 14 of the Convention and corresponding Articles of the Montenegrin Constitution, and found there had been no violation of any of them.", "27. On 7 April 2016, as regards the incident of 22 September 2009, the police informed the State prosecutor\u2019s office that \u201c[they] had acted on [the applicant\u2019s] criminal complaint and undertaken measures in accordance with their authority, having dedicated a significant amount of time [to the complaint]. While carrying out those official actions [they] had not found material evidence which would undoubtedly indicate the perpetrator of this criminal offence\u201d.", "28. The Government submitted information from the applicant\u2019s criminal record reflecting convictions for minor offences in 1981, 1990 and 2002. For each of these offences he had received a suspended sentence.", "29. On 20 December 2007 the applicant was celebrating Bayram. X and Y claimed before the domestic bodies that the applicant had celebrated inappropriately by playing loud music from very early in the morning, shooting in the air and calling Turks and Wahhabi (vehabije) to jihad. He had apparently also tried to hit X with a flagpole (koplje od zastave). The applicant submitted that X and W (the husband of X\u2019s niece) had been insulting him and his family, while X had also spat on him, shouted obscenities and thrown stones at him, causing him minor physical injuries. On 30 September 2008 the applicant was found guilty in misdemeanour proceedings of disturbing public order and peace (naru\u0161avanje javnog reda i mira) by shooting several shots in the air from his starting pistol on 20 December 2007. He was sentenced to a ten-day period of imprisonment and the pistol was confiscated. The decision was upheld by a secondinstance body on 23 December 2008. In relation to the same incident, on 29 July 2008 X and W were charged with violent behaviour against the applicant. In the course of the proceedings, a medical expert witness submitted that the applicant had a contusion (nagnje\u010denje) on the left part of the back of his head, which would have been classified as a minor physical injury at the time it had been inflicted. The medical expert submitted that the injury had been caused by a blunt object, possibly a \u201clarger stone\u201d, and that it could not have been caused by sand or \u201cstones the size of beans\u201d. On 24 May 2011, after the case had been remitted, the Court of First Instance acquitted X and W, considering that it had not been proved that they had committed the offence.", "30. The applicant reported the following events to the police, but to no avail: (a) on 6 October 2008 an unknown person had thrown a brick and broken one of the windows of his apartment; (b) on 11 September 2009 S and her husband, Z, had tried to hit the applicant\u2019s parked car with their own car; this was confirmed by another neighbour, N.L., who witnessed this event and was interviewed by the police in October 2009 (see paragraph 16 above); (c) on 16 October 2009 S had asked Y aloud if he was going to \u201cslaughter\u201d somebody, and he had answered that he was, both of them looking at the applicant; S had said that he would \u201cmake [his] car dirty with that man\u201d; (d) on 19 December 2009 an unknown person had fired several shots in front of the applicant\u2019s apartment, below the children\u2019s bedroom; the applicant gave the police eight bullet shells that he had found on the ground; (e) on 1 January 2010, shortly after midnight, X had thrown firecrackers at the applicant\u2019s car and broken its windscreen; he had also thrown a glass bottle at the applicant and a metal bar at his son, swearing profusely and threatening to slaughter them all; this had been followed by gunshots.", "31. On 21 October, 23 October and 30 October 2009 X, V and M.\u0106. respectively lodged criminal complaints against the applicant for insulting and provoking them, and for playing loud music and calling Turks and Wahhabi to jihad. On 25 December 2009 those complaints were rejected by the State prosecutor.", "32. On 24 April 2010 the Court of First Instance (Osnovni sud) in Podgorica found the applicant guilty of recording Y without authorisation and eavesdropping (prislu\u0161kivanje) on him, and sentenced him to 40 days\u2019 imprisonment, suspended for a period of one year. That judgment was upheld by the High Court on 15 October 2010. On 26 December 2012 the Constitutional Court dismissed a constitutional appeal by the applicant in this regard.", "33. On 7 May 2010 the applicant was fined 800 euros (EUR) in minor offence proceedings (prekr\u0161ajni postupak) for threatening (izazivanje osje\u0107aja ugro\u017eenosti) V, a decision which was upheld on 7 July 2010.", "34. On 26 May 2010 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint against X with the State prosecution service, alleging that in August and September 2009 he had threatened to \u201ccut [the applicant\u2019s] gypsy head off and impale it on a pike\u201d (nabiti na kolac). On 27 July 2010 the deputy State prosecutor rejected the criminal complaint. On 12 August 2010 the applicant filed a private criminal action (optu\u017eni predlog) against X, who was acquitted by the Court of First Instance on 7 June 2011. The court found that X had indeed said the impugned words in front of a witness, and that the words could have made the applicant feel frightened and insecure, but the court could not accept \u201cthat [the applicant] had taken those words seriously, especially since the witness, who was the only one who had heard the words, had not taken them seriously, which was why he had informed the applicant about them only two months later\u201d. That decision was upheld by the High Court on 7 March 2012.", "35. On 6 July 2010 X threatened the applicant\u2019s daughter by saying that he would kill and slaughter them all, with his hands stretched towards her neck. The girl apparently fainted and was admitted to hospital unconscious. The same day the applicant and his family moved out of their apartment. They were allegedly on a hunger strike for the next twenty-four days, seeking help from various State institutions."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
