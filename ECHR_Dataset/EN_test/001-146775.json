The Government", "391. The Government did not contest the essential facts underlying each application. However, they noted that some of the applicants had not been consistent in their descriptions of the abductors and that the abductions had taken place on various dates and in different districts. The Government pointed out that the abductions could have been perpetrated by members of illegal armed groups in the guise of State servicemen, using uniforms and documents similar to those used by the latter. They further claimed that none of the investigations had obtained evidence proving beyond reasonable doubt that State agents had been involved in the abductions and alleged deaths of the applicants\u2019 relatives.", "2. The applicants", "392. The applicants submitted that it had been established \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d that the men who had taken their relatives away had been State agents. In support of that assertion they referred to the ample evidence contained in their submissions and the criminal investigation files. They also submitted that they had each made a prima facie case that their relatives had been abducted by State agents and that the essential facts underlying their complaints had not been challenged by the Government. In view of the absence of any news of their relatives for a long time and the life-threatening nature of unacknowledged detention in the region at the relevant time, they asked the Court to consider their relatives dead.", "B. The Court\u2019s assessment", "1. General principles", "393. The Court shall examine the applications at hand in the light of the general principles applicable in cases where the factual circumstances are in dispute between the parties (see El Masri v. \u201cthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d [GC], no. 39630/09, \u00a7\u00a7 151-53, ECHR2012).", "394. The Court has addressed a whole series of cases concerning allegations of disappearances in Chechnya and Ingushetia. Applying the abovementioned principles, it has concluded that if applicants make a prima facie case of abduction by servicemen, this is sufficient for them to show that their relatives fell within the control of the authorities, and it is then for the Government to discharge their burden of proof either by disclosing the documents in their exclusive possession or by providing a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred (see, among many examples, Aslakhanova and Others, cited above, \u00a7 99). If the Government fail to rebut that presumption, this will entail a violation of Article 2 of the Convention in its substantive part. Conversely, where applicants fail to make a prima facie case, the burden of proof cannot be reversed (see, for example, Tovsultanova v. Russia, no. 26974/06, \u00a7\u00a7 77-81, 17 June 2010; Movsayevy v. Russia, no. 20303/07, \u00a7 76, 14 June 2011; and Shafiyeva v. Russia, no. 49379/09, \u00a7 71, 3 May 2012).", "395. The Court has also found in many cases concerning disappearances that a missing person may be presumed dead. Having regard to the numerous cases of disappearances in Chechnya and Ingushetia which have come before it, the Court has found that in the particular context of the conflict in the region, when a person has been detained by unidentified State agents without any subsequent acknowledgment of the detention, this could be regarded as lifethreatening (see, among many others, Yandiyev and Others v. Russia, nos. 34541/06, 43811/06 and 1578/07, 10 October 2013, and Dovletukayev and Others v. Russia, cited above).", "396. The Court has made findings of presumptions of deaths in the absence of any reliable news about the disappeared persons for periods ranging from four years (see Askhabova v. Russia, no. 54765/09, \u00a7 137, 18 April 2013) to more than ten years.", "397. A number of witness statements collected by the applicants, along with the documents from the investigation file furnished by the Government (see, for example, paragraphs 19-26 above), demonstrate that the applicants\u2019 relatives, Mr Alikhan Sultygov and Mr Visadi Samrailov, were abducted on 4 August 2000 by a group of armed servicemen at the checkpoint on the outskirts of Grozny. In view of all the materials in its possession, the Court finds that the applicants have presented a prima facie case that their relatives were abducted by State agents in the circumstances as set out by them.", "398. The Government did not provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation for the events in question. Therefore, they failed to discharge their burden of proof.", "399. Bearing in mind the general principles enumerated above, the Court finds that Mr Alikhan Sultygov and Mr Visadi Samrailov were taken into custody by State agents on 4 August 2000 in Grozny.

The Court finds that in all of the cases presently before it the applicants\u2019 relatives were abducted by armed men in uniforms, displaying behaviour characteristic of servicemen carrying out security operations. Their behaviour and appearance, their ability to pass through roadblocks and to cordon off areas, along with their use of military-type vehicles even during curfew hours, lead the Court to conclude that, in all probability, they could be none other than State servicemen. The applicants\u2019 allegations are supported by the witness statements collected by them and by the domestic investigations.
