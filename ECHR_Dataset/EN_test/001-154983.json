The applicant, Ljubljanska banka d.d., Ljubljana (hereafter \u201cthe applicant bank\u201d or \u201cthe Ljubljana Bank\u201d) is a joint stock company incorporated under Slovenian law. Its registered office is in Ljubljana.", "2. Before the economic reforms that were carried out in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (hereafter \u201cthe SFRY\u201d) in 1989-90, its commercial banking system consisted of \u201cbasic\u201d and \u201cassociated\u201d banks. Basic banks had separate legal personality, but were integrated into the organisational structure of one of the nine associated banks. As a rule, basic banks were founded and controlled by socially-owned companies based in the same territorial unit (that is, in one of the Republics \u2013 Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia \u2013 or Autonomous Provinces \u2013 Kosovo and Vojvodina). Socially-owned companies were the flagship of the Yugoslav model of self-management: neither private nor State-owned, they were a collective property controlled by their employees, based on a communist vision of industrial relations. At least two basic banks could form an associated bank (see Ali\u0161i\u0107 and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no. 60642/08, \u00a7 12, 16 July 2014).", "3. The Ljubljana Bank (in Slovenian and Croatian: Ljubljanska banka) was founded in 1955 under the laws of the then Socialist Republic of Slovenia. In 1969 it opened an office in Zagreb in the then Socialist Republic of Croatia. From 1978 until 1 January 1990 the Ljubljana Bank Ljubljana (hereafter \u201cthe Ljubljana Bank Head Office\u201d) operated as an \u201cassociated bank\u201d (in Slovenian: Ljubljanska banka \u2013 zdru\u017eena banka) and was composed of Ljubljana Basic Bank Sarajevo, Ljubljana Basic Bank Zagreb, Ljubljana Basic Bank Skopje and a number of other basic banks. In the same period the Ljubljana Bank\u2019s Zagreb office operated as a \u201cbasic bank\u201d, that is, as the Ljubljana Basic Bank Zagreb (in Croatian: Ljubljanska banka \u2013 Osnovna banka Zagreb) and had separate legal personality under the law of the then Socialist Republic of Croatia. It was, however, integrated into the organisational structure of the Ljubljana Bank (see Kova\u010di\u0107 and Others v. Slovenia [GC], nos. 44574/98, 45133/98 and 48316/99, \u00a7\u00a7 27-31, 3 October 2008, and Ali\u0161i\u0107 and Others, loc. cit.)", "4. Within the framework of the 1989-90 reforms, the SFRY abolished the system of basic and associated banks described above. This shift in the banking regulations allowed some basic banks to opt for an independent status, while others became branches (without legal personality) of the former associated banks to which they had belonged (see Ali\u0161i\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 21).", "5. On 19 December 1989 the Ljubljana Bank Head Office was re-registered as a joint stock company (in Slovenian: delni\u0161ka dru\u017eba, \u201cd.d.\u201d) in the then Socialist Republic of Slovenia. The change was entered in the register of commercial companies the same day and became effective on 1 January 1990 (see Ali\u0161i\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 21, and Kova\u010di\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 32 and 46).", "6. On 29 December 1989 the Ljubljana Basic Bank Zagreb was re-registered with effect from 1 January 1990 as the Zagreb Main Branch (in Slovenian and Croatian: Ljubljanska banka d.d. Ljubljana \u2013 Glavna filijala Zagreb, hereinafter: \u201cthe Ljubljana Bank Zagreb Main Branch\u201d) in the registers of commercial companies in both the then Socialist Republic of Slovenia and the Socialist Republic of Croatia (see Kova\u010di\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 33 and 48), that is, as a business unit of the Ljubljana Bank (in Slovenian: del podjetja, in Croatian: dio poduze\u0107a) without legal personality (see paragraph 22 below).", "7. Shortly after its declaration of independence on 25 June 1991, Slovenia nationalised the Ljubljana Bank. In 1994, it restructured the bank by virtue of the 1994 Amendments to the 1991 Constitutional Act Implementing the Fundamental Constitutional Charter on the Sovereignty and Independence of the Republic of Slovenia. Most of the bank\u2019s assets and a part of its liabilities were transferred to a new bank \u2013 the New Ljubljana Bank (Nova Ljubljanska banka, see paragraph 43 below). The old Ljubljana Bank was initially administered by the Bank Rehabilitation Agency of Slovenia. It is now controlled by a Slovenian Government agency \u2013 the Succession Fund (see Ali\u0161i\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 49, and Kova\u010di\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 52, 60 and 62-65).", "8", "9. On 15 November 1991 the applicant bank instituted enforcement proceedings before the Osijek Commercial Court (Trgova\u010dki sud u Osijeku) against the company IPK Tvornica \u0161e\u0107era Osijek d.o.o. (hereafter \u201cthe sugar factory\u201d) seeking payment of 11,401.20 Croatian kunas (HRK) together with the accrued statutory default interest. It relied on certified excerpts from its business records showing outstanding claims against the sugar factory arising out of loan agreements concluded on 25 November 1987 and 1 June and 11 December 1990.", "10. On 22 September 1992 the court issued a writ of execution (rje\u0161enje o izvr\u0161enju) ordering the sugar factory to pay the amount sought.", "11. On 31 May 1994 the applicant bank instituted another set of enforcement proceedings before the same court against the sugar factory seeking payment of HRK 137,698.99 together with the accrued statutory default interest. It again relied on certified excerpts from its business records showing outstanding claims against the sugar factory arising out of loan agreements concluded on 1 June and 26 October 1990.", "12. On 26 July 1994 the court issued a writ of execution ordering the sugar factory to pay the amount sought.", "13. On 21 September 1994 the applicant bank signed an agreement with IPK Osijek d.o.o. entitled \u201cProtocol on the settling of obligations of IPK Osijek and companies in its ownership toward the Ljubljana Bank\u201d (Protokol o na\u010dinu reguliranja obveza IPK Osijek i poduze\u0107a u njegovom vlasni\u0161tvu prema Ljubljanskoj banci, hereafter \u201cthe Protocol of 21 September 1994\u201d). The agreement acknowledged that IPK Osijek was unable to service its debts toward the applicant bank because its facilities were located in the zone affected by the Croatian War of Independence and had sustained substantial damage, which had significantly reduced its production capacities.", "14. The agreement further stipulated that the applicant bank\u2019s claims against the sugar factory (as one of the companies owned by IPK Osijek) were to be converted into shares of that company. However, it also mentioned that, while that arrangement had been accepted by the board of directors of the Ljubljana Bank Head Office, the Bank Rehabilitation Agency of Slovenia had not agreed to the conversion.", "15. Lastly, the agreement contained a non-enforcement clause (pactum de non petendo) whereby the applicant bank undertook not to seek enforcement of its claims against the companies owned by IPK Osijek until an inter-State agreement regulating the status of the Zagreb Branch of the applicant bank had been concluded. In particular, paragraphs 4 and 5 of the agreement read as follows:", "\u201c4. IPK Osijek and companies in its ownership have regulated their obligations toward Ljubljana Bank \u2013 Zagreb Main Branch by previous agreements, the decision of the Board of Directors of the Ljubljana Bank Head Office and this Protocol.", "A moratorium shall be placed on all obligations, all previous agreements and all decisions until the conclusion of an inter-State agreement on the status of Ljubljana Bank \u2013 Zagreb Main Branch. In that connection the Ljubljana Bank \u2013 Zagreb Main Branch, Zagreb, undertakes not to seek compulsory execution of its claims based on final court judgments.", "5. Ljubljana Bank \u2013 Zagreb Main Branch retains the right to pursue judicially its claims against IPK Osijek and companies in its ownership [but] only with a view to preventing those claims from becoming time-barred.\u201d", "16. On 8 October 1999 Croatia and Slovenia concluded a bilateral agreement on property issues (hereafter \u201cthe Bilateral Agreement\u201d). Paragraph 3 of Article 1 of the agreement expressly excluded the application of the Bilateral Agreement to issues related to the Zagreb Branch of the applicant bank (see paragraph 31 below).", "17. On 27 October 2003 the applicant bank asked the Osijek Commercial Court to continue the enforcement in both sets of proceedings. It did so because the sugar factory had started to make a profit again and because the Croatian Supreme Court had interpreted the Bilateral Agreement as narrowing the exclusion clause provided in paragraph 3 of Article 1 only to claims which Croatia as a State had against the Ljubljana Bank (see paragraph 32 below).", "18. In its response to the applicant bank\u2019s request to continue the enforcement, on 17 November 2003 the sugar factory replied that by signing the Protocol of 21 September 1994, the bank had agreed not to seek enforcement until the conclusion of an inter-State agreement regulating the status of the Zagreb Branch of the applicant bank, and that the terms of the Bilateral Agreement between Croatia and Slovenia were not the same as those envisaged in the Protocol of 21 September, which specifically excluded issues related to the Zagreb Branch of the applicant bank.", "19. By decisions of 15 and 16 December 2003 the Osijek Commercial Court stayed the two sets of enforcement proceedings. In so deciding, it entirely accepted the arguments advanced by the sugar factory. The relevant part of those decisions reads as follows:", "\u201cProceedings in this case shall be stayed until the conclusion of an inter-State agreement that would settle the enforcement issues between the creditor and the debtor.", "Given that the special agreement which would settle the enforcement issues between the creditor and the debtor has to date not been concluded, which means that this issue (section 12 of the Civil Procedure Act) has not been resolved yet, the court in accordance with section 213(1) of the Civil Procedure Act taken in conjunction with section 14 of the Enforcement Procedure Act, decided as stated in the operative provisions.\u201d", "20. On 30 December 2003 the applicant bank appealed against those decisions. It argued that (a) it had not had an opportunity to comment on the sugar factory\u2019s submissions of 17 November 2003 (see paragraph 18 above) as they had never been served on it; (b) the sugar factory was not a party to the Protocol of 21 September 1994 (see paragraphs 13-15 above), which was therefore inapplicable to the enforcement proceedings in question; (c) the protocol in any event referred to claims based on final court judgments (see paragraph 15 above) whereas the enforcement proceedings in question were based on excerpts from the bank\u2019s business records (see paragraphs 9 and 11 above); and (d) the contested decisions were contrary to the case-law of the Supreme Court, according to which the Bilateral Agreement only excluded issues relating to claims Croatia had against the bank (see paragraph 32 below) and thus did not prevent private individuals or companies from pursuing judicially their claims against the bank or vice versa.", "21. By decisions of 9 May and 20 June 2006 the High Commercial Court (Visoki trgova\u010dki sud Republike Hrvatske) dismissed the applicant bank\u2019s appeals and upheld the first-instance decisions. In addition to the reasons adduced in the contested decisions, that court also added that the proceedings should have been stayed for yet another reason, namely, because the Zagreb Main Branch had been deleted from the register of commercial companies in Croatia.", "22. The relevant part of the High Commercial Court\u2019s decision of 9 May 2006 reads as follows:", "\u201cIt is true that these proceedings were stayed until the conclusion of an inter-State agreement that would settle the enforcement issues between the creditor and the debtor. However, the case-file contains a certificate [issued] by the Zagreb Commercial Court ... of 22 August 2002 indicating that on 29 December 1989 the Zagreb Main Branch was, on the basis of the decision of the Ljubljana Basic Court [no.] Srg-3289/89, recorded as a business unit of the bank without legal personality, as a result of which on 5 June 1996 the subject was deleted from the register [of commercial companies] as a legal entity with effect from the date those facts had been established. It follows, given that the enforcement creditor no longer exists, that the first-instance court acted correctly when it stayed the proceedings because that was in accordance with section 212(1) subparagraph 4 of the Civil Procedure Act ...", "It follows from the foregoing that the appeal of the enforcement creditor is unfounded and thus had to be dismissed ...\u201d", "23. The relevant part of the High Commercial Court\u2019s decision of 20 June 2006 reads as follows:", "\u201cIt first has to be noted that the Ljubljana Bank \u2013 Zagreb Main Branch was deleted from the register of commercial companies [in Croatia] of the Zagreb Commercial Court ...", "The first-instance court stayed the proceedings, relying on section 213 of the Civil Procedure Act. However, the conditions for staying the proceedings on the basis of section 212(1) subparagraph 4 of the [same] Act have also been met.", "It follows from the foregoing that the first-instance court acted correctly when it stayed the proceedings. It further follows that the appeal of the Ljubljana Bank \u2013 Zagreb Main Branch is unfounded and thus had to be dismissed ...\u201d.", "24. On 18 October and 2 November 2006 the applicant bank lodged constitutional complaints against the decisions of the commercial courts alleging that its right to equality before the law, the right to a fair hearing and the right to appeal guaranteed by the Constitution, had been violated. In so doing, it reiterated the arguments it had made before the appellate court (see paragraph 20 above). It added that it was a foreign legal entity incorporated under Slovenian law and registered as such in the register of commercial companies in Slovenia. Therefore, contrary to the view of the High Commercial Court, the fact that its Zagreb Main Branch had been deleted from the register of commercial companies in Croatia did not mean that the entire company had ceased to exist as a legal entity within the meaning of section 212(1) subparagraph 4 of the Civil Procedure Act, which provided for the mandatory stay of proceedings in such cases (see paragraph 34 below). In that connection, the applicant bank in its constitutional complaints stated as follows:", "\u201c1. The Zagreb Commercial Court was not the court of registration for the enforcement creditor Ljubljana Bank as a legal entity.", "2. As the complainant has never been registered with the Zagreb Commercial Court, it could not have been deleted by that court either. That court is not the relevant court of registration for the complainant, given that the complainant\u2019s registered office is in Ljubljana and the complainant is a foreign legal entity ...", "...", "From the complainant\u2019s name it is evident that it is a joint stock company and that its registered office is in Ljubljana.", "Given that the complainant\u2019s seat as a joint stock company is in Ljubljana, Republic of Slovenia, the complainant is a foreign legal entity.", "...", "It follows from the excerpts from the register of commercial companies relevant for the complainant [that is, from the register of the Ljubljana District Court] that:", "- the complainant, Ljubljana Bank, was recorded in the register of commercial companies of the Ljubljana District Court ... on 19 December 1989 on the basis of the decision of the Ljubljana Basic Court no. Srg 2641/89.", "- on the basis of a decision of the Ljubljana Basic Court of 29 December 1989 no. Srg 3289/89 in the register folder ... of the complainant Ljubljana Bank as a joint stock company, the Zagreb Main Branch is recorded as a business unit of the complainant.", "...", "From the foregoing it is evident that the complainant Ljubljana Bank ran business on the territory of the Republic of Croatia through the Zagreb Main Branch as its business unit, the operation of which generated monetary claims that became due in the period between 31 August 1991 and 31 December 1991. These were pursued in enforcement proceedings against the debtor whose registered office is in the Republic of Croatia. After the dissolution of the SFRY, that is, after 8 October 1991 as the independence day of the Republic of Croatia, the Zagreb Main Branch as a business unit of the complainant became a business unit of a foreign bank.\u201d", "25. By decision of 24 November and 15 December 2006 the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) declared the applicant bank\u2019s constitutional complaints inadmissible. It held that the contested decisions did not involve the determination of the bank\u2019s rights or obligations, or of any criminal charge against it, within the meaning of section 62(1) of the Constitutional Court Act (see paragraph 33 below), and that therefore a constitutional complaint could not be lodged against those decisions. The Constitutional Court served both of its decisions on the applicant bank\u2019s representative on 27 December 2006.", "26. The applicant bank submitted that on the basis of calculations prepared by Z.R., an appointed court expert in finance, as of 15 June 2007 the claims it sought to enforce in the above two sets of enforcement proceedings against the sugar factory, including costs and the accrued statutory default interest, totalled HRK 422,041,634.40.", "27. The applicant bank claimed that the decisions to stay the proceedings had been made under the influence of Mr S.L., who had been the Deputy Prime Minister of Croatia in the period between 27 January 2000 and 22 December 2003. In support of its allegations it submitted three newspaper articles from two Croatian daily newspapers.", "28. On 9 March 2004 the business daily Dnevnik published on its front page an article entitled \u201cThe Ljubljana Bank is seizing [the assets of] Croatian companies\u201d (Ljubljanska banka plijeni hrvatske tvrtke). The front page featured a photograph of S.L. next to which there was a text that read as follows:", "\u201cS.L.: It is dubious that the Croatian courts are making awards in favour of a legal entity which actually does not exist.\u201d", "The article continued on page 3. Next to it, on the left side, there was a small column featuring another photograph of S.L. The column read as follows:", "\u201cThe first enforceable judgment against IPK [Osijek] in favour of the Ljubljana Bank was adopted in May 2003. However, as explained by the former Deputy Prime Minister S.L., one had managed to prevent the enforcement by disputing the adoption of the judgment in favour of a legal entity which does not formally exist in Croatia. For S.L. it is still dubious that the Croatian courts are making awards in favour of an inexistent legal entity because in such cases it is in his view questionable who is receiving that money.\u201d", "29. The article published in the daily Slobodna Dalmacija on 3 November 2006 entitled \u201cL.: I influenced the court\u201d (L.: Utjecao sam na sud) reads as follows:", "\u201cSlovenia\u2019s high representative for succession M.P. claims that the problem of the Ljubljana Bank would have been resolved a few years ago if the Deputy Prime Minister at the time, S.L., had not obstructed enforcement proceedings in which the bank should have received money to pay off its savers.", "S.L. himself admits that he influenced the enforcement of the Osijek court judgment according to which the money from a certain company had to be paid to some, as he says, strange people. He is persuaded that the money was not intended to be paid to savers, nor would they have ever seen it.", "\u2018There is not much point in commenting on shameful statements of Slovenian politicians who deny that they stole from the people who trusted them by depositing their money in their bank. That problem should not even have appeared and when it did the politicians were those who could have resolved it quickly and efficiently\u2019 L. states. The problem of recovering the debt [i.e. old foreign currency savings], he is convinced, can now be resolved only before the European court.\u201d", "30. The article prompted the reactions of several public figures, which were published in an article in the same daily newspapers the next day. In particular, the president of the Croatian Association of Judges at the time, Mr V.G., claimed that S.L. had committed a criminal offence and suggested that the Principal State Attorney bring criminal charges. The then president of the Parliamentary Judiciary Committee, Mr. E.T., stated that S.L. had grossly violated the Constitution, whereas a member of the same party as S.L., Mr. I.J., who was at the time the vice-president of that party\u2019s parliamentary \u201cclub\u201d, was more reserved, suggesting that S.L. might not have breached the law.", "31. The Bilateral Agreement between Croatia and Slovenia on Property Issues (Ugovor izme\u0111u Republike Hrvatske i Republike Slovenije o ure\u0111enju imovinskopravnih odnosa, Official Gazette of the Republic of Croatia \u2013 International Agreements nos. 15/99 and 4/00) was signed on 8 October 1999 and entered into force on 23 February 2000. The relevant Article reads as follows:", "\u201cThe provisions of this Agreement concern the resolution of property issues that arose before and after the Contracting Parties gained independence.", "...", "The resolution of issues related to Kr\u0161ko Nuclear Power Plant and the Ljubljana Bank \u2013 Zagreb Main Branch is not the subject of this Agreement, but shall be regulated by separate agreements.\u201d", "32. In its decisions nos. Gzz-166/02 of 27 February 2003 and Gzz-139/02 of 15 April 2003 and its judgment no. Rev 2029/01 of 16 March 2004, the Supreme Court interpreted Article 1 of the Bilateral Agreement in the following way:", "\u201cAccording to Article 1 paragraph 1 of the Agreement [its] provisions concern the resolution of property issues that arose before and after the Contracting Parties gained independence, whereas paragraph 3 of that Article stipulates that the resolution of issues relating to the Kr\u0161ko Nuclear Power Plant and the Ljubljana Bank \u2013 Zagreb Main Branch is not the subject of the Agreement but will be regulated by separate agreements.", "Property issues related to the Ljubljana Bank \u2013 Zagreb Main Branch [referred to in Article 1 paragraph 3 of the Agreement], are [legal] issues arising from contracts on savings deposits in foreign currency, which Croatian citizens concluded with that bank. In that connection, one should distinguish between foreign-currency savings deposits which the clients of the Ljubljana Bank transferred into public debt of the Republic of Croatia [on the basis of legislation allowing Croatian savers to transfer their foreign-currency savings at the Zagreb Main Branch to Croatian banks, enacted by Croatia after the Zagreb Main Branch stopped repaying them their savings] \u2013 in which case the contracts on savings deposits between [them] and the Ljubljana Bank were terminated (transferred foreign currency savings) and a new [legal] relationship between the Republic of Croatia and the Ljubljana Bank Zagreb Main Branch was created \u2013 from those cases where Croatian savers did not transfer their foreign currency savings deposits to Croatian banks or into public debt of the Republic of Croatia (non-transferred foreign-currency savings) [and where thus] contractual relations between [them] and the Ljubljana Bank regarding [their] foreign-currency savings deposits remained unchanged.", "In the opinion of this court, the subject of the inter-State agreement between the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Slovenia could have been only a [legal] relationship arising from the so-called transferred foreign-currency savings, because within that [legal] relationship Croatia is the holder of rights and obligations with respect to the Ljubljana Bank Zagreb Main Branch and was therefore entitled to negotiate those rights and obligations with third parties, in this case with the Republic of Slovenia. On the other hand, non-transferred foreign currency savings could not be, nor were they, the subject of the Agreement, which is why that legal relationship is not covered by Article 1 paragraph 3 [thereof].\u201d", "33.
