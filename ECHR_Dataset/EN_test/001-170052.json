ROMANIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 2 - Right to life (Article 2-1 - Effective investigation) (Procedural aspect)", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3;Egidijus K\u016bris;Iulia Motoc;Marko Bo\u0161njak;Nona Tsotsoria;Vincent A. De Gaetano;Gabriele Kucsko-Stadlmayer", "TEXT": ["5. The applicants, Dorina and Viorel-Aurel Ioni\u021b\u0103, were born in 1976 and 1972 respectively and live in Br\u0103ila.", "6. On 7 November 2005 the applicants\u2019 son, aged four years and nine months at that time, underwent surgery for the removal of polyps, which was performed by Dr C.B. in the State-run Br\u0103ila Emergency Hospital.", "7. Dr C.B. decided to perform the operation under general anaesthetic with tracheal intubation. The general anaesthesia was performed by Dr P.A, assisted by P.V.I., a staff nurse.", "8. After surgery the child was immediately transferred to the intensive care unit. Ten minutes after his transfer P.V.I. informed Dr P.A that the child was cyanotic and had no pulse.", "9. The child suffered a haemorrhage, causing blood to flood his lungs. A team of doctors tried to resuscitate him and clear his respiratory channels, but without any success. The child was declared dead two hours after the operation.", "10. A criminal investigation into the cause of death was opened by the Br\u0103ila police on the same day.", "11. Dr C.B. and Dr P.A. were questioned and gave written statements.", "12. An autopsy report issued by the Br\u0103ila Forensic Service (Serviciul de medicin\u0103 legal\u0103 Br\u0103ila) on 8 November 2005 said that the applicants\u2019 son had died of acute respiratory failure as a result of the blood that had blocked his airways and flooded his lungs. It also noted that the child had suffered from several congenital deficiencies which had probably played a role in the postoperative complications: myocardia and hepatic dystrophy, and interatrial septum aneurisms.", "13. The report was sent for the approval of the commission for confirmation and supervision of the Ia\u015fi Forensic Institute (Comisia de avizare \u0219i control din cadrul IMF Ia\u015fi). On 5 May 2006 the commission confirmed that the child\u2019s death had occurred after surgery and had been caused by the blood that had blocked his airways and lungs. It held that there had been a causal link between the post-operative treatment and the child\u2019s death. It noted the deflation of the balloon of the catheter (balona\u015ful sondei de \u00eentuba\u0163ie), applied after post-operatively to prevent the ingress of blood into the lungs, as a possible cause of the presence of blood there and in his airways.", "14. On 12 October 2006 the superior commission of the Mina Minovici Forensic Institute examined all the documents and approved the conclusions of the commission for confirmation and supervision of the Ia\u015fi Forensic Institute.", "15. On 8 November 2005 the child\u2019s father lodged a disciplinary complaint against Dr C.B. and Dr P.A.", "16. The disciplinary committee of the Br\u0103ila College of Doctors opened an investigation into the patient\u2019s death, collecting documents from the patient\u2019s medical file and taking statements from Dr C.B. and Dr P.A., as well as from the doctors involved in the resuscitation procedure postoperation. It gave its decision on 9 July 2007 by which it concluded that the child\u2019s death could be included among cases of sudden death (with a frequency of 2-4 % owing to the child\u2019s pre-existing medical conditions: myocardia and hepatic dystrophy, and inter-atrial septum aneurisms). Although the committee concluded that there had been no direct link between the child\u2019s death and the doctors\u2019 medical conduct, it reprimanded both doctors for their failure to perform the necessary pre-surgical medical tests and to seek the applicants\u2019 informed consent before surgery.", "17. The applicants objected to the committee\u2019s conclusions and their appeal was examined by the superior disciplinary committee of the National College of Doctors.", "18. An expert medical opinion was submitted to the committee and was used by it in reaching its final conclusions. The expert noted, among other things, that the child\u2019s preparation for surgery had not been appropriate as his examination before anaesthesia had been \u201cvery superficial\u201d; in this respect the committee noted the lack of a radioscopy of the lungs, of an EKG and an exploration of the necessary time for blood coagulation. In the expert\u2019s view, the doctors had ignored the child\u2019s severe congenital deficiencies as they had considered that surgery for the removal of polyps had been a \u201cminor intervention\u201d and therefore no special precautions had been necessary.", "19. By a decision of 6 June 2008 the superior disciplinary committee of the National College of Doctors quashed the decision of 9 July 2007 and fined each doctor 1,000 Romanian lei (the equivalent of approximately 220 euros (EUR)). It found that the child\u2019s pre-surgical tests had been insufficient for avoiding post-operative complications. Therefore, it held that Dr C.B. and Dr P.A. had infringed Article 53 of the Medical Deontological Code, pursuant to which a doctor should perform diagnoses with maximum diligence in order to determine the adequate treatment and avoid predictable complications that might occur for a patient under his or her care.", "20. The committee further stated that the presence of blood in the child\u2019s airways could not be explained on the basis of the documents and statements in the file. It noted that all the doctors and the nurses who had given evidence stated that the balloon of the intubation catheter had been leakproof (etanche); however, the fact that the cause of death had been the presence of blood in the child\u2019s lungs could only lead to the conclusion that such statements had been inaccurate.", "21. Relying on Articles 58 and 60 of the Deontological Code and Article 6 of Law no. 46/2003, the committee also noted that the parents had not given their informed consent.", "22. On 7 November 2005 the applicants lodged a criminal complaint alleging that the flawed surgical and post-surgical treatment received by their son had resulted in his death. They asked that those responsible be identified and held accountable for their son\u2019s death. They joined the criminal proceedings as civil parties.", "23. Following a request of the Br\u0103ila Police Inspectorate, on 19 July 2006 Br\u0103ila Emergency Hospital stated that the medical staff members in charge of monitoring the child were Dr P.A. during the intervention and the child\u2019s transfer to the intensive care unit and P.V.I. while in the intensive care unit.", "24. On 5 January 2007 the prosecutor\u2019s office of the Br\u0103ila District Court decided to institute criminal proceedings against Dr P.A.", "25. P.V.I. was interviewed as a witness immediately after the child\u2019s death, during the preliminary criminal investigation. During the criminal proceedings against Dr P.A., in spite of the fact that she had been repeatedly summoned, the investigating authorities were not able to question her as she had not been found. She had left her job at the Br\u0103ila Emergency Hospital in January 2006.", "26. The prosecuting authorities interviewed several doctors and nurses from the hospital\u2019s medical staff who had been involved in the applicants\u2019 son\u2019s post-operative care.", "27. Dr P.A. lodged a request with the investigating body for a new forensic medical report. He pointed out that there were major contradictions between the autopsy report and the opinion issued by the commission for confirmation and supervision of the Ia\u015fi Forensic Institute.", "28. On 4 April 2007 the Br\u0103ila Police Inspectorate asked the Ia\u015fi Forensic Institute to carry out a forensic expert report that would identify the cause and circumstances of the child\u2019s death. The Ia\u015fi Forensic Institute replied that a new forensic report could not be produced as the evidence examined had been sent by Br\u0103ila Forensic Service to the Mina Minovici National Forensic Institute.", "29. On 20 February 2008 Dr P.A. submitted an extrajudicial expert report. It stated that the cause of death had not been the presence of blood in the child\u2019s lungs owing to a lack of adequate post-operative monitoring, but the post-operative reaction of a child with pre-existing medical conditions (cardiac congenital malformation, hepatic dystrophy, renal stasis, mesenteric adenopathy and hemorrhagic enterocolitis) mentioned in the medical records kept by the child\u2019s paediatrician. The report noted a generalised inflammatory reaction associated with diffused haemorrhages in his digestive tract, lungs, heart and spleen.", "30. The applicants gave evidence to the investigating authorities on 23 January 2008. They contended that they had not been properly informed about the risks of surgery and of the general anaesthetic and consequently they had not given their consent for such interventions.", "31. On 30 June 2008 the Br\u0103ila Police Inspectorate ordered that a new forensic report be produced by the Mina Minovici National Forensic Institute. The applicants, Dr P.A. and the investigating authorities submitted several questions for the forensic experts. They asked, among other things, whether the pre-existent medical condition of the child had influenced his unfavourable post-surgical evolution and whether administration of a general anaesthetic had been the right option, given the age and the diagnosis of the child. The child\u2019s father also asked the Forensic Institute whether the post-operative monitoring of the child had been adequate.", "32. However, on 28 July 2008 the Forensic Institute replied that it could not deliver such a report because under the relevant domestic legislation a new forensic expert report could not be ordered unless there were new medical and factual elements. Accordingly, the Forensic Institute stated that it maintained its previous opinion.", "33. Copies of the documents from the disciplinary file were added to the criminal file.", "34. On 30 September 2008 the prosecutor\u2019s office of the Br\u0103ila County Court decided to discontinue the criminal proceedings against Dr P.A., finding, in the light of evidence gathered in the case, that there had been no element of criminal negligence in his conduct. That decision was upheld on 10 November 2008 by the chief prosecutor of the same prosecutor\u2019s office.", "35. A complaint by the applicants against the prosecutors\u2019 decisions was allowed by the Br\u0103ila District Court on 25 February 2009. The prosecutors\u2019 decisions were quashed and the District Court kept the file for fresh consideration. It considered that although a new forensic report had not been produced, the decision of the superior committee of the National College of Doctors provided enough information concerning the cause of death, which had been the presence of blood in the child\u2019s airways owing to the balloon of the tracheal catheter not being tight enough. It considered that it should be established whether the post-operative monitoring of the child by Dr P.A. had been appropriate and more precisely whether Dr P.A. should have noticed the non-functioning catheter.", "36. Dr C.B. and Dr P.A. gave statements before the District Court on 18 January 2010. Moreover, members of the medical staff that had attempted resuscitation gave evidence (on 1 March, 20 April and 8 June 2008). Some of them maintained that the blood in the lungs could be explained by the resuscitation attempts and that the balloon of the catheter had been kept tight all the time after surgery.", "37. P.V.I. did not give evidence before the court as, although summoned, she did not attend the hearings. According to several reports issued by bailiffs seeking to bring her before the court, she had left the country for Italy. Based on the material in the case file it does not appear that the court took special measures to identify her address there.", "38. The child\u2019s father gave evidence before the Br\u0103ila District Court on 18 January 2010. He reiterated his claims for pecuniary and nonpecuniary damages. He again contended that the doctors had not informed his family about the risks of surgery and in particular of the general anaesthetic and accordingly they had not given their informed consent.", "39. On 1 October 2010, after several hearings, the Br\u0103ila District Court acquitted Dr P.A. and dismissed the applicants\u2019 civil claim as unfounded.", "40. The District Court took into account the extrajudicial forensic report submitted by Dr P.A. It noted that the conclusions of the extrajudicial report were in total contradiction to the conclusions of the medical report of 8 November 2005 and the conclusions of the commission for confirmation and supervision of the Ia\u015fi Forensic Institute.", "41. This judgment was upheld by a decision of the Br\u0103ila County Court delivered on 21 December 2010.", "42. The County Court did not take into account the conclusions of the extrajudicial forensic report as in its opinion it represented only extrajudicial evidence which could not set aside the conclusions of competent forensic institutes.", "43. The County Court concluded that the death of the child had been caused by the presence of blood in his airways and lungs. However, based on the evidence in the file, it was not possible to explain when the blood had entered the child\u2019s airways because of the deflation of the catheter\u2019s balloon. Moreover, the post-operative complications occurred ten minutes after the child had been transferred to the intensive care unit, while under the supervision of P.V.I. The County Court held therefore that Dr P.A. could not be held responsible for the deflation of the catheter\u2019s balloon after surgery.", "44. The applicants lodged an appeal on points of law against that decision. They requested that the court extend the criminal investigation to P.V.I., who had had the child under her supervision in the intensive care unit.", "45. By a decision of 15 April 2011 the Gala\u0163i Court of Appeal allowed the applicant\u2019s appeal and quashed the decisions of the lower courts. Noting that the lower courts had not examined the allegation made by the child\u2019s parents that they had not given their consent for surgery and the general anaesthesia, the appeal court sent the file back to the Br\u0103ila District Court.", "46. On 22 December 2011 the Br\u0103ila District Court acquitted Dr P.A. It held that no causal link existed between the death of the child and the presumed omission of the medical authorities to obtain the applicants\u2019 informed consent for the administration of a general anaesthetic.", "47. It further held that it could not establish beyond any reasonable doubt that Dr P.A. had been negligent in ensuring the tightness of the catheter\u2019s balloon after surgery. Consequently, the court dismissed the applicants\u2019 civil claim as unfounded.", "48. The court also dismissed the applicants\u2019 request to extend the criminal investigation to P.V.I. on the grounds that, under Article 337 \u00a7 1 of the CCP, only the prosecutor could ask for the extension of the investigation to other persons while the proceedings were pending before the courts.", "49. This judgment was upheld by a final decision delivered by the Gala\u0163i Court of Appeal on 22 May 2012.", "50. On 28 October 2008 the applicants instituted separate civil proceedings against the Br\u0103ila Emergency Hospital and doctors C.B. and P.A. in the Br\u0103ila District Court for the pecuniary and nonpecuniary damages they had sustained as a result of their son\u2019s death.", "51. On 23 April 2009, referring to Article 19 of the CCP (see paragraph 57 below), the court stayed the civil proceedings pending a final decision in the criminal proceedings. It noted that the outcome of the civil proceedings would depend to a large extent on the verdict in the criminal proceedings.", "52. On 29 January 2013 the Br\u0103ila District Court lifted the stay of the civil proceedings. However, the applicants gave up their separate civil claim on 6 March 2013."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
