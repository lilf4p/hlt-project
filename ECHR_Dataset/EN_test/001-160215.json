The applicant was born in 1992 and lives in Diyarbak\u0131r.", "5. On 14 July 2008 a demonstration was held in Diyarbak\u0131r to protest about the conditions of detention of Abdullah \u00d6calan, the leader of the PKK (Kurdish Workers\u2019 Party), an illegal armed organisation.", "6. According to a report prepared by four police officers on 21 July 2008 following the examination of video footage of the demonstration recorded by the police, on 11 July 2008 the F\u0131rat News Agency, a website which was controlled by the PKK, had published a declaration of the Democratic People\u2019s Initiative of Turkey and Kurdistan. The declaration contained instructions to hold meetings and marches in each town and city on 14 July 2008 to show support for Abdullah \u00d6calan. The report also stated that on the website www.rojaciwan.com, which was also controlled by the PKK, a news article containing a call for participation in the reading out of a press statement to be held by the Party for a Democratic Society (Demokratik Toplum Partisi (DTP)) in Diyarbak\u0131r on 14 July 2008 had been published.", "7. The report stated that the police had received information according to which the Diyarbak\u0131r branch of the DTP was the organiser of the press statement to be held and MPs, mayors and local politicians from the DTP as well as members of a number of non-governmental organisations would gather in front of the DTP\u2019s Diyarbak\u0131r party office at around 5.30 p.m. and march to Ko\u015fuyolu Park, where they would make a press statement. The police took the necessary measures as they suspected that there could be violent protests during the march, which could become a demonstration for the PKK.", "8. According to the police report, people started to assemble by 4.30 p.m. in front of the DTP party office. Mayors and MPs were among the demonstrators. By 5.50 p.m. approximately 3,000 people had gathered. Thereafter, demonstrators started to march, arriving at 6.30 p.m.at Ko\u015fuyolu Park, where the press statement was made. At 7 p.m. while Emine Ayna, a Member of Parliament from the DTP, was giving a speech, a group of people started throwing stones at the police officers and the cars parked in the neighbourhood. Both in front of the local branch of the DTP and during the march, demonstrators chanted slogans praising Abdullah \u00d6calan, such as \u201cEvery Kurd is \u00d6calan\u2019s fedai\u201d (\u201cHer K\u00fcrt Apo\u2019nun Fedaisidir\u201d), \u201cWe will drop the world without \u00d6calan on your head\u201d (\u201c\u00d6calans\u0131z d\u00fcnyay\u0131 ba\u015f\u0131n\u0131za y\u0131kar\u0131z\u201d), \u201cThe Youth to Botan, to the free country\u201d (\u201cGen\u00e7lik Botan\u2019a, \u00d6zg\u00fcr Vatana\u201d), \u201cSalutations to \u0130mral\u0131 \u201d (\u201cSelam Selam \u0130mral\u0131\u2019ya Bin Selam\u201d), \u201cWith our blood, with our life, we are with you, \u00d6calan\u201d (\u201cCan\u0131m\u0131zla, kan\u0131m\u0131zla, seninleyiz \u00d6calan\u201d) , \u201cLong live President \u00d6calan\u201d (\u201cBiji Serok Apo\u201d), \u201cMartyrs are immortal\u201d (\u201c\u015eeh\u00eed Namirin\u201d), \u201cNo life without the Leader, Mr./Esteemed \u00d6calan\u201d (\u201cBa\u015fkans\u0131z ya\u015fam olmaz, Say\u0131n \u00d6calan\u201d). They carried banners which contained slogans such as \u201cStop the torture in \u0130mral\u0131\u201d (\u201c\u0130mral\u0131 i\u015fkencesine son\u201d) and \u201cWe make war for life, we die for peace\u201d (Ya\u015famak i\u00e7in sava\u015f\u0131r\u0131z; Bar\u0131\u015f i\u00e7in \u00f6l\u00fcr\u00fcz\u201d); photographs of Abdullah \u00d6calan and flags of the so-called \u201cConfederation\u201d were also brandished. Subsequent to the press statements, when the crowd dispersed, some people within the crowd knocked over waste containers and attacked the police and the shops in the neighbourhood with stones and bats while chanting slogans in support of the PKK and its leader. The police gave a warning to those people and asked them to disperse. The demonstrators refused to obey the warnings. As a result, the police had to use proportionate force against the group, who were holding an illegal demonstration. The police intervened using truncheons, water and tear gas. The police report also noted that some people had taken down the Turkish flag in the schoolyard of the Diyarbak\u0131r nursery school.", "9. At the end of the report it was noted that, according to the video footage, the applicant had thrown stones at the police together with a number of other persons and had acted with the group which had taken down the Turkish flag at the Diyarbak\u0131r nursery school.", "10. The report of 21 July 2008 also contained twenty-four photographs extracted from the video footage recorded by the police. In four photographs, the applicant is seen in a group of young men while, according to the police, throwing stones at the security forces. In two photographs, he is seen while standing together with a group of people by a flag pole. A total of six photographs concern the taking down of the Turkish flag; one photograph contains an image of a knocked-over waste container; and one other photograph shows a damaged passenger van. The remaining photographs contain images of demonstrators standing in front of a building or walking.", "11. The applicant was arrested on 21 July 2008. According to the arrest and transfer report, the video recording of the demonstration by the police showed that the applicant had thrown stones at the police officers and had been in the crowd which had taken down the Turkish flag in a schoolyard. The officers who drafted the report stated therein that the applicant had been informed of his rights when arrested and had been transferred to the children\u2019s branch of the Security Directorate, as he had been found to be a minor subsequent to a medical check. The applicant noted \u201cI am not signing\u201d and put his signature under that sentence on the report.", "12. On 22 July 2008 the applicant made statements before the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor in the presence of a lawyer. His statement reads as follows:", "\u201c...I am a primary school graduate and a peddler. On 14 July 2008 my brother and I were selling watermelons in front of Ko\u015fuyolu Park in Diyarbak\u0131r. Suddenly, a large group of demonstrators chanting the slogan \u201cLong live President \u00d6calan\u201d (\u201cBiji Serok Apo\u201d) approached us. Subsequently, the police intervened and took a number of persons into custody. Some individuals among the crowd then began throwing stones at the police officers. I also joined the demonstrators at the beginning and chanted the slogan \u201cLong live President \u00d6calan\u201d. I then threw stones at the police officers. After a short while, some people went to a school. I also went with them. Some of them climbed on the flagpole in the school garden. They took down the Turkish flag and replaced it with a PKK flag. I was not involved in taking down the Turkish flag. I did not have any particular purpose when I chanted the slogan and threw stones at the police. I only acted together with the crowd. I do not know why there was a demonstration. I do not have any connection with the illegal organisation. The person in the photograph that you have shown is me.\u201d", "13. On the same day the applicant was brought before a judge of the Fifth Division of Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court. He maintained that his statements to the public prosecutor had reflected the truth. His lawyer asked the court not to remand the applicant in custody, submitting that the applicant was a minor and therefore not capable of realising the meaning and consequences of his acts.", "14.
