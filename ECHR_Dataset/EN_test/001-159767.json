After the arrest, he had drunk some vodka given to him by the police, and that was why he did not remember what he had said or done from 9 to 11 February 2004. He \u201cwas not sure\u201d that he had written the self-incriminating statement on 9 February 2004. Investigator Ch. had promised to charge him with only the offence of concealment if he admitted that he had kept V. and Sh. in his basement. Actually, V., Sh., and N. had voluntarily stayed in his house and none of them had been forcefully held in the basement. In November 2003 Sh. and V. had drunk too much vodka, had fallen asleep in one of the rooms of his house, and had died of cold. He did not know that the victims\u2019 apartments had been sold without their consent. He had been afraid of the police and for that reason he had not reported the deaths of V. and Sh. and had buried them in his yard. After his arrest the police officers had not beaten him.", "32. The court questioned investigator Ch. in the applicant\u2019s presence and the latter asked him questions.

Ch. denied that he had subjected the applicant to any pressure or promised to charge him with only the offence of concealment.", "33. The court questioned experts who had examined the bodies of V. and Sh. and the applicant\u2019s lawyer asked them questions. The experts stated that they could not exclude the possibility that V. and Sh. had died of cold while they had been asleep in one of the rooms of the applicant\u2019s house. They said that it was also possible that they had died in the basement.", "34. On 17 March 2005 Ro. was questioned by the court in the applicant\u2019s presence and stated that he had seen V., still alive, in the applicant\u2019s basement, and had heard how V. had asked the applicant to release him. Later, Ro. had seen V.\u2019s dead body in the applicant\u2019s basement. Ro. had met N. in the applicant\u2019s house on several occasions, and N. had told him that a group of people intended to \u201csell\u201d him, and were keeping him in the applicant\u2019s house. The applicant asked Ro. questions during the hearing and received answers.", "35. Upon being questioned by the court, N. stated that in July 2003 certain \u201cOlya\u201d and \u201cVolodya\u201d had taken some of his documents, had brought him to the applicant\u2019s house and had left him there until the end of August 2003. The applicant had not allowed him to leave the house and had told N. that he had had a gun. While N. had been staying in the applicant\u2019s house he had observed the applicant, Olya, Volodya, and Kr., and had concluded that they had been acting as an organised group and had intended to sell his apartment without his consent. In August 2003 Olya had moved N. to the house which she had bought from Ru. In September 2003 Volodya and Olya had placed N. in a hospital in the town of Svetlovodsk. From there, N. had called his relatives in Kyiv and had learned that his apartment in Kyiv had been sold. He had then returned to Kyiv and had complained to the police. When N. had returned to the building where his apartment was located, the neighbours had told him that several people had been moving his furniture out of the apartment. They had described one of those people and N. had understood that it had been the applicant. The applicant was present during N.\u2019s questioning by the court and asked him questions.", "36. On 31 March 2005 the court questioned the applicant\u2019s girlfriend, Te., in the applicant\u2019s presence. She stated that N. had been living in the applicant\u2019s house for about a month because he had been \u201chaving a rest\u201d there. She further stated that a man and a woman had been locked in the basement of the applicant\u2019s house against their will. The people who had brought N. to the applicant\u2019s house had instructed Te. not to allow him to leave the house and not to talk to him about the apartment. She had been told that N.\u2019s apartment was being sold in accordance with his wishes, but she had understood that, in fact, he had not known that the apartment was being sold. Once, the applicant had brought various pieces of furniture to the house and had explained Te. that the furniture belonged to N. Kr. had visited the applicant and had brought him food and money for feeding V., Sh., and N.", "37. On 8 April 2005 the applicant asked the court to recall Te. as witness so that he could question her again. That request was granted, however, Te. did not appear before the court because the police could not find her at her permanent place of residence.", "38. Kr. stated before the court that he had brought N., a man and a woman to the applicant\u2019s house, where they had voluntarily stayed. In the autumn of 2003 the applicant had informed Kr. that the man and the woman had died in one of the rooms of his house and he had moved their bodies to the basement. Kr. had helped the applicant to carry two dead bodies from the basement to the yard and to bury them.", "39. The applicant asked the court if he could call and question Pl. and Ru., because, according to him, their statements contradicted those of N. The request to call Pl. was granted but Pl. refused to appear before the court stating that he was too busy with his work in the Svetlovodsk hospital. The request to call and question Ru. was not granted by the court. The applicant requested (unsuccessfully) that the court order a forensic examination of his basement, such an examination being aimed at establishing whether or not V. and Sh. had indeed spent several weeks there.", "40. On 25 May 2005 the Kyiv Court of Appeal convicted the applicant of having forcefully held N., V., and Sh. in his house, an action which led to the deaths of V. and Sh. The court also found the applicant guilty of absconding from detention facility, illegal storage of firearms and participating in the fraudulent sale of the apartments belonging to N. and V. The applicant was sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment. On the same date the lawyer Krav. stopped representing the applicant for unknown reasons. In his observations submitted in reply to those of the Government, the applicant stated that he had unsuccessfully lodged requests for the appointment of a lawyer to represent him before the Supreme Court. The case file does not contain copies of any such requests.", "41. On 11 August 2005 the applicant appealed against his convictions. He stated that the trial had not been objective or fair, and that the first-instance court had misinterpreted the facts of the case, and had refused to call witnesses proposed by him. Ru. and Pl. had not been questioned at a court hearing, although their statements contradicted those of N., while the statements of Te. and Ro. contained contradictory and false information. His request for examination of his basement had also been refused.", "42. On 22 December 2005 the Supreme Court upheld the applicant\u2019s convictions and sentence, having found no irregularities in the first-instance court\u2019s decision.", "43. On 7 June 2006 the applicant sent his first letter to the Court. On 29 August 2006 he submitted a duly signed and completed application form. On 29 September 2006 and 21 March 2007 the Court asked the applicant to provide a copy of his cassation appeal, and copies of his complaints concerning the alleged ill-treatment by the police. The applicant asked the Kyiv Court of Appeal to send those documents to him, but on 14 May 2007 that request was refused on the ground that the law did not empower the applicant to obtain copies of case documents after the conclusion of criminal proceedings.", "44. On 24 January 2008 the Kyiv Court of Appeal sent the applicant the copies which he had requested (see paragraph 43 above).", "45. In October 2011 the applicant requested the same court to send him various materials from his case file, in particular, all the courts\u2019 decisions, reports of medical experts and copies of all the statements and requests which the applicant had made during the criminal proceedings. The applicant stated, without elaborating further, that he needed those documents to \u201csubstantiate his complaints\u201d before the Court. On 18 November 2011 the Kyiv Court of Appeal refused the applicant\u2019s request on the same grounds as on 14 May 2007.", "46. Before the Court the applicant stated that the services provided to him by his lawyers had been of low quality. They were not interested in his case because he did not have any money to pay them.", "47. According to the applicant, the conditions of his detention at the pre-trial detention facility (ITT) in which he was detained for three periods between 9 February and 27 July 2004 were inhuman and degrading."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["34"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
