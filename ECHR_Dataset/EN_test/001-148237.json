The applicant, Mr V.J., is an Angolan national who was born in 1989. The President granted the applicant\u2019s request for his identity not to be disclosed to the public (Rule 47 \u00a7 4). He was represented before the Court by Mr Pirkka Lappalainen, a lawyer practising in Tampere.", "2. The Finnish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr Arto Kosonen of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.", "3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "4. The applicant is a 25-year-old single male from Angola. He originates from Kakongo city in Cabinda province. His whole family belonged to the FLEC-FAC party (Frente de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o do Estado de Cabinda - For\u00e7as Armadas de Cabinda), supporting and fighting for the independence of Cabinda. His parents were killed by the Angolan security forces when he was three years old. The applicant, together with his brother and sister, went to live with his uncle and the uncle\u2019s wife after the incident. The applicant\u2019s uncle had an important role in the FLEC-FAC, being the representative of the party and coordinating its activities in their neighbourhood. The uncle was held for approximately two years in Yabi prison when the applicant was still at school. The applicant was also a member of the party but his activities within the party were minor, mostly limited to distributing leaflets.", "5. The applicant described his problems with the authorities as first starting when he was around 14 years old (in 2003). He was selling tinned food at the market when he ended up having a disagreement with a buyer who subsequently reported him to the police, alleging that he was conspiring to kill an important army colonel. The applicant was apparently held for a long time (around 2 years) in detention without a trial, but eventually his uncle managed to buy his release. The conditions in detention were extremely poor and he also claimed to have been beaten and stripped naked.", "6. The events that led to his flight from Angola happened in late 2008. When returning home after his working day at the market, the applicant found that his uncle, brother and sister had been killed in the house. His uncle\u2019s wife and his own common-law wife, who was also living in the same house at the time, had disappeared. The applicant has not had any information about them since. He heard that some people from his village had managed to escape to the Democratic Republic of Congo and suspected that perhaps his spouse and his uncle\u2019s wife were among those people. Subsequently, the applicant was taken by FAA (Angolan Armed Forces) soldiers to an unknown location where some 15 other persons were held. The applicant was questioned about the whereabouts of his uncle\u2019s documents concerning FLEC-FAC and ill-treated by the soldiers. He was beaten on the head with the butt of a rifle, his feet were beaten and burned, he was shot in the leg and the surface of his chest was cut with a knife. Approximately five or six days later he managed to escape, together with another FLEC-FAC activist who had also been held captive. The applicant walked back to his village and went to see the local priest, who helped him to flee Angola. He stayed for a while with a friend of the priest and in a church in Luanda. Eventually the priest organised his escape through a smuggler. The applicant flew to Moscow and travelled by car to Finland, where he arrived on 17 April 2009.", "7. On 10 July 2009 a general physician examined the applicant. The applicant had already been hospitalised in May and June 2009 for epileptic fits which were at first diagnosed as psychogenic or caused by injuries to the head. The general physician reported scarring in several places on the applicant\u2019s body and diagnosed him as suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder. He referred the applicant to the Centre for Torture Survivors in Finland (Kidutettujen kuntoutuskeskus, Centret f\u00f6r rehabilitering av tortyroffer) for further examination and treatment. The applicant was examined on two occasions, on 3 December 2009 and 13 January 2010 respectively, by the physiotherapist of the Centre for Torture Survivors who reported that the applicant had altogether six visible scars on his body. Two 1 to 3 cm long scars were found on his forehead and half of his front teeth were missing. Other scars were detected on his chest, leg and feet, all matching his description of the torture he had suffered. The applicant complained also of chest pain and difficulties in breathing from time to time, which he claimed had been caused by being kicked in the chest. He was also very sensitive to touch in general, which the physician concluded to be most likely a psychological symptom of ill-treatment. The applicant had therapy sessions with both the psychiatrist and the psychologist of the Centre for Torture Survivors from 27 November 2009 until at least December 2012. In their various medical reports the psychiatrist and the psychologist concluded that the applicant\u2019s psychological condition was consistent with him having experienced severe and multiple trauma, compatible with his claim of having been tortured and having experienced the killing of his family. The psychiatrist diagnosed the applicant with severe depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and reported him as suffering also from slight memory problems. His symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and his memory problems eased during treatment and the applicant managed to begin studies in Finland. From 27 to 29 August 2011 the applicant was again hospitalised due to severe epileptic fits occurring despite medication. He was referred to a neurologist for follow-up.", "8. As from the end of October 2012 the applicant was reported to be suicidal and was shortly admitted to intensive mental care.", "9. On 17 April 2009 the applicant sought asylum immediately on arrival in Finland.", "10. On 27 May 2010 the Finnish Immigration Service (Maahanmuuttovirasto, Migrationsverket) rejected his application and decided to send him back to Angola. In its decision the Immigration Service referred extensively and in detail to the applicant\u2019s asylum interview and found several discrepancies in his story. It noted that on some occasions the applicant gave exact dates and on other occasions he could not place the events at a specific moment in time. The Immigration Service found the applicant\u2019s story of his escape, in a wounded state, from the FAA soldiers to be unlikely and not credible. The Immigration Service concluded that as there were such credibility issues, the applicant\u2019s scars could have been caused by other means than torture, as he claimed. It also doubted whether the applicant was from Cabinda province.", "11. The applicant appealed to the Administrative Court (hallinto-oikeus, f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen), requesting that the Immigration Service\u2019s decision be quashed and he be granted asylum, or alternatively, secondary protection or a residence permit due to individual humanitarian circumstances. He also requested that an oral hearing be held. The applicant also submitted to the court several new medical certificates, noting that it was common that such trauma as torture and epilepsy affect negatively a person\u2019s memory and ability to recount events consistently.", "12. On 19 August 2011 the Administrative Court rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal and refused his request for an oral hearing as unnecessary. It noted, however, that the discrepancies in the applicant\u2019s story were minor and did not give reason to doubt that he originated from Cabinda. On the other hand, the Administrative Court did not consider it likely that the applicant would have been arrested and tortured after the rest of the family had been killed. The applicant\u2019s previous arrest when he was 14 years old seemed to be unconnected with later events. The Administrative Court considered, furthermore, that it was not likely that Angolan officials would be interested in the applicant now that his uncle was dead. Although the human rights situation in Cabinda was not very satisfactory, it concluded that the applicant could be returned there without a real risk of ill-treatment.", "13. On an unspecified date the applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (korkein hallinto-oikeus, h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltnings-domstolen), reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before the Administrative Court.", "14. On 12 October 2012 the Supreme Administrative Court refused the applicant leave to appeal. The applicant was notified of the decision on 30 October 2012.", "15. On 21 December 2012 the applicant lodged a new asylum application, referring to the same grounds as in his first application. He also submitted new medical certificates, arguing that his current state of health prevented his removal or that removal to Angola would amount to inhuman treatment as no medical treatment would be available for him there. He also submitted certificates of his studies in Finland and relied on them as grounds for a residence permit.", "16. On 15 January 2013 the Immigration Service rejected the application after having examined it in a fast-track procedure and decided to expel him to Angola. It also imposed a two-year-ban on entry into Finland and the Schengen-area. The Immigration Service considered that the applicant\u2019s situation had not changed since the previous application and that there were no grounds for a residence permit or grounds preventing the applicant\u2019s removal to Angola. It noted that the situation in the Cabinda area had calmed down, even though some attacks were still reported between the Angolan army and some rebel groups of the FLEC-FAC. However, the applicant could relocate internally to other parts of Angola if he wished. As for his health, the Immigration Service noted that mental health care was available in Angola, although a shortage of medical staff in general was reported. Post-traumatic stress disorder could be treated in one private clinic in Luanda. The treatment of epilepsy was not mentioned.", "17. The applicant appealed to the Administrative Court, requesting again that a stay on removal be granted.", "18. On 7 February 2013 the Administrative Court notified the applicant that the request for interim measures had been refused. The applicant\u2019s appeal before the Administrative Court remained pending before that court.", "19. On 19 September 2013 the Administrative Court rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal.", "20. By letter dated 21 October 2013 the applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court, requesting that the Administrative Court\u2019s decision be quashed and he be granted asylum or, alternatively, secondary protection or a residence permit due to individual humanitarian circumstances. He claimed that his vulnerability continued to increase and that he was clearly in need of protection.", "21. On 17 April 2014 the Supreme Administrative Court refused the applicant leave to appeal.", "22. According to Article 9, paragraph 4, of the Constitution of Finland (Suomen perustuslaki, Finlands grundlag; Act no. 731/1999), the right of foreigners to enter Finland and to remain in the country is regulated by an Act. A foreigner shall not be deported, extradited or returned to another country, if in consequence he or she is in danger of a death sentence, torture or other treatment violating human dignity.", "23. According to section 87, subsection 1, of the Aliens Act (ulkomaalaislaki, utl\u00e4nningslagen; Act no. 301/2004), aliens residing in the country are granted asylum if they reside outside their home country or country of permanent residence owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of ethnic origin, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion and if they, because of this fear, are unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country.", "24. Section 88, subsection 1, of the Act (as amended by Act no. 323/2009) provides that an alien residing in Finland is issued with a residence permit on grounds of subsidiary protection if the requirements for granting asylum under section 87 are not met, but substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person, if returned to his or her country of origin or country of former habitual residence, would face a real risk of being subjected to serious harm, and he or she is unable, or owing to such risk, unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country. Serious harm means: 1) the death penalty or execution; 2) torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; or 3) serious and individual threat as a result of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflicts.", "25. Under section 88a of the Act (as amended by Act no. 323/2009), an alien residing in Finland is issued with a residence permit on the basis of humanitarian protection, if there are no grounds under section 87 or 88 for granting asylum or providing subsidiary protection, but he or she cannot return to his or her country of origin or country of former habitual residence as a result of an environmental catastrophe or a bad security situation which may be due to an international or internal armed conflict or a poor human rights situation.", "26. According to section 88b of the Act (as amended by Act no. 323/2009), the well-founded fear of being persecuted referred to in section 87b or the real risk of being subjected to serious harm referred to in section 88 may be based on incidents after the applicant\u2019s departure from his or her home country or country of permanent residence or on acts that the applicant has participated in since his or her departure.", "27. Section 98, subsection 2, of the Act (as amended by Act no. 432/2009) provides that the requirements for issuing a residence permit are assessed individually for each applicant by taking account of the applicant\u2019s statements on his or her circumstances in the State in question and of real time information on the circumstances in that State obtained from various sources. After obtaining the statement, the authorities shall decide on the matter in favour of the applicant on the basis of his or her statement if the applicant has contributed to the investigation of the matter as far as possible, and if the authorities are convinced of the veracity of the application with regard to the applicant\u2019s need for international protection.", "28. According to section 147 of the Act, no one may be refused entry and sent back or deported to an area where he or she could be subject to the death penalty, torture, persecution or other treatment violating human dignity or from where he or she could be sent to such an area.", "29. Section 147b of the Aliens Act (as amended by Act no. 1214/2013) incorporates into the Finnish legal system the Council Decision 2004/573/EC of 29 April 2004 on the organisation of joint flights for removals from the territory of two or more member States, of third-country nationals who are subjects of individual removal orders. The annex to the Decision contains common guidelines on security provisions for joint removals by air including, inter alia, an obligation for the Member States to ensure that the returnees for whom they are responsible are in an appropriate state of health, which allows legally and factually for safe removal by air.", "30. The Home Office\u2019s Country of Origin Information Report on Angola of September 2010 provides the following information:", "\u201cThe United States State Department 2009 Country Report on Human Rights Practices on Angola observed that \u201cthe Memorandum of Understanding for Peace and Reconciliation for Cabinda Province, signed in 2006, largely brought an end to the insurgency in the province, although sporadic attacks by dissident factions of the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC) and counterinsurgency operations by the Armed Forces of Angola (FAA) continued during the year.", "...", "The intensity of the armed conflict in Cabinda has declined as a result of large-scale counterinsurgency operations in 2002-2003, and the government publicly claims that the Cabinda conflict came to a close in 2006, when a peace agreement was signed with a faction of the rebel Liberation Front for the Independence of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC). But the campaign for independence remains unresolved, and sporadic guerrilla attacks have been ongoing.\u201d", "31. According to the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 2013 in Angola of January 2013:", "\u201cThe three most important human rights abuses were cruel, excessive, and degrading punishment, including reported cases of torture and beatings as well as unlawful killings by police and other security personnel; limits on freedoms of assembly, association, speech, and press; and official corruption and impunity.\u201d", "32. Concerning the availability of medical drugs for mental health, the Home Office\u2019s Country of Origin Information Report on Angola of September 2010 states the following:", "\u201c...the following therapeutic drugs are generally available at the primary health care level of the country: carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin sodium, amitriptyline, chlorpromazine, diazepam, fluphenazine, haloperidol, lithium.
