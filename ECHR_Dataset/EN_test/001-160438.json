The applicant, Mr Dra\u0161ko Budimir, is a Croatian national, who was born in 1941 and lives in Split. He was represented by Ms V. Garafuli\u0107 Kuko\u010d and Mr I. Restovi\u0107, lawyers practising in Split.", "2. The Croatian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms \u0160. Sta\u017enik.", "3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "4. Under the socialist system previously in force in former Yugoslavia, tenants who resided in socially owned flats benefited from \u201cspecially protected tenancy\u201d agreements, which were in most cases concluded for an indefinite period and could be passed from generation to generation.", "5. When Croatia became independent in 1991 and opted for a market economy, it adopted several main reforms in the housing sector which are relevant to the present case.", "6. Firstly, on 3 June 1991, Parliament enacted the Specially Protected Tenancies (Sale to Occupier) Act (Zakon o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo) with regulations for the sale of socially owned flats previously let under a specially protected tenancy. In general, the Act entitled the holder of a specially protected tenancy in respect of a socially owned flat to purchase it under favourable conditions of sale. However, the Act excluded the holders of specially protected tenancies in most privately owned flats from such favourable treatment.", "7. On 1 January 1997 the Act on Compensation for and Restitution of Property Taken under the Yugoslav communist regime (Zakon o naknadi za imovinu oduzetu za vrijeme jugoslavenske komunisti\u010dke vladavine \u2013hereinafter \u201cthe Denationalisation Act\u201d) entered into force. It enabled the former owners of confiscated or nationalised property, or their heirs in the first line of succession (direct descendants or spouse), to obtain, subject to certain conditions, either the restitution of property appropriated during the communist era, including dwellings which had been let under the \u201cspecially protected tenancy\u201d scheme, or compensation for it. Thus, a number of such dwellings became private property.", "8. Under section 32 of the Denationalisation Act, confiscated flats were to be awarded to their former owners. Under section 13 of the Appropriated Property Compensation Fund Act (Zakon o Fondu za naknadu oduzete imovine), a tenant only had the right to purchase a confiscated flat if no claim for its restitution had been submitted or if such a claim had been dismissed in a final decision.", "9. By a judgment of Split County Court of 24 June 1948, a flat in Split, measuring 84.49 square metres at Ante Jonji\u0107a Street 1, was confiscated from a private owner. It became the property of Split Municipality.", "10. The applicant was an employee of a socially owned company, Brodospas, based in Split, and paid compulsory monthly contributions to its housing fund. On 28 October 1980 the Housing Commission of Brodospas approved a priority list for granting protected tenancies and the applicant was first on the list.", "11. On 19 February 1983 the applicant and his family moved into the above-mentioned flat (see paragraph 9 above) and they lived there until 28 May 2012 (see paragraph 19 below).", "12. On 21 August 1984 the Housing Commission of Split Municipality entered into a contract by which it ceded the flat at issue to Brodospas for a period of three years. The purpose of the agreement was to resolve the applicant\u2019s housing needs temporarily; during the period in question Brodospas was obliged to find accommodation for the applicant in another flat and return the flat at issue to the Housing Commission of Split Municipality.", "13. On 22 February 1985 the Workers\u2019 Council of Brodospas adopted a decision to grant the flat to the applicant for temporary occupation. On 7 March 1985 Brodospas and the applicant entered into a contract which granted the flat to the applicant for temporary occupation for a period of three years. The applicant was designated as the holder of a specially protected tenancy in respect of that flat.", "14. On 27 March 1997 the applicant asked to purchase the flat from Split Municipality, which did not reply.", "15. On an unspecified date in 2001 the applicant brought a civil action in the Split Municipal Court against the Fund for the Restitution of Expropriated Property, seeking a judgment in lieu of the contract of sale.", "16. The claim was dismissed on 6 March 2006 on the grounds that the flat had been ceded to Brodospas by Split Municipality for a period of three years and that therefore the applicant could not have acquired a specially protected tenancy. The judgment was upheld by the Split County Court on 2 March 2007.", "17. On 25 September 2007 the flat was returned to I.H., an heir of its previous owner.", "18. The subsequent remedies used by the applicant, namely an appeal on points of law and a constitutional complaint, were unsuccessful. The former was dismissed by the Supreme Court on 9 June 2009 and the latter by the Constitutional Court on 17 June 2010. The Constitutional Court\u2019s decision was served on the applicant\u2019s counsel on 17 January 2011.", "19. On 15 December 2011 I.H. brought a civil action in the Split Municipal Court against the applicant, seeking his eviction. On 28 May 2012 the applicant and his family moved out of the flat. On 13 February 2013 I.H. withdrew her claim.", "20.
