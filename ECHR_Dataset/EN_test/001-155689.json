During 1991 and 1992 Serbian para-military forces gained control of about one third of the territory of Croatia and proclaimed the so-called \u201cSerbian Autonomous region of Krajina\u201d (Srpska autonomna oblast Krajina, hereinafter the \u201cKrajina\u201d). The applicant continued to live in the Krajina. At the beginning of August 1995 the Croatian authorities announced a campaign of military action with the aim of regaining control over Krajina. The action was codenamed \u201cStorm\u201d and lasted from 4 to 7 August 1995. Before that action, the vast majority of the population of the Krajina fled Croatia, initially for Bosnia and Herzegovina, but later many of them went to live in Serbia. Some returned to Croatia after the war. The number of people who fled is estimated at between 100,000 and 150,000.", "5. According to the applicant, on 4 August 1995 she and her nephew Z.D. \u2013 in a vehicle of the \u201cLada\u201d make \u2013 and her other nephew A.V. \u2013 in a vehicle of the \u201cZastava\u201d make \u2013 were driving along the road between the villages of Strmen and Slovenci, trying to flee Croatia and reach Bosnia and Herzegovina. After overtaking a convoy of tractors and while passing through a forest called Zelenik, Croatian soldiers started to fire at them. The applicant and both her nephews were wounded. The applicant and Z.D. got out of the vehicle and ran into the woods. Later on, they both managed to flee into Bosnia and Herzegovina. A.V. surrendered to the Croatian soldiers and was provided with first aid.", "6.

On 31 January 2005 the police interviewed the applicant, P.T. and I.\u0160. The applicant confirmed the accounts of A.V. and Z.D. P.T. said that he had been checking on his cattle in the same area on 4 August 1995 and had hidden in the woods during the shooting. After that he had been captured by the Croatian soldiers.

A battle between these soldiers and Serbian para-military forces issued. At that moment two vehicles, a Zastava and a Lada, and a tractor appeared on the road.
