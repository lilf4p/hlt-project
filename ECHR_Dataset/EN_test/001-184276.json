On 7 December 2009 the Sovetskiy District Court of Oryol convicted the applicant of drug-related crimes and sentenced him to twelve years\u2019 imprisonment in a strict-regime post-conviction detention facility. On 2 February 2010 the Oryol Regional Court upheld the conviction on appeal.", "9. Acting on the basis of the FSIN of Russia\u2019s instruction of 2 December 2009, on an unspecified date the Oryol FSIN decided, in view of the overcrowding in the postconviction detention facilities in the Oryol Region, that the issue of which particular facility the applicant would be transferred to should be resolved by the FSIN department for the Krasnoyarsk Region (\u201cthe Krasnoyarsk FSIN\u201d). The latter allocated the applicant to IK-7, a strict-regime post-conviction detention facility in the village of Areyskoye, Krasnoyarsk Region (about 4,200 km from Oryol), to serve his sentence. The applicant has been detained there since 20 April 2010.", "10. The applicant has repeatedly asked the penal authorities at different levels to transfer him to a detention facility located closer to Oryol so that he could effectively maintain family ties while serving his sentence.", "11. On 12 November 2010 the FSIN of Russia rejected the applicant\u2019s request, informing him that, under Article 81 of the Code on the Execution of Sentences (\u201cthe CES\u201d), in the absence of exceptional circumstances convicts were to serve their prison term in its entirety in the same detention facility, and that there were no such exceptional circumstances in the applicant\u2019s case. They noted as follows:", "\u201c[a]s regards maintaining the convict\u2019s social ties, the right to receive visits and parcels as well as the right to correspondence and phone calls should be realised in accordance with the laws on execution of sentences in force and does not depend on the place in which he is serving the sentence.\u201d", "12. The applicant brought civil proceedings against the Oryol FSIN, claiming compensation for pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage caused by their decision to transfer him to a penal facility in the Krasnoyarsk Region in breach of his right, under Article 73 \u00a7 1 of the CES, to serve his prison sentence in his home region, which had adversely affected his capacity to maintain his family and social ties.", "13. On 3 August 2012 the Zavodskoy District Court of Oryol dismissed the claims for damages with reference to Article 73 \u00a7 2 of the CES and Ruling No. 1700-O-O of the Constitutional Court of Russia. The court held that the Oryol FSIN\u2019s decision had been lawful because between December 2009 and February 2010 the penal facilities in the Oryol Region had been overcrowded. It also noted that the defendant had acted in accordance with the FSIN of Russia\u2019s instructions. The court did not address the applicant\u2019s argument regarding his difficulties in maintaining family ties because of the distance between his family home and the detention facility. It appears that the applicant did not appeal against the judgment.", "14. Between July 2011 and October 2013 the applicant\u2019s partner made long-term family visits to IK-7 on six occasions.
