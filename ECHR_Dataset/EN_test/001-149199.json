He was charged with a number of offences committed with an armed organised criminal group.", "7. In its decision, the District Court relied on a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question. The court further emphasised the gravity of the offences in question, the applicant\u2019s active role in the criminal group and the likelihood of a heavy prison sentence being imposed on him after conviction. In the domestic court\u2019s view the fact that the applicant was at the time detained pending other criminal proceedings against him did not guarantee the proper course of the proceedings since the applicant could had been released at any time from the pre-trial detention without the relevant authorities, responsible for the impugned proceedings, being notified. Moreover, the necessity to obtain further evidence justified remanding the applicant in custody.", "8. The applicant\u2019s appeal against the decision of 24 September 2006 was dismissed by the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) on 25 October 2006.

On 18 March 2009 the State Prosecutor (Prokurator Krajowy) lodged a bill of indictment against the applicant with the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Court. The applicant was charged with several counts of extortion and robbery committed in an organised and armed criminal group and with participation in an organised and armed criminal group.

The applicant lodged a number of motions to be released as well as appeals against the decisions extending his pre-trial detention, all in vain.", "In their decisions the courts repeated the grounds previously given for the applicant\u2019s detention.", "12. On 3 April 2009 the applicant\u2019s lawyer lodged an appeal against one of the decisions extending the applicant\u2019s detention. The lawyer argued that the reasons for continued pre-trial detention ceased to exist since the applicant had started serving a seven years\u2019 prison sentence imposed by the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a District Court in the case no. IV K 239/06.", "13. Meanwhile, the court scheduled fifteen hearings for November and December 2009. Due to sick-leaves of the presiding judge and of some of the accused those hearings did not take place.", "14. The trial was eventually opened on 18 January 2010. Subsequent scheduled hearings were adjourned due to absences of some of the co-accused and due to problems with sound system in the court room.", "15. In May 2010 the Regional Court gave a severance order and decided to determine charges against two co-accused separately.", "16. The bill of indictment was finally read out to the defendants at the hearing held on 27 May 2010.", "17. At the hearing of 28 May 2010 the Regional Court started taking evidence from the accused. It subsequently held fourteen hearings until the end of 2010, during which some of the accused gave evidence. Five of the scheduled hearings were adjourned due to sick-leaves of the accused. One hearing was adjourned because of the motion for disqualification of the presiding judge lodged by one of the co-accused.", "18.

The criminal proceedings against the applicant are still pending before the first-instance court.", "23. On 27 April 2011 the applicant lodged a complaint with the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Court of Appeal under the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w post\u0119powaniu przygotowawczym prowadzonym lub nadzorowanym przez prokuratora i post\u0119powaniu s\u0105dowym bez nieuzasadnionej zw\u0142oki \u2013 \u201cthe 2004 Act\u201d).

On 27 July 2011 the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint. The court found that, considering the complexity of the case and the number of co-accused who had actively tried to obstruct the proceedings, the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Court had conducted the proceedings in a correct and timely manner. Consequently, the appellate court refused to award the applicant compensation."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
