THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "J\u00e1n \u0160ikuta;Johannes Silvis;Josep Casadevall;Kristina Pardalos;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra", "TEXT": ["1. The first applicant, Orde van Register Adviseurs Nederland (Association of Chartered Advisers Netherlands, \u201cOvRAN\u201d) is an association under Netherlands law based in Wassenaar. Mr Antonius Johannes Boer was born in 1946 and lives in Delft; Mr Nicolaas Plug was born in 1948 and lives in Noordwijk; Mr Cornelis Bernardus Antonius Spil was born in 1941 and lives in Deventer; and Mr Rein Wierdsma was born in 1965 and lives in Leeuwarden. All four individual applicants are Netherlands nationals and all state their occupation as \u201cAccountant/Consultant\u201d. The applicants are represented by Mr A.W. Eikelboom, a lawyer practising in Amsterdam.", "2.", "3. In the Netherlands, accountants are either chartered accountants (registeraccountants) or accountants-administrative consultants (accountants-administratieconsulenten) depending on their training and qualifications. Both chartered accountants and accountants-administrative consultants are required to be members of their respective professional organisations, the Netherlands Institute of Chartered Accountants (Nederlands Instituut van Registeraccountants, \u201cNIvRA\u201d) and the Netherlands Association of Accountants-Administrative Consultants (Nederlandse Orde van Accountants-Administratieconsulenten, \u201cNOvAA\u201d).", "4. In 2009, a group of chartered accountants who were displeased by particular developments which they perceived within NIvRA, set up a separate professional organisation, which following a name change was called OvRAN by the time of the events complained of, intending it to be an alternative to NIvRA. Membership of OvRAN was open to members and former members of both NIvRA and NOvAA.", "5. NIvRA and NOvAA brought actions against OvRAN in the civil courts, the result of which was that OvRAN and those of its members who were not also members of NIvRA or NOvAA were no longer permitted to use the title \u201caccountant\u201d or perform statutory audits. No details have been given of these proceedings.", "6. On 19 October 2009 OvRAN, represented by the applicant Mr Spil as its president, wrote to the Director of Financial Markets within the Ministry of Finance asking for:", "an interpretation of section 1(4) of the Chartered Accountants Act and section 2(4) of the Accountants-Administrative Consultants Act (see below) in order that its members be entered on the registers of chartered accountants or accountants-administrative consultants, as the case might be, and permitted to use the title \u201caccountant\u201d, without having to be members of NIvRA and NOvAA; and", "the application of section 28 of the Organisations of Accountants (Supervision) Act (Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties) in order that its members be permitted to carry out legal audits.", "7. On 19 November 2009 the Director of Financial Markets sent a reply to the effect that only the courts could give a binding interpretation of legislation and pointing to the status of NIvRA and NOvAA as public bodies invested with delegated legislative powers.", "8. On 30 November 2009 OvRAN lodged objections (bezwaarschriften) against the letter of the Director of Financial Markets, invoking Article 11 of the Convention and denouncing certain actions of NIvRA and NOvAA as unethical.", "9. On 18 December 2009 the Director of Financial Markets dismissed the objections. The refusal to give an interpretation of statutory provisions was not a \u201cdecision\u201d in the sense of having an intended legal effect, which meant that an objection against it was inadmissible. Objections and appeals against a refusal to adopt statutory or delegated legislation were ruled out by the General Administrative Law Act (Algemene wet bestuursrecht; see below).", "10. On 21 January 2010 OvRAN lodged an appeal with the Industrial Appeals Tribunal (College van Beroep voor het Bedrijfsleven), citing the Minister of Finance as the defendant. It relied on the same grounds as in the objection proceedings and additionally on Article 13 of the Convention. OvRAN asked for its appeal to be joined with related appeals lodged by the applicants Mr Boer, Mr Plug and Mr Spil.", "11. The Industrial Appeals Tribunal gave its decision on 15 February 2011. It held that the Minister of Finance had rightly taken the view that the letter of 19 November 2009 did not comprise a decision within the meaning of section 1:3 of the General Administrative Law Act. Nor could the applicants rely on Article 13, since legal remedies were available through NIvRA and NOvAA. The appeal was therefore inadmissible.", "12. As relevant to the case, the Civil Code at the relevant time provided as follows:", "\u201c1. The legal person shall commission a chartered accountant or an accountant-administrative consultant in relation to whom a note as referred to in section 36(3) of the Accountants-Administrative Consultants Act has been added to the entry in the register referred to in section 36(1) of that Act to audit its annual accounts.
