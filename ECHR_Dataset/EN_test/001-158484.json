The applicant was born in 1969 and lives in Morozovsk in the Rostov Region.", "6. On 7 July 2004 the applicant was arrested and placed in a temporary detention centre at the Morozovsk police station (\u00ab\u0418\u0437\u043e\u043b\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f\u00bb, \u00ab\u0418\u0412\u0421\u00bb, \u201cIVS\u201d) on suspicion of murder.", "7. The applicant was detained in the IVS on four separate occasions: between 7 and 24 July 2004; 17 August and 8 October 2004; 24 October and 16 November 2004; and 4 and 16 December 2004.", "8. In the applicant\u2019s submission, the conditions of his detention in the IVS during those four periods were essentially identical and as described below.", "9. The IVS was situated in the basement of the police station. The applicant was placed in a cell measuring approximately 12.5 square metres, which housed six to seven people. The walls, floor and ceiling were all covered with cement. There was no ventilation in the cell and consequently it was stuffy. The windows were covered with exterior and interior metal plates with minuscule openings, which gave practically no access to natural light. The cell was lit by a lamp set high up in an alcove in the wall, so there was insufficient light for reading or writing.", "10. In summer, temperatures inside exceeded 40\u02daC and the cell had a high level of humidity. There was no glass in the windows and in winter it was cold.", "11. No mattresses, bedding, cups, eating utensils or toiletries were distributed. There were no pest control measures in place to eliminate cockroaches and mice. The cell was not connected to a sewer and detainees had to relieve themselves in a bucket, which was removed from the cell once a day to be emptied. The water which was distributed once a day (ten litres per cell) was not drinkable. There was no provision for outside exercise or showers.", "12. The applicant was fed once a day. The food was wholly inadequate, both in terms of quality and portion size.", "13. The applicant sustained an injury to his head prior to his arrest. While in the IVS, he did not receive adequate medical treatment for the injury. The applicant \u2013 who had contracted tuberculosis in 2001 \u2013 shared a cell with a person who was actually suffering from the open form of the disease at the time of his detention, and this represented a potential risk to his health.", "14. Each of the IVS cells in which the applicant was kept measured approximately 15 square metres and had six sleeping places. However, it was impossible to provide more detailed information, as the registration logs for the IVS had been destroyed.", "15. According to the findings of the inquiry carried out by the Morozovskiy district prosecutor\u2019s office on the basis of the applicant\u2019s complaint, the applicant shared one of the cells in which he was kept \u2013 which was equipped with six sleeping places \u2013 with four inmates. At some point, he was transferred to a solitary confinement cell upon his request. The applicant received three meals a day. There were no mice or insects in the cells. The bucket that acted as a substitute for sanitary facilities was cleaned daily. The applicant had access to drinking water and toiletries. The applicant was provided with adequate medical assistance on request.", "16. On 12 November 2004 the Morozovskiy District Court of the Rostov Region convicted the applicant of murder and sentenced him to eleven years\u2019 imprisonment.

The journey there included train travel and accommodation in SIZO-type detention facilities (\u00ab\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438\u0437\u043e\u043b\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f\u00bb, \u00ab\u0421\u0418\u0417\u041e\u00bb). These facilities generally serve as remand prisons, yet can also be used for the temporary detention of people who have already been convicted.", "18. At certain times between 24 July 2004 and 6 June 2005, the applicant was kept in Novocherkassk detention facility no. IZ-61/3.", "19. The applicant was detained in a cell measuring 28 square metres, which was designed to hold ten people. However, he shared this cell with fifteen other detainees, so they had to sleep in shifts. The bedding supplied was dirty, worn out and covered in bloodstains. Mattresses were also worn out and infested with insects. There was no ventilation. Lights were on day and night. No toiletries were supplied.", "20. In summer, the cell was extremely humid and stuffy.

The applicant was not provided with a copy of that decision. A further refusal was issued on 16 February 2006. However, the prosecutor found that the applicant\u2019s allegations concerning the conditions of detention in the IVS \u201chad been confirmed in part\u201d, but that such conditions did not constitute a crime under the Criminal Code.
