The applicants alleged that the prison held 2,400 prisoners, while it had been designed to accommodate 700. The applicants were detained in wings A and D in various cells which all measured 9 sq. m, including the space for sanitary facilities, and accommodated three or four prisoners; the living space for each prisoner was therefore less than 3 sq. m.", "7. The toilet facilities were partially separated from the rest of the cell. In addition, there was insufficient heating and hot water. Inmates had to use a washbasin to wash themselves, as well as their dishes and clothes. Cells were dirty and overrun with cockroaches and other pests, and no attempt was made to exterminate them. Rubbish was not properly collected and food remains were left in the cells and corridors for days. Prisoners were not sufficiently separated according to their health conditions or whether or not they were drug users. There was no adequate medical care, in particular as regards psychological health.", "8.

All detainees had access to the prison\u2019s infirmary, which was open twenty-four hours per day, and there were eighteen doctors with different areas of specialism and three nurses who offered appointments to the prisoners. When inmates\u2019 conditions could not be dealt with in the infirmary, they were transferred to Korydallos Prison Hospital, Korydallos Psychiatric Hospital or an external hospital. The Government submitted the applicants\u2019 medical records, to demonstrate that they had been treated on various occasions. Additionally, the prison\u2019s social services took care of detainees\u2019 needs, including those of the applicants, who had used those services on a number of occasions.", "14.
