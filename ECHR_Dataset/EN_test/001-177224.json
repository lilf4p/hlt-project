On 22 November 2011 the applicant was arrested and detained on suspicion of having committed war crimes against the civilian population and against prisoners of war during the 1992-95 war.", "7. On 23 November 2011 the State Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (\u201cthe State Court\u201d) reviewed and extended his detention based on the risk of his obstructing the course of justice by exerting pressure on witnesses and co-accused or by destroying evidence. On 1 December 2011 that decision was upheld by the Appeals Chamber of the State Court.", "8. On 21 December 2011 the State Court further extended the applicant\u2019s detention on the same grounds as before.

On 23 February 2012 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal, relying on Article II \u00a7 3.(d) of the Constitution (see paragraph 16 below) and Article 5 of the Convention.

On 13 July 2012 the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (\u201cthe Constitutional Court\u201d), in a formation of eight judges, rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal since it could not reach a majority on any of the proposals.

Pursuant to Article VI \u00a7 4 of the Constitution (see paragraph 16 below) that decision was final.", "13. On 1 November 2012 the State Court held that the grounds for the applicant\u2019s continued detention had ceased to apply and released the applicant. By the same decision, the court imposed preventive measures on the applicant which included the following: a prohibition on leaving his place of residence without the prior approval of the State Court save for the purpose of appearing before that court; the duty to report once a week to the Had\u017ei\u0107i police; a prohibition on associating with other co-accused and on associating or having contact with the witnesses. Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s passport was seized.", "14. The preventive measures were reviewed and extended every two months. On 16 December 2015 they were revoked.", "15. At the date of the latest information available to the Court (22 July 2016), the criminal proceedings against the applicant were still ongoing."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
