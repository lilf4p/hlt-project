The report noted that there was a contradiction between the report of 6 February 2002, which stated that the tympanic membrane of the applicant\u2019s left ear was intact, and that of 10 October 2001, according to which the applicant suffered from tympanic membrane perforation in his left ear.

On 22 August 2005 and 5 January and 20 September 2006 the public prosecutor reiterated his requests as he had not received the documents asked for. On 20 September 2006 the president of the first-instance court, which, in the meantime, had became the Van Assize Court, reiterated his previous reply.

On 12 May 2008 a medical expert from the Dicle University Research Hospital sent a report to the public prosecutor\u2019s office. According to the doctor, it was possible that the tympanic membrane perforation in the applicant\u2019s left ear had recovered over time.

On 12 November 2008 the applicant was examined at the Forensic Medicine Institute. During his examination, the applicant stated that he had been beaten at the time of his arrest. He also maintained that he had been illtreated while in police custody.", "55. On 31 December 2008 the 2nd Section of Expertise of the Forensic Medicine Institute issued a report. In this report, reference was made to the arrest protocol, dated 30 September 2001, which stated that the police officers had had to use force to apprehend the applicant, since he had resisted arrest. The Forensic Medicine Institute also took into consideration the aforementioned medical reports dated 30 September 2001, 9, 10 and 18 October 2001, 4 and 6 February 2002, 7 March and 1 July 2003 and 12 May 2008. On the basis of these reports and the medical examination of the applicant carried out on 12 November 2008, the 2nd Section of Expertise of the Forensic Medicine Institute established that the injuries observed on the applicant\u2019s body had not been life-threatening, but would have prevented him from continuing his daily activities for fifteen days. It was further indicated that the injuries on the applicant\u2019s face and ear could have been caused by a blow with a blunt object during the applicant\u2019s arrest. The report further stated the applicant had not been subjected to an examination of his ear between 30 September and 10 October 2001 and that the red patches behind the applicant\u2019s left ear noted in the report of 30 September 2001 could have been caused by physical trauma which could have also led to the tympanic membrane perforation in his left ear. The 2nd Section of Expertise finally noted that there was no medical evidence demonstrating that the applicant had been subjected to physical trauma during his detention in police custody.", "56. On 15 October 2009 the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor decided to close the investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment. In his decision, he relied on the report of the 2nd Section of Expertise of the Forensic Medicine Institute and held that the injuries observed on the applicant\u2019s body had been sustained during the scuffle at the time of his arrest. The public prosecutor noted that the injuries observed on the applicant\u2019s person had been caused by the force used to arrest the applicant, which had been in compliance with the Law on the Duties and Powers of the Police (Law no. 2559) and that there was no report or other evidence showing that the police officers had exceeded the limits of their powers on the use of force. The public prosecutor further considered that there was no evidence, such as medical reports or witness statements, demonstrating that the applicant had been ill-treated while detained in police custody. He also stated that the length of the applicant\u2019s detention in police custody had been in accordance with the legislation at the material time. The public prosecutor thus concluded that there was no evidence to support the applicant\u2019s allegation that he had been subjected to ill-treatment while in police custody.", "57. On 4 November 2009 the applicant lodged an objection with the Siverek Assize Court against the decision of 15 October 2009. In his petition, the applicant submitted that his medical examination by the 2nd Section of Expertise of the Forensic Medicine Institute had been conducted too late. He also contended that his medical examinations had been superficial. For instance, no examination had been carried out in relation to his allegation of being subjected to electroshocks. The applicant finally submitted that he had had to be taken to the emergency service while in police custody due to his problems with his ear.", "58. On 29 March 2010 the Siverek Assize Court rejected the applicant\u2019s objection, holding that there was no evidence showing that the applicant had been subjected to ill-treatment.", "59. On 22 May 2002 the applicant lodged an application with the Court alleging a violation of, inter alia, Article 3 of the Convention. The applicant alleged that he had been subjected to ill-treatment during his arrest and while in detention in police custody.", "60. On 13 December 2005 the Court, sitting as a Committee of three judges, declared the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 3 inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
