The applicant was born in 1965 and is currently detained in the Internment Facility at the US Guant\u00e1namo Bay Naval Base in Cuba", "16. It is to be noted that in the present case involving, as the applicant\u2019s previous application before the Court, complaints of secret detention and torture to which he was allegedly subjected during the extraordinary rendition operations by the United States\u2019 authorities (see paragraphs 22-70 and 78-97 below) the Court is deprived of the possibility of obtaining any form of direct account of the events complained of from the applicant (see Al Nashiri v. Poland, no. 28761/11, \u00a7 397, 24 July 2014; see also Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, no. 7511/13, \u00a7 397, 24 July 2014).", "As in Al Nashiri v. Poland and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, the facts as adduced by the applicant were to a considerable extent a reconstruction of dates and other elements relevant to his rendition, detention and treatment in the US authorities\u2019 custody, based on various publicly available sources of information. The applicant\u2019s version of the facts as stated in his initial application of 1 June 2012 evolved and partly changed during the proceedings before the Court (see paragraphs 115-116 below).", "The respondent Government contested the applicant\u2019s version of the facts on all accounts, maintaining that there was no evidence demonstrating that they had occurred in Romania (see paragraphs 395-402 and 419-443 below).", "17. Consequently, the facts of the case as set out below (see paragraphs 98-164 below) are based on the applicant\u2019s account supplemented by various items of evidence in the Court\u2019s possession.", "98. As regards the events preceding the applicant\u2019s secret detention in Poland, i.e. his capture in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and initial detention from the end of October 2002 to 4 December 2002, in Al Nashiri v. Poland (\u00a7\u00a7 401 and 404) the Court held as follows:", "\u201c401. The Court notes that the CIA official documents clearly confirm that by November 2002 the Agency had the applicant and Mr Abu Zubaydah, both referred to as \u2018High-Value Detainees\u2019, in its custody and that they were interrogated at a CIA black site with the use of the EITs \u2013 the applicant immediately after his arrival at that place on 15 November 2002 ... .", "...", "404. In the light of the above first-hand CIA documentary evidence and clear and convincing expert evidence, the Court finds established beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant, following his capture, was detained in the CIA detention facility in Bangkok from 15 November 2002 to 4 December 2002, that Mr Abu Zubaydah was also held in the same facility at that time and that they were both moved together to \u2018another CIA black site\u2019 on 4 December 2002 (see Husayn (Abu Zubaydah), cited above, \u00a7 404).\u201d", "The experts, Mr J.G.S and Senator Marty, heard by the Court at the fact-finding hearing in Al Nashiri v. Poland, identified the detention facility as the one known under the codename \u201cCat\u2019s Eye\u201d or \u201cCatseye\u201d and located in Bangkok, Thailand (see Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 403).", "At \u201cCat\u2019s Eye\u201d the CIA subjected the applicant to the EITs, including waterboarding from 15 November to 4 December 2002 (ibid. \u00a7\u00a7 86-88).", "99. As regards the early period of the applicant\u2019s detention, the 2014 US Senate Committee Report includes the following information. It indicates the date of the applicant\u2019s capture as \u201cmid-October 2002\u201d. According to the report, at that time \u201che provided information while in custody of a foreign government\u201d. On an unspecified date \u2013 i.e. redacted in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report \u2013 in November 2002 he was rendered by the CIA to a secret detention site code-named \u201cDetention Site Cobalt\u201d. In Al Nashiri v. Poland that site is referred to as being code-named \u201cSalt Pit\u201d and located in Afghanistan (see Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 83-84). The report states that he was held at that site briefly, for a number of days (redacted in the report), before being transferred to another detention site, identified in Al Nashiri v. Poland as \u201cCat\u2019s Eye\u201d in Thailand (see paragraph 97 above). In the 2014 US Senate Committee Report that facility is referred to as \u201cDetention Site Green\u201d. The report further states that:", "\u201cIn December 2002, when DETENTION SITE GREEN was closed, Al Nashiri and Abu Zubaydah were rendered to DETENTION SITE BLUE.\u201d", "100. As regards the events after 4 December 2002, in Al Nashiri v. Poland (\u00a7 417) the Court held:", "\u201c417. Assessing all the above facts and evidence as a whole, the Court finds it established beyond reasonable doubt that:", "(1) on 5 December 2002 the applicant, together with Mr Abu Zubaydah, arrived in Szymany on board the CIA rendition aircraft N63MU;", "(2) from 5 December 2002 to 6 June 2003 the applicant was detained in the CIA detention facility in Poland identified as having the codename \u2018Quartz\u2019 and located in Stare Kiejkuty;", "(3) during his detention in Poland under the HVD Programme he was interrogated by the CIA and subjected to EITs and also to unauthorised interrogation techniques as described in the 2004 CIA Report, 2009 DOJ Report and the 2007 ICRC Report;", "4) on 6 June 2003 the applicant was transferred by the CIA from Poland on the CIA rendition aircraft N379P.\u201d", "101. The events that took place between 5 December 2002 and 6 June 2003 at the CIA detention facility identified in Al Nashiri v. Poland as being code-named \u201cQuartz\u201d and located in Poland, including the use of unauthorised interrogation techniques against the applicant, correspond to the events that the 2014 US Senate Committee Report relates as occurring at \u201cDetention Site Blue\u201d.", "102. The 2014 US Senate Committee Report has established that \u201cbeginning in June 2003, the CIA transferred Al Nashiri to five different CIA detention facilities before he was transferred to US military custody on 5 September 2006\u201d.", "103. On the basis of their investigations, research and various material in the public domain the experts heard by the Court at the fact-finding hearing reconstructed the chronology of the applicant\u2019s transfers and identified countries of his secret detention.", "104. Mr J.G.S. stated that the applicant was transported from Poland first to Morocco, second to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, third to Romania, then to the fourth site \u2013 which, according to him, was with a high degree of probability Lithuania \u2013 before being transferred to Afghanistan, the fifth \u201cblack site\u201d and, finally back to Guant\u00e1namo Bay.", "In particular, Mr J.G.S. testified as follows:", "\u201c... [I]n respect of Mr Al Nashiri, it is stated explicitly and unredacted in the Senate Report that from June 2003 Al Nashiri was moved to five different detention facilities before his ultimate transfer to Guant\u00e1namo Bay in September 2006. This provides us with a precise timeframe, June 2003 to September 2006, and it provides us with a precise number of transfers which we then have to correlate with his interrogation schedule and the available flight data to determine where he was held. It is on that basis that we have been able to arrive at the conclusion that he was transported from Poland first to Morocco, then onwards to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, then onwards to Romania, to one further site, and with a high degree of probability, Lithuania, before being transferred back to Afghanistan as no. 5, and finally to Guant\u00e1namo Bay. There are very limited possibilities as to where the CIA could take its detainees because it always maintained a very small range of sites, and because the planes are the same, they operate upon systematic methodologies, notably dummy flight planning, switching of aircraft and all the other tactical elements described. One can narrow down that probability to a certitude, with the right rigour of investigation, and it is that which we have applied to arrive at these conclusions, which have subsequently been validated in the official record.\u201d", "105. In the light of the material in the Court\u2019s possession the chronology of the applicant\u2019s detention can be described as follows.", "106. In Al Nashiri v. Poland the Court established, inter alia, that in the light of the accumulated evidence, \u201cthere [could] be no doubt that the N379P, also known as \u201cGuant\u00e1namo Express\u201d, a Gulfstream V with capacity for eighteen passengers but usually configured for eight, arrived in Szymany on 5 June 2003 at 01:00 from Kabul, Afghanistan. It stayed on the runway for over two hours and then departed for Rabat, Morocco\u201d (see Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 408).", "It was also established that it had been one of the most notorious rendition aircraft used by the CIA for transportation of its prisoners. The plane N379P set off from Dulles Airport, Washington D.C. on Tuesday 3 June at 23:33 GMT and undertook a four-day flight circuit, during which it landed in and departed from six different foreign countries including Germany, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Poland, Morocco and Portugal. The aircraft returned from Portugal back to Dulles Airport on 7 June 2003 (ibid. \u00a7\u00a7 103-106 and 291-292).", "107. Mr J.G.S. at the fact-finding hearing testified as follows:", "\u201cAs was established in the earlier proceedings, Al Nashiri was taken from Poland to Morocco, to the facility near Rabat in June of 2003, arriving there on 6 June 2003. And after detention there for a period of only 3 months, he was then transferred to the CIA secret facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. The declassified Senate Committee Report provides extensive detail on the evolution of CIA operations in respect of Morocco and Guant\u00e1namo Bay, notably in this passage it refers specifically to Al Nashiri as having been transferred out of a country which is identifiable as Morocco, to the CIA detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, after a period of five months beyond the original agreed timeframe. This passage resides within a section of the report which describes difficult and sometimes acrimonious relations between the CIA and its Moroccan counterparts, and it is evident that, in fact, the date, redacted in this passage, is September 2003, which is precisely the time at which our flight information demonstrates an aircraft arriving in Morocco and transporting detainees onwards to Guant\u00e1namo Bay.\u201d", "108. According to Mr J.G.S., the plane N379P took the applicant, together with another CIA detainee, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, from Szymany, Poland to Rabat, Morocco, to a facility lent to the CIA by their Moroccan counterparts. He testified as follows:", "\u201cThe starting point in assessing Al Nashiri\u2019s own chronology of secret detention in these proceedings should be Poland, because we have it confirmed, as a matter of judicial fact, that Al Nashiri was detained in Poland, having been transported there on the flight of N63MU from Bangkok to Szymany on 4 and 5 December 2002. So he found himself in Poland at the end of 2002, during which he was subjected to all the documented abuse, the enhanced interrogation techniques and the unauthorised techniques described in the earlier proceedings, into the calendar year 2003. In the earlier proceedings we presented a range of flights which brought detainees into Poland.", "However, the first flight which took detainees out of Poland occurred on 5 and 6 June 2003. Based upon, now, the confirmations in the Senate Committee Report, we can see this outward flight from Poland as the starting point of Mr Nashiri\u2019s next chronology of detention. It is stated explicitly June 2003, from that point onwards, Mr Nashiri was detained in five further sites before ultimately being transferred to Guant\u00e1namo in September 2006. The flight on 5 June 2003 took Mr Nashiri, together with another CIA detainee, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, to Rabat, Morocco. Rabat, Morocco, at that time was a facility lent to the Agency, to CIA, by their Moroccan counterparts. It was a facility which resided within the Moroccan system, and it is described in explicit detail in the Senate Report. That facility was the same place to which some persons from Guant\u00e1namo would be later taken back, but I will explain why Mr Nashiri was not one of those, with reference to the same material. In 2003, according to the report, it was allowed to operate until September, at which point relations became acrimonious and certain conditions were placed upon it. The CIA collected its detainees who were housed there, which included Mr Al Nashiri, on 23 September 2003 in the rendition circuit I demonstrated. That is the date confirmed from the CIA\u2019s own reporting, and the flight confirmed through our investigations, the rendition circuit I demonstrated. So we are now taking Mr Nashiri from Poland to Morocco as number 1, Guant\u00e1namo as number 2.\u201d", "109. The 2014 US Senate Committee Report\u2019s section entitled \u201cCountry [name redacted] Detains Individuals on the CIA\u2019s Behalf\u201d, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:", "\u201cConsideration of a detention facility in Country [name blackened] began in [month blackened] 2003, when the CIA sought to transfer Ramzi bin al-Shibh from the custody of a foreign government to CIA custody [blackened] which had not yet informed the country\u2019 political leadership of the CIA\u2019s request to establish a clandestine detention facility in Country [blackened], surveyed potential sites for the facility, while the CIA set aside [USD] [number blackened] million for its construction.", "In 2003, the CIA arranged for a \u2018temporary patch\u2019 involving placing two CIA detainees (Ramzi bin al-Shibh and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri) within an already existing Country [blackened] detention facility, until the CIA\u2019s own facility could be built.", "...", "By [day/month blackened] 2003, after an extension of five months beyond the originally agreed upon timeframe for concluding CIA detention activities in Country [blackened], both bin al-Shibh and al-Nashiri had been transferred out of Country [blackened]| to the CIA detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.\u201d", "110. According to Mr J.G.S, on 23 September 2003 the applicant was transported from Rabat to Guant\u00e1namo Bay on the plane N313P.", "Mr J.G.S., in the course of the above mentioned PowerPoint presentation at the fact-finding hearing (see paragraphs 18 above and 367-376 below), gave the following details concerning N313P\u2019s circuit of 20-24 September 2003:", "\u201cHaving departed from Washington, this aircraft, ... N313P, flew to Prague in the Czech Republic for a stopover before heading eastward to Tashkent, Uzbekistan, where dissident detainees, handed over to the CIA by local intelligence services, were rendered to secret detention in Kabul.", "From Kabul, on 21 September 2003, the aircraft transported several detainees out of detention in Afghanistan towards detention in Europe. The first stop in Europe was the detention site at Szymany, in northern Poland, which was explicitly described in the [Al Nashiri v. Poland and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah ) v. Poland] proceedings, and this circuit is unprecedented and indeed unique because it is the only occasion on which a rendition flight carrying CIA detainees left one European site and flew directly to another European detention site, in this case in Bucharest, Romania. ...", "From Bucharest, the rendition plane carried further detainees out to Rabat. These were persons who had boarded on earlier legs, not persons leaving Romania, and from Rabat to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, where for four months, in late 2003 and early 2004, the CIA operated a secret detention facility apart from the larger military facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.\u201d", "111. As established in Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, the plane N313P landed in Szymany, Poland on 22 September 2003 en route from Kabul, Afghanistan. On that day Mr Abu Zubaydah was transferred by the CIA from Poland on board that plane.", "The plane set off from Dulles Airport in Washington, D.C. on Saturday 20 September 2003 at 22h02m GMT and undertook a four-day flight circuit, during which it landed in and departed from six different foreign countries, as well as the U.S. Naval Base at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.", "These six countries, in the order in which the aircraft landed there, were: the Czech Republic, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Poland, Romania, and Morocco. The aircraft flew from Rabat, Morocco to Guant\u00e1namo Bay on the night of 23 September 2003, landing there in the morning of 24 September 2003.", "112. In Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland (see \u00a7 312) Mr J.G.S. gave the following account of the \u201cfinal rendition circuit\u201d through Poland executed by the N313P plane, a Boeing 737, on 22 September 2003:", "\u201cOne flight circuit however is of particular significance and this is the final part of our presentation in which we would like to discuss how the detention operations in Poland were brought to an end.", "In September 2003 the CIA rendition and detention programme underwent another overhaul analogous to the one which had taken place in December 2002 when Mr Nashiri and Mr Zubaydah were transferred from Thailand to Poland. On this occasion, the CIA executed a rendition circuit which entailed visiting no fewer than five secret detention sites at which CIA detainees were held. These included, in sequence, Szymany in Poland, Bucharest in Romania, Rabat in Morocco and Guant\u00e1namo Bay, a secret CIA compartment of Guant\u00e1namo Bay, having initially commenced in Kabul, Afghanistan. On this particular flight route, it has been found that all of the detainees who remained in Poland at that date were transferred out of Poland and deposited into the successive detention facilities at the onward destinations: Bucharest, Rabat and Guant\u00e1namo. Among those persons was one of the applicants today, Mr Zubaydah, who was taken on that date from Poland to Guant\u00e1namo Bay. This particular flight circuit was again disguised by dummy flight planning although significantly not in respect of Poland. It was the sole official declaration of Szymany as a destination in the course of all the CIA\u2019s flights into Poland. The reason therefor being that no detainee was being dropped off in Szymany on the night of 22 September and the methodology of disguising flight planning pertained primarily to those renditions which dropped a detainee off at the destination. Since this visit to Szymany was comprised solely of a pick-up of the remaining detainees, the CIA declared Szymany as a destination openly and instead disguised its onward destinations of Bucharest and Rabat, hence demonstrating that the methodology of disguised flight planning continued for the second European site in Bucharest, Romania and indeed for other detention sites situated elsewhere in the world.\u201d", "113. The Romanian Civil Aeronautical Authority (Autoritatea Aeronautic\u0103 Civil\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u2013 \u201cRCAA\u201d), in its letter of 29 July 2009 (\u201cRCAA letter\u201d) stated that N313P\u2019s itinerary was: Szczytno Airport (which is located in Szymany, Poland) \u2013 Constan\u0163a Airport but the airport in Romania at which it landed was B\u0103neasa Airport in Bucharest (see also paragraph 324 below).", "114. The 2014 US Senate Committee Report, in the section entitled \u201cUS Supreme Court Action in the case of Rasul v. Bush Forces transfer of CIA detainees from Guant\u00e1namo to Bay to Country [name blackened]\u201d (see also paragraph 61 above), states:", "\u201cBeginning in September 2003, the CIA held a number of detainees at CIA facilities on the grounds of, but separate from, the U.S. military detention facilities at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. In early January 2004, the CIA and the Department of Justice began discussing the possibility that a pending U.S. Supreme Court case Rasul v. Bush, might grant habeas corpus rights to the five CIA detainees then being held at a CIA detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Shortly after these discussions, CIA officers approached the [REDACTED] in Country [REDACTED] to determine if it would again be willing to host these CIA detainees, who would remain in CIA custody within an already existing Country [REDACTED] facility. By January [day REDACTED] 2004, the [REDACTED] in Country [REDACTED] had agreed to this arrangement for a limited period of time.", "Meanwhile, CIA General Counsel Scott Muller asked the Department of Justice, the National Security Council, and the White House Counsel for advice on whether the five CIA detainees being held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay should remain in Guant\u00e1namo Bay or be moved pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. After consultation with the U.S. solicitor general in February 2004, the Department of Justice recommended that the CIA move four detainees out of a CIA detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay pending the Supreme Court\u2019s resolution of the case. The Department of Justice concluded that a fifth detainee, Ibn Shaykh al-Libi, did not need to be transferred because he had originally been detained under military authority and had been declared to the ICRC. Nonetheless, by April [redacted two-digit number] 2004, all five CIA detainees were transferred from Guant\u00e1namo Bay to other CIA detention facilities.\u201d", "115. In his application lodged on 1 June 2012 the applicant submitted that sometime between 6 June 2003 and 6 September 2006 Romania had hosted a secret CIA prison, codenamed \u201cBright Light\u201d and located in Bucharest. The applicant\u2019s rendition and secret detention were related as follows:", "\u201cMr Al Nashiri was captured in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates in October 2002. By November 2002, he had been secretly transferred to the custody of the CIA. He was held in various secret locations before being detained in Romania. US agents first took him to a secret CIA prison in Afghanistan known as the \u2018Salt Pit\u2019. In Afghanistan, interrogators subjected him to \u2018prolonged stress standing positions\u2019, during which his wrists were \u2018shackled to a bar or hook in the ceiling above the head\u2019 for \u2018at least two days\u2019. US agents then took him to another secret CIA prison in Thailand, where he remained until 5 December 2002. According to a United Nations Report, on 5 December 2002, the CIA transported Mr Al Nashiri on a chartered flight with tail number N63MU from Bangkok to a secret CIA detention site in Poland. On or about 6 June 2003, Polish authorities assisted the CIA in secretly transferring Mr. al Nashiri from Poland. ...", "After his transfer out of Poland, between 6 June 2003 and 6 September 2006 Mr Al Nashiri was held in various secret detention facilities abroad, including a CIA prison in Bucharest, Romania. He was transferred to Guant\u00e1namo Bay by 6 September 2006.\u201d", "As for the possible date of his rendition to Romania during the period between 6 June 2003 and 6 September 2006 the applicant mentioned 22 September 2003, i.e. the date on which the aircraft N313P executed its \u201cfinal rendition circuit\u201d through Poland, via Romania and Morocco (see paragraph 115 above). In that regard, he referred to the 2007 Marty Report (see also paragraphs 257-265 below), which had identified N313P as a \u201crendition plane\u201d and which, according to the flight plans of 22 September 2003 and the Romanian officials, had had as its destination Constan\u0163a and Bucharest.", "116. In further observations filed by the applicant\u2019s representatives on 26 April 2013, it was stated that he had been transferred to a CIA \u201cblack site\u201d in Romania on the plane N85VM from Guant\u00e1namo Bay to Bucharest on 12 April 2004. It was explained that that fact had emerged from a dossier submitted by Mr Hammarberg, the former Council of Europe\u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights, to the Prosecutor General of Romania (see also paragraphs 334-336 below). The dossier and new information about the applicant\u2019s transfers in CIA custody had not been publicly available earlier.", "117. The above-mentioned dossier produced by Mr Hammarberg states that on 12 April 2004 the applicant was transferred to the CIA \u201cblack site\u201d in Romania on the N85VM flight from Guant\u00e1namo Bay to Bucharest. It further states that N85VM landed at 21h47m GMT on the night of 12 April 2004 and was assessed to have been bringing in CIA detainee(s) from the US Naval Base, Guant\u00e1namo Bay via a technical stopover in Tenerife, with a false \u2013 \u201cdummy\u201d \u2013 flight plan filed featuring Constan\u0163a instead of its real destination, which was Bucharest (see paragraphs 334-336 below).", "118. The Romanian Government submitted a set of six documents originating from the Romanian Airport Services (\u201cRAS\u201d) at B\u0103neasa \u2013 Bucharest City Airport, described as \u201cannex no. 8\u201d to the 2007 Romanian Senate Report (see also paragraph 164 below), which were examined in the course of the Parliamentary inquiry in Romania. They initially asked that that the annex be treated as confidential. At the fact-finding hearing, the Government submitted that they no longer wished the Court to maintain its confidentiality (see paragraph 12 above).", "The first document, invoice no. 386 dated 13 April 2004, was issued by the handling agent of the RAS for Richmor Aviation and indicated an amount charged of 1,255.00 euros (EUR) due for ground services (basic handling, landing fee, lighting fee and navigation services) relating to the N85VM landing.", "The second document, ground handling note no. 0036904 dated 12 April 2004 indicated the same amount.", "The third document was a copy of an Air Routing card issued for Richmor Aviation.", "The fourth document, air navigation services sheet no. 906 dated 12 April 2004 included navigation services charges. It indicated that N85VM landed at B\u0103neasa Airport at 21h50m on 12 April 2004 and departed at 22h45m on the same day.", "The fifth document was a partly illegible table containing landing fees for several planes, including N85VM.", "The sixth document \u2013 a control list of navigation records indicated, among other things, the N85VM landing on 12 April 2004 at 21h47m.", "119. In the course of the PowerPoint presentation Mr J.G.S. testified as follows:", "\u201c...[T]he transfer date of Al Nashiri to Romania was 12 April 2004. Our investigations have provided evidence that this transfer took place directly from Guant\u00e1namo Bay to the \u2018black site\u2019 in Bucharest, Romania. Again, the [US] Senate Committee Report, albeit using code names, coloured code names for the sites in question, describes explicitly where particular detainees were at particular times, and in this passage highlighted, in describing the closure of the Guant\u00e1namo Bay facility in the face of probable exposure due to a Supreme Court assessment of the legality of their detention, it states that \u2018by a date in April 2004, all five CIA detainees were transferred from Guant\u00e1namo Bay to other CIA detention facilities\u2019. The use of \u2018facilities\u2019 here in the plural is very important, because the principal destination for those held by the CIA at Guant\u00e1namo was in fact back to the facility in Morocco from whence they had come. However, as the Senate inquiry made clear, not all of those held at Guant\u00e1namo went back to Morocco, and indeed the date cited here, 12 April 2004, coincides with the flight of N85VM aircraft from Guant\u00e1namo to B\u0103neasa, Bucharest, in Romania. This is the flight circuit, again it is backed up by a tranche of documentary evidence which I am prepared to provide to the Court, and in particular this graphic demonstrates that there were two distinct transfers out of Guant\u00e1namo. The first on 27 March 2004 carried detainees from Guant\u00e1namo back to Rabat, Morocco. The second of these, which is of our principal interest, transported one or more detainees, among them Al Nashiri, via a stopover in Tenerife onto Romania.", "I have put together a graphic to illustrate that, once again, the CIA had recourse to its systematic practice of disguised flight planning in respect of this flight. We reached a point in our investigations, Madam President, where evidence of dummy flight planning in fact became a tell-tale sign of rendition or detainee transfer activity on such flights. So it is significant, as I will demonstrate, that this was not a simple circuit. The aircraft embarked from Washington and flew to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, whereupon the blue line demonstrates the first part of the detainee transfer from Guant\u00e1namo to Tenerife, a flight planned and executed. From Tenerife, however, the aviation services provider, in this case Air Rutter International from Houston, Texas, filed a dummy flight plan to the alternative Romanian destination of Constan\u0163a, on the Black Sea Coast. The aircraft, however, flew and landed at Bucharest B\u0103neasa Airport, as documentation from the Romanian authorities demonstrates. It is this flight, depicted here with the blue line, that carried Al Nashiri to detention in Bucharest. From Bucharest, the aircraft flew back to Rabat, Morocco, and it is apparent premise that one or more detainees from the Romanian site, detained prior to April 2004, was at that point taken from Bucharest back to detention in Morocco, after which the aircraft returned to its base at Washington D.C.", "We have been able to uncover this and other flights planned through the network of private contractors, thanks to a large amount of documentation filed in court proceedings in civil courts in New York State, whereupon several US aviation service providers, contracted to the CIA, ended up in a financial dispute. The case in question, Sportsflight Inc. against [sic] Richmor Aviation, in fact concerns the CIA\u2019s chief aviation contractor, Computer Sciences Corporation, formerly DynCorp, its use of a prime aviation contractor known as Sportsflight Air, previously Capital Aviation, which in turn subcontracted its government mandates to a private company called Richmor Aviation, who were the owners and operators of the aircraft N85VM.", "I appreciate that this web of corporate relations is quite difficult to understand on its face, but over several years, myself and other investigators have carefully unpicked these relationships to provide the direct link between the tasking of the United States Government on government contracts through the CIA\u2019s rendition group air branch, all the way down to the pilots, crew members and operators of the aircraft in question. It is unambiguously and categorically the case that these are rendition aircraft, operated for the sole purpose of transferring detainees between \u2018black sites\u2019 in the CIA\u2019s RDI programme. The flight of N85VM, on the dates in question, belongs in that category.\u201d", "120. As regards the circumstances surrounding the applicant\u2019s transfer from Guant\u00e1namo to Romania, Mr J.G.S. testified at the fact-finding hearing as follows:", "\u201cThe Guant\u00e1namo site operated only for a finite period. As I mentioned, it was due to the judicial scrutiny of the Supreme Court with a case pending in Rasul v. Bush, which was likely to expose CIA detainees to the same reporting obligations, but also the same rights, that detainees in other forms of federal custody would enjoy, and so the CIA deliberately took action to remove its detainees from such scrutiny in advance of the Supreme Court ruling. The Senate Committee Report describes this process, based upon cables and other classified material, and states that by April 2004, the date I assert, 12 April 2004, all of those detainees who were held in Guant\u00e1namo were moved out.", "There were two flights, as I demonstrated, which formed part of this removal process, the first on 27 March 2004, the second on 12 April 2004. But the first of those only went to Rabat, Morocco, and if you recall, the Committee described, based upon its assessment of interrogation schedules, that Mr Nashiri had been to five different sites in that 3-year timeframe, and in order for him to be in five different sites, he, at that moment, could not have gone back to Morocco, because there are not sufficient documented instances of rendition which link the territories in question, Guant\u00e1namo, Rabat and Bucharest, in the timeframe in which the report confirms Mr Nashiri\u2019s tour of the sites.", "The 12th April 2004 site was the sole outward flight linking Guant\u00e1namo to Romania. From the report, from the cables regarding Mr Nashiri\u2019s treatment and physical and psychological state, we know that he found himself in Romania in the 3rd quarter and 4th quarter of 2004, and in July 2005, there were specific notes made upon his state and status in those date frames. In order for him to have been in Romania at Detention Site Black or \u2018Britelite\u2019 by that time, he had to be brought to Romania on flight N85VM on 12 April 2004.", "It is a process of elimination, but it is also a process of correlation, which very clearly links to documents filed by contractors, corresponds with the international aviation data that we have analysed, corresponds with the tactics of dummy flight planning and disguise, and ultimately is validated in the public record by the Senate Report.\u201d", "121. Mr Black, referring to the applicant\u2019s alleged rendition to Romania testified as follows:", "\u201cI am aware of two possible flights that could have taken the applicant Al Nashiri into Romania, that [a flight with the tail number N85VM], is one of them. There is a potential other one that occurred in February 2005. We know for a fact that he was in Romania after February 2005, we know from cables referenced in the Senate Report that he was in Romania in June 2005. There are indications that he was held in Romania before that, in late 2004, which leads me, of the two possibilities, that leads me to prefer the April 2004 flight as being the more likely of the two. In terms of my own research, I would say that there is a small ambiguity on that point, I am not prepared to say that the data I have at my fingertips conclusively demonstrates that he was taken on the April flight in 2004 rather than the February one in 2005. I think the balance of probability does lie in favour of that. However, whichever of the two it is, there is no doubt that he was in Romania by the summer of 2005.\u201d", "122. The applicant submitted that throughout his detention by the CIA he had been subjected to torture and other forms of ill-treatment prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention.", "123. On 15 June 2016 the US authorities disclosed to the public a second, less redacted version of the transcript of the hearing held by the Combatant Status Review Tribunal in Guant\u00e1namo on 14 March 2007 (for the first, more extensively redacted version see Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 112-113; see also paragraphs 142-143 below). During that hearing the applicant described the treatment to which he had been subjected in CIA custody from his capture in November 2002 to his transfer to Guant\u00e1namo in September 2006. The relevant part of that transcript read, as follows:", "\u201cFrom the time I was arrested five years ago, they have been torturing me. It happened during interviews. One time they tortured me one way and another time they tortured me in a different way.", "By hanging, head was up and legs were pointing downwards. I was hung for almost a month. You doing your things basically and you were hung upside down and drowning and hitting at the wall. There are many scars on my head if I shave my head. If I shave my hair the scars will become obvious.", "What else do I want to say? I was without clothes. I was sleeping on the floor for about a month. Many things happened. There were doing so many things. What else did they did?", "There a box half meter by half meter. It was two meters in height They used to put me inside the box. I was standing in that box for about a week and I couldn\u2019t do anything. My feet were swollen. My nails were about fall off because, I was standing on my feet for long time. They do so many things. So so many things. What else did they did?", "That thing lasted for about six month[s]. After that another method of torture began. They use to put something in the food that use to make the body tired. Before I was arrested I used to be able to run about ten kilometers. Now, I cannot walk for more than ten minutes. My nerves are swollen in my body. Swollen too. They used to ask me questions and the investigator after that used to laugh. And, I used to answer the answer that I knew. And, if I didn\u2019t reply what I heard, he used to put something in my food. And, after I ate it my body felt like, um, strange. After that he used to come back and talk to me. He told you he put anything in the food. He used to deny that but the camera was behind him. And; I would stand in front of the camera and he used to tell you that because camera was on. He could not deny anything. You have to acknowledge to what we are saying. And, I used to say acknowledge what? They used to ask even political questions. One is the solution to the American problem in Iraq. I\u2019m not the American Foreign Minister to answer these questions. So they used to go and put some stuff in my food. These things happen for more than two years. That thing did not stop until here. So many things happened. I don\u2019t in summary, that\u2019s basically what happened.", "Then, the President of the Combatant Status Review Tribunal says:", "Alright. Let me ask. So then since the time of capture 2002 until you came to Guant\u00e1namo you experienced these types of events?", "The applicant responds:", "Yes.\u201d", "124. At the fact-finding hearing Mr J.G.S. made the following statements concerning the treatment to which the applicant could be subjected during his alleged detention in Romania:", "\u201cI find myself somewhat more limited in my ability to describe specific forms of treatment or interrogation techniques to which Mr Nashiri was subjected in Romania than was the case in respect of Poland. And that is because of the natural evolution of the detention cycles to which CIA detainees were subjected. In pursuit of what was described as \u2018live actionable intelligence\u2019, the CIA developed its most stringent, harsh interrogation plans for the earliest days and weeks of a detainee\u2019s period in its detention system. Usually, within one to three days of being apprehended, the chief of base at the \u2018black site\u2019 in question would appeal to CIA headquarters for authorisation to practise EITs, so called \u2018enhanced interrogation techniques\u2019. This was the case in respect of Abu Zubaydah, this was the case in respect of Al Nashiri, this was the case in respect of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, this we know because of the Inspector General\u2019s reports. As soon as a detainee was in custody, in Abu Zubaydah\u2019s case, was fit enough to undergo interrogation, that plan would commence. We know that Al Nashiri underwent twelve days of harsh interrogation in Thailand including the waterboard, and we know that upon transfer to Poland, because he was assessed as having withheld information or not been compliant, he was then subjected to an intensive period of harsh interrogation during with multiple, unauthorised techniques were used. Those were documented in the earlier proceedings [Al Nashiri v. Poland]. But there arrives a juncture in a CIA detainee\u2019s detention at which his intelligence value is assessed as lower, at which no further approval or authorisation is sought or granted to practise these enhanced interrogation techniques, and in Al Nashiri\u2019s case we can only say that that point arrived sometime in 2003. Thereafter, it is, in my assessment and according to the documentary record, unlikely that the CIA practised further unauthorised techniques or indeed concerted programmes of enhanced interrogation on Mr Nashiri.", "However, that is not to say that he was not subjected to abuse or indeed that the conditions of his confinement did not amount to violations of the European Convention. In respect of those two latter points, I would aver quite clearly that the treatment did amount to violations of the Convention, purely by virtue of the conditions in which he was held and because of the regular interventions made by persons at the \u2018black site\u2019 to gratuitously abuse, punitively or otherwise, certain detainees in their custody. I can give you analogous examples of how detainees were treated in Romania. Hassan Ghul, for example: there is a lengthy description of his having endured 59 hours of sleep deprivation, having been shaved and barbered, stripped naked, placed in standing positions with his hands above his head. There are descriptions of how, notwithstanding medical and psychological problems diagnosed by professionals at the scene, he was subjected to further interrogation to the point of enduring hallucinations. I could also cite the example of Janat Gul, a detainee for whom the CIA sought authorisation to use the waterboard in Romania, an unprecedented move, and who was subsequently subjected to an intensive period of enhanced interrogation in the same site at which Al Nashiri was held. I could also cite the case of Abu Faraj al-Libi who was captured in 2005 and even at that point, three years and more into the programme, was subjected to the same litany of abusive techniques in interrogating him as Al Nashiri and others had been subjected to in 2002 and 2003. And I could also cite, too, some memoranda produced by the CIA General Counsel\u2019s office in the material period in which Al Nashiri was held in Romania, which described conditions of confinement, sensory deprivation as a matter of routine, denial of religious rights, physical and psychological oppression, sleep deprivation as a matter of course, notwithstanding whether a detainee is subject at that time, or not, to EITs.", "So whilst I cannot give the same level of specificity as I was able to present in respect of Poland, I can aver with a high level of certainty that he endured ill-treatment whilst held in Romania because, in my view, every one of those detainees brought to Romania, held incommunicado, indefinitely, with no idea of their whereabouts or their fate, subjected to frequent renditions, shackled, drugged, often beaten in the process, every one of those persons would have a legitimate claim under our European Convention on Human Rights for violation of their personal integrity.\u201d", "125. Mr Black testified as follows:", "\u201cThe question of precise types of treatment is, I would not say it is my specific expertise. It is clear from the Senate Report and other sources that treatment in Romania included very extreme sleep deprivation, which apparently led some of those who suffered it to have very severe mental and physical problems, and it is clear also that the applicant, Mr Nashiri, in particular when he was in Romania, was experiencing serious, let\u2019s say, psychological problems as a result of the treatment that he had received. But my, and I should say also it is clear that around that time, between 2003 and 2005, it is firmly on the record that there were a range of treatments being applied to these people, that the enhanced interrogation techniques were being applied, I think this has all been quite well documented, but it is not really my topic of expertise, I would not say.\u201d", "126. Citing as a source two CIA cables of 23 May 2004, the 2014 US Senate Committee Report states that \u201cat one point Al Nashiri launched a short-lived hunger strike that resulted in the CIA feeding him rectally\u201d (see also paragraph 158 below).", "Referring to an email to Detention Site Black dated 30 October 2004 on the subject \u201cInterrogator Assessments/Request for Endgame Views\u201d, the report states that \u201can October 2004 psychological assessment of Al Nashiri was used by the CIA to advance its discussions with National Security Council officials on establishing an \u201cendgame\u201d for the [HVD] program\u201d", "127. The 2014 US Senate Committee Report further refers to the applicant\u2019s detention at Detention Site Black in June and July 2005 as follows:", "\u201cIn the final years of al-Nashiri\u2019s detention, most of the intelligence requirements for al-Nashiri involved showing al-Nashiri photographs. In June 2005, the DETENTION SITE BLACK chief of Base suspended even these debriefings because it was \u2018the very, very rare moment\u2019 that al-Nashiri would recognize a photograph, and because the debriefings often were the \u2018catalyst\u2019 for his outbursts.\u201d", "It also states, with reference to a cable of 5 July 2005, that in July 2005 CIA Headquarters expressed concern regarding Al Nashiri\u2019s \u201ccontinued state of depression and uncooperative attitude\u201d. Days later a CIA psychologist assessed that the applicant was on the \u201cverge of a breakdown\u201d (see also paragraph 158 below).", "128. In his initial submissions the applicant submitted that no later than 6 September 2006 the Romanian authorities had assisted the CIA in secretly transferring him from Bucharest to another CIA \u201cblack site\u201d.", "129. The experts gave two possible dates for the applicant\u2019s rendition from Romania: 6 October 2005 and 5 November 2005. According to them, the latter date was the final closure of the CIA \u201cblack site\u201d on Romania\u2019s territory, prompted by the publication of Dana Priest\u2019s article \u201cCIA Holds Terror Suspects in Secret Prisons\u201d suggesting that such prisons operated in Eastern European countries on 2 November 2005 (see also paragraph 236 below).", "130. In the course of the PowerPoint presentation Mr J.G.S. testified as follows:", "\u201cIn terms of [the Black Site in Romania\u2019s] closure, it is stated in the [2014 US Senate Committee Report] that after the publication of the Washington Post article, that is the piece of reporting, the Pulitzer Prize-winning article by Dana Priest, ... dated 2 November 2005, the authorities of this country demanded the closure of Detention Site Black within a number of hours fewer than 100. We can see that from the redaction, it does not state exactly how many hours, but it is no more than four days. And in fact, as I described, 5 November 2005, using its practices of dummy flight planning and a further disguise which I will demonstrate shortly, the CIA transferred all of its remaining CIA detainees out of the facility within this time period. Again, as stated, flights into and out of Romania correspond exactly with the narrative described in the report.", "It might be pointed out, in relation to this specific package, that in order for the authorities of the host country to demand the closure of a detention facility, they must have known of its existence. Furthermore, in light of the report in The Washington Post, which went into intimate detail of the CIA\u2019s operations including the forms of ill-treatment and interrogation to which detainees therein were subjected, it follows that the authorities of the host country of Detention Site Black \u2013 and let me be clear \u2013 that is the authorities of Romania, must have known of the nature of operations occurring on their territory.", "The question has often been posed to us, Honourable Judges, if there were detainees in Romania, how did they leave? There appeared to be no obvious direct flights out of Romania in the critical period, October, November 2005, to any other detention site we were aware of, and this was often put forward by representatives of the Romanian authorities as a reason for decrying, for rejecting, for refuting the content of our reporting [i.e. at the time of the publication of the 2006 and the 2007 Marty Reports].", "We have, however, now ascertained how detainees were removed from Romania, and this occurred in two tranches in the months of October 2005 and, as stated, November 2005. I have chosen to illustrate the first of these transfers, which occurred between 5 and 6 of October 2005, because it provides a further segue into detention operations on the territory of another Council of Europe Member State, in this case Lithuania.", "The CIA used two tactics of deceit in order to provide these flights with the maximum degree of cover, in order that they could not and would not be tracked, traced or held to account. The first of those was its conventional dummy flight planning, but the second of those was a novel tactic involving switching of aircraft. This graphic will demonstrate how this was deployed on 5 and 6 October 2005, involving two aircraft, namely N308AB and N787WH. The first of those aircraft is depicted by red lines, the second by blue, on the graphic, the other symbols follow the earlier pattern of drop-off, transfer and stopover points. The two planes arrived in Europe, the first [N308AB] from provenance of Teterboro, New Jersey, the second [N787WH] from provenance of Keflavik in Iceland on 5 October 2005. While the first flew to Bratislava, in Slovakia, the second flew directly to Tirana, Albania, which would become the staging point for these operations. The first dummy flight plan, filed by the CIA\u2019s aviation services provider, stated a path for N308AB from Bratislava to Constan\u0163a airport, a route which it did not, nor did it intend, to fly. The aircraft instead flew directly to Bucharest B\u0103neasa airport, the servicing airport for the \u2018black site\u2019 in Romania, whereupon it would collect detainees. Those detainees referred to in the Senate Committee Report who were cleared from Romania in these critical months were then taken from Bucharest to Tirana, to the staging point where the other CIA aircraft had been waiting for a day in advance. In this staging point, in an unprecedented manoeuvre, according to our investigations, detainees were transferred from the first aircraft onto the second, together with members of the CIA rendition crew. The second aircraft, N787WH, which is also a Boeing 737 business jet, used conventionally for wholesale transfers filed its own dummy flight plan, citing a destination of Tallinn, Estonia, a route which it did not, nor did it intend, to fly. Instead, this aircraft N787WH flew on 6 October 2005 carrying detainees from Romania to Vilnius, Lithuania, thereby providing a link between two detention sites on European territory. The aircraft then departed in their own respective directions, the rendition aircraft N787WH via Oslo, towards the north, and the first aircraft, N308AB from Tirana, via Shannon, back towards New Jersey. Therein the CIA had innovated yet another means, another layer of cover to obstruct proper accounting for the illegal transfer of its detainees, but due to a process which Senator Marty referred to as \u2018la dynamique de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9\u2019, we have been able, methodically and carefully, to unpick these layers of secrecy and present to this Court what we believe is a truthful and accurate accounting of operations in respect of these \u2018black sites\u2019.\u201d", "131. In his further testimony, in response to questions from the Court, Mr J.G.S. added:", "\u201cThere are two known and documented junctures at which CIA detainees at the \u2018black site\u2019 in Romania were removed from Romania. The first of those, I illustrated with my last set of graphics, on 5 and 6 October, which took detainees from Bucharest, Romania via switching of aircraft in Albania, to Vilnius, Lithuania. The second took place on 5 November 2005, within three to four days of the Washington Post\u2019s report, and at the insistence of the Romanian authorities, which took detainees via Amman, Jordan to Kabul, Afghanistan. We know that at 1 January 2006 there were only two CIA detention sites in active operation, that much is stated in the Senate Report. Those were the sites known as \u2018Violet\u2019 and \u2018Orange\u2019: the former, \u2018Violet\u2019, in Lithuania, the latter, \u2018Orange\u2019, in Afghanistan. And so Al Nashiri, in all likelihood and without any other information to refer to, was taken to one of those two destinations on one of those two flights. Based upon my earlier rationale about the five different facilities in which he was held, I would aver that it is more likely than not that he was taken from Romania to Lithuania on 5 and 6 October 2005 and was held there until onwards transfer in March 2006 to Afghanistan and subsequently on to Guant\u00e1namo Bay. That would, logically, complete the number and nature of detention experiences chronicled in the Senate Committee Report and other documents released by the United States.\u201d", "132. Mr Black testified as follows:", "\u201c ... [T]here are two possibilities, and I believe only two possibilities: one is that [the applicant] left [Romania] in October 2005, on 5 October 2005, and the other is that he left on the 5 November 2005. If the flight on 5 October 2005 was a dual flight, it was a kind of a two-plane switch that took prisoners from Romania into Lithuania, and the flight the following month in November 2005 was again a two-plane switch that took prisoners from Romania into Afghanistan. I think there is an indication in the data that we have, based on the Senate Report, that Mr Nashiri was taken to Lithuania, which should mean he was taken in October rather than November, but it is, I would not say it is a hundred per cent clear, unambiguous. I would say it is an indication that seems probable. There is no doubt that the flight in November signalled the end of the Romanian site, I mean it came, I do not know, 72 hours after the existence of the site had been revealed in The Washington Post, the government had demanded the site shut down, the Senate Report is very clear that at that point everyone who was remaining in Romania was shipped out to Afghanistan, so at that point, after the 5 November 2005, the CIA \u2018black site\u2019 programme was operating only in Lithuania and in Afghanistan.\u201d", "133. The relevant section in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report reads as follows:", "\u201cAfter publication of the Washington Post article, [REDACTED] Country [REDACTED] demanded closure of DETENTION SITE BLACK within [two-digit number REDACTED] hours. The CIA transferred the [number REDACTED] remaining CIA detainees out of the facility shortly thereafter.\u201d", "134. According to public Eurocontrol flight data based on, among other things, the flight data entered by the Romanian authorities into the Eurocontrol system, which was referred to by Mr J.G.S and Mr Black, the flight circuit of October 2005 involving planes N308AB and N787WH and the circuit of November 2005 involving planes N1HC and N248AB can be described as follows.", "135. As regards the circuit of 1-7 October 2005, executed by planes N308AB and N787WH:", "(a) Eurocontrol data shows N308AB filing a flight plan departing from Teterboro, USA at 13:31 on 4 October 2005 with scheduled arrival time at Bratislava, Slovakia at 22:58 the same day. On the following day it filed a flight plan departing from Bratislava at 19:06 with scheduled arrival time at Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu International Airport, Constan\u0163a, Romania at 20:41. It then filed a plan departing 40 minutes later, at 21:21, from B\u0103neasa Bucharest City Airport. According to the experts, this indicated that the scheduled trip to Constan\u0163a was in fact a false flight plan, and that the plane did not go to Constan\u0163a, but rather to B\u0103neasa. Leaving B\u0103neasa it was scheduled to arrive in Tirana, Albania at 22:38. It filed its next flight plan from Tirana on 6 October at 01:08, with a scheduled arrival time in Shannon, Ireland, at 04:22 (all times are Zulu (i.e. GMT)).", "(b) Eurocontrol data shows that on 5 October 2005 at 00:45 N787WH filed a flight plan departing from Keflavik, Iceland with scheduled arrival in Tirana International Airport on the same day at 05:52. It then filed a flight plan departing Tirana at 23:44 with scheduled arrival at Tallinn, Estonia the following day at 02:26. It then filed a flight plan leaving 30 minutes later, at 02:56, not from Tallinn but from Vilnius International Airport, Lithuania, with scheduled arrival in Oslo at 04:33 (all times are Zulu (GMT)). Documents from Vilnius airport show that the plane landed in Vilnius at 01:54 Zulu / 04:54 local time, however, indicating that the scheduled trip to Tallinn was in fact a false flight plan, and that the plane did not go to Tallinn, but rather directly from Tirana to Vilnius (see also Abu Zubaydah v. Lithuania, no. 46454/11, \u00a7 130, 31 May 2018).", "As regards the circuit of 5-7 November 2005, executed by planes N1HC and N248AB:", "(a) Eurocontrol data shows that N1HC filed a flight plan to leave Harrisburg International Airport, USA at 10:30 on 5 November 2005, with scheduled arrival in Porto, Portugal at 16:58 the same day. It then filed a flight plan to leave Porto at 17:59, with scheduled arrival at Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu International Airport, Constan\u0163a, Romania at 21:45. Its next flight plan shows it leaving B\u0103neasa Bucharest City Airport 20 minutes later, at 22:05, with scheduled arrival at Amman, Jordan that night at 00:21 on 6 November. This, according to the experts, indicated that the scheduled trip to Constan\u0163a was in fact a false flight plan, and that the plane did not go to Constan\u0163a, but rather to B\u0103neasa.

On 27 December 2012 the Prosecutor\u2019s Office attached to the Court of Cassation (Parchetul de pe l\u00e2ng\u0103 \u020analta Curte de Casa\u021bie \u015fi Justi\u021bie \u2013 \u201cPICCJ\u201d) asked the RCAA to provide, in connection with the investigation the following information concerning certain flights mentioned in an annex to the request (the annex has not been produced):", "(a) any data, information, documents held with regard to the air traffic control in respect of the flights in question;", "(b) any audio or video recordings concerning the flights in question (for example: air traffic control or directing);", "(c) names of individuals who had carried out specific tasks on the dates when the flights in question had allegedly taken place;", "(d) names of individuals directly involved in facilitating or operating those flights.", "176. On 12 January 2013 the RCAA informed the PICCJ that, according to the relevant legislation in force at the relevant time (2003-2005), namely Government Decision no. 1172/2003, they had data concerning only a few flights \u2013 which they included in an annex (the annex has not been produced).", "The RCAA stated that the available data did not clearly show that these flights had taken place and that they did not have any documents which attested that the flights had actually taken place. According to the legislation in force at the material time, information in the RCAA\u2019s possession showed only an intention to operate the flights, which had been planned and notified to them.", "It further stated that Government Decision no. 1172/2003 had eliminated the need for the RCAA to approve flights which transited the national airspace with no commercial stop (and did not carry troops, military equipment, weapons, munitions, explosives, radioactive or other dangerous materials or did not fall in the category of technical flights) and, also, internal and international flights with civil aircraft registered abroad, landing and taking off from the Romanian territory, which were included in the category of civil air operations of general aviation. These flights were considered authorised if a flight plan on a published ATS (Air Traffic Service) route was submitted and the aircraft used were insured for damage caused to third parties on the ground.", "As regards audio or video recordings and names of any individuals involved, the RCAA stated that they did not have any such information.", "177. In addition, the Government produced copies of the following prosecutor\u2019s letters requesting information or documents from various authorities:", "(1) letter of 27 December 2012 addressed to the Romanian Government, asking for the classified annexes to the 2007 Romanian Senate Report;", "(2) letters of 27 December 2012 addressed to Timi\u015foara Airport, Constan\u0163a Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu Airport and Bucharest B\u0103neasa Airport, requesting information about the alleged suspicious flights, including audio or video recordings, and about the airport personnel who had worked on the relevant dates;", "(3) letter of 3 March 2013 addressed to the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure, requesting it to the transmit the National Programme of Aeronautical Security to the prosecutor;", "(4) letters of 18 March 2013 addressed to the Civil Aviation Directorate and the Bucharest Airports National Company requesting information about flights N313P, N85VM, N379P, N478GS, N228KA, N308AB, N789DK, N227SV, N787WH, N1HC, N2189M and N860JB, including general flight data from 2003-2006, types and purposes of flights, type of journey, flight route, flight operator, flight organiser, aircraft type, aircraft capacity, aircraft registration, documents regarding insurance, information about the crew and passengers, initial flight plans, subsequent flight documents, flight or overflight authorisations, specific requests for each flight and handling operator;", "(5) letter of 24 April 2013 addressed to the Bucharest Airports National Company, requesting information about applications for authorisation of access of persons and vehicles to the airplanes, the relevant records, information about the security personnel and the handling agents who had worked on the relevant dates at Bucharest B\u0103neasa Airport and at Constan\u0163a Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu Airport;", "(6) letter of 24 April 2013 addressed to the General Inspectorate of the Border Police, requesting information about the personnel who had worked on the relevant dates and any persons who entered, exited or transited the national territory on those dates through Bucharest B\u0103neasa Airport and Constan\u0163a Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu Airport;", "(7) letter of 29 April 2013 addressed to the Romanian Airport Services (\u201cRAS\u201d), requesting information about the personnel who had worked on the relevant dates and the handling operations performed.", "178. On an unspecified date, in response to the prosecutor\u2019s request, the Ministry of Transport-Civil Aviation Directorate provided the following documents:", "- flight plans of N312ME on 24 April 2003, N175A on 5 May 2003, N58AS on 16 June 2003, N313P on 22 September 2003, N313P on 25 January 2004 and N227SV on 1 October 2004;", "- control lists of the navigation records;", "- tables containing handling fees;", "- invoices issued by the RAS;", "- ground handling charge notes;", "- air navigation services sheets;", "- address no. 6 293 of 4 November 2006 issued by Timi\u0219oara Airport informing that, after checking their records, there was no evidence of the landing of the flight N313P operated by Business Jet Solutions.

The letter also mentioned that the flights concerned had not been identified as having operated at Henri Coand\u0103 Airport.", "- letter no. 2183 of 22 March 2013 from Constan\u0163a Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu Airport confirming, among other things, that N308AB had operated in that airport and that it had landed on 25 August 2004 at 00:03, and departed on 25 August 2004 at 01:33;", "- letter no. 3461 of 13 June 2006 from Constan\u0163a Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu Airport, confirming that the aircraft Lockheed L382 registered as N2189M had operated at that airport, landing on 13 June 2003 at 09:57, departing on 14 June 2003 at 08:31 and that the aircraft Gulfstream IV registered as N227SV had operated in the airport, landing on 1 October 2004 at 20:39 and departing at 21:26 on the same date.", "179. On 26 April 2013 the Bucharest Airports National Company replied to the prosecutor\u2019s request of 18 March 2013. The company stated that it did not have information about general flight data concerning the indicated aircraft in the period 2003-2006, the purpose of the flights, type of journey, flight organiser, aircraft capacity, any documents regarding insurance, information about the crew and passengers, initial flight plans, subsequent flight documents, flight or overflight authorisations or information about handling requests. It informed the prosecutor that the flight plans had been received through the AFTN terminal and had not been subject to archiving and that the RAS had been the handling operator in 2003-2006 at Bucharest B\u0103neasa Airport. A table containing information about the relevant flights was transmitted to the prosecutor.", "180. On 21 May 2013 the Bucharest Airports National Company replied to the prosecutor\u2019s request of 24 April 2013. The company transmitted the requested information about the applications for access authorisation to the planes and the relevant records. It also explained to the prosecutor that since the retention periods for the requested documents were from three to five years, it was impossible for it to produce any additional information about the requests for authorisations and the access records. The company also produced information concerning the security personnel who had worked on the relevant dates.", "181. On 20 May 2013 the General Inspectorate of the Border Police replied to the prosecutor\u2019s request of 24 April 2013. It forwarded a list containing the names, personal data and the present workplace of the personnel who had worked on the relevant dates. It also informed the prosecutor that flight logs had automatically been erased after five years and that, as a consequence, they could not submit the requested information about the persons who had entered, exited or transited the national territory on those dates at Bucharest B\u0103neasa Airport.", "182. On 11 July 2013 the General Inspectorate of the Border Police supplied information concerning the personnel who had worked at Bucharest B\u0103neasa Airport on 22 September 2003 and their personal data.", "183. On 13 June 2013 the RAS replied to the prosecutor\u2019s request of 29 April 2013. The RAS informed the prosecutor about the personnel who had worked on the relevant dates and transmitted several tables containing handling fees. They also stated that information about the handling services performed had been retained only for three years.", "184. In the meantime, on 24 April 2013, the prosecutor asked the Ministry of National Defence (Ministerul Ap\u0103r\u0103rii Na\u021bionale) to produce, on an urgent basis, the following information concerning the period of 2003-2006:", "(a) military flights carried out by US military aircraft or civilian flights carried out by the US air companies, which concerned \u201cthe transfer of individuals within the framework of the USA Special Rendition Program\u201d and which had had as a point of transfer, transit or destination \u201cairports on Romania\u2019s territory\u201d;", "(b) existence or non-existence, on Romania\u2019s territory, of alleged detention facilities set up at the US authorities\u2019 or the US forces\u2019 request and their possible location, including names of legal persons hosting them;", "(c) detention, interrogation, and subsequent transfer of individuals in the US forces\u2019 or the US authorities\u2019 custody from the alleged detention facilities to other locations;", "d) names of persons who had been subjected to such treatment.", "185. On 24 May 2013 the Ministry of National Defence replied that the requested materials were part of documents sent to the Romanian Senate Inquiry Committee by a note of 31 March 2006, which was classified as \u201cconfidential information\u201d. The Ministry stated that they did not have a copy of those documents, that the documents had been sent to the committee in a single copy (exemplar unic) and that they had not yet been returned to them. Moreover, the provision of information concerning civil aircraft which had operated in the Romanian airspace and in the Romanian international civilian airports fell within the competence and responsibility of the relevant departments attached to the Ministry of Transport.", "The Ministry further stated that, by their letter of 9 May 2008, sent to M. Constantinescu, a State councillor attached to the Prime-Minister\u2019s office, they had agreed that documents classified \u201cconfidential information\u201d be sent to the European Commission.", "Moreover, the Air Force General Staff (Statul Major al For\u021belor Aeriene) had stated that it had not had any records of flights operating in the airspace or in the military airports between 2003 and 2006 and transferring individuals in the framework of the US rendition programme; moreover, the representatives of the US authorities had not had access to buildings or air facilities belonging to air bases subordinate to the Air Force or exclusive access to certain areas.", "Lastly, the Ministry stated that the General Information Agency of the Defence (Direc\u021bia General\u0103 de Informa\u021bii a Ap\u0103r\u0103rii) had no information about the existence of secret US bases in Romania, about individuals allegedly detained illegally in Romanian prisons, their interrogation or transport to and from Romania by unmonitored or unauthorised flights.", "186. On 24 January 2014 the PICCJ asked the Service for International Judicial Cooperation, Programs and International Relations to forward a request for legal assistance (including 4 annexes) to the relevant US judicial authorities. In the letter of request, the prosecutor asked the US authorities to provide, in connection with the criminal investigation, information concerning, among other things, the period and circumstances of Mr AlNashiri\u2019s arrest and detention, the proceedings against him instituted by the US authorities; whether Mr Al-Nashiri had ever been brought to Romania in the context of his detention imposed by the US authorities under the CIA rendition programme and whether Romania had potentially been involved in that programme. The prosecutor also asked for the date of his arrival on Romanian territory, the means of transport used, the place of his detention on Romanian territory; the date of his departure from Romania, the means of transport used and the relevant documents and whether the Romanian authorities had been aware of his stay in the country.", "187. On an unspecified date in March 2014 the US Department of Justice replied to the letter of request, stating that the US authorities were not able to provide the information requested.", "188. In the meantime, on 27 February 2014, following the entry into force of the new Romanian Criminal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure (see also paragraph 196 below), the prosecutor had re-analysed the applicant\u2019s criminal complaint in the light of the new legislation and decided that the investigation should also include crimes of unlawful deprivation of liberty and torture.", "189. In the course of the investigation, in 2013 and 2015, the prosecutor took evidence from witnesses, including some high-office holders. It also heard other officials, the Border Police officers and the airport staff, including the security personnel. The Government produced transcripts of evidence given by certain witnesses (see paragraphs 298-325 below).", "190. The investigation, apparently still directed against persons unknown, is pending.", "419. As noted above in respect of the Government\u2019s arguments as to Romania\u2019s lack of jurisdiction and responsibility under the Convention, they denied on all accounts the applicant\u2019s allegations as being unsupported by any evidence and, consequently, having no factual basis. They also challenged the credibility of most part of the evidence gathered in the case and denied Romania\u2019s knowledge of, and complicity in, the operation of the CIA HVD Programme on its territory at the material time (see paragraphs 395-402 above).", "The Government\u2019s conclusions on the facts and evidence were as follows.", "420. First of all, the Government maintained that there had been no evidence demonstrating that a CIA secret detention facility had ever existed in Romania. They maintained that all the applicant\u2019s allegations to that effect were based on inconsistent and contradictory speculations.", "421. The sources relied on by the applicant had given contradictory indications regarding the period during which a \u201csecret\u201d detention facility had allegedly operated in Romania. The 2007 Marty Report affirmed that that facility had been opened in 2003 and had become highly important in 2004. It mentioned that it had been closed in November or December 2005 following the Washington Post\u2019s revelations. This contradicted the media sources indicating that the \u201csecret prison\u201d had been closed in the first part of 2006.", "According to the article published in The Independent on 8 December 2011, secret detention centres in Romania had been closed by May 2006. Reprieve had taken an approach differing from that of ABC News, stating that the detainees had been moved out of identified European \u201csecret\u201d locations prior to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice\u2019s visit to Romania on 5 December 2005. On the other hand, the Council of Europe\u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights, in his dossier, had described the \u201clifecycle\u201d of the site as a \u201cperiod of at least one year, beginning with its opening on 22 September 2003\u201d.", "Accordingly, the reliability and veracity of information concerning the period during which the alleged \u201csecret\u201d detention site had operated was extremely doubtful.", "422. As regards the location of the alleged CIA detention facility in Romania, at first there had been suppositions that it might have been located near Timi\u0219oara Airport, Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu Airport or B\u0103neasa Airport. These locations had been mentioned in succession, each for several years.", "The sources cited by the applicant had changed their assumptions each time it had been established that no \u201csecret\u201d detention facility had ever existed in the indicated place. Thus, a new location had subsequently been discovered.", "423. In 2007 the Romanian Senate, following on-site inspections of the locations and after hearing witnesses, had established in its report that there had been no \u201csecret\u201d detention site near Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu Airport in Constan\u0163a, including the military airbase. Despite that fact, in 2011 some journalists had come up with another hypothesis, indicating the basement of the building used by the ORNISS, a public institution, as a secret prison. To justify their speculations, they had not, however, supplied any solid evidence, or even any credible indications.", "424. In 2007 Senator Marty had seemed convinced, quoting \u201creliable sources\u201d within the CIA, that a secure area for the CIA transfers and detentions had been created near Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu Airport. In 2009, the New York Times had quoted \u201cofficials\u201d as saying that \u201cone jail was a renovated building on a busy street in Bucharest\u201d. In 2011, other \u201creliable sources\u201d indicated the ORNISS building \u2013 which, the Government added, was located in a residential area and not on a busy street \u2013 as the location of the secret CIA detention site in Bucharest.", "425. Lastly, in the pending criminal investigation there had so far emerged no evidence that any location in Romania or, especially, in Bucharest as suggested by the applicant\u2019s sources, could have been used by the CIA as a secret prison. In contrast, the prosecution had obtained a statement from an official working for the ORNISS \u2013 which had been produced before the Court \u2013 confirming that their building could never be, and had never been, used as a detention facility.", "426. The Government next argued that the applicant\u2019s account regarding the dates, circumstances and period of his alleged detention in Romania was inconsistent and therefore unreliable.", "In his application, the applicant had stated that he had been arrested in 2002 in Dubai. Then he had been held in Afghanistan and Thailand and moved to Poland on 5 December 2002. On 6 June 2003 he had been moved from Poland to Rabat, Morocco and, subsequently, on 22 September 2003 to Guant\u00e1namo Bay where he had been detained until 2004. On 27 March 2004 he had been transferred to Morocco and afterwards, to Romania. In 2006, the applicant had again been moved to Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Finally, he alleged that he had been \u201csecretly\u201d detained on Romanian territory from 6 June 2003 until 6 September 2006.", "427. Other sources advanced the idea that the applicant had been transferred to Romania in September 2003 but then Reprieve had indicated 12 April 2004 as the date of his transfer to Romania. According to the 2007 Marty Report, the applicant had been brought to the CIA \u201dblack site\u201d in Bucharest on the flight N313P on 23 September 2003. Mr Hammarberg, for his part, had maintained that the opening of the CIA prison code-named \u201cBright Light\u201d and the start of the CIA operations at the Romanian \u201cblack site\u201d had been marked by the N313P flight on the night of 22 September 2003. However, in his opinion, the applicant had been transferred to Romania on the N85VM flight directly from Guant\u00e1namo to Bucharest on 12 April 2004.", "428. The Government emphasised that the applicant had indicated no precise date of the flight on which he had allegedly been transferred out of Romania. He only mentioned that he had remained in Romania until around 6 September 2006, when he had been moved to Guant\u00e1namo. Nor had the experts heard at the fact-finding hearing been able to give a precise date for his transfer out of Romania.", "429. It was therefore clear that there was no conclusive evidence in support of any of the above versions of the possible dates, circumstances or period of the applicant\u2019s alleged detention in Romania.", "430. In the Government\u2019s opinion, there was a particular circuit of information concerning the alleged existence on Romanian territory of \u201csecret\u201d detention facilities. To begin with, mass media had launched accusations against certain States. Later on, this information had been reiterated as genuine by non-governmental organisations protecting human rights. These organisations had presented as evidence data extracted from records, invoices, and flight plans of planes allegedly used for transferring detainees. At the same time, these organisations had deliberately ignored the verifications performed by some European countries regarding the flights allegedly connected to the rendition programme. As a consequence, the information contained in official documents was not based on strong evidence, but on the sum of the data given by the mass media based on nonverifiable sources.", "431. The Government contested the credibility of sources relied on by Senator Marty in his reports of 2006 and 2007. They said that the Marty Reports included many inconsistencies and contradictions. For instance, even though the reports had stated that the materials analysed, i.e. satellite photographs, aircraft movements and witness accounts, had not constituted evidence in the formal sense of the term, the authors had nevertheless found that these elements had been sufficiently serious to assume that a CIA secret detention facility existed in Romania. In the Government\u2019s opinion, Senator Marty had displayed reluctance to reveal his alleged sources of evidence and protected them under the plea of a strict policy of confidentiality. Statements given by anonymous witnesses were not challengeable and this impeded the Government in properly contesting their reliability and defending themselves against the accusations made in the Marty Reports.", "432. Referring to the 2007 Marty Report, the Government saw inconsistencies in many respects. For instance, it was mentioned that the evidence had been obtained through alleged discussions with \u201cwell-placed persons from the Government and the intelligence services\u201d. It was also stated that information had been classified by the Americans into \u201ctiny pieces of information\u201d in order to prevent any single foreign official from seeing a \u201cbig picture\u201d. But it was further said that only the highly placed officials had been aware of the HVD Programme. In these circumstances, those \u201cwell-placed persons\u201d had been in no position to offer any information.", "The 2007 Marty Report spoke of the alleged \u201coperating agreements\u201d between the CIA and Romania to hold detainees. However, in the next paragraph Senator Marty had admitted that he had not seen the text of any such agreement.", "Furthermore, statements of Romanian politicians had been taken out of context to support the report\u2019s erroneous conclusions. Even a declaration of the Romanian President had been distorted into a \u201cformal approval\u201d of the agreement for the cooperation in the HVD Programme.", "In sum, the 2007 Marty Report\u2019s categorical conclusion that it \u201c[had been] finally established that secret detention centres [had] existed for some years in Romania\u201d seemed to have gone beyond the scant indications on which it had been based.", "433. As regards Mr Hammarberg\u2019s findings of 2009-2012, in particular those referred to in his affidavit and included in the dossier prepared for the Romanian Prosecutor General, the Government pointed out that they were \u2013 like Senator Marty\u2019s conclusions \u2013 based on newspaper articles and sources that could not be verified. They were accordingly no more than unsubstantiated allegations. Also, in the same fashion as other experts before the Court, Mr Hammarberg had based his theories on selective materials, without analysing the existing contradictions. For instance, he had found support for his assertions as to the alleged use of the ORNISS building by the CIA in the fact that in Poland a State facility had hosted a secret detention site. This was concluded without having regard to obvious differences between a remote location and a building used on a daily basis by Government officials in a European capital.", "434. Referring to Reprieve\u2019s research and findings, the Government said that this non-governmental organisation represented the interests of some of the detainees held in Guant\u00e1namo and carried out a humanitarian project concerning persons who had been subjected to extraordinary rendition in the HVD Programme. Reprieve\u2019s current case work involved representing fifteen prisoners from Guant\u00e1namo, assisting over seventy prisoners facing the death penalty around the world and conducting ongoing investigations into the rendition and the secret detention of \u201cghost prisoners\u201d in the so-called \u201cwar on terror\u201d. In these circumstances, Reprieve could not objectively state the facts in their documents and respective articles.", "435. Lastly, the Government pointed out that the reliability of the CIA sources cited by the experts and various inquiries or media reports was open to doubt because even the 2014 US Senate Committee Report concluded that the CIA had leaked inaccurate information regarding the operation of the HVD Programme.", "436. The Government did not deny that several \u2013 allegedly \u201csuspicious\u201d \u2013 planes had landed at and taken off from Romanian airports; these flights had at least partly been documented by the 2007 Romanian Senate Report. Also, publicly available evidence confirmed their stopovers on Romanian soil. However, the impugned flights had been of a private and non-commercial nature and had been treated accordingly. In all cases invoices, air navigation service sheets or ground handling charge notes had been issued for all the services provided. The flights had been included in the control lists of the navigation records. The declassified annexes to the 2007 Romanian Senate Report supported the conclusion that the purpose of the \u201cN\u201d flights\u2019 stops at B\u0103neasa Airport had been mainly technical in nature.", "For instance, as regards the alleged \u201crendition flight\u201d N85VM of 12 April 2004, the available documents attested that the flight had been recorded in the table containing handling fees and in the control list of navigation records, that an invoice had been issued and that the payment had been made by card; a copy of the air routing card having been attached to the relevant documents.", "437. Moreover, several witnesses who had worked in B\u0103neasa Airport at the material time and who had made statements in the investigation had identified these flights as having had a technical stop for refuelling at the airport. The vast majority of the witnesses had stated that the \u201cN\u201d flights had been serviced by a civil handling agent as any normal flight. Even the witnesses who had noted aspects that would suggest that the US flights had gone through a different procedure had completed their declarations by stating that they had not seen any persons disembarking from these aircraft. It should be stressed that not all the witnesses had serviced the same flights and that, therefore, their declarations should not be seen as contradictory.", "438. In contrast to the circumstances surrounding the CIA planes\u2019 landings as established by the Court in Al Nashiri v. Poland, in Romania there had been no special procedure for receiving the impugned flights. As the documents in the investigation file showed, all the \u201cN\u201d flights had gone through the standard procedure. The procedure, as described in the witnesses\u2019 statements, had been entirely different from what had happened in Szymany in Poland. No foreign vehicles had been seen entering the premises of B\u0103neasa Airport, there had been no military intervention in order to secure the airport perimeter and, most certainly, US officials had not assumed control of the airport on the dates in question. Nor had any HVDs been seen entering the country, as witnesses quoted in the 2007 Marty Report had stated with regard to the aircraft landings in Szymany.", "439. As regards the importance attached by the international inquiries, media and experts heard by the Court to changes of flight plans, in the Government\u2019s view this by itself could not suggest any involvement of the State in the applicant\u2019s detention and ill-treatment.", "The Government did not deny that the initial flight plans for the N313P flight on 22 September 2003 and the N85VM flight on 12 April 2004 indicating Constan\u0163a as their destination had been changed and the planes had eventually landed at B\u0103neasa Airport in Bucharest. Yet this could not be a proof of any consistent practice of the so-called \u201cdummy\u201d flight planning referred to in the Marty 2006 and 2007 Reports and the findings of the Council of Europe\u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights.", "In accordance with the relevant domestic and international regulations, every flight must have a flight plan, except for emergency issues. Each flight plan must indicate, in addition to the plane\u2019s destination, an alternative destination. The flight plans had been established by the aircraft\u2019s operators. The only potential involvement of the authorities had been limited to their assistance in transmitting the flight plan to the entity managing the integrated initial flight plan processing system. The decision to use the alternative destination or a change in flight plan had been a unilateral action by the flight operator. The acceptance of these changes in the flight plans was not indicative of any complicity of the Romanian authorities since such acceptance had in fact been automatic.", "440. Similarly, the alleged STS/STATE indicators for the impugned flights could not be considered meaningful, even though various reports had emphasised their exceptional relevance. According to the applicable rules, that indicator should not automatically qualify for an exemption from any relevant flow regulations. Even Mr J.G.S. they added, although repeatedly asked, could not indicate any special privileges that the STS/STATE designation would entail.", "441. In the Government\u2019s submission, the allegations regarding Romanian\u2019s complicity in the HVD Programme, in particular by means of \u201csecret cooperation agreements\u201d were completely baseless. No such agreements existed.", "In that context, the Government referred to the Romanian high-office holders\u2019 statements, in particular those made by former President of Romania, Ion Iliescu and his former security adviser, Ioan Talpe\u015f in Der Spiegel in 2014 and 2015. Both of them had said that specific agreements had been concluded with the American authorities after 11 September 2001, including the Romanian support at the level of intelligence services \u2013 which had actually been very fruitful. This did not mean cooperation in running a secret prison. Furthermore, in the course of the criminal investigation their initially ambiguous statements had later been clarified to the effect that there had been no cooperation and no complicity in the CIA rendition and secret detention operations on the part of Romania.", "442. Nor could it be said that the Romanian authorities had otherwise agreed \u2013 explicitly or implicitly \u2013 to the running of a secret detention facility by the CIA in Romania and that they had made available to them premises for that purpose. These were simply groundless assumptions unsupported by any evidence.", "Referring again to the statements of Mr Iliescu and Mr Talpe\u015f statements in Der Spiegel, the Government stressed that they had both clearly confirmed that they had had no knowledge of any CIA-run detention facility on Romanian territory.", "443. No evidence had been produced to show the slightest degree of knowledge on the part of the Romanian authorities as to the alleged hidden purpose of the flights landing at and taking off from Romanian airports.", "As attested by Mr J.G.S. at the fact-finding hearing, only at the beginning of November 2005 had there emerged the first information about the alleged existence in some \u201cEastern European countries\u201d of secret detention facilities designated for suspected terrorists and run by the CIA. Before that time the only information available had concerned the detention facilities in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Afghanistan, Egypt or Jordan and a specific case concerning the surrender of six Algerian men by Bosnian Federal Police into US custody. While information on the setting-up of military commissions for trying persons accused of terrorist acts had been in the public domain, the identities of those persons had been unknown. Nor had it been known what the US authorities\u2019 decision would be as to which of them would actually be tried before military commissions rather than before federal courts.", "In sum, at the relevant time, from 2003 to 2005, there had been no information that would have allowed the European States to suspect that some of the US flights that had landed in Europe had been used for the transfer of prisoners.", "444. The applicant maintained that the international inquiries, the CIA declassified documents, the 2014 US Senate Committee Report, other abundant materials compiling most recent research on the operation of the HVD Programme and expert testimony obtained by the Court provided a wealth of compelling evidence supporting his allegations and rejecting the Government\u2019s arguments as utterly untenable.", "In his view, it was established beyond reasonable doubt that Romania had hosted a secret CIA prison in 2003-2005 and that he had been detained in that prison.", "445. The 2014 US Senate Committee Report and other documentary exhibits before the Court, as well as cogent and credible expert testimony confirmed that the CIA detention site code-named \u201cBright Light\u201d or \u201cDetention Site Black\u201d had been located in Romania. The fact that a CIA secret prison had been located in Romania had already been confirmed in the 2007 Marty Report. In the Al Nashiri v. Poland judgment the Court had quoted verbatim from the expert testimony of Senator Marty and Mr J.G.S. stating that there had been a secret CIA detention site in Bucharest.", "446. As regards evidence that had emerged after the above judgment, the applicant attached particular importance to the 2014 US Senate Committee Report, adding that it fully confirmed the Court\u2019s factual findings in Al Nashiri v. Poland, including those based on expert testimony and documentary evidence.", "Although the report did not refer to Romania by name, it was established that publicly available information, when cross-referenced with references to Detention Site Black confirmed that this site was \u201cBright Light\u201d, a secret CIA prison that had operated in Bucharest in 2003-2005. For example, the 2014 US Senate Committee Report stated that detainees had begun arriving at Detention Site Black \u201cin the fall of 2003\u201d. It also stated that after publication on 2 November 2005 of the Washington Post article by Dana Priest disclosing that Eastern European countries had hosted CIA \u201cblack sites\u201d, the country concerned had demanded the closure of Detention Site Black within hours and that the CIA had transferred the remaining CIA detainees out of the facility shortly thereafter.", "447. Furthermore, the 2015 LIBE Briefing stated that it had been established beyond reasonable doubt that the CIA had used a facility in Romania to hold prisoners, that the first of them had been transferred to this facility on 22 September 2003 and that the last ones had been transferred out of the facility in November 2005.", "448. Lastly, the applicant relied on expert testimony at the fact-finding hearing. Senator Marty had stated that there had been no shadow of doubt that Romania had participated in the CIA programme. Mr J.G.S. had testified that with the exception of the \u201cblack site\u201d in Afghanistan, the Romanian \u201cblack site\u201d had operated for the longest period and held more detainees than any other CIA \u201cblack site\u201d. Mr J.G.S. and Mr Black had confirmed that the applicant had been secretly detained in Romania. They had also confirmed that the wealth of details about \u201cDetention Site Black\u201d in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report all corresponded to details about the Bucharest prison that the CIA code-named \u201cBright Light\u201d, where the applicant had been detained. As such, the report by itself, offered by no less than the United States\u2019 own Senate Intelligence Committee, based on exhaustive review of US Government documents, rendered untenable the Romanian Government\u2019s claim that there was no evidence of a CIA prison on Romanian territory.", "449. In response to the Government\u2019s arguments (see paragraphs 426429 above), the applicant said that contrary to their assertions the application had not stated that he had been detained in Romania for the entire period between 6 June 2003 and 6 September 2006. Rather, it stated that he had been detained in Romania for some time during that period. Moreover, after the subsequent disclosure of the dossier submitted by Thomas Hammarberg, the precise date on which the applicant was transferred to a CIA \u201cblack site\u201d in Romania had become clear \u2013 it had been 12 April 2004, on flight N85VM from Guant\u00e1namo Bay to Bucharest.", "450. The applicant further emphasised that, as regards the location of the secret prison, it had become known only on 8 December 2011 when a news report had identified for the first time the precise location of the CIA prison in Romania, while at the same time confirming the applicant\u2019s detention there, and providing details of the ill-treatment of detainees. The report had cited US intelligence officials familiar with the location and inner working of the prison.", "451. The applicant maintained that it had been established beyond reasonable doubt that planes associated with the CIA rendition operations had landed and taken off from Romania at the material time. The annex to the 2007 Romanian Senate Report listed forty-three flights that had been considered suspicious by the Romanian authorities.", "452. The Fava Report had \u201c[e]xpresse[d] serious concern about the 21 stopovers made by CIA-operated aircraft at Romanian airports\u201d which on many occasions had come from or had been bound for countries linked with extraordinary rendition circuits and the transfer of detainees. The list of rendition planes included flight N85VM of 12 April 2004 on which the applicant had been transferred to and from Romania.", "The Fava Report further noted that a flight with registration number N478GS had suffered an accident on 6 December 2004 when landing in Bucharest. The aircraft had reportedly taken off from Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, and its seven passengers had disappeared following the accident. The report expressed deep concern \u201cthat Romanian authorities [had] not initiate[d] an official investigation process ... into the case of a passenger on the aircraft Gulfstream N478G5, who [had been] found carrying a Beretta 9 mm Parabellum pistol with ammunition\u201d.", "453. Furthermore, the applicant pointed out that the international inquiries and the experts heard by the Court had identified the rendition flights on which he had been transferred to and from Romania.", "The finding in Mr Hammarberg\u2019s dossier for the Romanian Prosecutor General that the applicant had been transferred to Romania on 12 April 2004 on board N85VM, a flight clearly and consistently associated with the rendition operations, had been confirmed by multiple reliable sources, including the 2014 US Senate Committee Report and the reconstruction by those experts of the applicant\u2019s transfers in CIA custody.", "454. As regards his possible transfer from Romania, the experts had given two dates, agreeing on the most probable date, which constituted sufficient evidence.", "455. The applicant submitted that the Government\u2019s arguments contesting the evidential value of the material before the Court should be rejected in their entirety.", "In his view, the Government\u2019s submissions simply constituted an attempt to discredit the findings of reputable officials like the Council of Europe\u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights and Senator Dick Marty, by arguing that these findings were based solely on newspaper articles. In doing so, they failed to take into account the fact that Mr Hammarberg and Senator Marty had engaged in independent investigations and analysis of their own.", "Indeed, Commissioner Hammarberg\u2019s dossier for the Romanian Prosecutor General had expressly drawn on the \u201coriginal investigation and the analysis undertaken by [his] Office during the six of years of [his] mandate as Commissioner, among other sources of information\u201d. Similarly, the 2007 Marty Report had engaged in \u201canalysis of thousands of international flight records \u2013 and a network of sources established in numerous countries\u201d.", "Further, as regards the statement in the 2007 Marty Report that Romania had entered into a bilateral agreement with the US authorities, the applicant pointed out that, contrary to the Government\u2019s assertion, the fact that Senator Marty had not seen the actual document did not undermine the credibility of his claim that such an agreement had in fact existed, because its existence had been verified by credible sources, some of whom had been directly involved in negotiations that had led to this agreement. The fact that such an agreement had been brokered had recently been corroborated by the 2014 US Senate Committee Report.", "456. For the applicant, there was no doubt that the Romanian authorities had cooperated with the CIA in the HVD Programme. They had granted licences and overflight permissions to facilitate the CIA rendition flights. The AACR\u2019s officials had collaborated with Jeppesen (and, by extension, with Jeppesen\u2019s client, the CIA) by accepting the task of navigating disguised flights into Romanian airports.", "457. As set forth in the 2007 Marty Report, Romania had entered into a bilateral agreement with the United States. The report had named individual office-holders who had known about, authorised and stood accountable for Romania\u2019s role in the CIA\u2019s operation of secret detention facilities on Romanian territory from 2003 to 2005 as follows: the former President of Romania (up to 20 December 2004), Ion Iliescu; the then President of Romania (20 December 2004 onwards), Traian B\u0103sescu; the Presidential Advisor on National Security (until 20 December 2004). Ioan Talpe\u015f; the Minister of National Defence (ministerial oversight up to 20 December 2004), Ioan Mircea Pascu; and the Head of the Directorate for Military Intelligence, Sergiu Tudor Medar.", "458. Romania had therefore participated in the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment and incommunicado detention by entering into that agreement and giving the US the \u201cfull extent of permissions and protections it sought\u201d for conducting secret detention and rendition operations on Romanian territory; issuing an order to Romanian military intelligence services on behalf of the President to provide the CIA with all the facilities they had required and to protect their operations in whichever way they had requested; providing the use of a Romanian Government building for hosting the secret prison where Al Nashiri had been detained; actively assisting the landing, departures and stopovers of secret CIA rendition flights including flights which had transported Al Nashiri in and out of Romania; and failing to disclose the truth and effectively investigate the existence of a secret CIA prison and rendition flights in Romania.", "459. Consequently, the applicant\u2019s torture and secret detention, as well as his transfer from Romania in the face of real risks of further torture, secret detention and the death penalty could be attributed to the Romanian State because these acts had occurred on Romanian territory with the acquiescence and connivance of the Romanian authorities and because Romania had failed to fulfil its positive obligations to prevent these acts, despite being on notice that they would occur.", "460. Lastly, citing Al Nashiri v. Poland the applicant emphasised that in that case the Court had found that CIA rendition operations had \u201clargely depended on cooperation, assistance and active involvement of the countries which put at the USA\u2019s disposal their airspace, airports for the landing of aircraft transporting CIA prisoners and, last but not least, premises on which the prisoners could be securely detained and interrogated\u201d and that \u201cthe cooperation and various forms of assistance of those authorities, such as for instance customising the premises for the CIA\u2019s needs, ensuring security and providing the logistics [had been] the necessary condition for the effective operation of the CIA secret detention facilities\u201d. This was true with respect to Romania. Just as the Court had found it inconceivable that Poland had not known about the secret detention of prisoners on its territory, it was simply inconceivable that Romania had not known that it had been hosting a secret prison.", "461. The applicant contended that Romania had knowingly, intentionally, and actively collaborated and colluded with the CIA\u2019s extraordinary rendition programme, thereby enabling the CIA to subject him to secret detention and ill-treatment in Romania.", "462. The Romanian authorities should have known that high-value detainees would be tortured and ill-treated. Their close degree of cooperation with the CIA\u2019s secret detention operations in Romania must have put Romanian authorities on notice of the prisoners being at risk of secret detention and ill-treatment.", "In addition, Romania had had notice of the secret detention, torture and mistreatment of prisoners because of international and Romanian news reports, reports of the UN and human rights organisations and European legal cases that had documented US mistreatment of detainees suspected of terrorism at the material time. The Romanian Government were also presumed to have known of the CIA\u2019s secret detention, torture, and ill-treatment of terrorism suspects through its diplomatic missions.", "463. As the 2007 Marty Report had concluded, Romania had been \u201cknowingly complicit in the CIA\u2019s secret detention programme\u201d and senior Romanian officials had \u201c[known] about, authorised, and [stood] accountable for Romania\u2019s role\u201d in the CIA\u2019s secret detention and rendition operations on Romanian territory\u201d.", "464. Furthermore, the 2014 US Senate Committee Report had confirmed that the Romanian authorities had known that they had been hosting a secret prison and had attempted to cover up this fact. Indeed, the report observed that the Romanian authorities had \u201centered into an agreement\u201d in 2002 with the US to host the prison, and that the US had paid the Romanian authorities \u201cmillions of dollars to host the prison\u201d. It also confirmed that within hours of The Washington Post reporting in November 2005 that Eastern European countries had hosted secret CIA prisons, the Romanian authorities had insisted on closing the CIA prison on their territory.", "465. In the applicant\u2019s submission, the evidence before the Court demonstrated that it was the Romanian authorities which had given the CIA permission to run a secret prison in Bucharest, it was the Romanian authorities who had given the CIA permission to use dummy flight plans to secretly land rendition planes carrying prisoners in and out of the country, and it was Romanian authorities who had given the CIA extraordinary security cover for their operations in Romania.", "As expert J.G.S had said at the fact-finding hearing: \u201cit [was] quite clear that the Romanian authorities not only should have known but did know of the nature and purpose of the CIA\u2019s secret operations on their territory\u201d. He had also testified that this level of cooperation had depended on authorisation by the highest levels in the Romanian Government. The 2014 US Senate Committee Report had confirmed this. Mr J.G.S and Mr Black had testified that the Romanian authorities had known the nature and purpose of the CIA activities on Romanian territory because the CIA had paid Romania millions of dollars as a subsidy to host the prisoners. Moreover, the 2014 US Senate Committee Report had also established that it had been at the insistence of the Romanian Government that Detention Site Black had been ultimately closed. The Romanian Government had demanded closure of the CIA prison within hours from the publication of the November 2005 Washington Post article disclosing that CIA \u201cblack sites\u201d had existed in Eastern Europe. This clearly confirmed that for as long as the CIA prison had existed on Romanian territory, it had been there with the Romanian Government\u2019s consent.", "466. The applicant referred to the Court\u2019s finding in Al Nashiri v. Poland (cited above) that by June 2003 it was widely known that the US rendition programme had involved secret detention in overseas locations. It stood to reason that Romania, which had hosted a secret CIA prison after Poland and had enabled the applicant\u2019s transfers from its territory well after June 2003, indeed in 2005, had known by then that there had been substantial grounds for believing that the applicant had faced all of these risks.", "467. As regards the statements of Mr Iliescu\u2019s and Mr Talpe\u015f, the applicant maintained that the Government\u2019s submission was yet another example of their consistent refusal to acknowledge the truth about their hosting of a secret CIA prison on Romanian territory. In particular, the Government had quoted selectively from the statement of witness Z, denying that Romania had hosted a secret CIA prison. But a closer look at that statement revealed that Z had actually admitted that the Romanian authorities had supplied a \u201clocation\u201d to the CIA.", "468. In this connection, the applicant further referred to testimony given by witnesses X, Y and Z, saying that their statements expressly conceded that CIA flights had landed in Bucharest. In particular, X had said that Romania had partnership relations with similar institutions from other States, including equivalent structures in the United States of America. He also stated that in the framework of these bilateral relations, civil aircraft hired by the partner services on which their representatives travelled had landed at Bucharest B\u0103neasa Airport. Witness Z had confirmed that US government officials had asked the Romanian authorities to provide some locations on Romania\u2019s territory for the deployment of actions meant to fight the dangers of international terrorism and which were to be used by the CIA and that the authorities had \u201coffer[ed] a location for CIA activities\u201d\u2018. In his September 2013 statement Z had acknowledged that there had been \u201cconcrete agreements\u201d that had made possible the operation of the special US flights in Romania and that those flights had not been \u201cunder any obligation to obey usual rules imposed on civil flights\u201d.", "Moreover, Y testified that, in the context of Romania\u2019s strategic objective of \u201cNATO and European Union integration\u201d, it had been possible that CIA offices had been run on Romanian territory.", "469. Lastly, the applicant reiterated that all the experts heard by the Court at the fact-finding hearing had stated, in unambiguous terms, that Romania not only ought to have known but must have known and had known of the nature and the purpose of the CIA\u2019s secret operations occurring on its territory.", "470. Referring to any knowledge of the US authorities\u2019 practices in respect of suspected terrorist attributable to any Contracting State to the Convention at the relevant time, AI/ICJ pointed to, among other things, to the following facts that had been a matter of public knowledge.", "471. The interveners first emphasised that they had shown in their submissions in El-Masri and Al Nashiri v. Poland (both cited above) that, at least by June 2003, there had been substantial credible evidence in the public domain that in the context of what the USA called the global \u201cwar on terror\u201d, US forces had been engaging in enforced disappearances, secret detentions, arbitrary detentions, secret detainee transfers, and torture or other ill-treatment. Further, the submissions showed that, by presidential military order, the USA had established military commissions \u2013 executive tribunals with the power to hand down death sentences \u2013 for the prosecution of selected non-US nationals accused of involvement in terrorism in proceedings that would not comply with international fair trial standards.", "472. A February 2004 confidential report of the ICRC on Coalition abuses in Iraq, leaked in 2004 and published in the media at that time, found that detainees labelled by the USA as \u201chigh-value\u201d were at particular risk of torture and other ill-treatment and \u201chigh value detainees\u201d had been held for months in a facility at Baghdad International Airport in conditions that violated international law.", "473. In its annual reports covering the years 2004 and 2005, distributed widely to governments and the media, AI had reported on the growing body of evidence of human rights violations committed by US forces in the counter- terrorism context and stated that these violations, including secret detention and rendition, were continuing. In addition to individual country entries, the global overview pages of both reports addressed US abuses in the \u201cwar on terror\u201d. For example, in the report covering 2005 this overview showed how during the year, it had become \u201cincreasingly clear how many countries had colluded or participated in supporting US abusive policies and practices in the \u2018war on terror\u2019, including torture, ill-treatment secret and unlimited detentions, and unlawful cross-border transfers\u201d.", "474. In June 2004 The Washington Post published a leaked 1 August 2002 memorandum written in the US Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel at the request of the CIA. The memo advised, inter alia, that \u201cunder the circumstances of the current war against al Qaeda and its allies\u201d, presidential authority could override the US anti-torture law, that even if an interrogation method did violate that law \u201cnecessity or self-defense could provide justifications that would eliminate any criminal liability\u201d, and that there was a \u201csignificant range of acts\u201d that, while constituting cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, \u201cfail to rise to the level of torture\u201d and need not be criminalised.", "475. In October 2004 AI published a 200-page long analysis of US violations in the \u201cwar on terror\u201d and of the US Government documents that had come into the public domain, and including case details of secret transfers of detainees, the alleged existence of secret detention facilities and torture and other ill treatment.", "476. In May 2005, AI published a 150-page long report on US abuses in the \u201cwar on terror\u201d, which included cases of alleged torture or other illtreatment, deaths in custody, military commission proceedings, rendition flights, and the cases of \u201chigh-value detainees\u201d allegedly held in CIA custody in secret locations in Afghanistan and elsewhere and being subjected to enforced disappearance. The cases described included those of Tanzanian national Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani and German national Khaled El-Masri.", "477. In sum, as the Court held in Al Nashiri v. Poland (cited above), already by June 2003 it had been clear that States had known or should have known about the USA\u2019s rendition and secret detention programme and about the grave human rights violations it entailed as well as allegations of torture and other ill-treatment by US personnel, the indefinite detention regime at Guant\u00e1namo and the prospect of unfair trials by the military commission. As detailed above, the body of evidence regarding the USA\u2019s rendition and secret detention programme had only grown between June 2003 and September 2006. The USA\u2019s use of the death penalty remained well-known during this period and the US administration pursued the death penalty from 2002 to 2006 in the high-profile federal prosecution of Zacarias Moussaoui for terrorism offences, as well as moving ahead with a military commission system with the power to hand down death sentences.", "478. The parties expressed opposing views on the issues concerning the standard and burden of proof to be applied in the present case.", "479. The Government once again reiterated that there was no conclusive evidence that the Romanian authorities had in any way participated in the CIA rendition programme by hosting a secret prison for high-value detainees or by any other means.", "They agreed with the applicant (see paragraph 488 below) that the Court had accepted that in its establishment of facts and assessment of evidence the co-existence of sufficiently strong, clear and coherent inferences might be considered a proof. Yet in the applicant\u2019s case no such inferences existed.", "480. In the Government\u2019s view, the applicant had adopted a strategy of persuading the Court that the Romanian authorities, including the intelligence services and army, had shared the responsibility for gross violations of human rights during the so-called \u201crendition programme\u201d based on the idea of, in his view, striking similarities between the present case and El-Masri (cited above).", "However, in order for the Court to shift the burden of proof, the applicant was required to establish a prima facie case in favour of his version of events. In the El-Masri case, that applicant\u2019s presence on Macedonian territory at the material time had not been disputed. His detention and interrogation in \u201cthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d, together with his surrender to the US authorities, had not been refuted either. In contrast, in the instant case no detention facility had been established with certainty, there was no certainty as to the flights on which the applicant had allegedly been transferred to and from Romania, and the exact period of the applicant\u2019s alleged detention in Romania had remained unclear.", "481. Furthermore, Mr El-Masri\u2019s description of the circumstances of his detention and torture had been, as the Court held, \u201cvery detailed, specific and consistent\u201d. Conversely, in the present case the Court was confronted with the applicant\u2019s incoherent allegations.", "As opposed to El-Masri, where a significant amount of evidence had corroborated the applicant\u2019s allegations and had given rise to concordant inferences, in the present case no evidence had been put forward, save for the reports which relied on one another. It was true that the Court had held in the El-Masri judgment that it might examine a case by \u201cdrawing inferences from the available material and the authorities\u2019 conduct\u201d and had concluded that the applicant had prevailed in his claims. Yet in the instant case there was no such material and the authorities\u2019 conduct had been, if not beyond any criticism, proactive and had demonstrated good faith. Without any intention to attack and discredit the reports of reputable officials or non-governmental organisations, the Government insisted that the truth emerged at the end of a process of gathering evidence, failing which all the allegations remained simple claims.", "482. The Government further said that they were fully aware of the Court\u2019s standards of proof in cases involving injuries, death or disappearances that occurred in detention in an area within the exclusive control of the authorities of the respondent State, if there was prima facie evidence that the State might be involved. Nevertheless, they contended that a serious explanation, even if not a final one, had already been provided by the Romanian authorities since a serious and independent investigation was still pending before the national authorities.", "483. In view of the foregoing, the Government invited the Court to hold that there was no prima facie evidence in favour of the applicant\u2019s version of events and that, therefore, the burden of proof could not be shifted.", "They added, however, that they could not give a final version of the facts since the domestic investigation had not yet been completed.", "484. The applicant maintained that he had adduced strong, clear and concordant facts in support of his claims. In contrast, the Romanian Government had continued to cover up the truth. The Government had an unprecedented advantage over the applicant. They had all the relevant facts in their possession because they had entered into an agreement to host the secret CIA prison, because they had operationalised that agreement, and because they had covered it all up. In contrast, the applicant, still detained at the remote location of Guant\u00e1namo Bay, was gagged from speaking of his treatment in Romania.", "485. The applicant reiterated that he had established more than a prima facie case that he had been detained and tortured in Romania under the HVD Programme (see paragraphs 404-405 above). According to the Court\u2019s case-law, the burden of proof now shifted to Romania, particularly because Romania had \u201cexclusive access to information\u201d and witnesses who could corroborate or refute the applicant\u2019s case. However, the Government had failed to provide any such explanation; instead, they engaged in a pattern and practice of obfuscation and denial with respect to the events complained of. They had done so in the context of unprecedented secrecy maintained by the United States and its partner governments with respect to secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations.", "486. Where, as in the present case, the events at issue lay wholly or in large part within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, the burden of proof could be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation. Where, as in this case, the authorities had failed to provide a convincing explanation and failed to conduct an effective investigation, despite being on notice, at least since November 2005, of the fact that Romania had hosted a secret CIA prison, the Court was entitled to draw inferences adverse to the authorities.", "487. The applicant emphasised that the Court had consistently applied these principles in cases involving injuries, death or disappearances that occurred in detention, including cases where, as here, the Government denied that the individual had been in Government custody at the time of the events at issue. It had also applied these principles where persons had been found dead or injured, or had disappeared, in an area within the exclusive control of the authorities of the State and there had been prima facie evidence that the State might be involved. As the Grand Chamber reiterated in El-Masri, prima facie evidence could itself be provided by proof in the form of concordant inferences, based on which the burden of proof was shifted to the respondent Government.", "488. Furthermore, in Al Nashiri v. Poland (cited above) the Court had established that it was appropriate to adopt a flexible approach towards the evaluation of evidence. The Court had observed that although it had adopted the \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d standard of proof, it also \u201cadopt[ed] the conclusions that [were], in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as [might] flow from the facts and the parties submissions\u201d. Proof could thus \u201cfollow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact\u201d. In addition, in assessing the evidence, the Court had also taken note of the unique set of constraints on the applicant which had precluded him from testifying about his detention before the Court and of \u201cthe very nature and extreme secrecy of the CIA operations in the course of the \u2018war on terror\u2019\u201d.", "489. The applicant argued that the same constraints applied in his case against Romania. Indeed, he had been virtually isolated in Guant\u00e1namo and unable to talk publicly about his torture and ill-treatment or even submit a statement to the Court because the US authorities had taken the position that his thoughts and memories about his experiences under torture were classified information. Accordingly, they had prohibited him from sharing these experiences with anyone other than his US lawyers, who were prevented from revealing what they had been told by their client on pain of criminal sanction.", "Despite the extreme secrecy associated with CIA operations and his inability to address the Court directly, the applicant considered that he had submitted ample evidence in support of his factual claims. Indeed, the documentary and expert evidence offered by him and heard by the Court in the present case was, in his view, akin to the evidence that had been given credence by the Court in Al Nashiri v. Poland.", "490. The Court is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and has consistently recognised that it must be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (see Imakayeva v. Russia, no. 7615/02, \u00a7 113, ECHR 2006XIII (extracts); Aslakhanova and Others v. Russia, nos. 2944/06, 8300/07, 50184/07, 332/08 and 42509/10, \u00a7 96, 18 December 2012; El-Masri, cited above, \u00a7 154; Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 393; and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 393).", "Nonetheless, in cases where there are conflicting accounts of events, the Court\u2019s examination necessarily involves the task of establishing facts on which the parties disagree. In such situations the Court is inevitably confronted when establishing the facts with the same difficulties as those faced by any first-instance court (see El-Masri, cited above, \u00a7 151; and Imakayeva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 111-112).", "491. In assessing evidence, the Court has adopted the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d. However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems which use that standard. Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention \u2013 to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention \u2013 conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions.", "According to the Court\u2019s established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof, are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake. The Court is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a Contracting State has violated fundamental rights (see, among other examples, Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 161, Series A no. 25; Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7 147, ECHR 2005VII; Creang\u0103 v. Romania [GC], no. 29226/03, \u00a7 88, 23 February 2012; El-Masri, cited above, \u00a7 151; Georgia v. Russia (I) [GC], no. 13255/07, \u00a7\u00a7 93-94, ECHR 2014 (extracts); Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 394; Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 394; and Nasr and Ghali, cited above, \u00a7 119).", "492. While it is for the applicant to make a prima facie case and adduce appropriate evidence, if the respondent Government in their response to his allegations fail to disclose crucial documents to enable the Court to establish the facts or otherwise provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred, strong inferences can be drawn (see Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90, 16068/90, 16069/90, 16070/90, 16071/90, 16072/90 and 16073/90, \u00a7 184, ECHR 2009, with further references; Kadirova and Others v. Russia, no. 5432/07, \u00a7 94, 27 March 2012; Aslakhanova and Others, cited above, \u00a7 97; Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 395; and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 395).", "493. Furthermore, the Convention proceedings do not in all cases lend themselves to a strict application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio. According to the Court\u2019s case-law under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, for instance as in the case of persons under their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during that detention. The burden of proof in such a case may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, \u00a7 85, ECHR 1999-IV; Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000-VII; and Imakayeva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 114-115; El-Masri, cited above, \u00a7 152; Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 396; Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 396; and Nasr and Ghali, cited above, \u00a7 220).", "In the absence of such explanation the Court can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the respondent Government (see El-Masri, cited above, \u00a7 152).", "494. The Court has already noted that it is not in a position to receive a direct account of the events complained of from the applicant (see paragraph 16 above; also, compare and contrast with other previous cases involving complaints about torture, ill-treatment in custody or unlawful detention, for example, El-Masri, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 16-36 and 156-167; Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7\u00a7 13-24, ECHR 1999V; Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, \u00a7\u00a7 16-18, ECHR 2006IX; and Ila\u015fcu and Others v. Moldova and Russia [GC], no. 48787/99, \u00a7\u00a7 188-211, ECHR 2004VII).", "495. The regime applied to high-value detainees such as the applicant is described in detail in the CIA declassified documents, the 2014 US Senate Committee Report and also, on the basis, inter alia, of the applicant\u2019s own account, in the 2007 ICRC Report. That regime included transfers of detainees to multiple locations and involved holding them incommunicado in continuous solitary confinement throughout the entire period of their undisclosed detention. The transfers to unknown locations and unpredictable conditions of detention were specifically designed to deepen their sense of disorientation and isolation. The detainees were usually unaware of their exact location (see Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 397-398; Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 397-398; and paragraphs 48-58, 85 and 293 above).", "496. As held in Al Nashiri v. Poland (cited above, \u00a7 399) and as can be seen from the material cited above (see paragraphs 98-140 above), since an unknown date in mid-October 2002 the applicant has not had contact with the outside world, save the ICRC team in October and December 2006, the military commission\u2019s members and his US counsel. It has also been submitted that the applicant\u2019s communications with the outside world are virtually non-existent and that his communications with his US counsel and his account of experiences in CIA custody are presumptively classified (see paragraph 482 above).", "497. The above difficulties involved in gathering and producing evidence in the present case caused by the restrictions on the applicant\u2019s contact with the outside world and the extreme secrecy surrounding the US rendition operations have inevitably had an impact on his ability to plead his case before this Court. Indeed, in his application and further written pleadings the events complained of were to a considerable extent reconstructed from threads of information gleaned from numerous public sources.", "Consequently, the Court\u2019s establishment of the facts of the case is to a great extent based on circumstantial evidence, including a large amount of evidence obtained through the international inquiries, considerably redacted documents released by the CIA, the declassified 2014 US Senate Committee Report, other public sources and the testimony of the experts heard by the Court (see also Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 400, and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 400).", "498. It is also to be noted that while the Government have firmly denied the applicant\u2019s allegations in so far as they concerned Romania and contested the credibility of various parts of the evidence before the Court, they have not disputed the fact that he was subjected to secret detention and ill-treatment under the HVD Programme. Nor have they disputed his version of the circumstances preceding his alleged rendition to Romania on 12 April 2004 (see paragraphs 395-402 and 419-443 above).", "However, the facts complained of in the present case are part of a chain of events lasting from mid-October 2002 to 5 September 2006 and concerning various countries. The examination of the case necessarily involves the establishment of links between the dates and periods relevant to the applicant\u2019s detention and a sequence of alleged rendition flights to the countries concerned. As a result, the Court\u2019s establishment of the facts and assessment of evidence cannot be limited to the events that according to the applicant allegedly took place in Romania but must, in so far as it is necessary and relevant for the findings in the present case, take into account the circumstances occurring before and after his alleged detention in Romania (see Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 401-417, and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 401-419).", "499. The Court has already established beyond reasonable doubt the facts concerning the applicant\u2019s capture, rendition and secret detention until 6 June 2003, the date of his rendition on plane N379P from Poland to another CIA secret detention facility (see Al Nashiri v. Poland , cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 401-417). The relevant passages from Al Nashiri v. Poland containing the Court\u2019s findings of fact are cited above (see paragraph 98 above). Some additional elements, which are all fully consistent with the Court\u2019s establishment of the facts in that case, can also be found in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report (see paragraphs 99-101 above).", "500. It is alleged that before being rendered by the CIA on 12 April 2004 from Guant\u00e1namo to Romania on board N85VM the applicant had been detained in other CIA secret detention facilities abroad (see paragraphs 115-116 above).", "501. In Al Nashiri v. Poland (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 408 and 417) the Court held as follows:", "\u201c408. In the light of that accumulated evidence, there can be no doubt that:", "...", "2) the N379P, also known as \u201cGuant\u00e1namo Express\u201d, a Gulfstream V with capacity for eighteen passengers but usually configured for eight, arrived in Szymany on 5 June 2003 at 01:00 from Kabul, Afghanistan. It stayed on the runway for over two hours and then departed for Rabat, Morocco.", "...", "417. Assessing all the above facts and evidence as a whole, the Court finds it established beyond reasonable doubt that:", "...", "4) on 6 June 2003 the applicant was transferred by the CIA from Poland on the CIA rendition aircraft N379P.\u201d", "502. Referring to this point in time, the 2014 US Senate Committee Report states that from June 2003 onwards \u201cthe CIA transferred Al Nashiri to five different CIA detention facilities before he was transferred to US military custody on 5 September 2006\u201d (see paragraph 102 above). It further states that in 2003 the CIA arranged for a \u201ctemporary patch\u201d, which meant placing the applicant and another detainee \u2013 Ramzi bin al-Shibh \u2013 in a country whose name was redacted and that by an unspecified \u2013 redacted \u2013 date in 2003 both of them were transferred out of that country to Guant\u00e1namo (see paragraph 109 above).", "There can therefore be no doubt that between his transfer from Poland on 6 June 2003 and his transfer to Guant\u00e1namo on an unspecified later date in 2003 the applicant was for some time held by the CIA in another country \u2013 the first one out of five in which he would be secretly detained between 6 June 2003 and 5 September 2006.", "503. Mr J.G.S. testified that the country in question was identifiable as Morocco and that on 6 June 2003 the plane N379P had taken the applicant and Ramzi bin al-Shibh from Poland to Rabat, Morocco to a facility that at that time had been let to the CIA by their Moroccan counterparts. He stated that the applicant had remained there until 23 September 2003, the date on which he had been transported on plane N313P from Rabat to Guant\u00e1namo (see paragraphs 107-108 and 110 above).", "504. The N313P rendition circuit of 20-24 September 2003 was analysed in detail in Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, where the Court held that on 22 September 2003 Mr Abu Zubaydah had been transferred by the CIA from Poland on board that plane to another CIA secret detention facility elsewhere. It also held that this flight had marked the end of CIAassociated aircraft landings in Poland and the closure of the CIA \u201cblack site\u201d codenamed \u201cQuartz\u201d in that country (see Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 414 and 419). The collation of data from multiple sources shows that the plane left Washington D.C. on 20 September 2003 and undertook a four-day flight circuit during which it landed in six countries. It flew from Rabat to Guant\u00e1namo on the night of 23 September 2003, landing there in the morning of 24 September 2003 (see paragraphs 111-112, 274, 326, 337, 356 and 374 above).", "According to the RCAA letter of 29 July 2009, N379P\u2019s itinerary was Szczytno airport in Szymany, Poland-Constan\u0163a-Rabat but the airport at which it landed in Romania was B\u0103neasa Airport in Bucharest (see paragraphs 113 and 326 above). This information is consistent with evidence heard from Mr J.G.S., who in Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland testified that \u201cthis particular flight circuit was again disguised by dummy flight planning although significantly not in respect of Poland\u201d and that \u201csince this visit to Szymany was comprised solely of a pick-up of the remaining detainees, the CIA declared Szymany as a destination openly and instead disguised its onward destinations of Bucharest and Rabat, hence demonstrating that the methodology of disguised flight planning continued for the second European site in Bucharest, Romania\u201d (see Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 312; and paragraph 112 above).", "505. The 2014 US Senate Committee Report confirms that \u201cbeginning in September 2003\u201d the CIA held its detainees at CIA facilities in Guant\u00e1namo and that by a \u2013 redacted but clearly two-digit \u2013 date in April 2004 \u201call five CIA detainees were transferred from Guant\u00e1namo to other CIA detention facilities\u201d pending the US Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Rasul v. Bush which, as the US authorities expected, \u201cmight grant habeas corpus rights to the five CIA detainees\u201d. The transfer was preceded by consultations among the US authorities in February 2004. It was recommended by the US Department of Justice (see paragraphs 62 and 114 above).", "506. In the light of the material in its possession, the Court finds no counter evidence capable of casting doubt on the accuracy of the expert\u2019s conclusions regarding the above sequence of events, the places of the applicant\u2019s secret detention and the dates of his transfers during the relevant period.", "507. Accordingly, the Court finds it established beyond reasonable doubt that:", "(1) on 6 June 2003 on board the rendition plane N379P the applicant was transferred by the CIA from Szymany, Poland to Rabat, Morocco;", "(2) from 6 June to 23 September 2003 the applicant was detained in Morocco at a facility used by the CIA;", "(3) on 23 September 2003 on board the rendition plane N313P the applicant was transferred by the CIA from Rabat to Guant\u00e1namo; and", "(4) the applicant was detained in Guant\u00e1namo until a two-digit date in April 2004 (redacted in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report), then transferred by the CIA to another detention facility elsewhere.", "508. It is alleged that a CIA secret detention facility operated in Romania from 22 September 2003 to the first days of November 2005, when it was closed following the publication of Dana Priest\u2019s report on CIA overseas clandestine prisons in Eastern Europe in The Washington Post on 2 November 2005 (see, in particular, paragraphs 445-448 above). The Government denied that a CIA detention facility had ever existed on Romania\u2019s territory (see, in particular, paragraphs 420-425 above).", "509. The Court notes at the outset that the following facts are either uncontested or have been confirmed by the Court\u2019s findings in Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland and flight data from numerous sources, including the documents produced by the respondent Government:", "(a) On 22 September 2003 plane N313P arrived in Szymany, Poland en route from Kabul, left on the same day for Romania and, having indicated in its flight plan Constan\u0163a as its destination, in fact landed at Bucharest B\u0103neasa Airport. On 23 September 2003 the plane took off from Bucharest for Rabat (see Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 408 and 419; and paragraphs 112-113, 326 and 504 above).", "(b) On 5 November 2005 plane N1HC, having indicated in its flight plan Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu International Airport in Constan\u0163a as its destination, in fact landed at B\u0103neasa Airport in Bucharest and on the same day took off from Bucharest for Amman.", "(c) On 5 November 2005 plane N248AB arrived in Amman at 23:49 and on 6 November 2005, on the same night, left for Kabul;", "(d) On the same night of 5-6 November 2005 both N1HC and N248AB were in the same airport in Amman between 00:21 (N1HC\u2019s landing) and 00:55 (N248AB\u2019s departure) (see paragraph 135 above).", "510. It has not been disputed by the Government that the Washington Post publication was the first one in which East European countries were mentioned in the context of the HVD Programme (see paragraphs 236 and 421 above).", "It was followed by subsequent, more specific reports.", "On 6 November 2005 Human Rights Watch, in the 2005 HRW Statement, indicated Poland and Romania as the CIA accomplices in the HVD Programme (see paragraphs 226-227 above).", "That statement was followed by the HRW List of 30 November 2005 which referred to \u201cghost prisoners\u201d, including the applicant, considered to be possibly held in secret detention by the CIA (see paragraph 228 above).", "A few days later, on 5 December 2005, an ABC News report named Poland and Romania as countries hosting CIA secret prisons and listed the names of eleven top al-Qaeda terrorist suspects, including the applicant, being held in CIA custody. It also stated that, according to the CIA sources, the US authorities had \u201cscrambled to get all the suspects off the European soil before Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice arrived there today\u201d (see paragraph 237 above).", "511. Nor has it been disputed that the above disclosures soon triggered a number of international inquiries into the CIA rendition and secret detention operations and allegations of torture and ill-treatment of prisoners. The multiple investigations by international governmental organisations started with the Council of Europe\u2019s inquiry under Article 52 of the Convention and the Marty Inquiry, followed by the European Parliament\u2019s Fava Inquiry, the 2010 UN Joint Study and the investigative work of the Council of Europe\u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights carried out until 2012. Also, in that context, the ICRC independently prepared its earlier, confidential reports and the 2007 ICRC Report (see paragraphs 246-280, 290 and 294296 above). As a follow-up to the Fava Report, the European Parliament LIBE Committee still continues to investigate the issue of the CIA secret prisons in Europe (see paragraphs 282-290 above).", "512. The initial 2006-2007 reports drawn up in the framework of the inquiries conducted by the international governmental organisations confirmed consistently, albeit in various terms, that there was at least a strong suspicion that a CIA clandestine detention site had operated in Romania.", "(a) The 2006 Marty Report stated that, while the factual elements gathered so far had not provided definitive evidence of secret detention centres, Romania was \u201cthus far the only Council of Europe member state to be located on one of the rendition circuits\u201d which bore \u201call the characteristics of a detainee drop-off point\u201d. The rendition circuit in question was executed on 25 January 2004 by plane N313P which, before landing in Romania, on 23 January 2004 rendered Mr El-Masri from Skopje to the CIA \u201dblack site\u201d in Kabul (see paragraphs 253 and 327-330 above and El Masri, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 21 and 157-158).", "(b) The 2007 Marty Report affirmed that there was \u201cnow enough evidence to state that secret detention facilities run by the CIA [had] existed in Europe from 2003 to 2005, in particular in Poland and Romania\u201d (see paragraph 258 above). It stated that \u201cRomania [had been] developed into a site in which more detainees were transferred only as the HVD Programme [had] expanded\u201d. It was Senator Marty\u2019s understanding that \u201cthe Romanian \u201cblack site\u201d [had been] incorporated into the programme in 2003, attained its greatest significance in 2004 and operated until the second half of 2005\u201d (see paragraph 261 above).", "The report also referred to the \u201cclear inconsistencies in the flight data\u201d provided by various Romanian sources, when compared with data gathered by the Marty Inquiry independently. The disagreement between these sources was found to be \u201ctoo fundamental and widespread to be explained away by simple administrative glitches, or even by in-flight changes of destinations by Pilots-in-Command, which were communicated to one authority but not to another\u201d. In sum, the report stated that \u201cpresently there exist[ed] no truthful account of detainee transfer flights to Romania\u201d (see paragraph 264 above).", "Senator Marty in the 2006 and 2007 Marty Reports, as well as in his affidavit of 24 April 2013 and testimony given at the fact-finding hearing before the Court explained comprehensively the methodology adopted in his inquiry and the sources of information on the basis of which the respective findings had been made (see paragraphs 258, 262, 354 and 379 above).", "(c) The Fava Report expressed \u201cserious concern\u201d about twenty-one stopovers made by the CIA-operated aircraft at Romanian airports, which on most occasions had come from or been bound for countries linked with extraordinary rendition circuits.", "It was also found that five flight plans had been filed with inconsistencies as they had indicated a landing airport which had not corresponded with the subsequent take-off airport (see paragraphs 271 and 274 above). Moreover, the Fava Report identified three aircraft with multiple stopovers in Romania that already at that early stage of the inquiries into the HVD Programme had been known to have been involved in the CIA rendition operations.", "Among those aircraft was N85VM, conclusively identified as having been used for the rendition of Mr Osama Mustafa Nasr aka Abu Omar from Germany to Egypt on 17 February 2003 (see also Nasr and Ghali, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 39, 112 and 231) and N313P conclusively identified as having been used for the rendition of Mr El-Masri from Skopje to Kabul on 23 January 2004 (see El-Masri, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 67 and 157-159).", "The report also listed flights from suspicious locations that stopped over in Romania in 2003-2005. The first flight N313P, from Szymany, Poland to Bucharest, en route to Rabat, took place on 22 September 2003, the last one, N1HC, from Bucharest to Amman, took place on 5 November 2005 (see paragraphs 271, 273 and 276 above).", "The conclusion in the Fava Report was that it could not exclude, \u201cbased only on the statements made by Romanian authorities to the Temporary Committee delegation to Romania, the possibility that US secret services [had] operated in Romania and that no definite evidence ha[d] been provided to contradict any of the allegations concerning the running of a secret detention facility on Romanian soil\u201d (see paragraphs 271 and 280 above).", "With reference to that conclusion, Mr Fava testified at the fact-finding hearing that \u201cthe conclusion we reached was a very strong suspicion that [a CIA detention facility] existed, not certainty \u2013 there was no smoking gun\u201d (see paragraph 363 above).", "The Fava Report relied on comprehensive materials from multiple sources, comprising those collected during the TDIP delegation\u2019s visits to the countries concerned, including Romania, extensive flight data, expert evidence, analysis of specific cases of several victims of the CIA extraordinary rendition, interviews with the victims and their lawyers and material acquired in the context of meetings with the national authorities (see paragraphs 268-273 above).", "513. The 2010 UN Study, referring to Romania, mentioned that the analysis of complex aeronautical data had demonstrated the circuit flown by N313P in September 2003 and that the experts had not been able to identify \u201cany definite evidence of a detainee transfer into Romania\u201d taking place prior to that flight (see paragraph 296 above).", "514. Subsequent reports, which were based on fuller knowledge of the HVD Programme emerging from the CIA documents declassified in 2009 and 2010 and took into account progress in the research into rendition flights, contained more categorical conclusions.", "(a) Mr Hammarberg, in his dossier of 30 March 2012 addressed to the Romanian Prosecutor General, stated that \u201csufficient evidence ha[d] now been amassed to allow us to consider the existence of a CIA \u201dblack site\u201d in Romania as a proven fact, and to affirm that serious human rights abuses [had taken] place there\u201d. According to Mr Hammarberg\u2019s findings, the opening of the CIA prison, codenamed \u201cBright Light\u201d and the start of the CIA detention operations in Bucharest was marked by the plane N313P landing in Bucharest on the night of 22 September 2003. The physical location was identified as the ORNISS building in Bucharest. The dossier included, in chronological order, a list of eight disguised rendition flights into Bucharest in respect of which \u201cdummy\u201d flight plans featuring Constan\u0163a or Timi\u0219oara had been filed, starting from the N313P flight on 22 September 2003 and ending with the N860JB flight on 21 August 2005. No specific date of closure of the detention site was given; paragraph 18 of the dossier indicated that it had operated for \u201ca period of at least one year\u201d (see paragraphs 334-339). In response to the Court\u2019s question regarding this point, Mr Hammarberg explained that at that time their research had not managed to establish the precise dates for the closure of the Romanian \u201cblack site\u201d nor for the applicant\u2019s transfer from Romania (see paragraph 346 above).", "Mr Hammarberg, in his written response to the Court\u2019s questions, gave an account of the sources and methodology on which he relied in his findings. The conclusions as to the operation of a secret CIA \u201dblack site\u201d in Romania were based on \u201ca number of different sources which were crossreferenced and not on one piece of evidence in isolation\u201d. This included among other things, official US documents, flight records and aeronautical data amassed from diverse entities across the global aviation sector (see paragraph 345 above).", "(b) The 2015 LIBE Briefing, which in addition to extensive flight data had been based on an analysis of a large amount of new material disclosed in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report, stated that it had been established beyond reasonable doubt that a facility in Romania had been used by the CIA to hold prisoners, that the first prisoners had been transferred to this facility in September 2003 and that the last prisoners had been transferred out of this facility in November 2005. The dossier included a list of fifteen rendition circuits through Romania, the first of which was executed by N313P on 22-23 September 2003, the last of which was executed on 56 November 2005 and involved two planes N1HC (from Romania to Jordan) and N248AB (from Jordan to Afghanistan) (see paragraphs 355-358 above).", "515. Furthermore, in Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland Senator Marty and Mr J.G.S., referring in their PowerPoint presentation to the \u201cfinal rendition circuit\u201d through Poland executed by N313P, testified that this particular circuit had marked the closure of the CIA \u201dblack site\u201d in Poland and the opening of the CIA\u2019s second secret detention site in Europe \u2013 located in Romania (see Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 312 and 414; Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 414; and paragraph 112 above).", "516. At the fact-finding hearing held in the present case the experts heard by the Court confirmed in clear and categorical terms that a secret detention facility had operated in Romania in the period indicated by the applicant. They stated that the N313P flight on 22-23 September 2003 had marked the opening of the site and that a \u201cdouble-plane switch\u201d circuit involving two planes, identified as N1HC and N248AB had indicated its closure, prompted by the publication of the Washington Post article referred to above (see paragraph 508 above). In the same categorical terms they identified the CIA detention facility located in Romania as the one referred to in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report as \u201cDetention Site Black\u201d (see also paragraphs 160-164 above).", "(a) Senator Marty and Mr J.G.S in their PowerPoint presentation, in support of the above conclusions, referred to the extensive flight data and their correlation, as well as to the 2014 US Senate Committee Report. In particular, Mr J.G.S. in connection with several specific references in that report stated that the code name \u201cDetention Site Black\u201d in the report corresponded in such \u201cprecise and extensive detail\u201d to other multiple data concerning Romania that \u201cRomania, its territory, its airspace, its detention facility, [was] inseparable from Detention Site Black (see paragraphs 131, 371, 374-376 above)", "(b) Mr Black stated that it was \u201cclear, beyond reasonable doubt that there was a CIA detention facility in Romania\u201d and that he was convinced on \u201ca wide array of different types of evidence\u201d that it operated from September 2003 until November 2005. He testified that there was no doubt that the flight in November 2005 \u2013 which had been a two-plane switch taking prisoners to Afghanistan \u2013 had signalled the end of the Romanian site and that that flight had come within 72 hours after the existence of the site had been revealed in the Washington Post article. He added that the 2014 US Senate Committee Report was very clear that at that point everyone who had been remaining in Romania had been \u201cshipped out to Afghanistan\u201d (see paragraphs 132 and 390 above).", "In his testimony, he also mentioned specific HVDs, including the applicant, who had been detained in Romania between September 2003 and 2005, saying that \u201cthe fact that those individuals [had been] held in Romania at various points between 2003 and 2005 [was] absolutely beyond reasonable doubt, there [could not] be any alternative narrative to that that [made] any sense\u201d. He further stated that \u201cDetention Site Black [was] the site that fulfil[ed], in terms of its operating times, the flight paths that we [knew] to have been connected to prisoner movements and to the CIA rendition programme. Detention Site Black [was] the one which correlate[d] precisely with those flight paths that our research [had] discovered, [had] reconstructed\u201d (see paragraphs 390 and 392 above).", "517. The 2014 US Senate Committee Report includes several references to Detention Site Black. To begin with, the report confirms that CIA detainees were transferred to Detention Site Black in a country whose name was redacted \u201cin the fall of 2003\u201d. It further confirms that the site still operated in \u201cthe fall of 2004\u201d, as well as in April and May 2005 (see paragraphs 160-164 above) and that Mr Al Nashiri was held there in October 2004 and June and July 2005 (see paragraphs 127, 158 and 162-163 above).", "Finally, it indicates that Detention Site Black was closed \u201cafter publication of the Washington Post article\u201d, following the pressure from the country concerned, which demanded the closure within a number of hours which, although redacted in the text, clearly comprised two digits (see paragraph 133 above).", "518. The Court observes that this indication in theory could mean any time between 10 and 99 hours. However, in reality, given that the CIA had to secure a safe, secret transfer of possibly several detainees by air to another consenting country, such demand could not be dealt with abruptly and immediately and, by the nature of things, inevitably required some preparation and handling of logistical problems. According to the 2014 US Senate Committee Report, the \u201cCIA transferred ... the remaining CIA detainees out of the facility shortly thereafter\u201d (see paragraph 133 above). Having regard to the fact that the Washington Post article was published on 2 November 2005, the dates on which the transfer could realistically have been carried out \u2013 that is to say, within the range of 24-99 hours \u2013 had to be situated in the short period from 3 to 6 November 2005. This coincides exactly with the flight identified by the experts as the one marking the closure of \u201cDetention Site Black\u201d in Romania, namely N1HC from Bucharest to Amman, executed on 5 November 2005 (see also paragraph 509 above).", "519. Furthermore, all the materials in the Court\u2019s possession, including the list of twenty-one \u201csuspicious flights\u201d produced by the Government unambiguously demonstrate that a series of CIA-associated aircraft landings at Bucharest B\u0103neasa Airport started on 22 September 2003 with N313P and ended on 5 November 2005 with N1HC. Markedly, these two particular flight circuits were disguised by the so-called \u201cdummy flight planning\u201d\u2013 a practice that, as described by the experts and analysed by the Court in its previous judgments concerning the CIA rendition operations in Poland, consisted in filling false flight plans that indicated a route which the planes did not, or even intend to, fly. Both aircraft\u2019s flight plans indicated Constan\u0163a as their destination but in fact they landed at and took off from Bucharest B\u0103neasa Airport (see paragraphs 112, with references to Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, and 130, 134-135 and 372-373 above; see also Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 419-422).", "520. The Government acknowledged that on 22-23 September 2003 the flight plan for N313P, initially indicating Constan\u0163a as its destination, had been changed to Bucharest B\u0103neasa Airport when the plane had been en route (see paragraph 439 above). However, they did not see how the change of flight plans executed by the flight operator \u2013 a change on which the Romanian authorities had no influence \u2013 could be indicative of their complicity in the CIA rendition operations or, still less, of the existence of a CIA \u201cblack site\u201d in Romania (see paragraphs 436-440 above).", "521. Addressing the Government\u2019s arguments, the Court finds it appropriate to reiterate certain findings concerning the operation of the CIA-associated flights in Romania emerging from the material in the case file.", "(a) As already noted above (see paragraph 512 above), the Fava Report referred to twenty-one stopovers made by the CIA-operated aircraft at Romanian airports during the relevant period. Significantly, most stopovers (thirteen) and take-offs (five) found suspicious took place at Bucharest airports. Several of those flights are included in the Government\u2019s list of twenty-one \u201csuspicious flights\u201d (see paragraphs 273 and 327 above). The Fava Inquiry also identified fourteen different CIA aircraft that landed in Romania at the material time and referred to at least five inconsistent flight plans, concerning, among others, the N1HC flight on 5 November 2005. All these plans indicated destinations filed for Constan\u0163a or Timisoara; however, the aircraft real destination was Bucharest B\u0103neasa Airport, at which those flights in fact landed and from which they took off subsequently (see paragraphs 271-274 and 276 above).", "(b) Mr Hammarberg\u2019s dossier for the Romanian Prosecutor General contained a \u2013 non-exhaustive \u2013 list of the most significant eight flights into Bucharest, starting from N313P on 22 September 2003. Destinations for all of them were disguised by the \u201cdummy\u201d flight planning. All bore the characteristics of \u201cdetainee drop-offs\u201d, i.e. transportation of CIA prisoners into the country. All those planes are on the list of twenty-one \u201csuspicious flights\u201d furnished by the Government (see paragraphs 327 and 337 above).", "(c) The 2015 LIBE Briefing identified fifteen rendition missions linking Romania to other CIA prison host countries or to known or suspected prisoner transfers. According to that report, the first such mission was executed by N313P on 22 September 2003, the last by N1HC on 5 November 2005 (see paragraphs 357-358 and 514 above).", "The list of fifteen rendition missions in the 2015 LIBE Briefing overlaps with the Government\u2019s list of twenty-one \u201csuspicious flights\u201d (see paragraphs 327 and 357-358 above).", "(d) In all the inquiries conducted by the international governmental and non-governmental organisations, which were extensively referred to above, most planes included in the Government\u2019s list have been conclusively and definitely identified as carrying out the CIA rendition missions (see paragraphs 250-264; 268-290; 296; 327-330; 334-336; and 355-358 above).", "(e) It emerges from the comparison of the list of twenty-one \u201csuspicious flights\u201d with the above reports identifying the aircraft associated with the CIA\u2019s transportation of prisoners that between 23 September 2003 and 5 November 2005 there was a continued, steady and concentrated flow of those planes through Bucharest B\u0103neasa Airport. According to the material produced by the Government themselves, during that period fifteen CIA flights arrived at Bucharest B\u0103neasa Airport and only two were recorded by the Romanian authorities as landing at Constan\u0163a Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu Airport. The CIA flights into Bucharest arrived at fairly regular intervals of between one and some three months (see paragraphs 327 and 357-358 above).", "522. Considering the material referred to above as a whole, the Court is satisfied that there is prima facie evidence in favour of the applicant\u2019s allegation that the CIA secret detention site operated in Romania between 22 September 2003 and the beginning of November 2005. Accordingly, the burden of proof should shift to the respondent Government (see El-Masri, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 154-165, and paragraphs 492-493 above).", "523. However, the Government have failed to demonstrate why the evidence referred to above cannot serve to corroborate the applicant\u2019s allegations. Apart from their firm, albeit general, denial that the facts as presented by the applicant and disclosed in the international inquiries \u2013 to begin with the Marty Inquiry and Mr Hammarberg\u2019s investigative work \u2013 never took place or were grossly distorted to Romania\u2019s disadvantage, they have not offered any cogent reasons for the series of landings of CIA-associated aircraft at Bucharest between 22 September 2003 and 5 November 2005 (see also Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 414; and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 414).", "Likewise, the Government have not produced any evidence capable of contradicting the findings of the international inquiries and the experts heard by the Court, categorically stating that the aircraft in question were used by the CIA for transportation of prisoners into Romania. Nor have they refuted expert evidence to the effect that the CIA prison referred to in the 2014 US Senate Report as \u201cDetention Site Black\u201d was located in Romania (see also and compare with Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 414-415; and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 414-415).", "524. In that context, the Court cannot but note that all the international inquiries and other reports challenged by the Government were based on extensive, meticulous work which was done by the experts and politicians of the highest integrity and competence and whose only aim and mission was to reveal the facts and establish the truth about what had occurred in Europe during the CIA rendition operations. Their work was often impeded by the extreme secrecy surrounding the CIA operations, the uncooperative attitude of the national authorities and the lack of access to the necessary information \u2013 information which was revealed only gradually, over many years and which still remains incomplete due to the classification of essential documents, in particular the full version of the 2014 US Senate Committee Report. It is worth noting that the inquiries conducted in 20062007 did not have the benefit of access to the CIA declassified documents, which were released in 2009-2010 (see paragraphs 36-58 above) and which provided an important insight into the fate of specific HVDs, including Mr Al Nashiri, with such details as dates of detainees\u2019 transfers between the CIA \u201cblack sites\u201d and interrogation schedules.", "As regards the Government\u2019s challenge to the impartiality and credibility of Reprieve, based on its involvement in ongoing investigations into CIA rendition and secret detention and case work regarding Guant\u00e1namo prisoners (see paragraph 434 above), the Court finds no ground whatsoever to consider that Reprieve and its experts, who have \u2013 as for instance Mr Black \u2013 also been involved in the European Parliament\u2019s inquiry, lack objectivity in representing the facts concerning the operation of the HVD Programme in Europe and the plight of detainees, including the applicant.", "In so far as the Government can be seen as impliedly contesting the credibility of evidence from other experts heard at the fact-finding hearing (see paragraphs 399 and 430-435 above), the Court would wish to underline that Mr Fava, Senator Marty and Mr J.G.S. already gave evidence in Al Nashiri v. Poland and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland. The Court, in its examination of those cases, relied heavily on their testimonies considering them to be one of the most important parts of the evidence and finding them fully reliable and credible (see Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 404, 415, 434-436 and 441; and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 404, 415-416, 426-427, 434- 436, 439-440). Furthermore, in El-Masri the Court considered the expert report from Mr J.G.S. to be \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d which was duly taken into account in its establishment of the facts in the case (see El-Masri, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 159 and 166).", "Consequently, in the Court\u2019s eyes, there is nothing in the Government\u2019s submission that would be capable of shedding the doubt on the integrity and dependability of the experts whose testimony was taken in the present case.", "525. The Government also argued that the fact that the sources relied on by the applicant, including the 2007 Marty Report and Mr Hammarberg\u2019s dossier, had given different indications as to the exact location of the alleged \u201cblack site\u201d in Romania deprived his allegations of credibility. Referring in particular to the ORNISS building, they relied on witness R\u2019s statements obtained in the investigation denying that this location had, or could ever have been, used for the CIA prison (see paragraphs 325 and 422425 above).", "The Court does not find these arguments convincing.", "It is true that the applicant, relying on the press disclosures, indicated the ORNISS building as a probable CIA prison. However, considering the secrecy of the CIA operations it cannot be realistically expected that this kind of indication will be absolutely certain, unless the governments concerned decide to disclose such locations and formally \u201cofficialise\u201d the information circulating in the public domain. In that regard, the Court would note in passing that the likelihood of the ORNISS building having hosted the CIA facility has also been considered in the inquiry conducted by the European Parliament; however, the Romanian authorities did not enable the LIBE delegation to visit the site during their fact-finding mission in September 2015 (see paragraphs 288-290 above).", "The Court will not speculate on that likelihood. Nor is it necessary for the purposes of its ruling to establish where the CIA facility was exactly located. Given the coherent and unrefuted evidence corroborating the applicant\u2019s allegations as to the existence of the CIA \u201cblack site\u201d in Romania, the fact that he did not state its precise location does not undermine the credibility of his allegations.", "526. In view of the foregoing, the Government\u2019s objection to the credibility of the evidence and sources relied on by the applicant (see paragraphs 430-435 above) cannot be upheld.", "527. Consequently, the Court considers the applicant\u2019s allegations sufficiently convincing and, having regard to the above evidence from numerous sources corroborating his version, finds it established beyond reasonable doubt that:", "(a) a CIA detention facility, codenamed Detention Site Black in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report, was located in Romania;", "(b) the facility operated from 22 September 2003 and its opening was marked by flight N313P which took off from Szymany, Poland on 22 September 2003 and, having disguised its destination by indicating Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu International Airport in Constan\u0163a, landed at Bucharest B\u0103neasa Airport on the same day; and", "(c) the facility was closed on the Romanian authorities\u2019 demand and its closure was marked by flight N1HC which took off from Porto, Portugal on 5 November 2005 and, having disguised its destination by indicating Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu International Airport in Constan\u0163a, landed at Bucharest B\u0103neasa Airport and on the same day took off for Amman, Jordan.", "528. It is alleged that the applicant was transferred to Romania from Guant\u00e1namo on board N85VM on 12 April 2004 and that he was detained at Detention Site Black in Romania, also codenamed \u201cBright Light\u201d or \u201cBritelite\u201d until at least 6 October 2005 or, at the latest, until 5 November 2005 (see paragraphs 115-116 and 445-451 above). The Government firmly contested this (see paragraphs 426-429 and 436-437 above).", "529. The Court is mindful that, as regards the applicant\u2019s actual presence in Romania, there is no direct evidence that it was the applicant who was transported on board the N85VM flight from Guant\u00e1namo to Bucharest or that he was subsequently transferred from Bucharest to another CIA secret detention facility on 6 October or 5 November 2006, the two possible dates indicated by the experts (see paragraphs 129-135 above).", "The applicant, who for years on end was held in detention conditions specifically designed to isolate and disorientate a person by transfers to unknown locations, even if he had been allowed to testify before the Court, would not be able to say where he was detained. Nor can it be reasonably expected that he will ever, on his own, be able to identify the places in which he was held.", "No trace of the applicant can, or will, be found in any official flight or border police records in Romania or in other countries because his presence on the planes and on their territories was, by the very nature of the rendition operations, purposefully not to be recorded. As confirmed by expert J.G.S. in Al Nashiri v. Poland, in the countries concerned the official records showing numbers of passengers and crew arriving and departing on the rendition planes neither included, nor purported to include detainees who were brought into or out of the territory involuntarily, by means of clandestine HVD renditions. Those detainees were never appeared in a record of persons on board filed with any official institution (see Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 410-411).", "530. In view of the foregoing, in order to ascertain whether or not it can be concluded that the applicant was detained at Detention Site Black in Romania at the relevant time, the Court will take into account all the facts that have already been found established beyond reasonable doubt (see paragraphs 499, 507 and 527 above) and analyse all other material in its possession, including, in particular, the 2014 US Senate Committee Report and expert evidence reconstructing the chronology of the applicant\u2019s rendition and detention in 2003-2005 (see paragraphs 102-140, 159-164, 167-190 and 251-393 above).", "531. The Court observes that the following facts either are not disputed or have also been confirmed by flight data from numerous sources, including the documents produced by the respondent Government:", "(a) On 12 April 2004 plane N85VM, having indicated in its flight plans Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu International Airport in Constan\u0163a as its destination, in fact landed in B\u0103neasa Airport in Bucharest and took off from there on the same day (see paragraph 118 above);", "(b) that on 5 October 2005 plane N308AB, having indicated in its flight plans Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu International Airport in Constan\u0163a as its destination, in fact landed at B\u0103neasa Airport in Bucharest and took off from Bucharest for Tirana on the same day;", "(c) that on 5 October 2005 plane N787WH landed in Tirana at 05:52 and stayed there until 23:44, at which time it departed for Shannon;", "(d) that on 5 October 2005 both N308AB and N787WH were in the same airport in Tirana between 22:38 (N308AB\u2019s landing) and 23:44 (N787WH\u2019s departure);", "(e) that on 6 October 2005 N787WH, having indicated in its flight plans Tallinn, Estonia as its destination, in fact landed at Vilnius International Airport in Lithuania (see paragraphs 135 and 331 above).", "532. As regards the rendition circuit of 5-6 November 2005, the Court would reiterate that it has already been established that:", "- on 5 November 2005 N1HC, having disguised its destination as Constan\u0163a, in fact landed at Bucharest B\u0103neasa Airport and took off from there for Amman, arriving there in the night on 5 November 2005;", "- N248AB arrived in Amman 6 November 2005, and on the same night, left for Kabul; and", "- on the same night of 5/6 November 2005 both N1HC and N248AB were in the same airport in Amman between 00:21 and 00:55 (see paragraphs 509 and 527 above).", "533. The Court has also established that after his transfers from Poland to Morocco and from Morocco to Guant\u00e1namo the applicant was detained in Guant\u00e1namo until an unspecified two-digit date in April 2004 (see paragraph 507 above). As noted above, the 2014 US Senate Committee Report states that by that date, \u201call five CIA detainees were transferred from Guant\u00e1namo to other CIA detention facilities\u201d (see paragraphs 114 and 505 above, with further references).", "534. Mr J.G.S., in his testimony, explained that the use of the word \u201cfacilities\u201d in the plural in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report was significant in the context of the applicant\u2019s detention given that, as the very same report established, following his transfer from Poland, he had been held at five different CIA \u201cblack sites\u201d (see also paragraphs 102 and 104108 above). Mr Al Nashiri could not, therefore, have been transferred from Guant\u00e1namo back to Morocco. Mr J.G.S. further explained that at the relevant time there had been two distinct detainee transfers from Guant\u00e1namo; the first which had taken some detainees to Rabat on 27 March 2004 and the second which had taken the remaining ones on plane N85VM to Romania, via a stopover in Tenerife, on 12 April 2004. This, he said, was the sole outward flight linking Guant\u00e1namo with Romania. Also, it emerged from the 2014 US Senate Committee Report and cables regarding the applicant\u2019s treatment that he found himself at Detention Site Black in the third and fourth quarter of 2004 and in July 2005. Mr J.G.S concluded that, in order for the applicant to be at Detention Site Black or \u201cBritelite\u201d by that time, he had to have been brought to Romania on flight N85VM on 12 April 2004 (see paragraphs 119-120 above).", "Moreover, in respect of that flight the CIA had recourse to its systematic practice of disguised flight planning which, as the expert stated, \u201cin fact became a tell-tale sign of rendition or detainee transfer activity on such flights\u201d (see paragraph 119 above).", "535. Mr Black stated that he was aware of two possible flights that could have taken the applicant into Romania and N85VM was one of them. He indicated that there had been a potential other flight that had occurred in February 2005. While it was known for a fact that the applicant had been in Romania after February 2005 and in June 2005, there were also indications that he had been held in Romania before, in late 2004. That led Mr Black to prefer, of these two possibilities, the 12 April 2004 flight as being the more likely of the two (see paragraph 121 above).", "536. The Government acknowledged that the flight plan for N85VM, initially indicating Constan\u0163a as its destination, had been changed to Bucharest, B\u0103neasa Airport when the plane had been en route but did not consider that this element could confirm the applicant\u2019s secret detention in Romania (see paragraph 437 above). They produced documents issued by the RAS at B\u0103neasa Airport in connection with the N85VM landing on 12 April 2004 (see paragraph 118 above).", "As in respect of other allegedly \u201csuspicious\u201d flights, the Government asserted that the flight had been of a \u201cprivate and non-commercial nature\u201d and had not been executed in connection with the HVD Programme (see paragraph 436 above).", "537. However, this assertion does not seem to be supported by the materials gathered in the present case. To the contrary, the Court finds that in addition to the expert evidence referred to above, there is other abundant evidence to the effect that on 12 April 2004 plane N85VM executed a rendition mission to Romania with the purpose of \u201cdropping off\u201d detainees from Guant\u00e1namo.", "In that regard, the Court observes that since at least 2007 the findings of the international inquiries have clearly associated N85VM with the CIA rendition operations (see paragraphs 271- 273, 337, 342 and 358 above). As already noted above, N85VM was conclusively identified as the plane used earlier for the rendition of Osama Mustafa Nasr otherwise known as Abu Omar (see paragraph 512 above). The former Council of Europe\u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights dossier for the Romanian Prosecutor General included that flight among disguised rendition flights into Bucharest, bearing the character of detainee \u201cdrop-off\u201d (see paragraph 337 above). The same dossier listed the applicant among HVDs who had been brought to a CIA \u201cblack site\u201d in Romania and indicated 12 April 2004 as the date of his transfer to Romania (see paragraph 342 above).", "The 2015 LIBE Briefing indicated flight N85VM on 12 April 2004 among the missions carried out under rendition contracts (see paragraph 358 above).", "That flight is also listed among twenty-one \u201csuspicious flights\u201d in the document produced by the Government (see paragraph 327 above).", "538. As to the applicant\u2019s rendition by the CIA from Romania, the experts gave 6 October 2005 and 5 November 2005 as two possible dates of the applicant\u2019s transfer (see paragraphs 129-132 above).", "Mr J.G.S described in detail the CIA \u201cplane-switch\u201d operation that, according to him, had taken place in the course of the flight circuit on 56 October 2005 and involved two aircraft: N308AB and N787WH. On this premise, on 5 October 2005 the applicant was taken on board N308AB from B\u0103neasa Bucharest City Airport to Tirana and, subsequently, on board N787WH to Vilnius to a CIA \u201dblack site\u201d in Lithuania, referred to as \u201cDetention Site Violet\u201d in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report (see paragraphs 130-131 above).", "Mr Black considered both dates as probable, with the 6 October 2005 transfer of the applicant being more likely (see paragraph 132 above).", "539. Having regard to all the various documentary and oral evidence referred to above, the Court is satisfied that there is prima facie evidence in favour of the applicant\u2019s version of the events and that the burden of proof should shift to the Government.", "540. Yet again in the Court\u2019s view the Government have failed to give any convincing grounds to explain why the evidence considered above cannot support the applicant\u2019s allegations. They asserted that the applicant\u2019s version of events should be rejected as it was incoherent and that in his account of the facts there had been inconsistencies regarding the dates, circumstances and the exact period of his alleged detention in Romania (see paragraphs 426-429 above).", "The Court does not share the Government\u2019s assessment.", "While it is true that, with the passage of time, the applicant adduced newly disclosed facts relevant for his complaints or corrected the dates initially given for his detention (see paragraphs 115-116 above), this does not by itself render his version of events inconsistent or incredible. In that context the Court would again refer to the fact that since his capture in midOctober 2002 the applicant has been continually prevented from giving any direct account of his fate even to the counsel representing him before the Court (see paragraphs 494-497 above).", "541. Furthermore, having regard to the above evidence demonstrating clearly, consistently and conclusively the chronology of the events preceding the applicant\u2019s transfer to Romania, his transfer to Romania on 12 April 2004 and his presence at Detention Site Black located in Romania in 2004 and 2005 (see paragraphs 126-127, 158 and 162-163 above and 545 below), as well as expert evidence confirming that there were two \u2013 and only two \u2013 possible dates on which he could be taken by the CIA out of Romania, the Court does not find it indispensable to determine on which specific date the transfer occurred. It is certain and beyond any reasonable doubt that the applicant, once detained at Detention Site Black and, as confirmed by the 2014 US Senate Committee Report and the experts, still present there at least until July 2005, must have been transferred out of it at some later point before or when the site was definitely closed on 5 November 2005 (see paragraph 527 above). The experts\u2019 conclusions are founded on in-depth analysis of extensive international aviation data, contractual documents pertaining to rendition missions executed by the air companies used by the CIA and large amount of data released by the US authorities, including the CIA. On this basis, they gave a time-frame which is sufficiently accurate for the Court to conclude that the applicant must have been taken out of Romania either on 6 October 2005 or on 5 November 2005 to one of the \u2013 at the time two \u2013 remaining CIA detention facilities, referred to in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report as Detention Site Violet and Detention Site Brown.", "542. Accordingly, the Court finds it established beyond reasonable doubt that:", "(a) On 12 April 2004 the applicant was transferred by the CIA from Guant\u00e1namo to Romania on board N85VM.", "(b) From 12 April 2004 to 6 October 2005 or, at the latest, 5 November 2005, the applicant was detained in the CIA detention facility in Romania code-named \u201cDetention Site Black\u201d according to the 2014 US Senate Committee Report.", "(c) On 6 October 2005 on board N308AB or, at the latest, on 5 November 2005, on board N1HC via a double-plane switch the applicant was transferred by the CIA out of Romania to one of the two remaining CIA detention facilities, code-named Detention Site Violet and Detention Site Brown according to the 2014 US Senate Committee Report.", "543. It is alleged that during his secret detention in Romania the applicant was subjected to torture and other forms of treatment prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention. The Government have not addressed this issue.", "544. The Court observes that, in contrast to Al Nashiri v. Poland where the treatment to which the applicant was subjected by the CIA during his detention in Poland could be established with certainty owing to the CIA\u2019s declassified materials depicting in graphic detail the torture inflicted on him in the course of the interrogations (see Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 416 and 514-516), in the present case there is no evidence demonstrating that at Detention Site Black in Romania he was subjected to EITs in connection with interrogations (see paragraphs 48-55 above).", "545. As regards recourse to harsh interrogation techniques at the relevant time, the 2014 US Senate Committee Report mentions in general terms that in mid-2004 the CIA temporarily suspended the use of the EITs. While their use was at some point resumed and they were apparently applied throughout the most part of 2005, such techniques were again temporarily suspended in late 2005 and in 2006 (see paragraph 94 above).", "In respect of the applicant, the report states that in the \u201cfinal years\u201d of his detention \u201cmost of the intelligence requirements for Al Nashiri involved showing [him] photographs\u201d. Those \u201cdebriefings\u201d were suspended in June 2005 apparently because of the low value of intelligence obtained from him and \u201cbecause debriefings often were the \u2018catalyst\u2019 for his outbursts\u201d (see paragraphs 126-127 above). Other heavily redacted passages in the report speak of \u201cfeeding him rectally\u201d, which resulted from his \u201cshort-lived hunger strike\u201d at some unspecified time in 2004. It is also mentioned that in October 2004 he underwent a psychological assessment in the context of \u201cmanagement challenges\u201d posed to the CIA by psychological problems experienced by the detainees \u201cwho had been held in austere conditions and in solitary confinement\u201d. The applicant\u2019s assessment was used by the CIA in discussions on \u201cestablishing an endgame\u201d for the HVD Programme (see paragraphs 126, 158 and 162-163 above). In July 2005 the CIA expressed concern regarding the applicant\u2019s \u201ccontinued state of depression and uncooperative attitude\u201d. Days later a psychologist established that the applicant was \u201con the verge of a breakdown\u201d (see paragraph 158 above).", "546. According to the experts, even though the applicant was in all likelihood no longer interrogated with the use of the EITs, he did, as Mr J.G.S. stated \u201cpurely by virtue of the conditions in which he [had been] held\u201d suffer ill-treatment (see paragraph 124 above). Mr Black added that it was clear that the applicant, in particular when he had been in Romania, was experiencing serious psychological problems as a result of the treatment he had received (see paragraph 125 above).", "547. As regards the Court\u2019s establishment of the facts of the case, the detailed rules governing the conditions in which the CIA kept its prisoners leave no room for speculation as to the basic aspects of the situation in which the applicant found himself from 12 April 2004 to 6 October 2005 or 5 November 2005. The Court therefore finds it established beyond any reasonable doubt that the applicant was kept \u2013 as any other high-value detainee \u2013 in conditions described in the DCI Confinement Guidelines, which applied from the end of January 2003 to September 2006 to all CIA detainees (see paragraphs 56-58 above; see also Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 418-419 and 510).", "While at this stage it is premature to characterise the treatment to which the applicant was subjected during his detention at Detention Site Black for the purposes of his complaint under the substantive limb of Article 3 of the Convention, the Court observes that the regime included at least \u201csix standard conditions of confinement\u201d. That meant blindfolding or hooding the detainees, designed to disorient them and keep from learning their location or the layout of the detention facility; removal of hair upon arrival at the site; incommunicado, solitary confinement; continuous noise of high and varying intensity played at all times; continuous light such that each cell was illuminated to about the same brightness as an office; and use of leg shackles in all aspects of detainee management and movement (see paragraph 56-58 above).", "548. The 2014 US Senate Committee Report, in the chapter giving details as to the establishment of Detention Site Black, states that in an unspecified month (redacted the text) in 2002 the CIA \u201centered into an agreement\u201d with the country concerned \u201cto host a CIA detention facility\u201d.", "While the terms of that agreement have not been disclosed, it appears from subsequent passages that, in order to demonstrate to the country\u2019s authority (or person) whose name was redacted and to \u201cthe highest levels of the Country ... government\u201d that the US authorities \u201cdeeply appreciate[d] their cooperation and support for the detention program\u201d, the CIA station in the country was invited by their Headquarters \u201cto identify ways to support the\u201d \u2013 again redacted \u2013 country\u2019s bodies (presumably, or activities) by financial means, defined as a \u201csubsidy\u201d (see paragraph 161 above).", "549. The requested subsidy which was received in appreciation of \u201ccooperation and support\u201d amounted to a sum (redacted in the text) that was a multiple of USD million; in fact, the amount which was initially put on \u2013 in the report\u2019s words \u2013 \u201cwish list\u201d presented on behalf of the country by the CIA station was later increased by a further (redacted) multiple of USD million (see paragraph 161 above).", "The fact that such financial rewards were, as a matter of the general policy and practice, offered to the authorities of countries hosting CIA \u201cblack sites\u201d is also confirmed in Conclusion 20 of the 2014 US Senate Committee Report. The conclusion states that \u201cto encourage governments to clandestinely host CIA detention sites, or to increase support for existing sites, the CIA provided millions of dollars in cash payments to foreign government officials\u201d and that \u201cthe CIA Headquarters encouraged CIA Stations to construct \u201cwish lists\u201d of proposed financial assistance\u201d and \u201cto \u2018think big\u2019 in terms of that assistance\u201d (see paragraph 97 above).", "550. In that context, the Court would also wish to refer to its findings regarding the national authorities\u2019 knowledge of the CIA HVD Programme in Al Nashiri v. Poland and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland and the issue of the alleged existence of a bilateral agreement between Poland and the USA on the setting up and running of a secret CIA prison. In that case, the Court did not find it necessary for its examination of the case to establish whether such agreement or agreements existed and if so, in what format or what was specifically provided therein. It did, however, consider it inconceivable that the rendition aircraft could have crossed Polish airspace, landed at and departed from a Polish airport and that the CIA could have occupied the premises in Poland without some kind of pre-existing arrangement enabling the CIA operation in Poland to be first prepared and then executed (see Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 423-428; and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 425-430).", "The same conclusion is valid in respect of Romania; moreover, in the present case it has been reinforced by evidence from the 2014 US Senate Committee Report, unambiguously demonstrating the existence of a bilateral agreement between Romania and the USA on hosting Detention Site Black on Romanian territory.", "551. The Court would also add that the above-cited sections of the 2014 US Senate Committee Report further support the conclusions of the 2007 Marty Report, stating that \u201cthe key arrangements for CIA clandestine operations in Europe were secured on a bilateral level\u201d, that \u201cthe CIA brokered \u2018operating agreements\u2019 with the Governments of Poland and Romania to hold its high-value detainees ... in secret detention facilities on their respective territories\u201d and that \u201cPoland and Romania agreed to provide the premises in which these facilities were established, the highest degrees of physical security and secrecy, and steadfast guarantees of non-interference\u201d (see paragraph 260 above; see also Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 423-428; and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 425-430).", "In his affidavit made several years later, on 24 April 2013, Senator Marty stated that his \u201cconvictions regarding Romania\u2019s participation in the CIA\u2019s HVD Programme were unambiguous and unwavering\u201d, adding that \u201cup to the present day, I stand by every one of the factual findings I delivered in my 2006 and 2007 PACE Reports\u201d and that his \u201ccertitude that a CIA \u2018black site\u2019 existed in Romania [had] only increased since that time\u201d (see paragraph 354 above).", "At the fact-finding hearing he added that, based on \u201cextremely precise testimony\u201d obtained in the course of his inquiry, the Romanian officials \u201cmust have known that the CIA used their territory for transfers of prisoners in the context of the war on terror\u201d (see paragraph 380 above)", "552. In that regard, the Court notes that the 2007 Marty Report listed by name several individual high-office holders who \u201cknew about, authorised and stand accountable for Romania\u2019s role in the CIA\u2019s operation of \u2018outoftheatre\u2019 secret detention facilities on Romanian territory, from 2003 to 2005\u201d (see paragraph 262 above).", "Two of those identified in the report, namely former President of Romania, Ion Iliescu and his former Advisor on National Security, Ioan Talpe\u015f several years later made public statements relating to the CIA rendition operation in their interviews given to Spiegel Online in 2014 and 2015 (see paragraphs 244 and 245 above).", "553. In December 2014, in the first Spiegel Online publication, Mr Talpe\u015f was reported as saying that \u201cthere were one or two locations in Romania at which the CIA probably held persons who were subjected to inhuman treatment\u201d. It was further reported that \u201chad, from 2003 onwards, continued discussions with officials of the CIA and the US military about a more intense cooperation\u201d and that in that context \u201cit was agreed that the CIA could carry out its own activities in certain locations\u201d. He did not know where they were and \u201cRomania was, expressly, not interested in what the CIA was doing there\u201d. Mr Talpe\u015f also told Spiegel Online that in 2003 and 2004 he had informed President Iliescu that the CIA had carried out \u201ccertain activities\u201d on Romanian territory; at that time \u201che did not think that the CIA could possibly torture captives\u201d (see paragraph 244 above).", "554. In April 2015, in the second Spiegel Online publication, Mr Iliescu was reported as stating that \u201caround the turn of the year 2002-2003, our allies asked us for a site\u201d and that he, as Head of State, had in principle granted that request but the details had been taken care of by Mr Talpe\u015f. He added that \u201cwe [had not interfered] with the activities of the USA on this site\u201d.", "Spiegel Online further reported that Mr Talpe\u015f had confirmed Mr Iliescu\u2019s statements, adding that at the turn of 2002-2003 he had received a request from a representative of the CIA in Romania for premises, which the CIA needed for its own activities. He had arranged for a building in Bucharest to be given to the CIA. The building was used by the CIA from 2003 to 2006 and no longer existed; Mr Talpe\u015f would not reveal its location (see paragraph 245 above).", "555. In that context, it is also to be noted that the 2016 EP Resolution states that Mr Talpe\u015f \u201cadmitted on record to the European Parliament delegation that he had been fully aware of the CIA\u2019s presence on Romanian territory, acknowledging that he had given permission to \u2018lease\u2019 a government building to the CIA\u201d (see paragraph 290 above).", "556. Referring to Mr Iliescu\u2019s and Mr Talpe\u015f\u2019 interviews in Spiegel Online, the Government argued that subsequently their initially ambiguous statements had been clarified to the effect that there had been no cooperation and no complicity in the CIA rendition and secret detention operations on the part of Romania. In that regard, the Government also relied on evidence from witnesses obtained in the criminal investigation conducted in Romania (see paragraphs 441-442 above).", "557. The Court does not share this assessment.", "It is true that certain Romanian officials, for instance Y and Z, who testified in the investigation in May and June 2015, denied receiving any such request or having any knowledge of the existence of the CIA prisons in the country (see paragraphs 300-302 above).", "Yet in that regard the Court cannot but note that witness Z in his testimony given on 18 June 2015 nevertheless confirmed that \u201cUSA Government officials [had] asked the Romanian authorities to offer some locations on Romanian territory to be used for actions of combating the international terrorist threats by the representatives of the CIA, on the same pattern as that used in the other NATO Member States\u201d and that \u201cfinally one single location [had been] offered\u201d. It was understood \u201cat that stage, in 2003, that it should be an office building in Bucharest\u201d (see paragraph 302 above).", "558. The accounts given by Mr Talpe\u015f and Mr Iliescu to Spiegel Online in their interviews and Mr Talpe\u015f\u2019 admission to the European Parliament\u2019s delegation match the disclosures in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report, in particular regarding the date of the agreement to host a CIA secret detention site (2002), the fact that the Romanian authorities were asked for premises for the CIA, the time at which the premises were provided (2003) and the fact that they were informed of the purpose for which the premises that Romania offered were to be used (see paragraphs 161 and 548 above). They also correspond to the Court\u2019s above findings as to the dates marking the opening of Detention Site Black in Romania (see paragraph 527 above).", "559. The statements obtained in the investigation relied on by the Government are in a marked contrast to the disclosures made by the US authorities, Romania\u2019s partner under the agreement. The Court does not see how the findings of the US Senate Intelligence Committee, based on a several-year-long investigation and in-depth analysis of first-hand evidence, which in most part came from classified \u201ctop secret\u201d sources, including more than six million pages of CIA documents (see paragraphs 78-80 above) could be undermined by the material referred to by the Government.", "560. The 2014 US Senate Committee Report, in the chapter concerning the establishment of the CIA Detention Site Black (see paragraphs 161 and 548 above) also refers to several interventions vis-\u00e0-vis the CIA made by the US ambassador in the country in the context of the operation of the CIA HVD Programme in that country and public disclosures of ill-treatment of detainees in US custody. First, in August 2003, he expressed concern as to whether the State Department was aware of the CIA detention facility in the country and its \u201cpotential impact\u201d on US policy in respect of the State concerned. The second and third interventions, prompted by \u201crevelations about US detainee abuses\u201d were made in May 2004 and in the \u201cfall of 2004\u201d.", "The report further states that \u201cwhile it is unclear how the ambassador\u2019s concerns were resolved, he later joined the chief of Station in making a presentation\u201d to the country\u2019s authorities (or representatives) whose names were redacted in the text. The presentation did not describe the EITs but \u201crepresented that without the full range of these interrogation measures\u201d the US \u201cwould not have succeeded in overcoming [the] resistance \u201cof Khalid Sheikh Mohammed\u201d and \u201cother equally resistant HVDs\u201d. The presentation also included representations \u201cattributing to CIA detainees critical information\u201d on several terror plots, including the \u201cKarachi Plot\u201d, the \u201cHeathrow Plot\u201d and the \u201cSecond Wave Plot\u201d. Also, in the context of intelligence obtained, several well-known HVDs in US custody were mentioned by name (see paragraph 161 above).", "561. The above information originated in an evidential source to which the Court attributes utmost credibility (see also paragraph 559 above). It gives a description of a concrete event \u2013 an oral presentation \u2013 that occurred at some time following \u201cthe fall of 2004\u201d and during which, in the context of the operation of Detention Site Black in the country, the Romanian authorities were presented with an outline of the CIA HVD Programme by the US officials. Even though the format of the meeting and names or functions of participants representing the host country have not been revealed, the disclosure clearly shows that the presentation included a fairly extensive account of the HVD Programme. To begin with, the US officials clearly spoke of intelligence that had been obtained from high-value detainees through \u201covercoming resistance\u201d by means of a \u201cfull range of interrogation measures\u201d. They also suggested that specific terrorist suspects in CIA custody had provided \u201ccritical intelligence\u201d on prominent terror plots. CIA prisoners whose resistance was \u201covercome\u201d as a result of interrogations were spoken of, to mention only Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the top HVD in CIA custody, suspected of masterminding the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the USA.", "562. In Al Nashiri v. Poland and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland the fact that the national authorities cooperated with the CIA in disguising the rendition aircraft\u2019s actual routes and validated incomplete or false flight plans in order to cover up the CIA activities in the country was considered relevant for the Court\u2019s assessment of the State authorities\u2019 knowledge of, and complicity in, the HVD Programme (see Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 419-422; and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 421-424). The Court will follow that approach in analysing the facts of the present case.", "563. It is to be reiterated that the Government acknowledged that in respect of two flights, namely N313P on 22 September 2003 and NVM85 on 12 April 2004 the flight plans had been changed when the planes had been in the air. They denied that any role in the process had been played by the Romanian authorities, except for a passive, \u201cautomatic\u201d acceptance of the change for which the plane operator had been solely responsible and assistance in transmitting the flight plans to the entity managing the integrated initial flight plan processing system (see paragraph 439 above).", "564. However, as already noted above, the clear inconsistencies in the flight data pertaining to destinations where the CIA-associated aircraft were supposed to arrive and from where they actually took off presented by the Romanian authorities were already identified in the 2007 Marty Report and the Fava Report (see paragraphs 264 and 512 above). Also, Mr Hammarberg\u2019s dossier addressed to the Romanian Prosecutor General listed eight rendition flight circuits occurring between 22 September 2003 and 21 August 2005 in respect of which false flight plans had been filed (see paragraph 337 above).", "565. The practice of so-called \u201cdummy\u201d flight planning, i.e. a process of intentional disguise of flight plans for rendition aircraft used by the air companies contracted by the CIA, for instance Jeppesen Dataplan Inc. or Richmor Aviation (see paragraphs 63-70 above), was explained by Senator Marty and Mr J.G.S. in their testimony during the PowerPoint presentation on the basis of two examples of the CIA rendition circuits through Romania executed by plane N313P on 20-24 September 2003 and 16-28 January 2004 (see paragraphs 328 and 371 above). The experts described the \u201cdummy\u201d flight planning as \u201ca systematic practice deployed by the CIA and its aviation services providers to disguise CIA flights into and out of its most sensitive operational locations\u201d. They added that the CIA could not execute this tactic alone since it \u201cdepended upon, however discrete, a role played by the national counterpart authority\u201d. The Romanian documentary records demonstrated the landing of N313P on 25 January 2004 at Bucharest B\u0103neasa Airport despite the absence of a valid flight plan. According to the experts, \u201cthis was part of a systematic practice and through our investigations we [had] generated numerous, up to twelve instances on which CIA rendition aircraft [had] transferred detainees into, and out of, Bucharest, Romania\u201d (see paragraph 373 above).", "In this connection, the Court would also reiterate its above findings that the flights N313P and N1HC marking the opening and the closure of the CIA detention facility in Romania, flight N85VM, identified as the one that brought the applicant into Romania and flight N308AB, identified as one of the two possible flights on which the applicant was taken out of Romania were concealed by the \u201cdummy\u201d flight planning (see paragraphs 519, 527, 531, 534-537 and 542 above)", "566. As the Court found in Al Nashiri v. Poland and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, the \u201cdummy\u201d flight planning, a deliberate effort to cover up the CIA flights, required active cooperation on the part of the host countries through which the planes travelled. In addition to granting the CIA rendition aircraft overflight permissions, the national authorities navigated the planes through the country\u2019s airspace to undeclared destinations in contravention of international aviation regulations and issued false landing permits (see Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 419-422; and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 421-424).", "567. Consequently, the fact that the Romanian aviation authorities navigated the CIA flights into Bucharest, despite the fact that the relevant flight plans named Constan\u0163a or Timi\u0219oara as the airports of destination and accepted flight plans naming those destinations but navigated the planes to Bucharest demonstrated that they knowingly assisted in the process of disguise of the CIA planes (ibid.).", "568. The Government asserted that, in contrast to the circumstances in Al Nashiri v. Poland, in Romania there had been no special procedure for receiving the impugned flights (see paragraphs 436-440 above).", "In that regard they relied on evidence from witnesses heard in the investigation, who had not related any special treatment of the US flights that would deviate from routine procedures for any ordinary flight (see paragraphs 437-438 above).", "569. The Court notes that, indeed, several witnesses said that they had not heard about or seen any \u201cclandestine passengers\u201d, \u201cdetainees\u201d or \u201cany passenger especially of Arab origin\u201d (see paragraphs 306-309 and 317-319 above) or that they had not noted \u201canything out of the ordinary when the \u2018private planes\u2019 [had] landed\u201d or that there had been \u201cno special services provided\u201d (see paragraphs 320 and 323 above).", "570. However, the statements of several other witnesses who referred to the \u201cspecial\u201d or \u201cN\u201d status flights with the US registrations contradict the Government\u2019s assertion.", "Witness E knew about three or four such flights that landed at night time and parked on the airport platform for about 10-15 minutes. He said that that the only person approaching them had been witness X.", "Witness G knew of the \u201cN\u201d flights having been announced as special flights for which the staff had not been requested. Witness O spoke of one plane that had been treated differently and the staff had been asked to stay in the office and not go to the plane. Witness P knew that special flights had been \u201ccarried out at night\u201d; also, on one night he had seen a plane without a call sign and a man in dark overalls and military boots walking a dog near the plane (see paragraphs 310, 314 and 322-323 above).", "Witness X, apparently the only person who had been seen approaching the \u201cspecial planes\u201d did not explain in concrete terms what had in reality been going on but said that his presence in the airport had been connected with \u201cbilateral relations\u201d with the US\u201d equivalent structures\u201d and \u201caimed at ensuring protocol relations during processing as well as bilateral courtesy-setting according to diplomatic norms and international rules\u201d (see paragraph 299 above).", "571. Witness Z, in his statement of 17 September 2013 given to the prosecutor was more explicit. He confirmed that in the context of Romania\u2019s forthcoming accession to NATO \u201csome developments or agreements [had taken] place in relation to the American flights to be operated by the CIA\u201d and that, \u201cfrom about 2003 onwards several contacts had taken place in that direction and they resulted in concrete agreements that made possible the operation of the special American flights on Romanian territory, in different conditions than those provided for by international customs\u201d. He added that \u201cthose flights [had] had a special character and they [had] not [been] under an obligation to obey usual rules imposed on civil flights\u201d (see paragraph 301 above).", "572. Lastly, in the Court\u2019s view, the way in which the Romanian authorities dealt with the accident on the landing of the aircraft N478GS that occurred on 6 December 2004 is one more element that contradicts the Government\u2019s above assertion as to the lack of any special treatment of the CIA-associated flights. The incident was described in the Fava Report and the 2007 EP Resolution, and was also related by Mr Fava at the fact-finding hearing (see paragraphs 275, 280 and 362 above). The presence in Romania of seven passengers on the plane which came from Bagram, Afghanistan, was apparently concealed. Only on the TDIP\u2019s considerable insistence did the Romanian authorities give them a list of passengers, all of them US citizens with service passports. One of them was armed with a Beretta gun and had ammunition on him. No questions were asked about the purpose of their trip from Bagram, a place reported as hosting a CIA detention site for the purposes of interrogations of captured terrorist-suspects (see paragraph 362 above).", "573. As in Al Nashiri v. Poland (cited above \u00a7 434) and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland (cited above \u00a7 436) the Court considers the informal transatlantic meeting of the European Union and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation foreign ministers with the then US Secretary of State, Ms Condoleezza Rice, held on 7 December 2005, to be one of the elements relevant for its assessment of the respondent State\u2019s knowledge of the CIA rendition and secret detention operations in 2003-2005.", "574. In his testimony in Al Nashiri v. Poland, Mr Fava stated that the meeting had been convened in connection with recent international media reports, including The Washington Post and ABC News disclosures of, respectively, 2 November 2005 and 5 December 2005, naming European countries that had allegedly hosted CIA \u201cblack sites\u201d on their territories (see Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 306 and 434). He also described the content of the \u201cdebriefing\u201d of that meeting, a document that the TDIP obtained from a credible confidential source in the offices of the European Union. He stated that it had appeared from Ms Rice\u2019s statement \u201cwe all know about these techniques\u201d made in the context of the CIA operations and interrogations of terrorist suspects which had been recorded in the debriefing that there had been an attempt on the USA\u2019s part to share the \u201cweight of accusations\u201d (ibid.).", "575. In the present case Mr Fava testified that it had emerged from the debriefing that, at that stage, all the governments had known that this \u201coperational means\u201d had been chosen by the CIA and that the extraordinary renditions were a tool in the war against terrorism.", "Mr Fava further stated that the TDIP had \u201cnever had doubts\u201d given the precision of the debriefing notes and the fact that in the course of their further work they had received confirmation from Mr Bellinger, legal advisor to Ms Rice, that the US had \u201cnever violated the sovereignty of any EU Member States or indeed any States in in the process of accession to the EU\u201d and that everything what they had done \u201c[had been] done by always informing and asking for cooperation and never trying to prevail over the will of the governments of the Member States\u201d (see paragraph 361 above).", "576. In the context of Romania\u2019s knowledge of the CIA HVD Programme, Mr Fava moreover referred to a statement of Mr Pascu, listed in the 2007 Marty Report among the Romanian high-office holders \u201cwho knew about, authorised and [stood] accountable\u201d for Romania\u2019s role in the CIA HVD Programme (see paragraph 262 above). According to Mr Fava, Mr Pascu, as Minister of Defence, had been aware that the Romanian authorities had not had access to certain sites which had been under the control of the US army or intelligence services. In Mr Fava\u2019s opinion, this statement, although later rectified by Mr Pascu, was truthful (see paragraph 363 above).", "577. The Court considers, as it did in Al Nashiri v. Poland and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland (both cited above), that the circumstances and conditions in which HVDs were routinely transferred by the CIA from rendition planes to the CIA \u201cblack sites\u201d in the host countries should be taken into account in the context of the State authorities\u2019 alleged knowledge and complicity in the HVD Programme (see Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 437; and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 439).", "It follows from the Court\u2019s findings in the above cases and the CIA materials describing the routine procedure for transfers of detainees between the \u201cblack sites\u201d (see paragraphs 48-51 above) that for the duration of his transfer a HVD was \u201csecurely shackled\u201d by his hands and feet, deprived of sight and sound by the use of blindfolds, earmuffs and hood and that upon arrival at his destination was moved to the \u201cblack site\u201d under the same conditions.", "578. The Court finds it implausible that the transportation of prisoners on land from the planes to the CIA detention site could, for all practical purposes, have been effected without at least the minimum assistance of the host country\u2019s authorities, if only to secure the area near and around the landed planes and provide the conditions for the secret and safe transfer of passengers. Inevitably, the Romanian personnel responsible for security arrangements, in particular the reception of the flights and overland transit, must have witnessed at least some elements of the detainees\u2019 transfer to Detention Site Black, for instance the unloading of blindfolded and shackled passengers from the planes (see also Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 330 and 437).", "Consequently, the Court concludes that the Romanian authorities who received the CIA personnel in the airport could not have been unaware that the persons brought by them to Romania were the CIA prisoners.", "579. The Court also attaches importance to various material referring to ill-treatment and abuse of terrorist suspects captured and detained by US authorities in the \u201cwar on terror\u201d which were available in the public domain at the relevant time (see El Masri, cited above, \u00a7 160; Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 439; Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 441; and Nasr and Ghali, cited above, \u00a7 234).", "580. Before analysing that material, the Court wishes to refer to President\u2019s Bush memorandum of 7 February 2002, stating that neither alQaeda nor Taliban detainees qualified as prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions and that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions (see paragraph 204-209 above), did not apply to them. The White House Press Secretary announced that decision at the press conference on the same day. It was widely commented in the US and international media. That decision, although including a disclaimer that even detainees \u201cnot legally entitled\u201d to be treated humanely would be so treated, also spoke of respecting the principles of the Geneva Conventions \u201cto the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity\u201d (see paragraphs 31-32 above). Consequently, already at this very early stage of the \u201cwar on terror\u201d it was well known that \u201cmilitary necessity\u201d was a parameter for determining the treatment to be received by the captured terrorist-suspects.", "581. The Court would further note that from at least January 2002, when the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a statement relating to the detention of Taliban and al-Qaeda prisoners in Guant\u00e1namo, strong concerns were expressed publicly as to the treatment of detainees, in particular the use of \u201cstress and duress\u201d methods of interrogation and arbitrary and incommunicado detention. From January 2002 to the publication of the Washington Post report on 2 November 2005 the international governmental and non-governmental organisations regularly published reports and statements disclosing ill-treatment and abuse to which captured terrorist suspects were subjected in US custody in various places, for instance in Guant\u00e1namo and the US Bagram military base in Afghanistan. The material summarised above and cited in the AI/ICJ\u2019s amicus curiae brief include only some sources selected from a large amount of documents available in the public domain throughout the above period (see paragraphs 212-225 and 470-477 above).", "Also, in the 2003 PACE Resolution of 26 June 2003 \u2013 of which Romania, one of the Council of Europe\u2019s member States must have been aware \u2013 the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe was \u201cdeeply concerned at the conditions of detention\u201d of captured \u201cunlawful combatants\u201d held in the custody of the US authorities (see paragraph 216 above).", "582. At the material time the ill-treatment, use of harsh interrogation measures, and arbitrary detention of al-Qaeda and Taliban prisoners in US custody, as well as the existence of \u201cUS overseas centres\u201d for interrogations was also often reported in the international and Romanian media (see paragraphs 230-243 above). In particular, between January 2002 and May 2003 the Romanian press published a number of articles concerning illtreatment of prisoners and the use of \u201cviolent interrogation techniques\u201d against captured terrorists by the CIA (see paragraphs 239-243 above).", "583. The Court is mindful of the fact that knowledge of the CIA rendition and secret detention operations and the scale of abuse to which high-value detainees were subjected in CIA custody have evolved over time, from 2002 to the present day. A considerable part of evidence before the Court emerged several years after the events complained of (see paragraphs 36-59, 78-97, 251-297, 333-342 and 355-358 above; see also Al Nashiri, cited above, \u00a7 440; and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah), cited above, \u00a7 442).", "Romania\u2019s alleged knowledge and complicity in the HVD Programme must be assessed with reference to the elements that it knew or ought to have known at or closely around the relevant time, that is to say between 22 September 2003 and 5 November 2005. However, the Court, as it has done in respect of the establishment of the facts relating to the applicant\u2019s secret detention in Romania, will also rely on recent evidence which, as for instance the 2014 US Senate Committee Report and expert evidence obtained by the Court, relate, explain or disclose the facts occurring in the past (see Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 440 ; and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 442).", "584. In its assessment, the Court has considered all the evidence in its possession and the various related circumstances referred to above (see paragraphs 548-582 above). Having regard to all these elements taken as a whole, the Court finds that it has been adequately demonstrated to the required standard of proof that the Romanian authorities knew that the CIA operated on Romanian territory a detention facility for the purposes of secretly detaining and interrogating terrorist suspects captured within the \u201cwar on terror\u201d operation by the US authorities.", "This finding is primarily based on compelling and crucial evidence deriving from the 2014 US Senate Committee Report and, to a considerable extent, evidence from experts.", "The passages of the report about the agreement brokered between the USA and the country hosting Detention Site Black leave no doubt as to the fact as to the Romanian high-office holders\u2019 prior acceptance of a CIA detention facility on their territory. Nor can there be any doubt that they provided \u201ccooperation and support\u201d for the \u201cdetention programme\u201d and that, in appreciation, were offered and accepted a financial reward, referred to as a \u201csubsidy\u201d amounting to a redacted multiple of USD million (see paragraph 548-549 above). The experts, with reference to the reward received by the Romanian authorities, spoke of a \u201csubstantial sum, in the region of ten million United States dollars\u201d (see paragraph 384 above) or \u201cmore than eight million dollars\u201d (see paragraph 391 above). However, for the purposes of its ruling, the Court does not need, nor does it intend, to determine the sum that was at stake.", "585. The Court further attaches importance to the fact that the former Head of State Mr Iliescu and his national-security advisor Mr Talpe\u015f, admitted publicly in the press interviews that the authorities had made available to the CIA premises which, as Mr Talpe\u015f later explained, were located in Bucharest (see paragraphs 553-554 above). While it is true that Witness Y and Witness Z in their testimonies before the prosecutor contradicted the statements of Mr Iliescu and Mr Talpe\u015f reported in Spiegel Online, in the Court\u2019s view their denial cannot be considered credible as being in conflict with all other relevant materials cited above (see paragraphs 548-559 above). In any event, as noted above, Witness Z confirmed that a location \u201cfor actions of combating international terrorist threats\u201d was offered to the CIA (see paragraphs 302 and-557 above).", "586. Furthermore, the disclosure in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report demonstrates conclusively that in the autumn of 2004, when Detention Site Black had already been operating in Romania for around one year, the national authorities were given a presentation outlining the HVD Programme by the chief of the CIA station and the US ambassador. The content of that presentation as related in the report leaves no doubt as to the fact that at the very least the Romanian authorities had learnt from the CIA of a \u201cfull range of interrogation measures\u201d being used against their detainees in order to \u201covercome resistance\u201d in the context of obtaining intelligence (see paragraphs 560-561 above).", "587. Furthermore, the experts, who in the course of their inquiries also had the benefit of contact with various, including confidential, sources unanimously and categorically stated that Romania not only ought to have known but actually did know of the nature and purposes of the CIA activities in the country.", "Senator Marty said that the authorities \u201cmust have known that the CIA had used their territory for transfers of prisoners in the context of the war on terror\u201d. Mr J.G.S. stated that \u201cquite clearly, categorically the Romanian authorities, at the highest level, did know of the existence of secret detention on their territory\u201d and that \u201cthey were aware of the precise purpose of the rendition flights entering and exiting the country, and the conditions, or roughly the conditions, under which the detainees were held in between their arrivals and their departures\u201d. Mr Hammarberg stated that \u201cthough the operations were conducted under extreme secrecy, it is obvious that the CIA plane could not land with its cargo and depart without agreement from high-level Romanian decision makers\u201d. Mr Black said that it was \u201cclear that the authorities were aware of [the purposes of the CIA aircraft landings in Romania] because, among other things, they received money for it\u201d and that, based on the 2014 US Senate Committee Report, it was \u201cnormally common practice ... that the host country\u2019s officials were in the know about these facilities and the purposes of them\u201d (see paragraphs 344, 380, 384 and 391 above).", "This did not mean, the experts added, that the Romanian authorities had known the details of what exactly went on inside Detention Site Black or witnessed treatment to which the CIA prisoners had been subjected in Romania. As in other countries hosting clandestine prisons, the operation of the site was entirely in the hands of the CIA and the interrogations had been exclusively the CIA\u2019s responsibility (see paragraphs 344, 380 and 384 above; see also Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 441; and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 443).", "588. However, in the Court\u2019s view, even if the Romanian authorities did not, or could not, have complete knowledge of the HVD Programme, the facts available to them, in particular those presented to them directly by their US partners, taken together with extensive and widely available information about torture, ill-treatment, abuse and harsh interrogation measures inflicted on terrorist suspects in US custody which in 2002-2005 circulated in the public domain, including the Romanian press (see paragraphs 579-582 above), enabled them to conjure up a reasonably accurate image of the CIA\u2019s activities and, more particularly, the treatment to which the CIA were likely to have subjected their prisoners in Romania.", "In that regard the Court would reiterate that in Al Nashiri v. Poland and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland it has found that already in 2002-2003 the public sources reported practices resorted to, or tolerated by, the US authorities that were manifestly contrary to the principles of the Convention. Consequently, the Romanian authorities had good reason to believe that a person detained under the CIA rendition and secret detention programme could be exposed to a serious risk of treatment contrary to those principles on Romanian territory.", "It further observes that it is \u2013 as previously found in respect of Poland \u2013 inconceivable that the rendition aircraft could have crossed the country\u2019s airspace, landing at and departing from its airports, that the CIA occupied the premises offered by the national authorities and transported detainees there, without the State authorities being informed of or involved in the preparation and execution of the HVD Programme on its territory. Nor can it stand to reason that activities of such a character and scale, possibly vital for the country\u2019s military and political interests, could have been undertaken on Romanian territory without Romania\u2019s knowledge and without the necessary authorisation and assistance being given at the appropriate level of the State authorities (see Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 441-442; and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 443-444).", "589. The Court accordingly finds it established beyond reasonable doubt that:", "(a) Romania knew of the nature and purposes of the CIA\u2019s activities on its territory at the material time.", "(b) Romania, by entering into an agreement with the CIA on hosting Detention Site Black, enabling the CIA to use its airspace and airports and to disguise the movements of rendition aircraft, providing logistics and services, securing the premises for the CIA and transportation of the CIA teams with detainees on land, cooperated in the preparation and execution of the CIA rendition, secret detention and interrogation operations on its territory.", "(c) Given its knowledge of the nature and purposes of the CIA\u2019s activities on its territory and its involvement in the execution of that programme, Romania knew that, by enabling the CIA to detain terrorist suspects on its territory, it was exposing them to a serious risk of treatment contrary to the Convention."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "2", "3", "5", "6", "8", "P6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1", "5-1", "6-1", "8-1", "P6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
