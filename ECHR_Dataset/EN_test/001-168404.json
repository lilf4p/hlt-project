A list of the applicants is set out in the appendix. All the applicants are nationals of Bosnia and Herzegovina and are represented by Ms T. Drobnjak, a lawyer practicing in Belgrade.", "2. The Serbian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) are represented by their Agent, Ms N. Plav\u0161i\u0107.", "3. Following its declaration of independence from the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) in March 1992, a brutal war broke out in Bosnia and Herzegovina. More than 100,000 people were killed and more than 2,000,000 others were displaced as a result of \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d or generalised violence. The following local forces were the main parties to the conflict: the ARBH (mostly made up of Bosniacs and loyal to the central authorities in Sarajevo), the HVO (mostly made up of Croats) and the VRS (mostly made up of Serbs). The conflict ended in December 1995 when the General Framework Agreement for Peace (\u201cthe Dayton Agreement\u201d) entered into force between Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (succeeded by Serbia in 2006).", "4. \u017depa, a town in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina, is situated some twelve kilometres from the border with Serbia. Before the war it had a population of less than 3,000, of whom the majority were Bosniacs. During the war, \u017depa was one of three Bosniac enclaves in eastern Bosnia surrounded by the VRS. In 1993 it was declared a \u201csafe area\u201d by the United Nations Security Council.", "5. In 1995, there were between 6,500 and 8,000 people living in \u017depa, of whom some two-thirds were displaced persons from other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.", "6. On 12 July 1995 the VRS attacked the \u017depa \u201csafe area\u201d, capturing it on 25 July. In the days that followed, several hundred Bosniacs \u2013 predominantly able-bodied men who had refused to surrender to VRS forces \u2013 managed to cross the border and flee into Serbia. The present applicants were among them.", "7. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "8. When \u017depa was captured by the VRS, the applicants crossed into Serbia from Bosnia and Herzegovina, hoping that they would be able to find refuge in a third country. They were discovered by the border guard of the VJ and taken to two detention camps. The applicants claim that they received notification that they had prisoner-of-war status; it would appear that some of them were indeed members of ARBH but some were civilians. The first camp, \u0160ljivovica, was situated in the municipality of \u010cajetina and the second, Mitrovo Polje, in the municipality of Aleksandrovac, both in Serbia. The \u0160ljivovica detention camp was located in an abandoned workers\u2019 barracks and the Mitrovo Polje camp in a former children\u2019s recreational facility.", "9. During their existence the camps were visited by representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the State Commission for Missing Persons of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The latter compiled a report in which it found that the conditions of detention were disturbing.", "10. Between January and April 1996 the UNHCR facilitated the transfer of the camps\u2019 detainees to third countries and the camps were closed in April 1996.", "11. On 6 September 2011 the Humanitarian Law Centre (Fond za humanitarno pravo), a Belgrade-based NGO, lodged a criminal complaint on behalf of the applicants with the Office of the War Crimes Prosecutor of Serbia against more than 50 individuals for alleged war crimes. In the criminal complaint it was alleged that, when the applicants were discovered at the Serbian border, the army and the police had used force against them and transported them to the aforementioned camps. Both camps had been guarded by officers of the Serbian police force and none of the applicants had been allowed to leave them. According to the applicants, during the time they spent in the camps they had been regularly verbally abused, taken to mock executions, kicked and punched, and beaten with fists, batons, cables, shovels and metal rods. Some of the applicants had had burning cigarettes held against their skin, had been forced to drink water mixed with motor oil and some had also been sexually abused (in particular, some of the applicants had been forced to perform sexual acts on each other). The applicants who had been suspected of being members of the ARBH had suffered particularly harsh treatment and had been forced to engage in mutual fights, look directly into the sun, move heavy rocks and had been denied medical assistance.", "12. In its criminal complaint the Humanitarian Law Centre submitted statements by the camps\u2019 detainees, medical documentation, documentation from the International Committee of the Red Cross and the State Commission for Missing Persons of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and other evidence. Amongst those who were alleged to have taken part in torture, the Centre identified members of the State Security Agency of Serbia, police officers, and military servicemen of various ranks.", "13. On 23 September 2011 the Office of the War Crimes Prosecutor undertook preliminary verification of the information submitted by the applicants and requested that the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Defence submit information regarding the criminal complaint.", "14. On 17 November 2011 and 2 December 2011 the Ministry of Interior submitted two reports to the Office. In their reports it was stated that the situation in the camps had been generally good, that the camps had not been enclosed behind a fence, and that residents who were given refugee status had had access to health services, a canteen, a post office, a phone, a bank, and both private visits and visits by officials from international organisations. While one of the reports describes the conditions in \u0160ljivovica camp as unsatisfactory, the conditions in Mitrovo Polje were described as lodgings with the quality of \u201chotel accommodation\u201d.", "15. On 1 March 2013 the Office of the War Crimes Prosecutor notified the Humanitarian Law Centre that it did not find any grounds for initiating criminal investigation since the alleged acts could not be classified as war crimes or any other crime under the jurisdiction of the Office of the War Crimes Prosecutor. On 8 April 2013 the applicants lodged a constitutional appeal before the Constitutional Court of Serbia claiming violations of Articles 2, 3 and 6 of the Convention. On 4 February 2014 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicants\u2019 constitutional appeal as incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Constitution, finding that the notification in question was not an act which was decisive with respect to the applicants\u2019 human rights.", "16. On 13 June 2014 Belgrade Court of Appeal, acting upon a civil action for damages brought by two of the applicants, Enes Bogilovi\u0107 and Mu\u0161an D\u017eebo, delivered a final judgment in civil proceedings in which it found that the applicants in question had suffered \u201cintensive torture and inhumane treatment\u201d and that the \u201capplicants survived what was without a doubt the harshest suffering an individual [could] experience\u201d. The court further described the actions of the guards towards the two applicants and other detainees as \u201cconduct ... hardly worthy of a human being\u201d. Each plaintiff was awarded 300,000 Serbian dinars (RSD) in non-pecuniary damage.", "17. The decision of the Constitutional Court was delivered to the applicants\u2019 representative on 2 July 2014.", "18.
