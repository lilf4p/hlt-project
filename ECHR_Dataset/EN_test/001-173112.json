According to the applicants, on an unspecified date shortly afterwards she underwent a complex kidney operation and had to stay with her sons, who provided her with the necessary care after her surgery. Sometime in 2001 she lost her passport and became stateless. At a later date the first applicant had another kidney operation, meaning she required constant care, which was provided by her family.", "7.

The applicants appealed against the expulsion order to the Stavropol Regional Court. They pointed out that they were long-term migrants and that their sons and other members of their family lived in Russia.
