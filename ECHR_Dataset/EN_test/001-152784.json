The applicants were born in 1975, 1987, 1961, 1968, 1973 and 1984, respectively. When introducing the applications, they were detained in prisons in Baracska, Szolnok, Budapest, Sopronk\u0151hida, P\u00e1lhalma and Szeged, respectively.", "6. On 31 December 2013 the Hungarian prisons accommodated altogether 18,042 inmates (that is, an overcrowding rate of 144 %), out of which 5,053 people were in pre-trial detention.", "7. Mr Varga was held at Baracska Prison which, he claimed, was severely overcrowded at the time of his detention lasting from 17 January to 3 September 2011. In particular, the cell in which he was detained measured 30 square metres and accommodated seventeen prisoners (that is, 1.76 square metres gross living space per inmate). The quality and quantity of the food provided were poor, as a result of which he claimed to have lost 20 kilograms.", "From 4 July 2011 he was kept in solitary confinement for eleven days as a disciplinary measure. He submitted that he was kept in a cell of some eight square metres and in poor sanitary conditions, without adequate running water. This led to problems of hygiene and a skin infection, for which he did not receive adequate treatment. Throughout this confinement he had outdoor stays of only 30 minutes a day.", "8. Mr Lakatos was held from 20 January 2011 until an unspecified date in the spring of 2012 at Hajd\u00fa-Bihar County Prison in a cell that measured nine square metres and accommodated three inmates including him (that is, three square metres gross living space per inmate). As of spring 2012, he was transferred to J\u00e1sz-Nagykun-Szolnok County Prison where he has been held in a cell measuring nine square metres and housing four inmates including him (that is, 2.25 square metres gross living space per inmate). He claimed that at the latter facility there was no ventilation and the toilet was only separated from the living area by a curtain, offering insufficient privacy.", "9. Mr T\u00f3th was placed in pre-trial detention on 7 April 2010. On 10 April 2010 he was transferred to Hajd\u00fa-Bihar County Prison where he was held until 18 January 2012 in a cell of about ten square metres together with three other detainees (that is, 2.5 square metres gross living space per inmate). Only a curtain was used as a partition between the toilet and the living area.", "He was subsequently transferred to Budapest Prison (Budapesti Fegyh\u00e1z \u00e9s B\u00f6rt\u00f6n) where the cell in which he was held between 18 January 2012 and 18 January 2014 was about ten square metres in size; he shared it with two other inmates (that is, 3.33 square metres gross living space per inmate).", "Since 18 January 2014 he has been detained with seven other detainees in a cell measuring 25 square metres (that is, 3.13 square metres gross living space per inmate). He claimed that the toilet is separated only by a curtain from the living area. The bed linen is changed only once every five or six weeks.", "10. The applicant started to serve his prison sentence in 2009 at M\u00e1rianosztra Prison. He shared his cell with eight to ten inmates and the surface available was 25.7 square metres (that is, a maximum of 2.86 square metres gross living space per inmate).", "On 6 December 2012 he was transferred to Sopronk\u0151hida Prison where his cell measures 6.2 square metres and is occupied by him and another man (that is, 3.1 square metres gross living space per inmate).", "11. On 27 October 2011 Mr Fak\u00f3 was placed in pre-trial detention at Budapest Correctional Facility (F\u0151v\u00e1rosi B\u00fcntet\u00e9s-v\u00e9grehajt\u00e1si Int\u00e9zet).

Without specifying the size of the cell, he submitted that the gross living space per person varied between 1.5 and 2.2 square metres.", "He had a daily one-hour-long outdoor exercise and spent the remainder of his time in the cell. He submitted that in 2013 the summer temperature in the cell rose to 40\u02daC because of poor ventilation. He asserted that he was allowed to take a shower once a week for no longer than five minutes each time. Furthermore, the cell was infected with bed bugs, lice and cockroaches, but the prison administration did not address this issue.", "12. From 12 December 2006 Mr Kapcz\u00e1r has served his sentence at Szeged Prison. Throughout his detention he has been held in fourteen different cells.

Furthermore, some of the bunk beds had been welded together, so detainees were obliged to sleep right next to each other."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
