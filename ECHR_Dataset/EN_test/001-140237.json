The applicant was born in 1965 and, at the material time, lived in \u017dilina.", "6. On 26 June 2009 the applicant went to the offices of the Asylum Authority in Gbely with the intention of applying for asylum in Slovakia. From there, he was escorted to the Foreigners Police Department in Bratislava, where he arrived at about 3 p.m.", "7. Following questioning on the same day, that is to say on 26 June 2009, the Foreigners Police Department decided to detain (zaistenie) the applicant, finding, inter alia, that he was staying in Slovakia without a valid travel document or any legal entitlement, and in spite of a previous decision expelling him from Slovakia and banning him from returning there for five years.", "8. Under the detention order of 26 June 2009, the applicant was detained in the Alien Detention Centre in Medve\u010fov.", "9. On 16 July 2009 the Trnava Regional Court (Krajsk\u00fd s\u00fad) received a submission dated 13 July 2009 in which the applicant applied for judicial review of the order of 26 June 2009, challenging the assessment of the facts and the interpretation and application of the law by the police.", "10. On 13 August 2009 the Regional Court held a hearing at which the applicant was not present in person but was represented by his lawyer. At the conclusion of the hearing, on the same day and in the presence of the applicants\u2019 lawyer, the Regional Court dismissed the claim.", "11. The written version of the judgment of 13 August 2009 was sent out on 27 August 2009 and served on the applicant on 7 September 2009.", "12. On 2 November 2009 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court (\u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad), relying on Article 127 of the Constitution (individual complaint) and Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention (speedy review of the lawfulness of detention), and complaining about the length of the proceedings in respect of his application dated 13 July 2009.", "13. On 16 December 2009 the Constitutional Court declared the complaint inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded.", "It observed, on the one hand, that the Regional Court had granted the police as long as fifteen days to submit observations in reply to the applicant\u2019s claim, which the Constitutional Court held to have been disproportionately long.", "However, overall, the decision-making process in respect of the applicant\u2019s claim had lasted only twenty-nine days, and not thirty-one days, as argued by the applicant. On that account, the Constitutional Court observed that the period under consideration had not commenced until 16 July 2009 \u2013 when the applicant\u2019s submission had reached the Regional Court \u2013 and that it ended on 13 August 2009, when the applicant had learned of the Regional Court\u2019s judgment through his lawyer.", "The written version of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision was served on the applicant on 21 January 2010.", "14.

On 3 November 2009 the Supreme Court quashed the impugned judgment and remitted the matter to the Regional Court for re-examination, having found that the latter had neither established all the relevant facts nor dealt properly with some of the applicant\u2019s material objections.", "17. On 19 January 2010 the Regional Court ruled anew on the applicant\u2019s application dated 13 July 2009 by quashing the order of 26 June 2009 and remitting the matter to the Foreigners Police Department for a new decision on the grounds that they had failed both to establish and properly to assess all the relevant facts. The decision was served on the applicant on 19 February 2013."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
