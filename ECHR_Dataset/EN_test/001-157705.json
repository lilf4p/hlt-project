According to the notice, the assembly was scheduled to take place from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. on 19 June 2011 at the square in front of the Narimanov Cinema in Baku.", "7. The BCEA refused to authorise the holding of the demonstration at the place indicated by the organisers and proposed another location on the outskirts of Baku.", "8. Nevertheless, the organisers decided to hold the demonstration in one of the central areas of Baku, namely, near the Puppet Theatre on Seaside Boulevard.", "9. According to the applicant, the demonstration was intended to be peaceful and was conducted in a peaceful manner. The participants were demanding free and fair elections, democratic reforms, freedom of assembly, and the release of persons arrested during some previous demonstrations.", "10. The applicant attended the demonstration, but shortly after it had started the police started to disperse it. The applicant was arrested at around 6.10 p.m. during the dispersal operation. He claimed that he had been arrested and taken to a police car by plain-clothed persons. According to the official records, he was arrested by police officers Z.H. and J.M. He was taken to police station No. 9 of the Sabail District Police Office.", "11. Police officers Z.H. and J.M. stated the following in a report (raport) submitted to a superior police officer:", "\u201c... at around 6.10 p.m. we were on duty ... when Mammadov Gafgaz Suleyman oglu, whose identity was established later, was attempting to hold an unlawful demonstration. We demanded that he stop his illegal actions, [he] deliberately disobeyed [and] continued his actions, and for that reason we brought him to the [police station] ...\u201d", "12. According to the applicant, he was questioned at the police station.", "13. At 6.50 p.m. on the day of the arrest, an \u201cadministrative-offence report\u201d (inzibati x\u0259ta haqq\u0131nda protokol) was issued by police officer H.H. in respect of the applicant. The report stated that by deliberately failing to comply with the lawful order of the police during the demonstration, the applicant had committed an administrative offence under Article 310.1 of the Code of Administrative Offences (\u201cthe CAO\u201d).", "14. The applicant refused to sign the report, which contained a preprinted text declaring that \u201c[the arrested person] was familiarised with the report, the reasons for his or her arrest and his or her rights under Articles 371, 400.2, 401.1.6, 401.1.7 of the CAO of the Republic of Azerbaijan were explained\u201d.", "15.

On 20 June 2011, the day after his arrest, the applicant was brought before the Sabail District Court.", "18. According to the applicant, he refused the assistance of a Statefunded lawyer and insisted on hiring a lawyer of his own choice, but the judge disregarded his request. His representation by that lawyer was ineffective and of a formalistic nature. The hearing was very brief and members of the public, including human rights defenders and journalists, were not allowed to attend, even though the court had not taken a formal decision to close the hearing to the public.", "19. The applicant stated before the court that he was not guilty of disobeying a lawful order of a police officer and that he had participated in the demonstration because he had a constitutional right to freedom of assembly.", "20. According to the record of the hearing provided by the Government, in response to the judge\u2019s question whether the police officers, before arresting him, had issued a relevant notice about dispersal of the demonstration, the applicant gave the following answer:", "\u201cThere were a lot of police officers and they were demanding that we disperse. But their demand was not lawful because we were exercising our right. Instead of calling on us to disperse, the responsibility of the police should have been to ensure our security.\u201d", "21. The only witness questioned during the court hearing was police officer Z.H., who testified as follows:", "\u201cAt around 6.10 p.m. on 19 June 2011 ... we noticed that [the applicant], together with a group of other people, was attempting to hold an unauthorised demonstration by shouting out slogans, and ... asked them to observe silence. However, [the applicant] continued his actions, disobeying our requests ...\u201d", "22. According to the record of the hearing, the State-funded lawyer stated that the applicant was not guilty and asked the court to take into consideration the applicant\u2019s age and the fact that he had children.", "23. The court found that the applicant had failed to stop participating in the unauthorised demonstration. The court convicted him under Article 310.1 of the CAO and sentenced him to five days\u2019 \u201cadministrative\u201d detention.", "24. The applicant lodged an appeal before the Baku Court of Appeal, arguing that his conviction was in violation of his rights because the demonstration in which he had participated had been peaceful. He also complained that his arrest had been unlawful and that the hearing before the first-instance court had not been fair. He urged the Baku Court of Appeal to quash the first-instance court\u2019s decision.", "25. The applicant was represented before the Baku Court of Appeal by a lawyer of his own choice.", "26. On 24 June 2011 the Baku Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal and upheld the decision of the first-instance court, stating that its findings had been correct."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["11", "5", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["11-1", "5-1", "6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-b", "6-3-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
