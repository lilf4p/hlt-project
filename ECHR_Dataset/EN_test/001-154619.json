The body was identified as A, the applicants\u2019 respective husband and father. A tooth was found on the body. An autopsy was carried out and it was established that A had been struck several times on the back of his head with a hard object, and this had caused his death. On the same day the police lodged a criminal complaint with the X State Attorney\u2019s Office in respect of the killing of A by unknown perpetrators.", "5.

On 6 December 1991 the police interviewed C, a Croatian soldier who had been present at the wedding reception in Y on 23 November 1991. He said that he had spotted A next to the van in which he and some of his friends had come to the wedding, and had seen that A was noting down the licence plate numbers of the van and of another vehicle parked near-by. C had called his colleagues, D, E and F, and they had forced A into the van and driven to the outskirts of X, where they stopped under a bridge. They had taken A out of the van and D had told him to climb onto a river bank; A had refused. A commotion had ensued, in the course of which A had hit C in the mouth and kicked his tooth out. D, E and F had then continued to strike A. E had taken a metal implement from the van. C took it from him and struck A, killing him. C had pushed A\u2019s body into the river and had then thrown the metal implement into the river.", "11. On the same day the police interviewed D, E and F.

The investigating judge opened an investigation in respect of C, D, E and F in connection with the killing of A.", "14. During the investigation an opinion was commissioned from a dental expert. He established that the tooth found on A\u2019s body did not belong to any of the suspects. In their further statements during the investigation C, D and E denied the charges against them while F remained silent.", "15.

An official note was drafted about that meeting, but no formal decision was taken upon the first applicant\u2019s request.", "21. The first applicants\u2019 request was forwarded to the X State Attorney\u2019s Office, which dismissed it on 16 April 2010 on the basis that proceedings in respect of the same facts had already been terminated.

The first applicant complied with the said instruction and on 27 April 2010 submitted the request for an investigation to the X County Court. It was dismissed on 15 December 2010 on the same ground as the one provided by the State Attorney\u2019s Office, i.e. that it concerned the same facts as the indictment from 1992 in respect of which the proceedings had been terminated and that a fresh trial would be in violation of the ne bis in idem principle.", "23.

On 23 September 2014 the State Attorney\u2019s Office retrieved the case-file concerning the investigation into A\u2019s killing from its Archives.
