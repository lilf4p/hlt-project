LITHUANIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Administrative proceedings;Article 6-1 - Fair hearing)", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3;Egidijus K\u016bris;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Nona Tsotsoria;Vincent A. De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["5. The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Vilnius.", "6. The applicant owned a 0.53 hectare plot of land in the village of Tarailiai (Taurag\u0117 region). In 2005 he submitted a request to the local authorities to change the classification of the land from agricultural to residential use. In accordance with the domestic law, such a request had first to be granted by the municipal council and then approved by the county administration.", "7. Taurag\u0117 District Municipal Council granted the applicant\u2019s request and prepared a detailed area plan (detalusis planas) (hereinafter \u201cthe plan\u201d). The plan was subsequently submitted for approval to the Taurag\u0117 County Administration (hereinafter \u201cthe TCA\u201d). However, on 25 November 2005 the TCA refused to approve the plan on the ground that it had not been prepared in accordance with the domestic laws governing the planning process.", "8. The applicant submitted a complaint to the State Inspectorate for Planning and Construction (hereinafter \u201cthe Inspectorate\u201d), which was the competent institution for out-of-court settlement of disputes arising from the planning process. On 10 August 2006 the Inspectorate held that the TCA\u2019s refusal to approve the plan had been unfounded.", "9. After the Inspectorate\u2019s decision, Taurag\u0117 District Municipal Council re-submitted the plan to the TCA. However, on 13 November 2006 the TCA informed the council and the applicant that it would not review its previous decision to refuse approval.", "10. On 22 December 2006 the Inspectorate notified the TCA that its refusal to approve the plan had been unfounded and urged it to review that decision. It appears that the TCA did not take any action in that respect.", "11. In January 2007 the applicant lodged a claim with the Klaip\u0117da Regional Administrative Court. He asked the court to order the TCA to approve the plan. Following the court\u2019s suggestion, in April 2007 the applicant added a request to annul the TCA\u2019s decision of 25 November 2005.", "12. On 4 May 2007 the Klaip\u0117da Regional Administrative Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s claims. The court held that county administration\u2019s decisions on approval of detailed area plans were valid for one year after their adoption. If the plan had not been adopted within that time, the decision became invalid and the plan had to be re-submitted for approval. Therefore, the court found that the TCA\u2019s decision of 25 November 2005 was no longer valid and could not have any effect on the applicant\u2019s situation. The court stated that it had no competence to examine the lawfulness of an invalid act and dismissed the claim. It also held that, as a result, there was no need to examine the applicant\u2019s remaining claims.", "13. The applicant appealed against that judgment. He complained, inter alia, that the first instance court had not examined his original request \u2013 to order the TCA to approve the plan.", "14. On 15 February 2008 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the applicant\u2019s appeal and returned the case for re-examination by the firstinstance court. The Supreme Administrative Court noted that when a county administration refused to approve a detailed area plan, that plan could be re-submitted only after the errors indicated in the refusal had been corrected. However, if the author of the plan disagreed with the indicated errors, he or she would effectively be denied access to court if the proceedings lasted longer than a year. The court also noted that the applicant\u2019s original request had been to order the TCA to approve the plan and that the first-instance court had not made any findings in that respect.", "15. On 16 October 2008 the Klaip\u0117da Regional Administrative Court, after re-examining the case, again decided to dismiss the applicant\u2019s claims. The court held that decisions of the Inspectorate, taken during the out-of-court settlement procedure, were mandatory for county administrations (see paragraph 20 below). Accordingly, the Inspectorate\u2019s decisions of 10 August 2006 and 22 December 2006 had repealed the TCA\u2019s decision of 25 November 2005. As a result, the TCA\u2019s refusal to approve the plan was no longer valid and the court had no competence to examine its lawfulness. The court also held that, as a result, there was no need to examine the applicant\u2019s remaining claims.", "16. The applicant appealed against that judgment, again complaining that the first-instance court had not examined his request to order the TCA to approve the plan, and that it had not followed the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s judgment of 15 February 2008 (see paragraph 14 above).", "17. On 12 December 2008 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal. It upheld the lower court\u2019s findings that the TCA\u2019s decision had been repealed by the Inspectorate and that courts had no competence to examine invalid acts. The Supreme Administrative Court then held that the applicant\u2019s request to order the TCA to approve the plan was \u201cderived\u201d (i\u0161vestinis) from the request to annul the TCA\u2019s decision; having dismissed the latter, there was therefore no need to examine the former request either. Lastly the court noted that the applicant had not requested that the court order the TCA to comply with the Inspectorate\u2019s decisions, so it would make no findings in that respect.", "18. In 2010, following a national administrative reform, all county administrations were abolished and their planning powers were transferred to the Inspectorate. The applicant then submitted a new request to change the classification of his land and it was approved by all the relevant authorities. The classification of the land was changed to residential use in February 2012."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
