According to this second account of events, there had been a verbal confrontation between the applicant and Mrs Sh. on 29 July 2002 in the yard of the latter\u2019s house, during which no injuries had been inflicted on the applicant. It was noted in the decision that numerous witnesses had been questioned, facetoface interrogations had been held and forensic medical examinations had been carried out.

Mr Sh. called the police, but the applicant and her husband had left before they arrived.

He ordered specifically that it be established in the course of the reconstruction whether the witnesses (including T. and B.) could in fact have been able to observe the incident from the street outside the yard, as claimed by them. In a later decision, of 8 December 2004, a senior prosecutor from the Ternopil Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office noted, inter alia, the need to also question the ambulance personnel who had conveyed the applicant to the emergency unit on 30 July 2002.", "28.
