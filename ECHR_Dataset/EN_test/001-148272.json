The applicant was born in 1941 and lives in Kadzid\u0142o.", "5. The applicant\u2019s parents owned land within the administrative borders of Warsaw. It was expropriated by way of an administrative decision issued on an unspecified date under the provisions of the Decree on Ownership and Use of Land in Warsaw of 26 October 1945. In February 1949 the applicant\u2019s legal predecessor requested to be granted a right of perpetual use (u\u017cytkowanie wieczyste) for another plot of land situated in Warsaw as compensation provided for by the provisions of the 1945 Decree. His request was dismissed by way of an administrative decision given in 1961 and ultimately upheld in 1968.", "A judicial decision given in 1975 confirmed that the applicant was his parents\u2019 general heir.", "6. On 16 July 1993 the applicant requested that the decision given in 1961 be declared null and void.", "7. On 20 September 1994 the Minister of Construction and Land Planning (Minister of Gospodarki Przestrzennej and Budownictwa) gave a decision. It noted that in 1961 the authorities had failed to examine whether the substantive conditions for granting the owners the right of perpetual use of the land specified in section 7 of the 1945 Decree (see paragraph 46 below) had been met at that time. He declared, referring to Article 156 \u00a7 1 item 2 of the Code of Administrative Procedure (CAP) (see paragraph 39 below), that decision null and void in so far as it related to the part of the land concerned which was used as family gardens. In so far as this decision related to the part of the land which had already been used for construction purposes, he considered that the contested decision had given rise to irrevocable legal consequences within the meaning of Article 156 \u00a7 2 of the CAP (see paragraph 41 below). Therefore under Article 158 \u00a7 2 he could merely declare that it had been issued contrary to law within the meaning of this provision.", "8.

On 3 March 1995 the applicant complained to the Minister of Construction and Land Planning about the authorities\u2019 failure to give a decision in his case.", "12. On 7 September 1995 the Minister of Minister of Construction and Land Planning stayed the compensation proceedings instituted by the applicant under Article 160 of the Code of Administrative Procedure (see paragraphs 29-33 below). He observed that the decision given on 20 September 1994 (see paragraph 7 above) made it necessary in law to reexamine the former owners\u2019 request for grant of the right to perpetual use submitted in 1949 and that it created a compensation claim for the applicant. It referred to the applicant as \u201cthe claim\u2019s owner\u201d (w\u0142a\u015bciciel roszczenia).", "13.

On 13 December 2004 the Warsaw Town Hall (Urz\u0105d m. st.

On 14 July 2011 and 27 September 2012, respectively, the Warsaw Regional Administrative Court rejected his complaints for failure to comply with the applicable procedural requirements.

The applicant appealed.", "31.
