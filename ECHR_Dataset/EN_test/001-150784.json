On 17 January 2005 the Academy lodged an application for supervisory-review with the Presidium of the Court of the Khanty-Mansy Autonomous Region (\u201cthe Presidium\u201d).

On 12 May 2006 the Presidium amended the judgments of 17 January and of 5 April 2005 as to the applicant\u2019s immediate reinstatement. The Presidium found that in accordance with Article 81 \u00a7 4 of the Labour Code in case of the liquidation of a branch of an organisation located in another territory the termination of contracts of its employees is governed by the rules applicable to the liquidation of organisations. In accordance with point 60 of the Ruling of the Plenum of the Supreme Court no. 2 of 17 March 2004, if it is not possible to reinstate an unlawfully dismissed employee because of the liquidation of the organisation, the court finds that the dismissal was unlawful and holds that he was dismissed in accordance with Article 81 \u00a7 1 of the Labour Code as a result of the liquidation of the organisation. In view of the above, the Presidium concluded that the lower courts incorrectly applied the substantive law and amended their judgments in the part concerning the applicant\u2019s immediate reinstatement by declaring that he should be considered as dismissed as a result of the liquidation of the employer organisation as from 17 January 2005 and that there was no need to send the matter to a new consideration. The Presidium rejected the remainder of the Academy\u2019s supervisory-review application."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
