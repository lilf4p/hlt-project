In a final decision of 15 March 2006 the criminal section of the High Court of Cassation and Justice dismissed the appeal lodged by the applicant, as it considered that the lower courts had correctly established the facts of the case and classified the crimes in law. It reiterated the arguments advanced by the Military Court of Appeal concerning the claims raised by the applicant in his previous appeal. It also considered that the evidence in the file was sufficient to secure the applicant\u2019s conviction and that there were no doubts that could have been clarified by statements from B.V.
