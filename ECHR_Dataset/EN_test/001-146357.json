UKRAINE", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Remainder inadmissible;Violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8-1 - Respect for family life;Respect for home;Respect for private life);Non-pecuniary damage - award", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Ann Power-Forde;Ganna Yudkivska;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["6. The applicant was born in 1961 and lives in the village of Tatariv, which forms part of Yaremche, a resort town in the Ivano-Frankivsk Region of Ukraine.", "7. The applicant owns a house and an adjacent plot of land in Tatariv. The village of Tatariv is situated in a mountainous region and because of its location holds the status of mountainous residential area. It is also known as a resort for \u201cgreen tourism\u201d in Carpathy region. It is situated on the banks of Prut river.", "8. On 10 February 2000 Tatariv Village Council (\u201cTatariv Council\u201d), having considered four sites on which to construct a new cemetery, chose the land previously occupied by garages belonging to a company called Vorokhtya Lisokombinat (\u201cthe VL plot\u201d) as it was not occupied, it was located in the village and the cemetery could be constructed at low cost.", "9. The VL plot is located near the applicant\u2019s house (for further details see paragraphs 14 and 33 below), in which he was residing with his family at the time. Two rivers flow at a distance of 30 and 70 metres from the VL plot. Drinking water for Tatariv comes from wells fed by groundwater; there is no centralised water supply system and the wells are not protected.", "10. On 24 May 2000 the All-Ukrainian Bureau of Environmental Investigations informed the Chairman of Yaremche Town Council (\u201cYaremche Council\u201d) that the construction of the cemetery on the VL plot might cause contamination of the river and the wells situated on adjacent plots of land by ptomaine carried by the groundwater flow.", "11. The cemetery was opened for use by the Yaremche Council in August 2000. It is being administered by the Yaremche Council.", "12. On 6 February 2001 the Yaremche Environmental Health Inspectorate (\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0456\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e-\u0435\u043f\u0456\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0456\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0456\u0447\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0456\u044f) concluded that the cemetery should not have been constructed on the VL plot in view of its proximity to residential buildings and the risk of contamination of the surrounding environment by ptomaine.", "13. On 20 August 2002 the Regional Environmental Health Inspectorate of the Ministry of Health refused to approve the construction plan. In particular, it stated that the cemetery should not be situated in the proposed area as its distance from private housing did not comply with the norms and standards of a health protection zone (\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0456\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e-\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0438\u0441\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u043e\u043d\u0430).", "14. On 30 August 2002 and 20 January 2003 the Marzeyev Institute of Hygiene and Medical Ecology, part of the Academy of Medical Sciences, informed the applicant and Yaremche Council that another location would have to be found for the cemetery. It was of the view that constructing the cemetery on the VL plot would breach environmental health laws and regulations and would worsen the living conditions of the residents of adjacent houses. In particular, it would be located less than 300 metres from the nearest residential buildings, which are 38 metres away from the edge of the cemetery (which would not allow for the establishment of the necessary health protection zone). It could lead to contamination of the groundwater reservoir used by the residents of adjacent households for drinking water and of the nearby rivers with by-products of human decomposition. It further stated that a health protection zone was also intended to reduce psychological pressure on the residents of adjacent houses.", "15. The applicant alleges that from 2002 to the present moment he has been receiving treatment for hypertension and various cardio-related diseases. He supplied in this respect sick leave certificates and medical certificates from 2002 and 2006, relating to him and his wife. He has also provided the Court with death certificates for two of his neighbours Mr R.G. and Mr D.B., who also resided in the vicinity of the prohibited cemetery and died at the age of 68 and 43, respectively.", "16. On 17 September 2002 the Ivano-Frankivsk Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office informed the applicant that it could not intervene in respect of unauthorised burials taking place on the VL plot: the issue was in the competence of local authorities, including the Yaremche Council, which was responsible for management and maintenance of the cemetery.", "17. On 22 April 2003 the Executive Board of Yaremche Council informed the Regional State Administration that Tatariv Council was considering resettling the applicant. He had twice been invited to discuss a proposal for resettlement of his family to another part of the village but no response had been received.", "18. On 5 May 2003 the Regional Urban Development and Architecture Department (\u201cthe Urban Development Department\u201d) informed Yaremche and Tatariv Councils that the area near the applicant\u2019s house was not suitable for construction of the cemetery as it did not respect a 300-metre wide health protection zone that would protect the residential buildings and a 50-metre wide water protection zone to protect the Prutets river.", "19. On 18 May 2003 the Tatariv Council resolved inter alia that the relevant local authorities were prepared to consider the purchase of a house or apartment for the applicant, or to pay him compensation if he refused to reside in the cemetery\u2019s vicinity.", "20. On 21 April 2004 the issue of the site of the cemetery was examined by officials from the Urban Development Department, the Municipal Housing Department, the environmental health inspectorate and the Land Management Department. They recommended to the Chairman of Tatariv Council that another plot on the outskirts of the village of \u201cVentarivka\u201d be used as a cemetery.", "21. On 22 June 2005 the Regional State Administration informed the applicant that the only way to resolve the issue was to resettle him. They asked him to agree to such a resettlement. They also confirmed that Yaremche Council was willing either to buy a house for the applicant or to provide him with an equivalent plot of land and the funds necessary to construct another house", "22. On 18 July 2005 the Chairman of Yaremche Council invited the applicant to inform the authorities whether his family was willing to resettle and, if so, on what conditions.", "23. In reply, the applicant sought more information on the proposal, such as, details of the specific land plot, house and facilities to be provided.", "24. By letter of 27 July 2005 the Chairman of Yaremche Council, in reply to the applicant\u2019s request for specific proposals, invited the applicant to discuss the proposal in person with a view to a possible compromise.", "25. On 15 August 2005 the Chairman of Tatariv Council asked the Ukrainian State Urban Planning Institute (\u0414\u043d\u0456\u043f\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0456\u0441\u0442\u043e \u2013 \u201cthe Institute\u201d) to develop proposals for the site of a cemetery in the village.", "26. On 21 December 2005 the Institute informed the applicant that it was not within its competence to decide matters such as the question of where to situate the cemetery. It also mentioned that the local development plan for Tatariv proposed a plot in the Chertizh area for the cemetery. However, this was subject to approval by the local council and environmental health inspectorate. It also informed the applicant that no letter of 15 August 2005 with proposals to investigate possible site of the cemetery (see paragraph 25 above) had been received from Tatariv Council.", "27. By letter of 6 March 2006 addressed to the applicant and the Chairman of Tatariv Council, the Urban Development Department stated that it had repeatedly proposed to Tatariv Council that it use an area called Venterivka for the site of the cemetery. However, the council had not taken up that suggestion for unspecified reasons. It also informed the applicant that it was within Tatariv Council\u2019s competence to decide on the allocation of a plot of land for a cemetery.", "28. On several occasions between August 2006 and June 2008 the applicant and members of his family, who resided together, asked Tatariv Council to grant each of them a plot of land on which to construct a house because they felt that living in the cemetery\u2019s vicinity was intolerable. Tatariv Council rejected the requests because of a lack of available plots of land.", "29. According to the results of examinations of drinking water from the applicant\u2019s well conducted by the Yaremche Environmental Health Inspectorate dated 21 August 2008 and 7 July 2009, the toxicological, chemical and organoleptic indices of the water complied with national standards (no E. coli index examination had been made). A conclusion was reached that water could be used for household needs.", "30. On 23 August 2008 and 6 July 2009 the Yaremche Environmental Health Inspectorate carried out a bacteriological analysis of the water from the same well. It established, contrary to the results of the examinations held on 21 August 2008 and 7 July 2009 (see paragraph 29 above) that the E. coli bacteria index in the water gave a reading of 2,380, whereas the normal reading was 10 (see paragraph 72 below), and concluded that the water could not be used for household needs. It also recommended disinfecting the water supply. The cause of water pollution was not established and would require an additional expert report.", "31. On 14 December 2009 in response to a request from the Government, the Yaremche Environmental Health Inspectorate concluded that the reading obtained from the bacteriological analysis which had indicated water contamination did not have any connection to the location of the cemetery, but could also have been caused by other sources.", "32. On 15 December 2009 the Regional Environmental Health Inspectorate informed the applicant that the reasons for the bacterial contamination of the water supply could be established on the basis of a hydrogeological assessment as to whether there were any connections between the drinking water reservoirs and possible sources of contamination. It further stated that according to an analysis of water taken from different parts of the village, the E. coli index exceeded the allowed reading established by law, which provided that drinking water should not contain any index of E. coli or be less than 1 in that index per 100 cm3 (see paragraph 72 in relation to the domestic drinking water standards), nevertheless the E. coli index ranged from 23 to 2,380.", "33. The applicant\u2019s house and well are some 38 metres from the nearest boundary of the cemetery.", "34. By letters of 10, 15 and 16 December 2009 from the Tarariv Council, Yaremche Executive Committee and the Ivano-Frankivsk Regional State Administration, the authorities informed the Government\u2019s agent that the applicant had failed to manifest any interest in being resettled.", "35. On 10 August 2000 the Verkhovyna Court, following the applicant\u2019s claim in proceedings against the Tatariv Council, held that the Council\u2019s decision to situate the cemetery on the VL plot had been unlawful.", "36. At the end of August 2000 residents of Tatariv carried out the first burial at the cemetery.", "37. On 1 December 2000 the Yaremche Court, in another set of new proceedings, found that Tatariv Council had failed to follow the proper procedure for the allocation of a plot of land for a cemetery, namely obtaining an environmental health assessment, and ordered it to prohibit burials on the VL plot.", "38. On 24 December 2000 the residents of Tatariv were informed of the court\u2019s decision to stop the use of the VL plot as a cemetery. Nevertheless, burials continued at the site.", "39. On 29 December 2000 Tatariv Council prohibited burials on the VL plot. On 2 February 2001 the State Bailiffs\u2019 Service terminated enforcement proceedings in the case, considering that the judgment had been fully complied with by the Tatariv Council.", "40. On 2 March 2001 Tatariv Council again decided that the VL plot could be used for the new village cemetery. On 26 March 2001 the applicant lodged a new claim against that decision with the Yaremche Court.", "41. In the meantime, on 22 August 2001 the Regional Environmental Health Inspectorate informed the relevant judge of the Yaremche Court, which assumed jurisdiction over the claims lodged on 26 March 2001 (see paragraph 40 above), that the site of the cemetery did not comply with national environmental health laws and regulations on the planning and construction of urban areas. In particular, the location did not comply with the requirement of a health protection zone between the cemetery and the nearest residential buildings.", "42. On 16 October 2001 the Yaremche Court declared Tatariv Council\u2019s decision of 2 March 2001 unlawful. On 17 April 2002 the Supreme Court upheld that judgment.", "43. On 25 December 2001 Tatariv Council cancelled its decision of 2 March 2001 in pursuance of the judgment of 16 October 2001.", "44. On 3 July 2003 Tatariv Council approved a new development plan for the village. The plan again authorised the use of the VL plot as a cemetery.", "45. On 22 July 2003 the applicant again instituted proceedings against Tatariv Council, seeking to have the approval of the new development plan for the village, insofar as it concerned the location of the cemetery, declared unlawful. He also sought compensation for non-pecuniary damage, court fees and legal expenses.", "46. On 22 August 2003 the Verkhovyna Court ordered Tatariv Council to inform the residents of the village that burials at the unauthorised cemetery near the applicant\u2019s house were prohibited.", "47. By that time, up to seventy burials had been carried out on the VL plot. The distance between the applicant\u2019s house and some of the graves was less than 120 metres.", "48. The Chairman of Tatariv Council argued before the court that there was no other suitable area for a cemetery in the village. She further submitted that the applicant\u2019s allegation of possible contamination of the water supply was unfounded, as the groundwater flowed away from his property.", "49. On 26 December 2003 the Verkhovyna Court allowed the applicant\u2019s claims and held that the new construction plan was unlawful as regards the location of the cemetery. It found that the VL plot was not suitable for use as a cemetery. In particular, constructing the cemetery on the VL plot had breached the environmental health laws and regulations requiring the establishment of: (a) a health protection zone 300 metres wide separating residential areas from a risk factor; and (b) a water protection zone 50 metres wide separating water supply sources from a risk factor. It observed that those distances could not be reduced. It ordered Tatariv Council to close the cemetery and to pay the applicant 25,000 hryvnias (UAH) in compensation for non-pecuniary damage and UAH 609.45 for costs and expenses.", "50. On 28 May 2004 the Ivano-Frankivsk Regional Court of Appeal (\u201cCourt of Appeal\u201d) upheld the judgment of 26 December 2003 in part. In particular, it decided that no award of non-pecuniary damage should be made to the applicant, and it reduced the award for costs and expenses to UAH 151.", "51. On 9 October 2006 the Supreme Court upheld the ruling of 28 May 2004.", "52. On 18 June 2004 the Verkhovyna Court issued two writs of execution ordering Tatariv Council to adopt a decision declaring the new development plan unlawful and to close the cemetery.", "53. On 7 July 2004 the State Bailiffs\u2019 Service instituted enforcement proceedings in the case.", "54. Between July 2004 and February 2005 the State Bailiffs\u2019 Service imposed fines on Tatariv Council several times for its refusal to comply with the judgment of 26 December 2003.", "55. On 3 March 2005 the Bailiffs terminated the enforcement proceedings, stating that it had been impossible to enforce the decision without the involvement of Tatariv Council, whose members had failed to adopt a decision in pursuance of the judgment of 26 December 2003.", "56. In March 2005 the applicant requested the Verkhovyna Court to change the terms of the enforcement of the judgment of 26 December 2003. In particular, he sought to have the Chairman of Tatariv Council ordered to execute the judgment.", "57. On 17 October 2005 the Verkhovyna Court rejected the applicant\u2019s request. It held that the Chairman had acted only as a representative of Tatariv Council, the respondent in the case. The Chairman had not been involved as a party to the proceedings. On 6 December 2005 the Court of Appeal upheld the ruling of 17 October 2005.", "58. In August 2005 the applicant challenged the alleged omissions and inactivity of the Chairman of Tatariv Council as regards the enforcement of the judgment of 26 December 2003 before the Verkhovyna Court.", "59. On 8 November 2005 the Verkhovyna Court found no fault on the part of the Chairman and rejected the applicant\u2019s claim. On 12 January 2006 the Court of Appeal upheld that decision.", "60. On 16 August 2006 Tatariv Council again refused to declare the new development plan unlawful and to close the cemetery.", "61. On 28 August 2006 the State Bailiffs\u2019 Service informed the applicant that the enforcement proceedings were not subject to renewal.", "62. The applicant also unsuccessfully sought to institute criminal proceedings against the Chairman of Tatariv Council for her alleged failure to enforce the judgment of 26 December 2003.", "63. On 7 May 2002 the Yaremche Court, acting upon the applicant\u2019s request, refused to institute criminal proceedings against a private individual, K.M., for using the VL plot for a burial. On 16 July 2002 and 21 January 2003 the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, respectively, upheld this decision.", "64. On 3 October 2002 the Yaremche Court in two separate judgments rejected as unsubstantiated damages claims brought by the applicant and his neighbour, D.B., against K.M. and F.G. (private individuals) concerning the unlawful use of the land near their houses for burial purposes. It found no breach of applicant\u2019s rights by the respondents.", "65. The judgments were upheld on 24 December 2002 (in two separate rulings) by the Court of Appeal and subsequently on 15 September 2005 and 15 February 2006 by the Supreme Court."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
