On 17 April 2007, after pleading guilty to counts of rape, indecent assault and robbery, the applicant was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence for the public protection (\u201cIPP\u201d). The minimum term that the applicant had to serve before being eligible for release (the \u201ctariff\u201d) was set at 4 years 273 days. His tariff was due to expire on 16 January 2012.", "7. On 16 October 2007 the applicant completed alcohol in cell work and on 31 October 2007 he completed an alcohol awareness course.", "8. In March 2008 the applicant was transferred to HMP Wayland. From 30 May 2008 to 2 July 2008 he participated in the Enhanced Thinking Skills (\u201cETS\u201d) course.", "9. In November 2008 the applicant completed the Living with Loss course.", "10. On 16 July 2009 the applicant completed the Core Sex Offenders Treatment Programme (\u201cSOTP\u201d). In a post-programme progress review dated 30 November 2009, further work to reduce his risk of reoffending was identified, namely full engagement in the Structured Assessment of Risk and Need (\u201cSARN\u201d) process and full engagement in further assessments for sexual offending programmes.", "11. A SARN Report dated 8 April 2010 prepared by a forensic psychologist in training noted that the applicant was assessed at a high statistic and high dynamic risk of sexual reoffending. It recommended personality and psychiatric assessments followed by completion of the extended Sex Offenders Treatment Programme (\u201cESOTP\u201d) in order to reduce his risk. It concluded that the risk presented by the applicant was not low enough for him to be transferred to open conditions. The applicant was placed on a waiting list for the ESOTP.", "12. On 20 May 2010 the applicant was informed by the Parole Board that it had not directed his release on licence or transfer to open conditions as some risk factors were outstanding. It noted that the Secretary of State had identified the need for sex offending and alcohol awareness work to reduce the level of risk. The applicant\u2019s next parole process was to commence in May 2011, with an oral hearing in November 2011.", "13. On 13 September 2010 the applicant made a formal application to HMP Bure, where he was then detained, to ask whether it intended to run the ESOTP.

On 13 July 2011 the applicant completed a further alcohol awareness course.", "15. On 26 September 2011 the Parole Board decided, on the papers, not to direct the applicant\u2019s release. It noted that the applicant had completed an accredited alcohol course, the ETS course and the SOTP and that he hoped to complete the Thinking Skills Programme (\u201cTSP\u201d) and ESOTP in the near future. It concluded:", "\u201cYou have been consistently well motivated to engage with all work identified as necessary for you. This is to your credit, as is your calm and personable approach. You have made some progress in that you now talk more openly and in more depth about your sexual offences. This has enabled you to work constructively with programme facilitators, and has provided a foundation on which to build in the ESOTP. You are motivated to complete that programme, and it is only available in the closed estate \u2013 any move to open conditions would therefore be premature. Release is, at present, out of the question. There is some lack of clarity around some of the risk factors in your case, and you yourself recognise that there is more to be done in terms of addressing risk ...\u201d", "16. In November 2011 the applicant completed the TSP.", "17. By letter dated 1 December 2011, the applicant was informed that the Secretary of State had considered the Parole Board recommendation and agreed that the applicant was not suitable for release or transfer to open prison conditions. The next review period was set at twenty months, allowing eight months for completion of TSP, six months for completion of ESOTP and six months for production of a further SARN report. The review would therefore commence in October 2012 with a view to completion by July 2013.", "18. In a Sentence Planning and Review Report dated 5 December 2011, it was recognised that ESOTP was a course that the applicant should concentrate on as part of his sentence plan. The report observed that the applicant\u2019s need to improve his use of alternative styles of thinking had been addressed through his attendance at the TSP. The report further noted:", "\u201cAlcohol was an area that was problematic before his incarceration ... He has completed an accredited alcohol course (TADS) and continues to work with CARATS to address this issue. Mr Alexander has completed TSP and reports following completion were positive ... His sentence plan also recommends that he is assessed for the Extended SOTP. I understand from the programmes department that due to lack of resources this remains an objective. However, I am confident that subject to local prioritization strategy this should be completed in 2013.\u201d", "19. The applicant\u2019s tariff expired on 16 January 2012.", "20. On 27 April 2012 the Prison Service notified the applicant\u2019s solicitors that the applicant was listed on their database \u201cas a priority for assessment\u201d prior to the next ESOTP scheduled to commence in August 2012.

In its recommendation, the report stated:", "\u201cIt is hoped that [the applicant] will be able to participate in the ESOTP (6 months in duration) that is scheduled for March 2013. Until that programme is completed and a further SARN written to identify whether further intervention is required to manage risk, there can be no change to his current assessments and there is no support for a move to less secure conditions at this time ...\u201d", "26. On 12 February 2013 the Parole Board decided on the papers not to direct the applicant\u2019s release, deeming him still a risk to the public until he completed the ESOTP. Its report stated:", "\u201cThrough no fault of your own, you have been unable to complete ESOTP but it is anticipated that you will have the opportunity to do so in 2013.\u201d", "27.

In June 2013 the applicant was transferred to HMP Whatton. In February 2014 he underwent further assessments for the ESOTP in order for prison staff to decide whether he could access the ESOTP at another prison or whether he should undertake the course at HMP Whatton.", "33. On an unknown date in autumn 2014 the applicant commenced the ESOTP at HMP Risley.
