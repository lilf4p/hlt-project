THE CZECH REPUBLIC", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8-1 - Respect for private life)", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Andr\u00e9 Potocki;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Ganna Yudkivska;Mark Villiger;Paul Lemmens", "TEXT": ["6. The first applicant, Ms \u0160\u00e1rka Dubsk\u00e1, was born in 1985 and lives in Jilemnice. The second applicant, Ms Alexandra Krejzov\u00e1, was born in 1980 and lives in Prague.", "7. The first applicant gave birth to her first child in hospital in 2007 without any complications. According to her, during the birth the medical personnel present were urging her to agree to undergo various kinds of medical intervention even though she had expressly stated her wish not to be subjected to any unnecessary medical treatment. She was also forced to give birth in a position she did not wish. She wanted to leave the hospital a few hours after the birth as both she and the baby were healthy, but a doctor ordered her to stay in the hospital. She therefore did not leave until the next day, when she presented a letter from her paediatrician, who confirmed that she would take the child into her care.", "8. In 2010 the applicant became pregnant for the second time with an expected delivery date in the middle of May 2011. The pregnancy was free from complications and the medical examinations and tests did not indicate any problems. Since she considered that giving birth in a hospital had been stressful for her, the applicant decided to give birth at home and searched for a midwife to assist at the birth. However, she was unable to find any midwife who was willing to assist her with a home birth.", "9. On 5 April 2011 she wrote to her health-insurance company and to the Liberec Regional Office (krajsk\u00fd \u00fa\u0159ad) asking for help in finding a midwife.", "10. On 7 April 2011 the health-insurance company replied that Czech legislation did not provide for the possibility that a public health-insurance company might cover costs arising from home births and that it therefore had no contracts with any health professionals providing such services. Moreover, prevailing expert medical opinion did not approve of home births.", "11. In a letter of 13 April 2011 the Regional Office added that the midwives listed in its register of health professionals were, in any event, only allowed by law to attend births at premises possessing the technical equipment required by Decree no. 221/2010 and not in a private home.", "12. Not having found any health professional to assist her, the applicant gave birth to her son alone at home on 11 May 2011.", "13. On 1 July 2011 she lodged a constitutional appeal (\u00fastavn\u00ed st\u00ed\u017enost) claiming that she had been denied the possibility of giving birth at home with the assistance of a health professional, in violation of her right to respect for her private life.", "14. On 28 February 2012 the Constitutional Court (\u00dastavn\u00ed soud) dismissed the appeal, holding that it would be contrary to the principle of subsidiarity for it to decide on the merits of the case because the applicant had not exhausted all the available remedies, which included an action for protection of personal rights under the Civil Code and an application for judicial review under section 82 of the Code of Judicial Administrative Procedure. It nevertheless expressed its doubts as to the compliance of the Czech legislation with Article 8 of the Convention and asked the relevant parties to initiate a serious and well-informed debate about new legislation. Nine out of the fourteen judges attached to the decision their separate opinions, in which they disagreed with the reasoning behind it. Most of them considered that the Constitutional Court should have dismissed the appeal as an actio popularis and should have refrained from expressing any views on the constitutionality of the legislation concerning home births.", "15. The second applicant is the mother of two children who were born at home in 2008 and 2010 with the assistance of a midwife. The midwives attended the births without any authorisation from the State.", "16. According to the applicant, before deciding to give birth at home, she had visited several hospitals which had all refused her requests to deliver the baby without any medical intervention that was not strictly required by the situation. They had also refused to agree to her wish for uninterrupted contact with the baby from the moment of birth, as the regular practice was to take the child away from the mother immediately after the birth to be weighed and measured and for further medical observation lasting for two hours.", "17. At the time of lodging the present application, the applicant was pregnant again, with an expected delivery in the middle of May 2012. The pregnancy was free from complications and she again wished to give birth at home with the assistance of a midwife. However, she was unable to find a willing midwife because of the risk of a heavy fine if medical services were provided without authorisation. The applicant asked various authorities to help find a solution to her situation.", "18. In a letter of 18 November 2011 the Ministry of Health replied that it did not provide medical services to individual patients and that the applicant should make enquiries with the City of Prague (M\u011bsto Praha) which, acting as a regional office, registered and issued authorisations to health professionals.", "19. On 29 November 2011 the applicant\u2019s health-insurance company informed her that the attendance of a health professional at a home birth was not covered by public insurance.", "20. On 13 December 2011 the City of Prague informed the applicant that no midwife registered in Prague was authorised to assist with home births.", "21. On 7 May 2012 the applicant gave birth to a child in a maternity hospital in Vrchlab\u00ed, 140 km away from Prague. She had chosen that hospital because of its reputation for respecting the wishes of mothers during delivery. Nevertheless, according to her, not all her wishes had been respected. Despite the fact that both she and the child had been healthy and that no complications had occurred during the birth, the applicant had had to stay in the hospital for seventy-two hours. The newborn baby had been separated from her after the birth and before leaving the maternity hospital the remains of the child\u2019s umbilical cord had been cut off despite her wishes to the contrary.", "22. In its bulletin no. 2/2007 of February 2007 the Ministry of Health published a practice guideline which stated:", "\u201cConducting a delivery in the Czech Republic is regarded as a healthcare provision that is provided only in a healthcare institution. Each healthcare institution must fulfil the statutory requirements ... and the requirements laid down by the relevant secondary legislation.\u201d", "23. The Czech Medical Chamber (\u010cesk\u00e1 l\u00e9ka\u0159sk\u00e1 komora) considers a home birth to be a procedure non lege artis because of the dangers associated therewith.", "24. Almost all births in the Czech Republic currently take place in hospital, with only about 0.2% to 0.3% of births happening at home.", "25. In reaction to what has been perceived as an attempt to criminalise midwifery in some central and eastern European countries \u2013 in particular in Hungary \u2013 the President of the International Confederation of Midwives and the President of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics issued a joint statement on 6 March 2012 in which they declared: \u201cThere is strong evidence that out of hospital birth supported by a registered midwife is safe, and a preferred experience for many mothers. Women should not be denied this choice because of the lack of an adequate regulatory framework that makes it possible for midwives to practice their profession in any place that women choose to give birth.\u201d", "26. On 20 March 2012 the Ministry of Health set up an expert committee on obstetrics with the objective of studying the issue of home births. There were representatives of care recipients, midwives, physicians\u2019 associations, the Ministry of Health, the Government\u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights and public health-insurance companies. The representatives of the physicians\u2019 associations boycotted the meetings, declaring that the current state of affairs was satisfactory and that, in their view, there was no need to change anything. Subsequently, the Minister of Health removed the representatives of care recipients, midwives and the Government\u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights, with the argument that only by changing the committee\u2019s composition in this way would it be possible for it to agree on certain conclusions.", "27. On 18 January 2013 the Governmental Council for Equal Opportunities for Women and Men (Rada vl\u00e1dy pro rovn\u00e9 p\u0159\u00edle\u017eitosti \u017een a mu\u017e\u016f), an advisory body to the Government, recommended the prevention of further discrimination against women in the enjoyment of their right to a free choice of the method and circumstances of giving birth and the place of delivery. It also recommended the prevention of discrimination against midwives by permitting them to practise their profession in full through their inclusion in the public health-insurance system. The Council also referred to the recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (see paragraph 56 below), which monitors implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, to support its position that women should have a choice of where to give birth.", "28. In its bulletin no. 8/2013 published on 9 December 2013, which replaced the previous practice guideline of 2007 (see paragraph 22 above), the Ministry of Health described the procedure for providers of healthcare services when discharging newborns into their own social environment. It stated that the recommendation of specialists was that a newborn should be discharged from the maternity hospital no sooner than seventy-two hours after birth. The new procedure allows for the discharge of the newborn from the maternity hospital less than seventy-two hours after the birth at the request of the newborn\u2019s legal representative, provided that the latter:", "\u201c(a) has submitted a written withdrawal of his or her agreement to the provision of medical services to the newborn, or a written statement declaring his or her disagreement with the provision of the medical services, or alternatively such agreement or disagreement has been entered in the newborn\u2019s medical documentation ...;", "(b) has been demonstrably and duly informed about the possible consequences following the discharge of the newborn before seventy-two hours have elapsed since the birth ...;", "(c) has been duly informed that \u2013 in the interests of the subsequent healthy development of the newborn \u2013 the Czech specialist medical associations recommend:", "1. that a clinical examination be conducted within twenty-four hours of the discharge of the newborn ...;", "2. that a blood sample be taken within forty-eight to seventy-two hours following the birth for the purposes of screening for hereditary metabolic malfunctions ...\u201d", "In the event that the newborn is hospitalised without the agreement of the legal representative in order to be given medical treatment necessary to save the child\u2019s life or to prevent serious damage to the child\u2019s health, the hospital should proceed in accordance with sections 38 and 40 of the Medical Services Act (Law no. 372/2011). This practice guideline came into force on 1 January 2014.", "29. According to estimated data provided by the World Health Organisation in a 2000 report, the Czech Republic was among the countries with the lowest perinatal mortality rate, which is defined as the number of stillbirths and deaths in the first week of life. The rate for the Czech Republic was 0.4%. In other European countries the figures ranged from 0.5% in Sweden and Italy to 5.8% in Azerbaijan. In most European countries the figures were below 1%. According to the report, perinatal mortality is an important indicator of maternal care and maternal health and nutrition; it also reflects the quality of available obstetric and paediatric care, comparing different countries. The report recommended that, if possible, all foetuses and infants weighing at least 500g at birth, whether alive or dead, should be included in the statistics. The reported data regarding stillbirths were not adjusted to this effect in the study.", "30. According to the European Perinatal Health Report on the health and care of pregnant women and babies in Europe in 2010, issued in 2013 within the framework of the activities of the Euro-Peristat Project, the Czech Republic was amongst the countries with the lowest mortality rate amongst newborns in the first twenty-seven days of their life. The rate was 0.17%. The data for other included countries, mostly European Union (EU) member States, ranged from 0.12% for Iceland to 0.55% for Romania. However, if only statistics relating to babies born after twenty-four weeks of pregnancy were taken into account, the Czech Republic, with a rate of 0.16%, moved closer to the average of 0.2%. The report noted that the wide variation in gestational age-specific neonatal mortality rates at twenty-two to twenty-three weeks suggested that not all births and deaths very early in the neonatal period were systematically included. Consequently, the report considered the data including only babies born after twenty-four weeks of gestation more reliable.", "31. The applicants pointed out that the above sets of data were not easily comparable across countries owing to the different definitions used. The majority of European countries set a weight limit of 500 g for counting live births and stillborn children. In the Czech Republic, however, the practice until April 2012 had been that a birth was registered for statistical purposes only if the child weighed at least 1,000 g.", "32. The Government stated that Czech maternity hospitals offered highquality services during delivery that fully respected the rights and wishes of mothers. For their part, the applicants submitted testimonies from numerous mothers who had given birth in maternity hospitals during recent years and who pointed to practices that were \u2013 in their view \u2013 unacceptable, including the following: medical intervention during delivery without the consent of the mothers and sometimes against their explicitly expressed will, such as artificial rupture of membranes; episiotomy; intravenous infusion of medication for the mother; performing the Kristeller manoeuvre (pushing with the fist or forearm the top of the uterus coinciding with a contraction and pushing by the mother during the second stage of labour); performing Caesarean section without sufficient medical justification; using techniques and medication to speed up the delivery; separation of mothers from their babies for several hours after delivery, ignoring the mother\u2019s wishes to have immediate contact with the baby after delivery; routinely placing healthy babies in incubators; administering treatment to babies against the express wishes of the mother; and forcing the mother and baby to stay in hospital for seventy-two hours after delivery even when they were both healthy. There had also been complaints of arrogant, intimidating, disrespectful and patronising behaviour on the part of the hospital staff and of a lack of privacy.", "33. It appears that no midwife has been prosecuted in the Czech Republic for attending home births per se. Several of them have been prosecuted for alleged malpractice in connection with a delivery at home, however. The applicants referred to the cases of Ms \u0160. and Ms K., who are both well-known promoters of natural deliveries without any unnecessary medical intervention and who used to regularly conduct home deliveries.", "34. On 27 March 2013 the Prague 6 District Court (obvodn\u00ed soud) found Ms \u0160. guilty of negligently causing the death of a baby who was stillborn. She was sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment, suspended for five years, and prohibited from practising the occupation of midwife for three years. The culpability of Ms \u0160. was based on the fact that she had not strongly advised the mother to contact a medical facility when consulted by telephone during a labour that was already ongoing at home. She had thus given flawed advice to the mother-to-be without actually examining her. The conviction was upheld on appeal on 29 May 2013, although the sentence was changed to fifteen months\u2019 imprisonment, suspended for thirty months, and two years\u2019 prohibition on practising as a midwife. An appeal on points of law is pending.", "35. On 21 September 2011 the Prague 3 District Court found Ms K. guilty of negligently causing bodily harm to a baby whose home birth she had attended and who had stopped breathing during the delivery. The baby died several days later. She was sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment, suspended for five years, prohibited from practising as a midwife for five years, and ordered to pay 2,700,000 Czech korunas (CZK) (equivalent to 105,000 euros (EUR)) by way of reimbursement of the costs incurred by the insurance company in treating the child until the latter\u2019s death. According to the court, the malpractice on the part of Ms K. consisted in the fact that she had not followed the standard procedures for deliveries as laid down by the Czech Medical Chamber (\u010cesk\u00e1 l\u00e9ka\u0159sk\u00e1 komora) and her conduct had thus been \u201cnon lege artis\u201d. The criminal complaint was not lodged by the parents but by a hospital.", "36. On 24 July 2013 the Constitutional Court quashed all the judgments in the case against Ms K. on account of a violation of her right to a fair trial. It considered the conclusions of the ordinary courts as to Ms K.\u2019s guilt to have been too subjective and not supported by the evidence beyond any reasonable doubt, thereby violating the principle of the presumption of innocence. It stated in particular that the courts had uncritically relied on an expert opinion which they had failed to subject to thorough scrutiny. It held that \u2013 on the basis of the expert opinion \u2013 the courts had applied very strict liability to the conduct of Ms K. in a situation where it had not been clear how she could have prevented the baby\u2019s death. Moreover, it had been established that she had tried to help the baby and had called an ambulance immediately after establishing that the baby had hypoxia. To foresee every possible complication during delivery and be able to react to it immediately, as was required of Ms K., would ultimately lead de facto to an absolute prohibition of home births. In that context the Constitutional Court noted:", "\u201c... a modern democratic State founded on the rule of law is based on the protection of individual and inalienable freedoms, the delimitation of which closely relates to human dignity. That freedom, which includes freedom in personal activities, is accompanied by a certain degree of acceptable risk. The right of parents to a free choice of the place and mode of delivery is limited only by the interest in the safe delivery and health of the child; that interest cannot, however, be interpreted as an unambiguous preference for deliveries in hospital.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
