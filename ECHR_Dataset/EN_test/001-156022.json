THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Branko Lubarda;J\u00e1n \u0160ikuta;Josep Casadevall;Kristina Pardalos;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra", "TEXT": ["1. The applicant, Mr Maurice Marcellin Marie van Weerelt, is a Netherlands national, who was born in 1928 and lives in Steensel. He is represented before the Court by Mr P. van Hagen, a lawyer practising in Breda.", "2", "3. The German tax authorities received information concerning assets held in a Liechtenstein bank by non-Liechtenstein residents, a number of Netherlands residents among them. In May 2008 the German tax authorities transferred to the Netherlands Tax and Customs Administration (Belastingdienst) a file containing particulars concerning the Netherlands residents under the procedure for spontaneous exchange of tax information (Article 4 of Council Directive 77/799/EEC of 19 December 1977 concerning mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct taxation, see below). The Netherlands tax authorities requested the German tax authorities\u2019 permission to use these particulars in criminal proceedings to be held in public; this was granted.", "4. As relevant to the present case, it emerged that a Liechtenstein foundation (Stiftung) by the name of C. had been created in 1986 to administer a bank account held in Switzerland. The foundation was controlled through a trustee (Treuhand) in Liechtenstein. The \u201cby-laws\u201d of C. foundation, which were in English, listed as \u201cfirst beneficiary of all assets and revenues, as well as of any possible liquidation proceeds ... during his lifetime and without any restriction\u201d the applicant; upon his death, the applicant\u2019s wife as second beneficiary; upon her death, the applicant\u2019s brother; upon his death, the latter\u2019s descendants. These \u201cby-laws\u201d were revocable at any time by the applicant during his lifetime. C. foundation was liquidated on 3 November 2000.", "5. On 9 June 2009 the Tax Inspector wrote to the applicant stating that he had information from which it appeared that the applicant was, or had been, involved with a financial interest (als gerechtigde betrokken) in a foundation under the law of the Principality of Liechtenstein and asked him to submit certain information with a view to a tax adjustment.", "6. The applicant, through his counsel, replied on 26 June 2009. Although he did not deny his involvement with a Liechtenstein foundation, he stated that he had only the sketchiest recollection of it and possessed no pertinent documents. He invited the Tax Inspector to share the information in his possession in order to clarify matters.", "7. The Tax Inspector responded on 7 July 2009. He did not consider it credible that the applicant no longer had the information requested, in view of the possible financial interest involved; nor did he believe that the applicant did not remember anything about his involvement with a Liechtenstein foundation.", "8. The applicant, through his counsel, wrote to the Tax Inspector on 14 July 2009 restating his earlier position.", "9. The Tax Inspector replied on 20 July 2009, pointing to increases in the applicant\u2019s asset position that could not be explained absent corresponding increases of his income or debt.", "10. On 14 August 2009 the applicant submitted a written explanation to the effect that the increases noted had resulted from rising stock markets.", "11. On 19 August 2009 the Tax Inspector wrote again, dismissing the applicant\u2019s explanation of the increases in his asset position as insufficient and demanding more detailed information. He also asked for more information on the applicant\u2019s involvement in the Liechtenstein foundation.", "12. On 14 September 2009 the applicant submitted more detailed information in response to the request for an explanation of the increase in his asset position. In relation to the Liechtenstein foundation, he stated that he could remember nothing more than that he had once had dealings with such a body. He asked the Tax Inspector for copies of the documents concerning the Liechtenstein foundation which were apparently in his possession.", "13. On 22 September 2009 the Tax Inspector wrote dismissing as insufficient the information which the applicant had given. With regard to the Liechtenstein foundation, he suggested that the applicant obtain the information needed from its trustee. On the information available, he reached the conclusion that the applicant was, or had been, involved with the Liechtenstein foundation and had failed to report its assets and income. He announced the intention to issue a tax adjustment based on an asset value of five million euros (EUR) and an annual interest yield of EUR 200,000, these figures to be reviewed if the applicant disproved them.", "14. On 19 October 2009 the applicant wrote submitting further documents regarding his asset position. As to the Liechtenstein foundation, he protested that a tax adjustment based on assets worth EUR 5 million and interest in an amount of EUR 200,000 was incomprehensible, given that the Tax Inspector had not revealed anything other than that he had \u201cinformation from which it appeared that the applicant was, or had been, involved with a financial interest\u201d in such a body. He asked the Tax Inspector to specify the information on which his assessment was based.", "15. On 27 October 2009 the Tax Inspector wrote announcing his intention to issue tax adjustments if the information asked for was not forthcoming within four weeks.", "16. The applicant submitted further documents on various dates until May 2010. None of these concerned the Liechtenstein foundation.", "17. On 1 June 2010 the Tax Inspector sent the applicant\u2019s representative a summary of the information available concerning the Liechtenstein foundation \u201cto jog [the applicant\u2019s] memory\u201d. The information in issue had been received by the Netherlands Tax and Customs Administration from the German tax authorities. It had emerged that the applicant had been involved in a Liechtenstein foundation called C., based in Vaduz, Liechtenstein. The applicant had been the first beneficiary without restriction of all its assets and revenue and any possible liquidation proceeds. He had had the power to revoke its by-laws and dismiss its trustee. The Netherlands tax authorities had knowledge of dozens of similar cases, the pattern in all cases being the same: although ostensibly ownership of assets was vested in the Liechtenstein foundation, the existence and content of the relevant bye-laws, letter of authority and appointment of the economic beneficiary demonstrated that in real terms ownership of the assets lay with whoever had set up the foundation. The Tax Inspector was of the view that a similar arrangement must exist for the foundation C. as well and sent a final demand for the surrender of C.\u2019s corresponding documents and accounts. A time-limit was set for this purpose, which in subsequent correspondence was extended until 6 September 2010.", "18. On 3 September 2010 the applicant informed the Tax Inspector that the trustee of the C. foundation had referred him to an administrator in Switzerland.", "19. On 10 September 2010 the applicant forwarded to the Tax Inspector a letter from the administrator in Switzerland refusing to supply any information \u201cdue to confidentiality matters\u201d.", "20. The Tax Inspector thereupon ordered the applicant to provide information orally. A meeting for this purpose took place on 4 November 2010.", "21. On 18 November 2010 the Tax Inspector wrote to the applicant noting that he had admitted to the possession of documents concerning the C. foundation and agreed to submit them to the Tax Inspector. The letter stated the demand that the applicant submit these documents.", "22. On 23 November 2010 the applicant replied denying having made the admission suggested and stating that he had no such documents in his possession.", "23. Faced with the imminent expiry, on 1 January 2011, of the statutory twelve-year time-limit for issuing tax adjustments, the Tax Inspector sent the applicant a letter on 6 December 2010 announcing that a tax adjustment would be sent shortly. The latter gave warning of the Tax Inspector\u2019s intention to impose a tax fine (section 67g of the General State Taxes Act \u2013 Algemene wet inzake rijksbelastingen \u2013 see below). The fine was to be based on the consideration that although the applicant knew, or ought to have known, that he was the sole beneficiary of the assets held in the C. foundation, he had deliberately failed to mention the property and income derived from it on his tax returns. The Tax Inspector counted as aggravating circumstances that the applicant had resorted to subterfuge (listigheid) and conspiracy (samenspanning) with foreign entities to conceal C. foundation\u2019s assets, and thus part of his property, from the Netherlands tax authorities and had made insufficient effort to supply to the Tax Inspector the information necessary to arrive at a correct assessment.", "24. On 10 December 2010 the Tax Inspector sent the applicant a tax adjustment for income tax (inkomstenbelasting) and property tax (vermogensbelasting) due for 1998/1999. Absent detailed information, the estimate was that the assets in issue had a value of EUR 5 million and had yielded 4% per annum. The applicant was ordered to pay the taxes due, plus punitive fines (vergrijpboetes) in an amount equal to the taxes and tax interest (heffingsrente). The total sums came to EUR 285,656 in respect of income tax and EUR 85,890 in respect of property tax for this fiscal year alone.", "25. The applicant lodged an objection with the Tax Inspector on 18 January 2011. As relevant to the case before the Court, he argued, firstly, that the Tax Inspector had failed to specify the demands for information which the applicant had not met and submitted in addition that he had answered each of the Tax Inspector\u2019s questions; secondly, that the Tax Inspector had not had the right to ask questions during the meeting of 4 November 2010 and demand answers, since these questions also served for the imposition of punitive fines; and finally, that the Tax Inspector had not shown that the applicant had failed to submit a tax return required by law.", "26. The Tax Inspector adjourned the proceedings. It would appear that no decision has yet been taken.", "27. On 25 February 2011 the Tax and Customs Administration summoned the applicant to appear before the provisional measures judge (voorzieningenrechter) of the Regional Court (rechtbank) of \u2018sHertogenbosch in summary injunction proceedings (kort geding). The purpose was to obtain an order for the applicant to disclose all information concerning any assets held abroad, including those held in C. foundation and the allocation of the latter after the foundation had been dissolved.", "28. The applicant submitted a counterclaim for an injunction restraining the Tax and Customs Administration from making any further such demands for information.", "29. Having held a hearing on 22 March 2011, the provisional measures judge gave judgment on 5 April 2011. The applicant was ordered to disclose the information specified within twenty-eight days from the day on which the judgment was served on him, on pain of a penalty payment (dwangsom) of EUR 2,500 for each day or part of a day thereafter that he failed to comply up to a maximum of EUR 500,000. The judgment was provisionally executable (uitvoerbaar bij voorraad).", "30. The judgment was served on the applicant on 6 April 2011.", "31. On 9 May 2011 the applicant submitted a statement in writing that \u201cto the best of his knowledge\u201d he had held no foreign bank accounts after 1998 save for one Belgian account which he had duly declared to the tax authorities and had closed down in 2000, and a second letter from the Swiss administrator again refusing to supply information \u201cdue to reasons of confidentiality\u201d.", "32. On 29 April 2011 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Court of Appeal (gerechtshof) of \u2018sHertogenbosch against the judgment of the provisional measures judge.", "33. On 4 November 2011, while the appeal was pending, the lawyers representing the Tax and Customs Administration wrote to the applicant informing him that they considered him to have been liable for penalty payments in an amount of EUR 2,500 daily since 6 May 2011. The Tax and Custom Administration reserved the right to demand their payment.", "34. The Court of Appeal gave judgment on 31 January 2012 confirming the judgment of the provisional measures judge of the Regional Court.", "35. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court (Hoge Raad). He complained of being forced to incriminate himself in that he was being compelled to provide evidence that would be used against him in proceedings to determine a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d.", "36. The Advocate General (advocaat-generaal) to the Supreme Court submitted an extensively reasoned advisory opinion in which he discussed, inter alia, the case-law of the Court and of the Supreme Court itself. He recommended that the Supreme Court should not quash the judgment of the Court of Appeal and remit the case, but dismiss the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law and direct that information extracted from the applicant under coercion should not be used for punitive purposes.", "37. The Supreme Court gave judgment on 12 July 2013 (ECLI:NL:HR:2013:BZ3640). Its reasoning included the following:", "\u201c3.7. In so far as it concerns evidentiary material the existence of which is dependent on the will of the taxpayer (hereafter \u2018will-dependent material\u2019), the following applies. The principle is that the surrender of such material may be coerced for purposes of levying tax. If it cannot be excluded that the material will also be used in connection with a \u2018criminal charge\u2019 (compare [J.B. v. Switzerland, no. 31827/96, ECHR 2001III]), the domestic authorities will have to ensure that the taxpayer will be able to exercise effectively his right not to cooperate in self-incrimination. Since regulation directed to this end is lacking in the Netherlands, it is for the courts to provide the necessary guarantees.", "3.8. For this reason the (provisional measures) judge will have to add a qualification to that end to the order to be given. The State has brought its claim relying on section 47 of the General State Taxes Act with a view to levying tax, while not excluding possible use of the information demanded for purposes of imposing administrative fines or prosecution. In order to comply with the requirements flowing from Article 6 of the Convention, as referred to in paragraph 3.7 above, the measure to be ordered, in so far as it concerns will-dependent material, will have to be limited in the sense that such an order may only be given subject to the restriction that the material supplied be only used for the purpose of levying tax.", "Should the material that has come into the hands of the Tax Inspector, and thus the State, nonetheless be used also for purposes of imposing tax fines or prosecution, then the decision on what consequence should be attached to the violation of the restriction posed by the provisional measures judge will be for the court that decides on the tax fine or the prosecution to take.", "3.9 The above reasoning means that in cases in which the surrender of material is demanded from a taxpayer under section 47 of the General State Taxes Act with a view to the correct levying of tax, and the taxpayer relies on the nemo tenetur principle, the following distinction has to be made.", "(a) In civil summary injunction proceedings a taxpayer may be ordered, on pain of having to make penalty payments, to supply all material that may be relevant to the correct levying of taxes, regardless of whether it concerns will-independent or will-dependent material, subject however to the restriction that material of the latter type may only be used for the purpose of levying tax.", "(b) Should the taxpayer not obey this order, he will forfeit the corresponding penalty payments. If the parties differ as to whether the taxpayer has obeyed the order, then in any ensuing execution proceedings the State will have the obligation so to state (stelplicht) and the corresponding burden of proof (bewijslast). This means that if the claim is contested, the State will have to prove \u2013 that is, make out a plausible case \u2013 that the taxpayer was in fact in a position to supply the material demanded from him but not surrendered.", "(c) Will-dependent material supplied by the taxpayer in response to the order of the provisional measures judge may not be used for the purpose of imposing tax fines on, or prosecuting, the taxpayer. In the event of that happening, it will be for the tax court or criminal court to decide what consequence to attach to such use.\u201d", "The operative provisions were as follows:", "\u201cThe Supreme Court:", "Annuls the judgment given on 31 January 2012 by the Court of Appeal of \u2018sHertogenbosch, as well as the judgment given by the provisional measures judge on 5 April 2011, but only in so far as the orders given in the latter judgment ... are given without restriction and in so far as [the applicant] is ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings in the first-instance proceedings and the appeal proceedings concerning the principal claim [principaal appel]; and, judging anew to that extent,", "Determines that, in so far as those orders relate to material the existence of which is dependent on the will of [the applicant], this material shall be supplied subject to the restriction that it shall only be used for the levying of taxes;", "Determines that the time-limit of \u201828 days from the date of notification of the judgment [of the provisional measures judge] shall be replaced by \u201828 days from the date of notification of the judgment pronounced by the Supreme Court on 12 July 2013\u2019;", "Orders the State to repay to [the applicant] all that he has paid to the State in compliance with the judgment of the provisional measures judge, plus statutory interest until the day of complete repayment;", "Orders each of the parties to bear its own costs incurred in the proceedings at first instance, the appeal proceedings concerning the principal claim and the appeal on points of law.\u201d", "38. The judgment of the Supreme Court was served on the applicant on 29 July 2013, together with a letter from the lawyer acting for the State requiring him to submit to the Tax and Customs Administration the information specified in the judgment of the provisional measures judge.", "39. On 26 August 2013 the applicant replied, through his representative, that he did not have further information than he had already given. At most, he could try approaching his Swiss administrator a third time, but in view of the replies he had already received (see paragraphs 19 and 31 above) there would be little point in doing so.", "40. On 14 October 2013 the lawyer acting for the State wrote to the applicant taking note of his failure to submit the information demanded and informing him of the intention to enforce the penalty payments in an amount of EUR 2,500 per day from 28 August 2013.", "41. On 23 October 2013 an enforcement notice was served on the applicant for EUR 140,000 in respect of penalty payments imposed per that date.", "42. The applicant has maintained his position that he can neither submit nor retrieve any further information in order to comply with the orders given him.", "43. The applicant states that on 23 August 2011 the Tax Inspector issued an information decision (informatiebeschikking) pursuant to section 52a of the General State Taxes Act, as in force by then (see below). The applicant lodged an objection; this was dismissed on 18 November 2011.", "44. The applicant states that he lodged an appeal with the Regional Court, which was dismissed on 2 January 2013. An appeal on points of law is still pending before the Supreme Court.", "45. The applicant states that information orders have been issued for other fiscal years, and that the objection proceedings which he has brought against these have been adjourned.", "46. The provisions of the Constitution for the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Grondwet voor het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden) relevant to the case are the following:", "\u201cProvisions of treaties and of resolutions of international institutions which may be binding on all persons by virtue of their contents shall become binding after they have been published.\u201d", "\u201cStatutory regulations in force within the Kingdom shall not be applicable if such application is in conflict with the provisions of treaties that are binding on all persons or of resolutions by international institutions.\u201d", "47.
