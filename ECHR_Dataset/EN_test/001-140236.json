The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in \u0141a\u0144cut.", "6. Prior to her early retirement she had been employed for 23 years and had paid her social security contributions to the State. Between October 1992 and November 1997 she received a disability pension.", "7. On 6 March 2000 the applicant filed an application with the Rzesz\u00f3w Social Security Board (Zak\u0142ad Ubezpiecze\u0144 Spo\u0142ecznych) to be granted the right to an early-retirement pension for persons raising children who, due to the seriousness of their health condition, required constant care, the so-called \u201cEWK\u201d pension.", "8. Along with her application for a pension, the applicant submitted, among other documents concerning her son\u2019s health condition, a medical certificate issued by a specialist doctor. The certificate stated that the child (born in 1985) suffered from chronic asthma and that he was in need of his parent\u2019s constant care.", "9. On 19 April 2000 the Rzesz\u00f3w Social Security Board issued a decision granting the applicant the right to an earlyretirement pension with effect of 1 March 2000.", "10. Due to the applicant\u2019s employment the Social Security Board initially suspended the payment of the pension until the end of April 2000. The payment started on 1 May 2000.", "11. The EWK pension granted to the applicant amounted to 773.89 Polish zlotys (PLN) (approximately EUR 193).", "12. The applicant was issued with a pensioner\u2019s identity card marked \u201cvalid indefinitely\u201d and she continued to receive her pension without interruption until the date of the revocation of the right.", "13. On an unspecified date the Rzesz\u00f3w Social Security Board asked the Main Social Security Board\u2019s doctor (G\u0142\u00f3wny Lekarz Orzecznik) to inform it whether the applicant\u2019s son required the permanent care of a parent. The doctor stated that, on the basis of the medical documents, the child could not be considered as ever having required such care.", "14. On 25 April 2003 the Rzesz\u00f3w Social Security Board issued simultaneously two decisions in respect of the applicant.", "15. By virtue of one decision, the payment of the applicant\u2019s pension was discontinued with immediate effect. By virtue of the other decision, the Social Security Board revoked the initial decision granting a pension and eventually refused to grant the applicant the right to an earlyretirement pension under the scheme provided for by the 1989 Ordinance.", "16. The applicant appealed against the respective decisions divesting her of the right to an early-retirement pension. She submitted that she should receive the benefit because her child required constant care, as confirmed by the medical certificate attached to the original application for a pension. Moreover, the applicant alleged that the revocation of her retirement pension was contrary to the principle of vested rights.", "17. On 12 May 2004 the Rzesz\u00f3w Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal.", "18. The applicant appealed against the first-instance judgment.", "19.

On 24 February 2004 the Supreme Court refused to examine the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision was served on the applicant\u2019s lawyer on 15 March 2005.", "21.

The Government submitted that the applicant\u2019s gross annual income in 2006 amounted to PLN 8,293 (approx. EUR 262) which constituted 27.90% of the average salary in Poland at the relevant time.", "26. On 1 November 2006 the applicant turned 55 and she was granted a right to early retirement.
