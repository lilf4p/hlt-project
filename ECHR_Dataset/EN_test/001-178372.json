The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Riga.", "5. On 24 November 2005 a residential building maintenance services provider, Kurzemes Namu Apsaimniekot\u0101js, a limited liability company (\u201cthe plaintiff\u201d), brought a claim against the applicant for recovery of a debt for their services in the amount of 320 Latvian lati (LVL \u2013 approximately 455 euros (EUR)). The next day civil proceedings were instituted in that connection. The applicant disagreed; she argued that she did not owe any money to the plaintiff \u2013 they had not concluded an agreement for maintenance services and she was free to choose another service provider. In those proceedings the applicant was represented by Mr S. Se\u013cez\u0146ovs, who was not a lawyer.", "6. On 30 December 2005 a judge of the Riga City Kurzeme District Court (R\u012bgas pils\u0113tas Kurzemes rajona tiesa \u2013 hereinafter \u201cthe City Court\u201d) scheduled the first hearing to take place on 21 April 2006. During this hearing the applicant\u2019s representative requested additional time to examine the relevant legal norms and to obtain the relevant documents from the plaintiff. The City Court postponed the hearing to allow both parties to \u201cprepare documents\u201d. The next hearing was scheduled for 9 August 2006.", "7. On 9 August 2006 the plaintiff applied to have the hearing postponed because the applicant\u2019s debt for services had in the meantime increased and the plaintiff had not yet settled the courts fees for the increased claim. The application was granted and the next hearing was scheduled for 17 October 2006.", "8. On 17 October 2006 the plaintiff increased the amount of the claim and submitted the relevant documents. The applicant\u2019s representative applied to have the hearing postponed so as to examine those documents. The application was granted and the next hearing was scheduled for 31 January 2007.", "9. On 31 January 2007 the plaintiff increased the amount of the claim to LVL 426 (approximately EUR 606) and submitted more documents. The applicant\u2019s representative submitted written observations and some documents showing some debts that had been paid. The City Court admitted them to the case file and scheduled the next hearing for 23 March 2007.", "10. On 23 March 2007 the plaintiff increased the amount of the claim and submitted more documents. The applicant\u2019s representative requested that more detailed information be provided in this connection. The City Court ordered the plaintiff to provide observations by 13 August 2007 and scheduled the next hearing for 12 September 2007.", "11. On 11 September 2007 the City Court informed both parties that another judge was taking over the case; the next hearing was scheduled for 17 October 2007.", "12. On 17 October 2007 both parties pleaded their case. The City Court ordered the plaintiff to provide more detailed information and scheduled the next hearing for 13 November 2007.", "13. On 13 November 2007 the applicant\u2019s representative applied to have the hearing postponed as he had only received the relevant documents on the previous day. The application was granted and the next hearing was scheduled for 14 February 2008.", "14. On 14 February 2008 the applicant\u2019s representative pleaded the case. He argued that the service charges which the applicant had been asked to settle had been unclear. The plaintiff did not have all the relevant documents at hand and thus requested time to submit additional information. The City Court ordered the plaintiff to submit the specific documents and scheduled the next hearing for 17 April 2008.", "15. On 17 April 2008 the plaintiff submitted the relevant documents and the applicant\u2019s representative applied to have the hearing postponed to examine them. His application was granted and the next hearing was scheduled for 4 June 2008.", "16. The parties continued to plead their case in the hearing of 4 June 2008. The City Court imposed a monetary fine on the applicant\u2019s representative for disobeying a judge\u2019s order. Following an application by the plaintiff the hearing was postponed because the applicant\u2019s debt for services had in the meantime increased; they had not prepared the documents for the increased amount of the debt. The plaintiff was ordered to submit the relevant documents by an unknown date in September 2008 and the next hearing was scheduled for 28 October 2008.", "17. On 28 October 2008 the City Court held the last hearing in the case; it refused a fresh application by the plaintiff to postpone the hearing once again. On 6 November 2008 the City Court dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the applicant as unsubstantiated \u2013 the plaintiff had not proved that the expenses had actually been incurred and that they had duly reflected the services provided. On 27 November 2008 the plaintiff appealed against the judgment. On 28 November 2008 a judge of the City Court gave the plaintiff additional time to comply with the procedural requirements for lodging an appeal. On 2 December 2008 the plaintiff rectified those deficiencies. On 3 December 2008 the appeal was admitted and sent to the Riga Regional Court (R\u012bgas apgabaltiesa \u2013 hereinafter \u201cthe Regional Court\u201d).", "18. The first hearing before the Regional Court was held on 13 September 2010. The plaintiff increased the amount of the claim because the applicant\u2019s debt for services had in the meantime increased to LVL 3,173 (approximately EUR 4,515) and submitted the relevant documents. The applicant\u2019s representative disagreed with the increase of the claim. The Regional Court admitted those documents to the case file and scheduled the next hearing for 8 December 2010.", "19. On 8 December 2010 the Regional Court held the last hearing in the case. The plaintiff did not attend, nor did it inform the court of any reasons for its absence. The Regional Court decided to proceed with the case. On 22 December 2010 the Riga Regional Court partly allowed the plaintiff\u2019s claim and ordered the applicant to settle the debt in the total amount of LVL 2,854 (approximately EUR 4,059). Although the parties had not concluded an agreement for maintenance services, the applicant was obliged to pay for those services in accordance with domestic law. She could contest bills provided by the plaintiff, however she had failed to do so. The applicant had selectively paid some bills, but not all of them. The Regional Court refused the plaintiff\u2019s claim to receive contractual penalty (l\u012bgumsods) for late payment but awarded default interest of 6%. On 18 January 2011 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. On 3 February 2012 the Senate of the Supreme Court (Augst\u0101k\u0101s tiesas Sen\u0101ts) remitted it to the Regional Court as the applicant had not paid the security deposit for lodging it. Those deficiencies were rectified.", "20. On 3 April 2012 the Senate of the Supreme Court, following a preparatory meeting, refused to institute proceedings on points of law."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
