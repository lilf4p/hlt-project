THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Ledi Bianku;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Pauliine Koskelo;Robert Spano", "TEXT": ["1. The applicants, Mr Eric Wright and Mr James Brown, are Irish nationals who were born in 1960 and live in Londonderry, Northern Ireland. They are represented before the Court by Mr P. MacDermott of MacDermott, McGurk & Partners Solicitors, a lawyer practising in Londonderry.", "2. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) are represented by their Agent, Ms A. McLeod of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.", "3. By letter dated 21 March 2014 the Government of Ireland were notified of the applications and were asked if they wished to exercise their right to intervene pursuant to Article 36 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 of the Rules of Court. However, they did not seek to exercise this right.", "4. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "5. The first applicant was arrested by the army at 07.25 on 1 January 1977 in relation to two attacks on army patrols in Londonderry. He was handed over to the police at 10.15 and he was visited by his father and examined by a police surgeon shortly thereafter. No injuries or complaints were noted.", "6. From 12.02 to 12.57 the first applicant was interviewed by two detectives. During this interview he admitted that he was a member of Fianna na h\u2019Eireann, a proscribed Republican organisation, and had acted as a lookout during the two attacks.", "7. A second interview took place between 14.45 and 17.12 the same day, and during this interview the first applicant allegedly signed a statement admitting membership of a proscribed organisation; again admitted to acting as a lookout during the two attacks; and sketched the area showing where he and others had been situated during the attacks. His father was admitted to the interview room at 16.51 and shown the statements of admission.", "8. That evening the first applicant was again medically examined and no complaints or injuries were noted.", "9. The second applicant was arrested by the army at 20.55 on 7 December 1976 in relation to the same two attacks on army patrols. He was transferred to police custody at 00.40 on 8 December 1976.", "10. During his first interview, which took place between 00.40 and 01.15, he admitted to being a member of Fianna na h\u2019Eireann.", "11. He was medically examined at 01.40 and no complaints or injuries were noted.", "12. He was again interviewed under caution between 09.15 and 10.30 and during this interview he confirmed that he was a member of a proscribed organisation and admitted to being a lookout during one of the attacks. He further indicated the location of this incident by reference to a map.", "13. The second applicant was visited by a relative at 10.30. He was interviewed again from 11.50 to 13.00, and from 15.00 onward. During the second of these interviews he made a written confession in which he admitted to acting as a lookout during both attacks and carrying shotgun cartridges across the border into the Republic of Ireland.", "14. At 19.30 on 8 December 1976 he was visited by his parents, who declined to countersign his confessions. He was medically examined on the evening of 9 December 1976 and again on the morning of 10 December. On both occasions he denied any ill-treatment and no relevant sign of injury was detected.", "15. The applicants\u2019 trial took place from 15 to 18 December 1977. The first applicant was charged with one count of membership of a proscribed organisation, two counts of conspiring to communicate information likely to be of use to terrorists, one count of causing grievous bodily harm and one of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm. He entered \u201cnot guilty\u201d pleas to all counts. However, he was found to be guilty as charged and sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment. He did not appeal against conviction and his application for leave to appeal against sentence was dismissed on 17 February 1978.", "16. The second applicant pleaded \u201cguilty\u201d to one count of belonging to a proscribed organisation, two counts of conspiracy to communicate prohibited information, one count of unlawful possession of ammunition and one count of possessing ammunition without a licence. He pleaded not guilty to one count of conspiracy to cause an explosion and one count of conspiracy to discharge a firearm. He was found to be guilty as charged and sentenced to a total of ten years\u2019 imprisonment. He did not appeal against either conviction or sentence.", "17. On 18 October 2011 the applicants\u2019 cases were referred to the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (\u201cCCRC\u201d) on the grounds that there was a real possibility that the Court of Appeal would consider that the manner in which they were detained and interviewed involved significant breaches of the Judges\u2019 Rules (see paragraph 27 below) and of other protections which they should have enjoyed (namely, access to a solicitor before or during the police interviews and the presence of a family member or independent adult); that in consequence of those breaches the admissions made were unreliable and/or inadmissible; and that in the circumstances their convictions were unsafe.", "18. Judgment was delivered by the Court of Appeal on 23 May 2012. The court noted that at the time of the applicants\u2019 trial confessions made in breach of the Judges\u2019 Rules were admissible under the emergency provisions legislation (see paragraph 25 below) unless obtained by torture or inhuman or degrading treatment.", "19. In respect of the first applicant, the court held that although the confessions had been obtained in breach of the Judges\u2019 Rules because he had not had access to a solicitor, independent adult or family member, in light of the statutory background it could not conclude that the admission of the confessions rendered the conviction unsafe. In particular, it noted that the confessions were not contradictory or inaccurate, they were not challenged at trial, and the conviction was not appealed. The first applicant\u2019s appeal was therefore dismissed.", "20. The court also found no evidence that the second applicant\u2019s conviction was unsafe. In reaching this conclusion, it noted that he had pleaded \u201cguilty\u201d to most of the offences and had not challenged the admissibility or reliability of his confessions in contesting the two counts to which he pleaded \u201cnot guilty\u201d. The second applicant\u2019s appeal was also dismissed.", "21. On 7 September 2012 the Court of Appeal certified that the following point of law of general public importance was involved in the decision which ought to be considered by the Supreme Court:", "\u201cWhere in a trial conducted in accordance with the then applicable statutory emergency provisions a young person was convicted of an offence on the basis of a confession admitted at the time of trial by virtue of the statutory emergency provisions but in circumstances in which such a confession would otherwise have been excluded as having been obtained in a manner which contravened the Judges\u2019 Rules, the Administrative Directions on Interrogation and the Taking of Statements and the RUC Code and where such confession was obtained in circumstances which did not provide safeguards subsequently and currently considered to be necessary to avoid a miscarriage of justice, does such conviction fall to be considered as unsafe?\u201d", "22. However, the Court of Appeal refused to grant leave to appeal to the Supreme Court.", "23. On 7 February 2013 the Supreme Court also refused permission on the grounds that the application did not raise an arguable point of law which it ought to consider and that there was no real possibility that the court would find the convictions to be unsafe.", "24. Section 10 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 provides that:", "\u201cWhere a person has been convicted of an offence on indictment in Northern Ireland, the Commission\u2014", "(a) may at any time refer the conviction to the Court of Appeal, and", "... ... ...", "(2) A reference under subsection (1) of a person\u2019s conviction shall be treated for all purposes as an appeal by the person under section 1 of the 1980 Act against the conviction.\u201d", "25. Section 6 of the 1973 Act provided that:", "\u201c(1) In any criminal proceedings for a scheduled offence a statement made by the accused may be given in evidence by the prosecution in so far as it is relevant to any matter in issue in the proceedings and is not excluded by the court in pursuance of subsection (2) below.", "(2) If, in any such proceedings where the prosecution proposes to give in evidence a statement made by the accused, prima facie evidence is adduced that the accused was subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment in order to induce him to make the statement, the court shall, unless the prosecution satisfies them that the statement was not so obtained, exclude the statement or, if it has been received in evidence, shall either continue the trial disregarding the statement or direct that the trial shall be restarted before a differently constituted court (before whom the statement in question shall be inadmissible).\u201d", "26. The effect of section 6 was to suspend the rules and practice governing the admissibility of confessions for the period during which the legislation was in force. However, immediately following the implementation of the legislative changes, judges dealing with cases governed by the 1973 Act declared that they retained a discretion to exclude what was, by statute, otherwise admissible evidence (see, for example, R v. Corey & Others, NIJB, December 1973).", "27. A note preceding the Judges\u2019 Rules indicated they did not affect the principles:", "\u201c(c) That every person at any stage of an investigation should be able to communicate and to consult privately with a solicitor. This is so even though he is in custody provided that in such a case no unreasonable delay or hindrance is caused to the processes of investigation or the administration of justice by his doing so.", "... ... ...", "(e) That it is a fundamental condition of the admissibility in evidence against any person, equally of any oral answer given by that person to a question put by a police officer and of any statement made by that person, that it shall have been voluntary.", "The principle set out in paragraph (e) above is overriding and applicable in all cases. Within that principle the following Rules are put forward as a guide to police officers conducting investigations. Non-conformity with these Rules may render answers and statements liable to be excluded from evidence in subsequent criminal proceedings.\u201d", "28. The Administrative Directions accompanied the Judges\u2019 Rules. Paragraph 4 provided that, as far as practical, children and young persons should only be interviewed in the presence of a parent or guardian or, if that was not possible, a person who was not a police officer and was of the same sex as the child. Home Office guidance indicated that this requirement should be seen as applying to anyone under the age of seventeen.", "29. Pursuant to paragraph 7(a), a person in custody should be allowed to speak on the telephone to his solicitor or to his friends provided that no hindrance was reasonably likely to be caused to the process of investigation or to the administration of justice.", "30. The police code applicable at the relevant time provided that:", "\u201cPolice pursuing inquiries involving children and young persons must bear in mind that where at all possible children and young persons should be interviewed in the presence of a parent/guardian or other adult friend, and that the venue selected for the interview should not be one which could be calculated to intimidate, unduly embarrass or frighten the person interviewed.\u201d", "31. In HM Advocate v McLean [2009] HCJAC 97, 2010 SLT 73 the High Court of Justiciary (sitting with seven judges) had held, notwithstanding the decision of the Grand Chamber in Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, ECHR 2008, that it was not a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 3(c) for the Crown to rely at trial on admissions made by a detainee while being interviewed without having had access to a solicitor, since the guarantees otherwise available under the Scottish system were sufficient to avoid the risk of any unfairness.", "32. However, in Cadder the Supreme Court unanimously found that McLean had been incorrectly decided as the High Court of Justiciary had erred in its interpretation of Salduz. The Grand Chamber\u2019s judgment was to be understood as laying down two statements of principle: that access to a lawyer should be provided as from the first interrogation of a suspect; and that the rights of the defence would be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer were used for a conviction. There was room for a certain flexibility in the application of these requirements but they did not permit a systematic departure from it.", "33. Furthermore, the Supreme Court did not accept that the guarantees otherwise available under the Scottish system were sufficient to secure a fair trial. Those guarantees were commendable but were, in truth, incapable of removing the disadvantage that a detainee would suffer if, not having access to a solicitor for advice before he was questioned by police, he made incriminating admissions or said something which enabled the police to obtain incriminating evidence from other sources which was then used against him at his trial.", "34. That being said, the Supreme Court indicated that where incriminating statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer were used for a conviction, it would only be appropriate to quash that conviction if it was clear that there was insufficient evidence for it without the evidence of the police interview, or taking all the circumstances of the trial into account, there was a real possibility that the jury would have arrived at a different verdict had they not had that evidence before them.", "35. Finally, the Supreme Court held that, in the interests of legal certainty, the ruling should not permit the reopening of closed cases, but rather should only apply to those cases which had not yet gone to trial, to cases where the trial was still in progress, and to appeals that had been brought timeously. For all closed cases it was a matter for the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission to decide whether the cases should be referred back to the Appeal Court and for that court to decide what course it ought to take if a reference were to be made to it by the Commission."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
