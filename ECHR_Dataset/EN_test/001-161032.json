De Gaetano;Gabriele Kucsko-Stadlmayer", "TEXT": ["1. The applicant, Ms Danica Lorger, is a Slovenian national who was born in 1955 and lives in Ljubljana. She was represented before the Court by Odvetni\u0161ka Pisarna Tine \u0160najder Paunovi\u0107, a law firm practising in Ljubljana.", "3. On 22 December 2009, following her dismissal from work, the applicant brought a claim against her former employer in the Ljubljana Labour Court, requesting that the dismissal be declared unlawful and that she be reinstated to her previous position. She alleged, inter alia, that her previous employer had transferred its entire printing business to another company, and that this company (by virtue of the applicable labour law) had a duty to assume the contractual obligations of her previous employer.", "4. On 29 November 2010 the Ljubljana Labour Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim, having established that her employer had in fact closed its printing business and terminated the employment contracts of all its employees in the printing department. The court found that the termination was justified, having regard to the circumstances. Moreover, it held that the applicant\u2019s previous employer had not transferred its printing business, but had merely sold the printing equipment to another company.", "5. The first-instance judgment included information on legal remedies and drew the applicant\u2019s attention to the fact that the provisions of the Civil Procedure Act concerning the amendment and perfection of pleadings did not apply to appeal proceedings.", "6. On 14 January 2011 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Higher Labour Court.", "7. On 6 September 2011 the Higher Labour Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal, finding that the first-instance judgment did not contain any error of fact or law. The court confirmed that the sale of the printing equipment had not constituted a transfer of the business, and that the applicant was therefore not entitled to continue her employment with the new owner of the equipment.", "8. On 9 November 2011 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. The appeal document was submitted with a power of attorney, which was given for the specific purpose of lodging the appeal in the applicant\u2019s case. The power of attorney was signed by the applicant and her lawyer. The appeal document itself bore the lawyer\u2019s stamp, but was not signed by either the applicant or her lawyer.", "9. On 6 February 2012 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law as inadmissible for failure to meet the formal requirements. The court explained that sections 335 and 383 of the Civil Procedure Act set down minimum requirements for appeals on points of law: identification of the judgment which was subject to appeal and a signature of either the appellant or the lawyer. The Supreme Court noted that the appeal on points of law was not signed by either the applicant or her lawyer, rendering it incomplete. According to the rules of civil procedure, an incomplete appeal on points of law was to be rejected forthwith, without a party being given the opportunity to perfect it.", "10. On 19 April 2012 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court, alleging that one of the component parts of the appeal on points of law was the original power of attorney signed by both herself and her lawyer. The applicant was of the view that the sanction of rejecting her appeal on points of law constituted an excessive interference with her right to judicial protection and her right of appeal. The applicant pointed out that the Supreme Court\u2019s rejection had precluded her right to appeal, as the time-limit for lodging an appeal had meanwhile expired. In her opinion, in labour dispute cases such as her own, where workers, as the weaker parties, were aiming to protect their socioeconomic status, they should not be made to suffer such grave consequences. In this connection, the applicant claimed that the interference complained of was disproportionate to the aim pursued by the legislature. According to a parliamentary bulletin containing draft laws and explanatory commentary, the 2008 amendment to the Civil Procedure Act \u2013 which had, inter alia, removed the possibility of amending or perfecting incomplete pleadings in appeal proceedings \u2013 had been passed with a view to tackling the backlog of cases pending before the higher courts, thereby guaranteeing a party\u2019s right to trial within a reasonable time. The applicant, however, pointed out that the rule on the immediate rejection of incomplete pleadings did not affect an appellant\u2019s duty to pay court fees. While the higher courts continued to call upon appellants to pay fees instead of rejecting their applications forthwith, the applicant had not been afforded the possibility of remedying the procedural defect in her appeal on points of law. Having regard to the unchanged rules regarding the payment of fees, the applicant maintained that the rule in question did not in fact pursue the legitimate aim of accelerating proceedings.", "11. On 12 June 2012 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint, finding that it did not concern an important constitutional question or entail a violation of human rights which would have serious consequences for the applicant.", "12.
