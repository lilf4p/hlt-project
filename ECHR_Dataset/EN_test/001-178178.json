De Gaetano;Georges Ravarani", "TEXT": ["6. The applicant was born in 1990 and lives in Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6spata. He is of Roma origin.", "7. On 12 August 2010 at about 1.50 a.m. the applicant was taken to Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6s Police Department after he and his accomplices had been apprehended while driving a car containing goods apparently stolen from a nearby summer house.", "8. The applicant submitted that shortly afterwards, for about twenty minutes, he had been ill-treated by two police officers; at about 4.30 a.m. the two officers had returned and had continued hitting and kicking him for another thirty minutes or so. Some two hours later the two officers had escorted the applicant to another room for questioning, but had then continued beating him, together with several other officers. In the applicant\u2019s account of the events, altogether six officers and two security guards took part in the ill-treatment, with the apparent intention of extracting his confession to further offences. He stated that he had been hit in the face, forced to his knees and kicked repeatedly; a paper bag had been pulled over his head and the soles of his feet had been hit many times with a piece of wood. The officers had insisted that he admit to at least three counts of theft in order for them to stop hitting him, and they had repeatedly insulted him, making references to his Roma origin. One of them had said that they would not mind if he died \u2013 there would just be one Gypsy less.", "9. The applicant eventually signed the record of the questioning, which stated that the questioning had taken place between 5.51 a.m. and 6.33 a.m.", "10. Later that morning, at about 6 a.m., the applicant was allegedly escorted to the toilet, where he said the officers had again started hitting and kicking him. One of them had removed a towel-holder from the wall and hit the applicant\u2019s hand with it. Again, references were allegedly made to the applicant being a Roma.", "11. The applicant was released at about 2 p.m.", "12. Later that day, at the request of the applicant\u2019s mother, the general practitioner of the neighbouring village, Dr C.S., came to the applicant\u2019s house and examined him. Since she had apparently been told only about chest complaints, she did not examine the applicant\u2019s legs or feet. She did not identify any marks indicating external injury on the applicant but found that his ribs were sore and suggested that he go to hospital if he wished to obtain a medical certificate recording his injuries. Dr C.S. herself did not produce a medical report on the premises.", "13. On the same evening the applicant went to the emergency room of Bug\u00e1t P\u00e1l Hospital in Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6s. At 7.34 p.m. he was issued with a medical certificate, for which he paid the fee due, stating that he had bruises on the forehead, the nose and the left shoulder and an abrasion on the right hip; both his hands and arms were swollen and hyperaemic; and the rear surface of both thighs, as well as the soles of his feet, were swollen, red and sore. According to the certificate, the applicant had numerous contusions that had been inflicted by other persons.", "14. Still on the same evening, at 8.38 p.m., X-rays were taken of the applicant at Albert Schweitzer Hospital in Hatvan, a town at a distance of 32 kilometres, where the applicant was driven by his family members. He was diagnosed with a \u201cchest contusion\u201d, a \u201cskull contusion\u201d and \u201cbodily injury inflicted by human force\u201d.", "15. The applicant stated that he had been unhurt at the time that he had been taken to the police department. He added that between his release and the medical inspection, he had been continuously accompanied by his relatives, who testified in the ensuing proceedings that he had not suffered any injuries outside the police department.", "16. On 27 September 2010 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint alleging that he had been brutalised by police officers. The applicant alleged that during the ill-treatment the officers had made repeated references to his Roma origin. The case was being investigated by the Miskolc Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office.", "17. On 8 November 2010 the applicant was heard as a witness and shown, for the purposes of his identifying his alleged assailants, the photos of police officers serving at the Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6s Police Department. The applicant acknowledged from the outset that he would be able to identify with certainty only three of the several perpetrators. Nevertheless, he finally identified eight persons as the perpetrators \u2013 six police officers (T.B., M.Z., Gy.K., K.V., F.I. and H.A.) and two security guards employed by the police department (P.G. and Z.A.). Subsequently, the applicant became uncertain about the involvement of K.V. and H.A.", "18. The prosecutor\u2019s office appointed a forensic expert. This expert had at his disposal the medical reports issued by Bug\u00e1t P\u00e1l and Albert Schweitzer Hospitals. In his opinion given in retrospect, he made the following statement as to the time when the applicant\u2019s injuries had been sustained:", "\u201cThe exact time of the infliction of the injuries cannot be established. Given that the doctor examining the applicant did not document any lesions characteristically pointing to an inveterate injury, it can only be said that the injuries had been sustained within a 24-48-hour-time-frame preceding the medical care. Since, according to the police report on the application of coercive measures, the local police constable handed the applicant over to the officer on duty without any complaints or injuries, the injuries were likely to have occurred after this point in time.\u201d", "\u201cA s\u00e9r\u00fcl\u00e9sek pontos keletkez\u00e9si ideje nem hat\u00e1rozhat\u00f3 meg.

On 28 December 2010 the Miskolc Investigating Prosecutor\u2019s Office discontinued the investigation, holding in essence that the applicant\u2019s version of events was not plausible. The prosecutor emphasised the fact that since the applicant had been apprehended just after he had committed the crime in question (and still in possession of the proceeds of that crime), coercive interrogation by police officers with the intention of extracting his confession to the offence in question seemed pointless and thus hardly plausible. Relying on the internal records of the police department recording the shifts of the officers, the prosecutor was satisfied that three of the alleged perpetrators, Gy.K., F.I. and H.A., had alibis for the time of the incident, in that early in the morning of that day, they had been assigned to patrol service. Therefore, they could not possibly have been present at the applicant\u2019s questioning. Furthermore, the two security guards (P.G. and Z.A.) were not allowed to leave their station and thus could not have been present at the incident. The prosecutor also observed that a general practitioner had examined the applicant between his release from the police department and the first hospital inspection, but had recorded no injuries. The prosecutor also found it material that the applicant had been uncertain of the identities of the alleged perpetrators when shown photos of the Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6s police officers; that he had contradicted himself on several occasions; and that he had complained about the alleged incident only on 27 September 2010, not before.", "20. On 16 January 2012 the Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n County Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint against the discontinuation order. The prosecutor was satisfied that the investigation had been adequate and comprehensive, and that the obtaining of further evidence \u2013 in particular, by questioning the applicant\u2019s brother and friend, who were present at his release \u2013 was superfluous. The applicant\u2019s allegations about racist motives behind the ill-treatment were not addressed.", "This decision was served on the applicant on 23 January 2012.", "21. On 21 March 2012 the applicant brought a substitute private prosecution against the eight presumed perpetrators \u2013 that is to say, six police officers and two security guards \u2013 on charges of coercive interrogation. The motion included assertions about racial insults being uttered during the incident.", "22. The Eger High Court held a hearing on 26 September 2012. At that hearing the applicant stated that he did not recognise the defendants P.G. and Z.A. and that he was not certain if K.V. had beaten him, so he dropped the charges against them. Accordingly, the court terminated the proceedings against these three defendants.", "23. The remaining defendants either denied the charges or refused to make any statements. The High Court heard Dr C.S., who confirmed that she had not seen any marks of external injury on the applicant\u2019s body when examining him on the day of the incident. A court-appointed medical expert stated that if the applicant had had the injuries in question when examined by Dr C.S. then the latter must have noticed them. The court also obtained testimony from the applicant\u2019s mother and brother and a friend (the two latter had not been heard during the investigation), who had been waiting for him in front of the Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6s Police Department on his release. They all stated that the applicant had already had those injuries at the moment of his release.", "24. The High Court was satisfied that Gy.K., F.I. and H.A. had alibis for the time of the incident. As to the charges against the two other officers, T.B. and M.Z., the court highlighted that even though the applicant said that he had been ill-treated in order to force him to admit to at least three counts of theft \u2013 which he finally did \u2013 there was actually no reference in the record of the questioning to any further counts of theft. The court also emphasised that, contrary to the statements of the applicant, the two officers could not have been continuously present in the Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6s Police Department because between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. they had been carrying out some onsite inspections in another town, Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6spata.", "25. On 28 November 2012 the Eger High Court acquitted the officers for want of sufficient evidence. According to the reasoning of the judgment, the court relied on documentary evidence relating to the applicant\u2019s apprehension and questioning, documents relating to the service particulars of the officers involved, the testimony of the applicant, medical documentation, and the testimony of the officers.", "26. The applicant did not appeal.", "27. As a consequence of the applicant lodging, but subsequently withdrawing, a criminal complaint against K.V., criminal proceedings on charges of false accusation were conducted against the applicant. On 7 November 2013 the Eger District Court found him guilty as charged and placed him on three-year probation. The judgment was upheld in essence by the Eger High Court on 10 June 2014; however, the applicant\u2019s sentence was altered to 180 days of community work."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
