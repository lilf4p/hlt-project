POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Protection of property (Article 1 para. 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Deprivation of property)", "JUDGES": "Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Ledi Bianku;Paul Mahoney", "TEXT": ["5. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "6. The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Mielec.", "7. The applicant is married and has four children born in 1982, 1984, 1986 and 1994. Prior to his application for an early-retirement pension he had been unemployed with no right to unemployment benefit.", "8. On 31 May 2001 the applicant filed an application with the Rzesz\u00f3w Social Security Board (Zak\u0142ad Ubezpiecze\u0144 Spo\u0142ecznych) to be granted the right to an early-retirement pension for persons raising children who, due to the seriousness of their health condition, required constant care, the socalled \u201cEWK\u201d pension.", "9. Along with his application for a pension, the applicant submitted, among other documents concerning his daughter\u2019s health condition, a medical certificate issued by a specialist medical centre. The certificate stated that the child (born in 1994) suffered from chronic asthma and that she was in need of her parent\u2019s constant care.", "10. On 31 July 2001 the Rzesz\u00f3w Social Security Board (\u201cthe SSB\u201d) issued a decision granting the applicant the right to an earlyretirement pension in the net amount of 870.83 Polish zlotys (PLN). The pension was granted with retroactive effect of 1 May 2001.", "11. On an unknown date the Rzesz\u00f3w Social Security Board asked the Main Social Security Board\u2019s doctor (G\u0142\u00f3wny Lekarz Orzecznik) to inform it whether the applicant\u2019s daughter required the permanent care of a parent. The doctor stated that, on the basis of the medical documents, the child could not be considered as ever having required such care.", "12. On 18 July 2002 the Rzesz\u00f3w Social Security Board reopened the pension proceedings and, on 8 August 2002, the Board refused the applicant the right to early retirement and discontinued the payment of the pension with effect of 1 August 2002.", "13. The applicant appealed against the decision divesting him of the right to an early-retirement pension. He submitted that he should receive the benefit because his child required constant care, as confirmed by the medical certificate attached to the applicant\u2019s original application for a pension. Moreover, the applicant alleged that the revocation of his retirement pension was contrary to the principle of vested rights.", "14. On 24 October 2003 the Tarnobrzeg Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) amended the challenged decisions and granted the applicant the right to early retirement pension with effect of 1 August 2002. The Regional Court found that the applicant could not bear the responsibility for the mistake made by the administrative authorities. It further held that the pension proceedings could not be reopened in this case because no new circumstances had arisen; the reopening decision was based on the same circumstances freshly assessed.", "15. The Rzesz\u00f3w Social Security Board appealed against the firstinstance judgment.", "16. On 17 March 2004 the Rzesz\u00f3w Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) amended the first-instance judgment and dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal against the Social Security Board\u2019s decisions. It held, among other things, that the Social Security Board based its decisions on evidence which did not constitute basis for the original decision granting the applicant the early retirement pension, namely medical documentation concerning the applicant\u2019s daughter.", "17. On 22 June 2004 the Supreme Court (S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy) refused to entertain the cassation appeal lodged by the applicant\u2019s lawyer.", "18. Following the social security proceedings the applicant was not ordered to return his early-retirement benefits paid by the Social Security Board, despite the revocation of his right to an early-retirement pension.", "19. The Government submitted that after the revocation of the applicant\u2019s pension, he was employed between 6 and 8 August 2002, between 2 October and 31 December 2002, 19 January and 31 May 2003, 10 August and 10 October 2003, 3 November and 31 December 2003, 13 January and 6 November 2004, 30 July and 4 August 2005, 19 and 23 June 2006, 30 July and 8 December 2008. According to the Government\u2019s submissions the applicant was receiving an unemployment benefit for one year between January 2005 and January 2006 and, subsequently for 3 months in 2009.", "20.
