The applicant, Ms Izabel Skokandi\u0107, is a Croatian national who was born in 1965 and lives in \u017drnovo. She was represented before the Court by Mr I. Surjan, a lawyer practising in Zagreb.", "2. The Croatian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms \u0160. Sta\u017enik.", "3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "4. On 19 April 2004, after obtaining all the relevant permits from the competent domestic authorities, the applicant applied to the Kor\u010dula Office of the Dubrovnik State Administration (Ured dr\u017eavne uprave u Dubrova\u010dko-neretvanskoj \u017eupaniji, Ispostava u Kor\u010duli, hereinafter \u201cthe Kor\u010dula Office\u201d) for a permit for the construction of a house in \u017drnovo.", "5. On 3 August 2004 the applicant was granted a construction permit, and this decision became final on 26 August 2004.", "6. During the building work, on 24 May 2005, a building inspector of the Ministry of Ecology, Spatial Planning and Construction (Ministarstvo za\u0161tite okoli\u0161a, prostornog ure\u0111enja i graditeljstva, hereinafter \u201cthe Ministry\u201d) carried out an on-site inspection and, after examining the construction permit, found no irregularities in the work.", "7. On 21 June 2005 a certain M.C. asked the Ministry to carry out a further inspection of the applicant\u2019s construction work and her construction permit.", "8. On 11 July 2005 the construction inspector requested the Ministry to revoke the applicant\u2019s construction permit. He considered that the construction permit had not been properly issued, as it allowed construction in excess of the maximum limit of construction on a single plot of land. The inspector also considered that the construction of a flat roof as authorised by the construction permit would not be permissible under the relevant spatial planning regulations.", "9. On 17 August 2005, on the basis of its supervisory review powers, the Ministry revoked the applicant\u2019s construction permit on the grounds that the construction permit had not been issued in accordance with the relevant construction regulations.", "10. The applicant challenged this decision before the Administrative Court (Upravni sud Republike Hrvatske) on 26 September 2006, arguing that she had lawfully obtained a construction permit, which had become final and enforceable. The applicant considered that the revocation of the permit was an abuse of powers by the construction inspector, and that there had been no legal grounds to revoke the construction permit for the reasons cited by the Ministry.", "11. On 16 May 2007 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s administrative action on the grounds that it appeared from the available evidence that the applicant\u2019s construction permit had been issued contrary to the relevant construction regulations.", "12. On 5 October 2007 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint before the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske), contending that by the revocation of the construction permit the status of her property had become precarious as, although the house could not be demolished, she could never obtain a residential use permit, which was a further permit to be obtained as a necessary condition for a fully lawful use of house. She also considered that she had been made to bear an excessive individual burden as a construction investor.", "13. On 25 November 2010 the Constitutional Court declared the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded.", "14. On 28 March 2013, following the enactment of the Unlawful Construction Act (Zakon o postupanju s nezakonito izgra\u0111enim zgradama, Official Gazette no. 86/2012), which provided for the possibility of legalisation of unlawful constructions, the applicant requested legalisation of the construction status of her house.", "15. In support of that request she submitted a new architect\u2019s plan, for which she paid 15,000 Croatian kunas (HRK; approximately 1960 euros (EUR)). In addition, the Kor\u010dula Office ordered her to pay the legalisation fees in the amount of HRK 500 (approximately EUR 60).", "16.

On 13 February 2008, in decision no. U-III-822/2005, the Constitutional Court further stated by way of clarification:", "\u201c[Section 13] provides for primary and immediate responsibility of the Republic of Croatia irrespective of the level of governance (state, county, municipality or legal entity with public powers) at which damage has been caused by illegal or improper conduct. Such a responsibility of the State, which was also accepted in judicial practice (see Supreme Court decision no. Rev-903/03-2 of 4 January 2005), is an expression of the rule of law as one of the highest values of the Croatian constitutional order set out in Article 3 of the Constitution.
