The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Magadan.", "6. In April 2008 the administration of Magadan Region forwarded for review to the Magadan Regional Psychoneurological Clinic (MRPC) letters sent by the applicant to the President of the Russian Federation, the governor of the region, and 11 other administrative bodies. In these letters the applicant alleged in particular that she had a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the mayor of Magadan, that she was destined to protect people in high office, and that she was being persecuted by employees of the mayor\u2019s office.", "7. On 17 April 2008 the Chief Psychiatrist of the MRPC asked the Magadan Town Court to order an involuntary psychiatric examination of the applicant. The relevant part of the request read:", "\u201c[T]he resident psychiatrists concluded that [the applicant\u2019s letters] are morbid (delusional) and that she suffers from a mental disorder. The content of the letters reveals high levels of emotional stress, crystallised delusions, and the probability of unlawful actions against the persons involved in the delusions. The MRPC attempted to persuade the applicant to undergo a psychiatric examination voluntarily, but she refused. Her son suffers from a chronic mental disorder manifested as paranoid schizophrenia. [Accordingly] a judicial authorisation of the applicant\u2019s psychiatric examination under sections 24-25 of the Psychiatric Assistance Act 1992 [is requested] ...\u201d", "8.

On 13 October 2008 a clinical psychiatric evaluation report was issued by the panel of three psychiatrists in the MRPC. The applicant was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and paranoid syndrome. The panel noted in particular her belief that she had an affectionate relationship with the mayor of Magadan (attempting to contact him directly by phone and in person), her sense of being persecuted by the mayor\u2019s assistants, and the intense arguments during her visits to the town hall.", "11. Involuntary hospitalisation of the applicant was recommended in the light of her persistent refusal to commit herself to hospital voluntarily, her failure to acknowledge her medical condition, and the risk of significant damage to her health through aggravation of her psychiatric condition in the absence of psychiatric assistance.", "12. The MRPC submitted the application for involuntary treatment to the Magadan Town Court under Article 29 c of the Law of the Russian Federation on Psychiatric Assistance and Guarantees of Citizens\u2019 Rights related to its Administration of 1992 (Psychiatric Assistance Act 1992).", "13. On 17 October 2008 the Magadan Town Court terminated proceedings on the MRPC\u2019s application because the applicant had agreed to undergo the necessary treatment voluntarily and had signed the consent form in the courtroom. The MRPC representative thus withdrew the application for involuntary treatment.", "14. Between 17 October 2008 and 26 December 2008 the applicant was an in-patient in the MRPC, following a course of anti-schizophrenia treatment.", "15. In a letter of 6 May 2010, the Magadan Mayor\u2019s Office asked the Chief Psychiatrist of the MRPC to take \u201cprophylactic measures\u201d within his competence in respect of the applicant. The letter stated that she persistently stalked employees of the Mayor\u2019s Office, demanded that unspecified payments be made to her, and insulted and threatened individuals dealing with her.", "16. On 19 May 2010 a psychiatrist examined the applicant and established that she had not been following her medication treatment, with the result that her schizophrenia was at an acute stage. The psychiatrist recommended involuntary hospitalisation and issued the corresponding medical referral.", "17. On 20 May 2010 the applicant was interned in the MRPC.", "18. On 21 May 2010 a clinical psychiatric evaluation report was issued by the panel of three psychiatrists at the MRPC. The applicant was diagnosed with progressive paranoid schizophrenia. The panel took special note of her general medical and clinical history, with the greatest emphasis focussed on the events of 2008 and the treatment she received. In respect of developments since 2008 the report read:", "\u201cOn 20.05.2010 at 15:50 the patient Mrs Mifobova was transported to the MRPC under a referral by the psychiatrist Mr Ya. due to changes in her mental state, her expression of delusional ideas of relations, grandeur and persecution. Hospitalised involuntarily ...", "[Further follows the detailed personal, family and social profile of the applicant and her medical history in 2008]", "... Currently admitted to the MRPC due to progression of her psychiatric symptoms to an acute stage. During examination the following were identified: delusional ideas of relations, persecution, grandeur, exceptional importance. A lack of any objective attitude regarding her condition and statements was observed.", "Having regard to the above, the panel concluded that Mrs Mifobova suffers from a chronic mental disorder in the form of paranoid continuous schizophrenia and needs involuntary treatment in the MRPCV under subsections (a) and (c), Section 29 of the Psychiatric Assistance Act 1992.\u201d", "19. The application for involuntary treatment was submitted by the MRPC to the Magadan Town Court under Section 29 a and c of the Psychiatric Assistance Act of 1992, on the grounds of significant damage to her health due to the aggravation of her psychiatric condition in the absence of psychiatric assistance, posing an immediate danger to herself and others.", "20. On 24 May 2010 the Magadan Town Court made phone calls to the applicant\u2019s son, Mr L., and Mrs B., a representative of the municipal Department of Healthcare of Magadan, summoning them to attend the hearing and to act as the applicant\u2019s representatives.", "21. Mrs B\u2019s rights and duties under the letter of authority of 21 January 2010 issued by the Department of Healthcare were described as follows:", "\u201c... Mrs B is entrusted with representing the interests of the Department of Healthcare of the Magadan Mayor\u2019s Office in relation to all institutions, organisations, and commercial enterprises, and also to litigate in all judicial institutions with all the rights of a plaintiff, defendant or a third party ...\u201d", "22. On 26 May 2010, after considering the testimony of the applicant and the MRPC\u2019s representative, medical evidence, written statements from the witnesses and documentary evidence, the Magadan Town Court ordered the involuntary hospitalisation of the applicant.", "23. Present at the hearing were a representative of the hospital, a prosecutor, a representative of the municipal social services, and the applicant. The applicant\u2019s legal representative Mr L. (her son, who also suffered from schizophrenia) was notified about the hearing, but did not appear. The trial record indicated that none of the parties objected to the hearing being held in his absence, including the applicant, who stated that she had \u201ctold him not to open the door to anyone\u201d.", "24. The hearing record indicates that Mrs B (designated as a representative of a party having an interest in the proceedings) took part in the examination of the applicant (addressing one question to the representative of the MRPC), stated that there were grounds for involuntary hospitalisation, but did not take part in the closing arguments.", "25. In reaching the decision to order involuntary treatment of the applicant, the Town Court noted the applicant\u2019s long history of suffering from a chronic psychiatric disorder and her acute state of schizophrenia at the material time; her inability to control her behaviour; her lengthy exposure to harsh weather conditions while seeking encounters with the mayor on the street; the absence of anyone able to provide her with the necessary care; the appearance and behaviour of the applicant in the courtroom; the answers given to the questions addressed to her; her previous history of in-patient psychiatric treatment and the lack of any prospect of improvement outside of a specialised facility.", "26. Only the operative part of the judgment was delivered during the hearing and the applicant was never served with the full text of the judgment.", "27. On 10 June 2010, during her stay in the MRPC, the applicant lodged an appeal against the judgment. Since she had not been served with a copy of it, the appeal claims had to be confined to general statements concerning the absence of reasons for her internment. The appeal contained a request to be provided with a lawyer for the appeal proceedings, because the applicant was allegedly not allowed to use the phone in the MRPC or otherwise contact a representative of her choice.", "28. The applicant was notified of the scheduled appeal hearing by the medical personnel, but was not transferred from the hospital to the courthouse in order to participate in it.", "29. On 6 July 2010 the Magadan Regional Court held a hearing in the presence of the MRPC\u2019s representative and a prosecutor. No other party participated in the hearing, the record indicating in respect of the applicant that she \u201cwas duly informed about the date and time of the hearing, but did not appear\u201d. The applicant\u2019s request to be represented by a lawyer was neither specifically mentioned nor addressed in any way. After hearing the testimony of the hospital\u2019s representative and the opinion of the prosecutor, and reviewing the written evidence, the Regional Court upheld the lower court\u2019s authorisation in full, explicitly stating that \u201cthe arguments in the statement of appeal are essentially analogous to those examined [by the lower court]\u201d.", "30. On an unspecified date in 2010 the applicant was released from the MRPC.", "31. During the applicant\u2019s stay in the MRPC the medical personnel of the facility kept a treatment record, logging all the events considered significant.
