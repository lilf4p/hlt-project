On 1 December 2008 the Commission drew up, under section 55(6) of the 2006 Act, a report on the question whether the request for the first applicant\u2019s dismissal had been justified. It submitted the report to the plenary of the SJC for consideration.", "11. On 17 December 2008 the plenary of the SJC, the composition of which included V.V., dismissed the first applicant for professional misconduct.", "12. The first applicant challenged that decision at second instance, namely before an Appeal Panel formed within the Supreme Court (\u201cthe Appeal Panel\u201d). Such panels were set up on an ad hoc basis in each separate case. As specified under section 60 of the 2006 Act, they were composed of nine judges, of whom three were to be Supreme Court judges, four Appeal Court judges and two judges of the court of the applicant. On 24 September 2009 the Appeal Panel dismissed the first applicant\u2019s appeal and upheld the SJC\u2019s decision.", "13. On 21 July 2008 R.P., a member of the SJC, applied to the SJC for professional misconduct proceedings to be instituted in respect of the second applicant. It had been alleged that, as an on-duty investigating judge, the second applicant had not been diligent in the investigation of an incident that had occurred in the Tetovo detention centre.

On 20 January 2009 the Commission held a hearing at which R.P. and the second applicant presented their arguments and concluding remarks (\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0448\u043d\u0438 \u0437\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438). Evidence against the second", "17. On 12 February 2009 the plenary of the SJC, the composition of which included R.P., dismissed the second applicant for professional misconduct. The second applicant appealed against his dismissal to the Appeal Panel that had been formed in his case within the Supreme Court, arguing, inter alia, that he had not been given the opportunity to comment on the evidence against him when the request for his dismissal had been served on him. He also asked the Appeal Panel to inform him of the date of its session. At a hearing held in private on 5 May 2009, the Appeal Panel dismissed the second applicant\u2019s appeal.", "18.

He complained, inter alia, about the alleged refusal of his request for exclusion of Judges N.I. and J.V. who had been parties to the decision of the Appeal Panel in his case. He had requested their withdrawal because Judge N.I. had applied at the relevant time to the SJC for the post of president of a first-instance court, and Judge J.V. allegedly had a close relationship with the public prosecutor involved in the case in respect of which he had been dismissed. On 6 October 2010 the Administrative Court rejected the second applicant\u2019s action as inadmissible. That decision was upheld by the Higher Administrative Court.", "19. The second applicant produced copies of articles published in local newspapers on 26 January and 13 February 2009 reporting on his case.
