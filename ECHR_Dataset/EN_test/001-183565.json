The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Riga. At the material time he was the chairman of the supervisory board of a Latvian bank \u2013 Latvijas Kr\u0101jbanka (\u201cKr\u0101jbanka\u201d or \u201cthe Bank\u201d). The State held 32.12% of its shares.", "6. A.L. was one of the shareholders of Kr\u0101jbanka. He was also the President of the Bank until January 2002, when he voluntarily stepped down from this position. In November 2002 he was elected as a member of the Latvian Parliament (Saeima), representing a newly established political party, Latvijas Pirm\u0101 Partija (the Latvia\u2019s First Party \u2013 also referred to below as the \u201cPastors\u2019 Party\u201d), which had been established in the same year.", "7. At the material time an advertising agency, Z., was contracted by both Kr\u0101jbanka and the Latvia\u2019s First Party to provide certain advertising services.", "8. Neatkar\u012bg\u0101 R\u012bta Av\u012bze (\u201cNRA\u201d) was one of the main daily newspapers in Latvia at the material time. It was published by a joint-stock company, Preses Nams (until 2 January 2003) and, subsequently, by the limited liability company Mediju Nams.", "9. On 30 September 2002 the applicant prepared a report on the advertising and marketing expenses incurred by Kr\u0101jbanka in 2001 and the first seven months of 2002, which he then presented to the Bank\u2019s supervisory board. His report was based on information which he had requested from the heads of the marketing and economics departments. According to the applicant\u2019s report, the Bank had transferred substantial sums for advertising and marketing services to, inter alia, Z., for which no supporting documents could be found. This raised suspicions that the Bank\u2019s funds had been misappropriated. The parties did not provide the Court with a copy of the applicant\u2019s report, nor any further details of that report.", "10. On 2 October 2002 the Bank\u2019s supervisory board held an extraordinary meeting and ordered an internal audit to verify the applicant\u2019s findings. At a meeting of 16 October 2002 the head of the internal audit department informed the supervisory board that no undocumented advertising and marketing expenses had been incurred. In response to press reports (see paragraphs 13 et seq. below), the internal audit had verified all deals concluded with Z. in 2002; the internal audit in relation to 2001 was ongoing. The information published in the press had not been confirmed. The conclusions of the final report, dated 30 October 2002, indicated that in 2001 no undocumented advertising and marketing expenses had been incurred. All contracted services had been received, but on some occasions no supporting documents have been kept (for example, copies of certain advertisements in the press and some printed material \u2013 such as concert posters and tickets \u2013 were no longer available).", "11. On 16 October 2002 the supervisory board ordered an additional external audit. In May 2003 the audit agency in its report concluded that while the advertising and marketing expenses incurred in 2001 (755,000 Latvian lati (LVL), approximately 1,074,268 euros (EUR)) and 2002 (LVL 555,000, approximately EUR 789,694) had been greater than in previous years (in 1998 the figure had been LVL 374,000, approximately EUR 532,154; in 1999, LVL 324,000, approximately EUR 461,010; and in 2000, LVL 640,000, approximately EUR 910,638), this could be explained by the fact that the Bank had been in the process of changing its corporate identity during the period under consideration. This process had continued while the external audit was being carried out and the Bank had incurred more expenses in this regard. All contracts with Z. had been approved and signed by the Bank\u2019s highest management. The external audit concluded that there was no evidence that payments had been made for services or goods that had not been received or that the payments had exceeded the value of the services received. No personal links had been found between A.L. or the Bank\u2019s staff members and the advertising companies. There was no evidence that the staff members had been forced to work with the particular service provider or to prepare documents for services which the Bank had not received.", "12. Meanwhile, A.L. applied to have criminal proceedings instituted in respect of the alleged intentional dissemination of false information about him. By a final decision of 13 August 2003 the prosecution refused to institute criminal proceedings. The information and conclusions, which the applicant had provided to the journalists, had been based on erroneous findings contained in the applicant\u2019s initial report on the advertising and marketing expenses. However, there was no evidence that the applicant had intentionally disseminated false information about A.L. The latter was informed of his right to lodge a civil claim in that regard.", "13. Between August 2002 and May 2003 NRA published numerous articles on various topics of public interest concerning the 2002 parliamentary elections. It appears that NRA journalists contacted the applicant for a comment shortly after the meeting of 2 October 2012 of the Bank\u2019s supervisory board had taken place.", "14. In their submissions to the Court, the parties disagreed on the manner and form in which the applicant had provided the respective information to the NRA journalists. The Government stated that the applicant had provided this information to the journalists on several occasions, and that his comments, which had contained concrete descriptions of A.L.\u2019s actions, had been provided in the form of facts susceptible of proof. The applicant, however, stated that he had only on one occasion provided a short comment to the journalists via telephone about the issues discussed at the meeting of the Bank\u2019s supervisory board. Furthermore, the comments had constituted merely his own opinion about Kr\u0101jbanka\u2019s management; they had still needed to be verified by the Bank\u2019s internal audit.", "15. The following excerpts are from nine articles, which were published between 3 and 23 October 2002, and which were based on the information provided by the applicant in this regard:", "1. \u201c \u2018Kr\u0101jbanka\u2019s former management accused of fraud\u2019", "...", "[Since] the beginning of 2001, [LVL] 522,000 has been transferred [to finance] [Kr\u0101jbanka\u2019s] advertising and marketing activities, in respect of which no documentation \u2013 the relevant contracts, delivery/acceptance deeds etc. \u2013 has been provided ...

Moreover, significant advance payments were made [for services to be provided within a year] shortly before [a] change in Kr\u0101jbanka\u2019s management at the beginning of [2002].

[NRA] has already repeatedly written about the long-standing battle among Kr\u0101jbanka\u2019s shareholders, during which A.L. was accused several times of potentially unlawful actions ... This, however, has not prevented the friends of A.L. from resorting to extreme methods. [NRA] was informed by [the applicant] that ... at the last meeting of the supervisory board, a member of \u2018A.L.\u2019s group\u2019, V.D., asked him in a forthright manner: \u2018Have the folks from Ventspils insured your property?\u2019 \u2018This is an unprecedented event \u2013 the chairman of the Bank\u2019s supervisory board being blatantly threatened!\u2019 admitted [the applicant]. He believes that A.L. is now speculating that he will soon be afforded immunity as a member of [parliament], preventing him from being criminally prosecuted without a majority vote of [the Parliament] ... Commenting on the value of marketing, advertising and public relations contracts, [the applicant] admitted that even though it is necessary to carry out in-depth market research, during A.L.\u2019s era various procedures were breached and payments were made whose sums currently cannot be precisely determined ... NRA has already written that [LVL] 522,000 has been transferred [to finance Kr\u0101jbanka\u2019s] advertising and marketing activities since the beginning of the year 2001, in respect of which no documentation \u2013 the relevant contracts, delivery/acceptance deeds, etc. \u2013 has been provided ...

He also indicated that the applicant had provided false information to NRA, which had formed the basis of the above-mentioned nine articles (see paragraph 15 above).", "17. During a hearing of 16 January 2004 the applicant admitted before the first-instance court that the information concerning the possible misappropriation of Kr\u0101jbanka\u2019s funds, which he had provided to NRA, had proved to be incorrect. He made the following statements:", "\u201cThe information [was] wrong, unfounded. [As part of my duties] I was carrying out my task of managing [the Bank\u2019s] activities. I was not interested in A.L.\u2019s private life. I have always respected him.

On 3 October 2005 the Riga Regional Court (R\u012bgas apgabaltiesa) delivered its judgment, dismissing the claims against the applicant. The court concluded that the nine articles in question (see paragraph 15 above), which had been based on the information provided by the applicant, had reported his personal opinion about the functioning of Kr\u0101jbanka and its management, which could not be considered defamatory. Moreover, no claim for defamatory information to be retracted was lodged against the applicant. The claims against both publishers of NRA (Preses Nams and Mediju nams) were partly upheld in so far as they concerned six out of the nine articles which had been based on information provided by the applicant and six other articles reporting on other matters.", "19. On 28 May 2007 the Civil Cases Chamber of the Supreme Court (Augst\u0101k\u0101s tiesas Civillietu tiesu pal\u0101ta) \u2013 after appeals by A.L., Preses Nams, and Mediju nams \u2013 re-examined the case and delivered a new judgment. The judgment took immediate effect.", "20. The appellate court noted that at the material time the press and other mass media had been widely reporting on the 2002 parliamentary elections \u2013 that is to say the political parties and their leaders, including the newly-established political party, of which A.L. was one of the leaders. He had stood for election, his candidacy had been widely advertised and it had been, accordingly, examined by the press and other mass media. NRA had published a series of articles about the money spent on the pre-election advertising of the Latvia\u2019s First Party, linking the source of these funds to Kr\u0101jbanka and its former President, A.L. It had been reported that during his time in office, LVL 522,000 had been transferred for advertising and marketing purposes without any documentary proof thereof having been preserved and that this had been considered to constitute a misappropriation of the bank\u2019s funds. These funds had been spent on the party\u2019s large-scale advertising; as the applicant had put it: \u201c[T]his money has been stolen from the shareholders\u201d. The nine articles had also contained other information provided by the applicant \u2013 that during A.L.\u2019s time in office, there had been breaches not only in relation to the advertising expenses, but also other breaches in respect of banking operations, payments without approval, the administration of certificate accounts against the interests of the Bank and the State.", "21. The appellate court stated that the information contained in those articles about the use of Kr\u0101jbanka\u2019s funds and transactions had been provided by the applicant (who had mentioned specific sums), and that the articles had contained references to his statements.", "22. The appellate court found that since the applicant had provided this information to NRA journalists, he had to bear responsibility for giving and disseminating false information. The court held that this information had not corresponded to the facts and that this had been acknowledged by the applicant himself during the hearing before the first-instance court (see paragraph 17 above). This had also been confirmed by the results of the external audit and by the prosecution (see paragraphs 11 and 12).", "23. The court also held that the journalists had not had a responsibility to verify the accuracy of the provided information, since the applicant\u2019s status as the chairman of the supervisory board of Kr\u0101jbanka had created a legitimate expectation that the provided information was correct.", "24. Lastly, the court found that, even if the margin of permissible criticism in respect of A.L. as a member of parliament was necessarily a wider one than would normally be the case, the false information had nevertheless offended his honour and dignity, as it had contained serious allegations of unlawful activities and had given the impression that A.L. was a dishonest person.", "25. Given the above, and in view of the seriousness of the interference and the applicant\u2019s position in the Bank, the court ordered the applicant to pay compensation to A.L. in connection with the nine articles in the amount of LVL 10,000 (approximately EUR 14,229), together with statutory interest (6% per annum).", "26. In addition, the court upheld the claim against Preses Nams alone in respect of one other article, and ordered it to pay compensation in the amount of LVL 5,000 (approximately EUR 7,114), together with statutory interest (6% per annum).", "27. The applicant and Preses Nams were also ordered to pay A.L.\u2019s legal costs in the amount of LVL 495 (approximately EUR 704) and LVL 375 (approximately EUR 534) respectively.", "28. The appellate court dismissed A.L.\u2019s claims against Preses Nams and Mediju Nams as regards all the other articles that had not been based on any information provided by the applicant.", "29. On 28 June 2007 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the Senate of the Supreme Court (Augst\u0101k\u0101s tiesas Sen\u0101ts). He did not contest that the information he had provided to the journalists had turned out not to be supported by evidence. However, this information had constituted his evaluation of the actions taken by Kr\u0101jbanka\u2019s management as a whole. He had not directly mentioned A.L. by name, surname or his position when giving the information to the journalists. His allegations regarding the misappropriation of Kr\u0101jbanka\u2019s funds could only have infringed the interests of the Bank as a legal entity; it could not have offended the honour and dignity of certain executives, who had been under an obligation to inform the supervisory board and the mass media of the truth. Furthermore, the applicant had provided the information in the form of a supposition by indicating that it still needed to be verified by the Bank\u2019s internal audit. It was the NRA journalists who had linked the applicant\u2019s report with the allegations of wrongdoing by A.L. Thus, the applicant could not be held responsible for the manner in which the journalists had decided to present this information, since he had had no means of influencing this.", "30. On 30 January 2008 the Senate of the Supreme Court delivered a new judgment, which in essence upheld the appellate court\u2019s judgment. The relevant parts of the judgement read as follows:", "\u201c[The appellate court\u2019s] conclusion that the applicant had disseminated defamatory and false information was supported by the applicant\u2019s own submissions before the first-instance court, in which he admitted that he had provided incorrect information to [the journalists] ... . The fact that this information was not truthful was confirmed by [the audit agency and the prosecution].", "The applicant in his appeal on points of law did not contest these findings. ... He merely noted that he was a source and could not influence the evaluation given by the journalists.", "Having examined the testimony of [the NRA journalists], the appellate court found that the false information provided by the applicant had related not to Kr\u0101jbanka\u2019s management, as the applicant indicated, but specifically to A.L., as the then President of the Bank, thus infringing his honour and dignity. ...", "[The appellate court] found that the journalists had had no reason to doubt the credibility of the information, as it had been provided by the applicant [in his capacity as] chairman of the supervisory board of Kr\u0101jbanka, and his position had undoubtedly created a legitimate expectation that this information was true ... Accordingly, the appellate court rightly held that the journalists had had no obligation to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the applicant. ...", "A.L. had requested compensation in the amount of LVL 10,000 from [the applicant]. By granting his claim, the [appellate] court, taking into account the scope of the distributed information and its audience, rightly considered it justified.\u201d", "The Senate of the Supreme Court also upheld the claim against Preses Nams alone in respect of one other article; they held that A.L.\u2019s honour and dignity had not been offended in other articles. The appellate court had referred to the Court\u2019s case-law and had taken into account A.L.\u2019s status and the fact that he had refused to offer comment. The appellate court had correctly applied the relevant principle that the journalistic freedom also covered possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation; the Senate referred to a/s Diena and Ozoli\u0146\u0161 v. Latvia (no. 16657/03, \u00a7 84, 12 July 2007) in this regard.", "Referring to section 2352a of the Civil Law and section 29(3) of the Law on the Mass Media, the Senate of the Supreme Court ordered the applicant (who had disseminated that defamatory information), and not Preses Nams, to retract the relevant parts of the articles in question (see paragraph 15 above). The latter, however, still remained obliged to publish the retracted information."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
