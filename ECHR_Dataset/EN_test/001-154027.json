On 6 December 2010 a three-judge panel of the Skopje Court of Appeal, presided over by the applicant (including Judges I.L. and M.S.), decided, in second instance, to grant an appeal of a detainee.

On 10 December 2010 a five-judge panel of the Supreme Court, presided over by Judge J.V., the President of the Supreme Court at the time, held a session at which the public prosecutor\u2019s request was examined. The Supreme Court accepted the prosecutor\u2019s amended request (\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043e) and stated inter alia that:", "\u201cThe Supreme Court finds that Skopje Court of Appeal, which decided the appeal ... against the decision ... in which the Skopje Court of First Instance had dismissed a request for termination of pre-trial detention (\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043b\u043e\u0433 \u0437\u0430 \u0443\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440) as unsubstantiated, had no statutory ground to decide the complaints on the merits, but, on the contrary, it was bound by law to establish that the appeal ... was inadmissible ...\u201d", "9. On 10 December 2010 the criminal division of the Supreme Court composed of six judges of that court, including Judge J.V.

Following an examination of the record of the deliberations of the Skopje Court of Appeal regarding the decision of 6 December 2010 (see paragraph 7 above), the criminal division of the Supreme Court concluded that two judges had disclosed professional misconduct. The relevant part of the record of that session reads as follows:", "\u201c... the criminal division of the Supreme Court unanimously found (\u0435\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e \u0441\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0443\u0447\u043e\u043a) that there had been professional misconduct by two judges of the Skopje Court of Appeal who had adjudicated in the case \u041a\u0441\u0436.\u0431\u0440. 537/2010.", "The President of the Supreme Court, J.V., then closed the session of the criminal division.\u201d", "10.

This request was submitted pursuant to sections 78 and 79 of the State Judicial Act 2010 (\u201cthe Act\u201d, see paragraph 20 below) according to which a member of the SJC or the president of the higher court can seek that professional misconduct proceedings were launched regarding a judge. As stated in the request, there were reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant and Judge I.L. had exercised the office of judge in an unprofessional and unconscientious manner given that they had voted in favour of the decision of 6 December 2010 in the criminal case \u041a\u0441\u0436.\u0431\u0440. 537/2010, which had been in violation of the Criminal Proceedings Act. In support, he submitted copies of the decisions of 6 and 10 December 2010 (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above).", "11. On 23 December 2010 the plenary of the SJC, including Judge J.V., discussed Judge J.V.\u2019s request for determination of professional misconduct on the part of the applicant and accepted it as timely, complete and admissible. It also set up a Commission for determination of professional misconduct by the applicant (\u201cthe Commission\u201d), composed of five of its members, including the President of the SJC (see section 80 of the Act, paragraph 20 below). The composition of the Commission did not include Judge J.V.", "12. On 29 December 2010 the Commission communicated Judge J.V.\u2019s request and the supporting evidence to the applicant. On 18 January 2011 the applicant responded in writing and provided evidence in support (see section 81 of the Act, paragraph 20 below). Judge I.L. resigned in the meantime.

On 23 February 2010, the plenary of the SJC, including Judge J.V., initiated professional misconduct proceedings against the applicant and temporarily suspended him from the office of judge.

After the applicant had presented his arguments verbally, the President of the Commission put several questions to him. The applicant\u2019s lawyer and judge J.V. did not put any questions notwithstanding that they were provided with such an opportunity. Then, the applicant and judge J.V. made concluding remarks. The record of the hearing indicated that under section 92 of the Act (see paragraph 20 below), the Commission would draw up a report, which would be communicated to the SJC for consideration. The record of the hearing was signed by the applicant, judge J.V., as the complainant, and the members of the Commission (see section 90 of the Act, paragraph 20 below).

He also sought withdrawal of judge J.V. and all the Supreme Court judges. In support he stated that there was a conflict of interest, as judge J.V. had sought his dismissal and had later voted for it as an ex officio member of the SJC. The position he held was such that he could influence other judges of that court.", "18. On 13 September 2011 the Appeal Panel dismissed the appeal and confirmed the SJC\u2019s decision dismissing him from the office of judge. It also refused his request for the withdrawal of judges. It found that it was the plenary of the Supreme Court, and not the Appeal Panel, which had competence to decide on the applicant\u2019s request for the withdrawal of the President of the Supreme Court.
