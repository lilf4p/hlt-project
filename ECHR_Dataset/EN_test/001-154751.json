However, given the character of the applicant\u2019s ailments, her state of health needed to be also assessed by relevant specialists, in particular, a neurologist and a gastroenterologist. The medical opinions relied on by the Regional Court did not contain this kind of assessment.", "37. In its decision of 24 February 2012 the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Court refused to grant the applicant a temporary release. It was of the view that the applicant\u2019s condition could be treated in detention, having regard to a medical certificate of 10 January 2012 (see paragraph 27 above). It noted that the applicant received necessary medical care, including consultations by specialists. The applicant\u2019s medical documentation did not substantiate a conclusion that her continued detention would seriously endanger her life or health.", "38. The applicant appealed. The \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Court of Appeal dismissed her appeal on 24 April 2012. It shared the conclusions of the lower court as to the applicant\u2019s state of health and her being fit for detention. The appellate court stressed that it transpired from the medical opinion of 10 January 2012 that the applicant had been examined not only by general practitioners but also by specialists in surgery, psychiatry, neurology and gastroenterology. The opinions of the specialists confirmed that the applicant could be treated in detention.
