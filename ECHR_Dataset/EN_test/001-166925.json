The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Prague.", "6. The applicant claims to have been living in Prague since 18 November 2000, when the Czech authorities granted him a visa for an extended stay (a long-term residence permit). On 18 February 2008 the applicant was granted the right to reside permanently in the Czech Republic (a permanent residence permit). However, he did not de-register his domicile (prebivali\u0161te) in Croatia.", "7. On 5 June 2008 the applicant bought a car (a Mercedes S 350 L) in Germany and on 10 June 2008 he registered it in the Czech Republic in his name.", "8. On 11 June 2008 the applicant entered Croatia in his car. He claimed that the purpose of his visit was, inter alia, to de-register his domicile in Croatia.", "9. On 15 June 2008 the applicant was stopped by the police in Zagreb while driving his car. The police authorities, finding it suspicious that a Croatian national was driving a car with foreign licence plates, impounded the car and reported the matter to the Customs Administration, suspecting that the car had been imported into Croatia without payment of the relevant taxes and that an administrative offence had thus been committed.", "10. On 17 June 2008 the applicant de-registered his domicile in Croatia.", "11. On 15 September 2008 the applicant re-registered his domicile in Croatia.", "12. Meanwhile, on 16 June 2008 the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance had instituted administrative proceedings (upravni postupak) with a view to establishing whether the applicant was liable to pay taxes on the importation of his vehicle and if so, in what amount. On the same day the Customs Administration had issued a decision impounding the applicant\u2019s car, against which the applicant did not appeal.", "13. On 11 December 2008 the Customs Administration issued a decision ordering the applicant to pay, by 30 December 2008, the customs debt (consisting of the VAT and the special tax on motor vehicles) owed on the importation of his car, which amounted to 527,747.08 Croatian kunas (HRK).", "14. The applicant did not appeal against that decision, which thus became final and enforceable on 3 January 2009.", "15. Since the applicant did not pay the above sum, on 23 February 2009 the Customs Administration instituted administrative enforcement proceedings and issued a decision confiscating his car and ordering its sale with a view to collecting the above-mentioned customs debt.", "16. By a decision of 5 June 2009 the Ministry of Finance, as the second-instance administrative authority, dismissed an appeal by the applicant and upheld the first-instance decision of 23 February 2009.", "17. On 6 October 2009 the applicant brought an action in the Administrative Court (Upravni sud Republike Hrvatske).", "18. On 9 May 2012 that court, which in the meantime had become the High Administrative Court (Visoki upravni sud Republike Hrvatske), dismissed the applicant\u2019s action.", "19. In the meantime, on 17 July 2008 the Customs Administration had also instituted administrative offence proceedings (prekr\u0161ajni postupak) against the applicant for importing his car into Croatia without paying the relevant taxes.", "20. On 31 July 2008 the Customs Administration found the applicant guilty of committing an administrative offence under section 241(1) subparagraph 10 of the Customs Act (see paragraph 29 below), and fined him HRK 5,000. The Customs Administration found that the applicant had had his domicile in Croatia at the time of the commission of the offence. Therefore, it was irrelevant that he did not pay income tax in Croatia, that he had health insurance in the Czech Republic and not in Croatia, and that he had been granted the right to reside permanently in the Czech Republic. By having his domicile in Croatia he failed to satisfy the conditions for exemption from payment of customs duties set forth in Article 5 of Annex C to the Convention on Temporary Admission (\u201cthe Istanbul Convention\u201d), which stated that the registered owner of a vehicle registered abroad must, in order to qualify for exemption, have his domicile outside the territory of the State into which the vehicle was being brought (see paragraph 45 below).", "21. On 8 September 2008 the High Court for Administrative Offences (Visoki prekr\u0161ajni sud Republike Hrvatske) quashed the first-instance decision on account of incomplete facts, and remitted the case to the Customs Administration. The relevant part of that decision reads as follows:", "\u201c[The Customs Administration] states, as the decisive reason for its decision to find the accused guilty, that [he] has his domicile in ... Croatia, at [an] address in Zagreb, ..., and that the fact that he possesses a residence permit, that is, a valid visa, of the Czech Republic, is not sufficient evidence for the accused to be entitled to import [his] vehicle with total exemption from customs duties under the Convention on Temporary Admission.", "However, it is precisely such explanation of the contested decision that, along with the other elements in the case file, shows that the taking of evidence was flawed, that [the Customs Administration] did not give [sufficient] reasons for the decisive facts on which it based its decision, and that they [that is, those facts and the reasons given] are in strong contradiction with each other. [In particular, the Customs Administration] while acknowledging the fact that [the accused] possesses a residence permit, that is, a visa, of the Czech Republic, further gives as reasons [to support the finding] that the accused has a domicile in ... Croatia, that he is not a taxpayer in ... Croatia, and that he is not even insured with the Croatian Health Insurance Fund.", "....", "... [D]uring the first-instance proceedings [before the Customs Administration] the accused stated circumstances and furnished evidence which, in his view, suggested that he had not committed the offence of which he was accused. [The Customs Administration therefore] needed to examine the evidence more thoroughly with a view to establishing the [relevant] facts completely and correctly.", "...", "This court considers that what is missing in the present case are the reasons for not accepting the status of the accused in the Czech Republic, the explanation of where the accused actually lives [resides] and, consequently, a clear conclusion as to whether or not he satisfied the conditions set out in Article 5 of Annex C of the Convention on Temporary Admission ....\u201d", "22. In the resumed proceedings, by a decision of 9 October 2008 the Customs Administration again found the applicant guilty of committing the same administrative offence and fined him HRK 5,000. The Customs Administration again found that at the time of the commission of the offence the applicant had had his domicile in Croatia according to the Domicile and Residence of Citizens Act (see paragraph 32 below) and thus did not satisfy the conditions for exemption from payment of customs duties set forth in Article 5 of Annex C to the Istanbul Convention (see paragraph 45 below). Therefore, the fact that the applicant resided in the Czech Republic was of no relevance as he had not proved that he had his domicile there. The relevant part of that decision reads as follows:", "\u201cAfter having examined the evidence ..., this authority finds that the accused, Miljenko \u017daja, committed the customs-related administrative offence he was charged with, defined in section 241(1) subparagraph 10 of the Customs Act.", "Section 241(1) subparagraph 10 [of the Customs Act] provides that a fine for an administrative offence is to be imposed on a person who treats goods as if they satisfy the conditions for temporary admission, and that conduct is contrary to the conditions for the temporary admission of goods set forth in the Customs Act or in the [Istanbul] Convention.", "In the proceedings it was established beyond doubt that on 15 June 2008 the accused was found operating the vehicle in question with foreign licence plates of the Czech Republic on the territory of Croatia as if he satisfied the conditions for temporary admission, and that conduct was contrary to the conditions for temporary admission of goods set forth in the Customs Act or in the [Istanbul] Convention because he was a Croatian national who at the time of the commission of the offence had his domicile in Croatia.", "The rights and obligations of participants in customs proceedings and the powers of the customs authorities as regards means of transport imported by natural persons into Croatian customs territory are regulated by the provisions of the [Istanbul] Convention. Likewise, customs proceedings and supervision of means of transport with foreign licence plates in the Croatian customs territory is regulated by the provisions of the Customs Act and the Decree on the implementation of the Customs Act.", "It is established beyond dispute that the accused is a Croatian national who at the time of ... the offence had his domicile in ... Croatia. His defence that he had a registered residence in the Czech Republic was not accepted as a ground for exemption from liability ... Namely, the mere fact that he possesses a residence permit is not a proof that would entitle him to import [his] car with total relief from payment of customs duties under the Convention on Temporary Admission because he does not have his domicile abroad.", "This is so because the procedure for temporary admission of private means of transport is regulated by Article 5 of Annex C to the [Istanbul] Convention in such a way that means of transport for private use must be registered in a territory other than that of temporary admission in the name of a person having a seat or domicile outside the territory of temporary admission and be imported and used by persons residing in that territory.", "As regards his personal status, it has been established beyond doubt that the accused is a Croatian national, and that until 17 May 2008 he had [his] domicile in Croatia, in Zagreb. Furthermore, after the accused was reported as having committed the administrative offence, he de-registered his domicile in Zagreb \u2013 in this authority\u2019s view \u2013 merely to avoid liability for the offence. At the time of the commission of the offence the accused did not satisfy the conditions for temporary importation with total relief and [was thus not entitled to] operate a vehicle with foreign licence plates. Namely, [Article 5 of] Annex C to the [Istanbul] Convention expressly provides that the right to temporary importation belongs to persons who have domicile outside the territory of temporary admission, that is, outside Croatia.", "This authority has examined the argument of the accused that he is not a taxpayer in Croatia, which is evident from the certificate of 23 June 2008 issued by the Tax Administration, as well as the evidence [to the effect] that he is neither insured with the Croatian Health Insurance Fund nor has social security [cover] in Croatia. However, that evidence cannot lead to the adoption of a different decision, because the fact of [having or not] health insurance or social security is not evidence of domicile abroad.", "This authority has also taken into account the fact that the accused had health insurance in the Czech Republic as of 3 October 2007. However, having [health] insurance is itself not relevant for the adoption of a different decision because the fact of [possessing] insurance, which according to the accused\u2019s own statement is voluntary, does not give [him] the right to temporary admission of the vehicle in question with total relief.", "On the basis of these findings of fact, and in accordance with the foregoing provisions, this authority has established beyond doubt that the accused did not satisfy the conditions for temporary admission, and that, by handling the vehicle in question contrary to [those] conditions, he committed the administrative offence defined in section 241(1) subparagraph 10 of the Customs Act.", "This authority has [also] examined the argument of the accused that he is registered in the Czech Republic [as an alien] for an extended stay, of which he submitted evidence [in the form of] a certificate [issued] by the Police of the Czech Republic. However, that evidence does not prove his domicile abroad, but only his stay. What is more, at the hearing held on 30 September 2008 the accused himself stated only the fact of his residence in the Czech Republic, which confirms that at the time of the commission of the offence he did not satisfy the conditions for the temporary admission of vehicles with total relief, in accordance with Annex C to the [Istanbul] Convention.", "In particular, it is beyond doubt that at the time of the commission of the offence the accused had his domicile in Croatia. Section 2 of the Domicile and Residence of Citizens Act provides that a citizen\u2019s domicile is the place where he has settled with the intention of permanently living there, and in which he has permanent accommodation secured.", "The solemn statement of the commercial company [ERC] of 13 August 2008 stating that it would provide accommodation for Miljenko \u017daja as of 1 January 2008 was also examined in the proceedings. However, [that statement] is not decisive for exempting [the accused] from liability because it was issued after this authority adopted its [first] decision of 31 July 2008 and because the statement in question does not give him the right to temporary admission with total relief.", "The statement given by P.\u0106. (before a notary public on 22 September 2008), which was also examined during the proceedings, is illogical and contrary to [both] the statement of Miljenko \u017daja and the solemn statement of 13 August 2008 in that it suggests that the flat [in Prague in which the applicant claimed to be living] was rented to P.\u0106., and not to the accused, whereas the solemn statement of ERC of 13 August 2008 suggested that it provided Miljenko \u017daja with accommodation at the address [in Prague]. After examining that evidence, this authority considers that it was obtained with a view to proving that the accused had rented accommodation to live in abroad.", "Moreover, the evidence of the accused that his wife is a director of company PZM in Prague is not relevant either, because in his statement of 22 July 2008 he stated that his wife lived in Zagreb and had her business in Croatia.", "This authority does not dispute the fact that the accused is disabled, with a degree of disability of 100%, of which he submitted as evidence a membership card [issued by an association of disabled persons] in his name indicating his domicile [as being] in Zagreb ...", "In the proceedings all the evidence furnished by the accused was examined. However, by that evidence the accused did not prove that he had been living abroad.", "From all the evidence it is apparent that at the time of the commission of the offence the accused was a Croatian national who had his domicile in Croatia, with all the rights and obligations attached to that. The accused could not pose in Croatia as a person having domicile abroad and enjoy the rights of [such] a person in [his own] country, where until 17 June 2008 he had his domicile. Therefore, the accused did not satisfy the conditions for the temporary admission of a foreign car to the territory of the Republic of Croatia with total relief under Annex C [to the Istanbul Convention] and the Decree on the implementation of the Customs Act because his domicile was in Croatia at the time of the commission of the offence.", "In the light of the foregoing, this authority has adopted a decision finding the accused guilty, as stated in the operative provisions.\u201d", "23. By a decision of 29 October 2008 the High Court for Administrative Offences dismissed an appeal by the applicant and upheld the first-instance decision, endorsing the reasons given therein. The relevant part of that decision reads as follows:", "\u201cAgainst the first-instance decision the accused ... lodged ... an appeal on the grounds of breaches of procedure, incomplete and incorrect findings of fact, misapplication of the substantive law, and a wrong decision on the sanction. In the appeal the accused essentially argues ... that he has proved that at the time of entry into the Republic of Croatia he satisfied all statutory requirements for legally entering [Croatia] with the car in question, that the first-instance authority called into question the validity of the visa of the Czech Republic, where he was [first] granted an extended stay, and from 18 February 2008 the right to reside permanently, [and] that he uses the flat in Prague without restrictions. He therefore considers that there are no legal grounds or evidence for a finding that he committed the administrative offence in question.", "...", "The appeal is unfounded.", "...", "The accused unjustifiably denies liability for the administrative offence committed, because the first-instance authority[,] ... on the basis of his statement given at the hearing of 30 September 2008 and ... the written evidence[,] ... correctly concluded that his conduct had all the elements of the administrative offence defined in section 241(1) subparagraph 10 of the Customs Act. [The accused] was on 15 June 2008 in Zagreb found operating a Mercedes Benz vehicle ... with foreign licence plates of the Czech Republic as if he satisfied the conditions for temporary admission, and that conduct was contrary to the conditions for temporary admission of goods given that at the time of the commission of the offence he had his domicile in Croatia. Since that conduct was contrary to the conditions for temporary admission of goods set forth in the Customs Act and the [Istanbul] Convention, he committed the administrative offence defined in section 210(1) subparagraph 10 of the Customs Act.", "...", "The other appellate arguments are also unfounded because the ... Customs Administration ... correctly and accurately established the [relevant] facts ... and correctly applied the substantive law...", "In particular, special conditions for the temporary importation of means of transport are prescribed in Article 5 of Annex C to the Convention on Temporary Admission in Chapter III, where subparagraph (b) provides that means of transport for private use must be registered in a territory other than that of temporary admission, in the name of a person having seat or domicile in a territory other than that of temporary admission, and [must] be imported and used by persons having domicile in such a territory. The Domicile and Residence of Citizens Act in its section 2 provides that domicile is the place where a citizen has settled with the intention of permanently living there.", "Therefore, given that during the [first-instance] proceedings the decisive fact that the accused is a Croatian national who at the time of the commission of the offence had his domicile in the territory of the Republic of Croatia was established beyond doubt, he did not satisfy the conditions for temporary admission of a foreign car to the territory of the Republic of Croatia set out in the above-cited provisions of the Annex to the Convention on Temporary Admission.", "[This court] therefore upholds as correct in its entirety the decision of the first-instance authority ... whereby the accused was found guilty and sanctioned for the administrative offence defined in section 210(1) subparagraph 10 of the Customs Act ...\u201d", "24. The applicant then, on 12 November 2008, lodged a constitutional complaint against the second-instance decision, alleging violations of his constitutional rights to fair proceedings, equality before the law and equality before the courts and other public authorities. In so doing he relied on Article 14 paragraph 2, Article 26 and Article 29 paragraph 1 of the Croatian Constitution (see paragraph 26 below). He argued that the High Court for Administrative Offences had misinterpreted the text of Article 5 of Annex C to the Istanbul Convention, which in the official text did not refer to \u201cdomicile\u201d but to \u201cliving\u201d abroad. Therefore, the fact that while living in Prague he had kept his domicile in Croatia was not relevant. The applicant further argued that the meaning given to certain legal terms in domestic legislation could not be relied on in interpreting the same or similar terms used in international agreements. In particular, the applicant argued as follows:", "\u201cIn the decision [of 29 October 2008] the High Court for Administrative Offences totally wrongly quoted the text of Article 5 subparagraph (b) ... of Annex [C] to the Convention on Temporary Admission by stating [that it] \u2018provides that means of transport for private use must be registered in a territory other than that of temporary admission, in the name of a person having seat or domicile in a territory other than that of temporary admission, and [must] be imported and used by persons having domicile in such a territory\u2019 [emphasis added].", "However, the text Article 5 subparagraph (b) ... of Annex [C] to the Convention on Temporary Admission published in the Official Gazette [\u2013 International agreements] no. 16/98 is completely different and reads:", "\u2018... means of transport for private use must be registered in a territory other than that of temporary admission, in the name of a person having seat or domicile in a territory other than that of temporary admission, and [must] be imported and used by persons living in such a territory\u2019 [emphasis added].", "The obvious difference between [the two texts] is that the High Court for Administrative Offences refers to [having] domicile in the territory of another State as a condition for using a foreign car whereas the text of the Convention [on Temporary Admission] ... refers to ... living in the territory of another State, which is legally not the same.", "Besides, the fact of living in the territory of another State, that is, in the State from which the disputed car originates, cannot be assessed in accordance with Croatian laws, and especially not in the way [the High Court for Administrative Offences] did it, but in accordance with the Convention [on Temporary Admission] itself and the Decree on the implementation of the Customs Act, .... [T]hat fact of living in the territory of another State is to be proved by work or residence permit.", "... all customs offices in Croatia have, upon a citizen\u2019s entry into [Croatia] by car, been establishing the fact of living in another State by checking only work or residence permit.", "It is evident that in the instant case [the authorities] departed from the relevant law and the established practice ... by deliberately misquoting the relevant provisions with a view to creating conditions for the complainant\u2019s conviction at all costs.", "...", "[T]he complainant proved beyond doubt, by presenting a valid visa for an extended stay, the contract on the use of a flat and a social security certificate, that he has de jure and de facto been living in the Czech Republic, and that he had legally bought the car in accordance with the Czech laws. [It follows that] the complainant perfectly legally entered Croatia in accordance with Article 5 subparagraph (b) ... of [Annex C to] the Convention on Temporary Admission, and that by so doing he did not commit a customs offence defined in section 241(1) subparagraph 10 of the Customs Act. In any event, the customs office [in question] would not have allowed the complainant to enter the territory of Croatia if he did not satisfy the said conditions.", "It is totally unclear why the complainant should, as stated in the first-instance decision, pay any customs debt [in the situation] where he did not ask for customs clearance but only temporary admission. If the customs authorities considered that temporary admission was not allowed then they could have ordered that the car be exported from Croatia ... at the expense of the complainant.", "The above described proceedings are certainly a chicanery for the reasons as stated and at the same time constitute a dangerous precedent for all other citizens of Croatia ...", "If such proceedings would apply to all Croatian nationals operating cars with foreign licence plates, only a few [such] cars daily could enter Croatia. Besides, if that view of the lower judicial and other authorities on the [interpretation of the relevant] substantive law is to be accepted, not a single one of hundreds of thousands of Croatian citizens temporarily working in Germany, Italy or Switzerland could enter Croatia because they all legally have domicile in Croatia. [In this way] several thousands of cars should be confiscated every year, especially from citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina having double nationality who enter Croatia on a daily basis.", "In particular, the [contested] decisions infringed the right to impartial and fair proceedings guaranteed by Article 29 of the Croatian Constitution because for the reasons set out above those decisions are certainly neither fair nor impartial. On the contrary, they are absolutely biased and blatantly unfair.", "The decision to prosecute only the complainant and not hundreds of thousands of others certainly constitutes a violation of Article 14 paragraph 2 of the Constitution whereby equality before the law is guaranteed to the complainant, and also of Article 26 of the Constitution which guarantees equality of all Croatian citizens before courts and other State authorities.\u201d", "25. By a decision of 8 April 2009 the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) dismissed the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint, finding that the contested decisions were based on a \u201cconstitutionally acceptable interpretation and application of the relevant substantive law\u201d. The Constitutional Court\u2019s decision was served on the applicant\u2019s representative on 22 April 2009. It reads as follows:", "\u201c5. According to section 241(1) subparagraph 10 of the Customs Act a ... natural person shall be liable for an administrative offence if he or she handles [the] goods as if they satisfy the conditions for temporary admission, and that conduct is contrary to the conditions for temporary admission of goods set forth in the Customs Act or in the Convention on Temporary Admission,", "Convention on Temporary Admission, Annex C, Article 5 subparagraph (b) provides as follows:", "(b) means of transport for private use must be registered in a territory other than that of temporary admission, in the name of a person having seat or domicile in a territory other than that of temporary admission, and be imported and used by persons living in such a territory.", "Having regard to the cited provisions of the Customs Act and Article 5 subparagraph (b) of the Annex C to the Convention on Temporary Admission, as well as the facts established in the proceedings ... (in particular the fact that it was established ... that at the time of the commission of the offence the complainant had registered domicile in Croatia in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Domicile and Residence of Citizens Act), the Constitutional Court finds that the legal views expressed in the contested decisions are based on a constitutionally acceptable interpretation and application of the relevant substantive law. The Constitutional Court considers that the relevant administrative authority and the High Court for Administrative Offences, relying on the facts established in the proceedings, gave reasons for their views expressed in the contested decisions, which undoubtedly do not result from an arbitrary interpretation and application of the relevant substantive law.", "The Constitutional Court therefore finds that the complainant\u2019s right to equality before the law guaranteed by Article 14 paragraph 2 of the Constitution was not violated by the contested decisions.", "6. Article 29 paragraph 1 of the Constitution provides as follows:", "Everyone has the right that an independent and impartial court established by law decides fairly and within a reasonable time on his rights or obligations, or as regards suspicion or accusation of a criminal offence.", "[In the present case] the administrative and judicial authorities acted within their jurisdiction established by law. It is evident from the case-file that the first-instance administrative authority took evidence in accordance with the Administrative Offences Act and that the High Court for Administrative Offences decided on the complainant\u2019s appeal on the merits. It is also evident that the complainant had an opportunity to follow and participate in the proceedings, and that he could undertake all permitted procedural actions and lodge a remedy. The contested decisions are sufficiently reasoned and adopted in accordance with the relevant procedural rules.", "For these reasons, the [Constitutional] Court finds that the contested decisions did not violate the complainant\u2019s constitutional right to fair proceedings.", "As regards the complainant\u2019s argument that in similar cases the relevant authorities proceed differently, that in itself does not mean that the complainant\u2019s constitutional right was violated by the contested decisions. In the [Constitutional] Court\u2019s view, in the proceedings [complained of] the contested decisions were adopted in accordance with the relevant legislation. [T]herefore the fact that different decisions may have been adopted in other proceedings is of no relevance for the lawfulness of the decisions contested before the Constitutional Court in these proceedings, nor can it lead to a different decision in this particular case.", "7.
