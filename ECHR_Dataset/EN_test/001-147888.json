Later that day the investigating judge, assisted by a road traffic expert, carried out an on-site inspection.", "9.

Meanwhile, the case file was forwarded to the Split Municipal State Attorney\u2019s Office (Op\u0107insko dr\u017eavno odvjetni\u0161tvo u Splitu \u2013 \u201cthe State Attorney\u2019s Office\u201d) for its assessment of the relevant facts.", "12.

On the same day the Split Municipal Court acquitted Z.K. on charges of causing the road accident.", "31. The applicant lodged an appeal with the Split County Court, which on 17 May 2011 quashed the first-instance judgment because of the procedural errors in the composition of the trial court. The relevant part of the judgment reads:", "\u201c... the first instance court did not sit in a proper formation because the trial was held before a single judge instead before a panel composed of a judge and two lay judges. The offence under Article 272 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 of the Criminal Code is punishable by imprisonment between one and ten years, and under Article 18 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for the offences punishable by imprisonment of more than five years, the Municipal Courts must sit in panels composed of a judge and two lay judges. ...", "It should be also noted that for the offence under Article 272 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 of the Criminal Code, that is in issue in the present case, because of the prescribed penalty, the trial should be held according to the rules of ordinary, and not summary, procedure, and that such [ordinary criminal] proceedings can be held only on an indictment, against which the accused has the right to lodge an objection, and not based on a request to prosecute.\u201d", "32. In the resumed proceedings, on 15 September 2011 the Split Municipal Court asked the applicant to specify whether he had submitted an indictment (optu\u017enica) or a request to prosecute (optu\u017eni prijedlog). The relevant part of the letter reads:", "\u201cIn accordance with Article 269 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the submission named [request to prosecute] is being returned to the [subsidiary] prosecutor for amendment in accordance with Article 268 \u00a7 1 (6) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. That is to say, the subsidiary prosecutor must indicate whether or not his submission is actually an indictment.\u201d", "33. The applicant replied on 28 September 2011 indicating that his submission was an indictment rather than a request to prosecute.", "34. On 30 November 2011 the Split Municipal Court discontinued the proceedings on the grounds that the applicant\u2019s indictment had not been drafted properly, as it did not contain the statement of reasons on which it was based. The relevant part of this decision reads:", "\u201cThe subsidiary prosecutor on 24 November 2006 submitted a request to prosecute against the accused Z.K. ....", "Under Article 269 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure such submission, titled request to prosecute, was returned to the [subsidiary] prosecutor for amendment under Article 268 \u00a7 1 (6) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.", "The representative of the subsidiary prosecutor submitted before this court his amendment of the [above-noted document] indicating that the title \u201crequest to prosecute\u201d should be changed to \u201cindictment\u201d, and that he had no other amendments.", "Since the [subsidiary] prosecutor failed to comply with Article 268 \u00a7 1 (6) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (\u2019s defence and the prosecutor\u2019s position on the defendant\u2019s defence), this court decided [to discontinue the proceedings].\u201d", "35. The applicant lodged an appeal on 9 December 2011 with the Split County Court, contending that he had only been invited to indicate whether he had instituted the proceedings by a request to prosecute or an indictment and that he had replied to that question accordingly. He also pointed out that the courts had accepted his indictment in 2006, conducted the proceedings and decided the case on the merits. Together with the appeal, the applicant submitted an amended indictment containing the statement of reasons.", "36. On 17 April 2012 the Split County Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal as ill-founded, endorsing the reasoning of the Split Municipal Court.", "37. On 16 May 2012 the Split Municipal Court ordered the applicant to pay Z.K.\u2019s legal costs and expenses in the amount of 17,500 Croatian kunas. This decision was upheld by the Split County Court on 11 June 2012.", "38. Also on 11 June 2012 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) regarding the manner in which the criminal law mechanisms had been implemented in his case.", "39. On 20 September 2012 the Constitutional Court declared the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint inadmissible on the grounds that the decisions of the lower courts did not concern the applicant\u2019s civil rights or obligations or any criminal charge against him."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
