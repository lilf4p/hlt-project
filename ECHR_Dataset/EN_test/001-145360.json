The applicant was born in 1952 and lived in Split.", "8. He was the owner of a flat in Split with a surface area of 66.76 square metres.", "9. On 17 October 1955 a certain Ms P.A. was, on the basis of the Decree on Administration of Residential Buildings of 1953 (see paragraph 24 below), awarded the right to live in the flat and moved in together with her mother and her cousin I.T. (born in 1948) whom her parents had entrusted to P.A.\u2019s care in 1951. This right was by the entry into force of the Housing Act of 1959 transformed into the specially protected tenancy (stanarsko pravo, see paragraphs 24-30 below about the specially protected tenancy in the former Yugoslavia).", "10. P.A. and I.T. lived together in the applicant\u2019s flat until P.A. moved out in 1973. I.T. continued to live there with her husband and her son, Ig.T. (born in 1972). I.T.\u2019s husband died in 1998.", "11. On 5 November 1996 the Lease of Flats Act entered into force. It abolished the legal concept of the specially protected tenancy and provided that the holders of such tenancies in respect of, inter alia, privately owned flats were to become \u201cprotected lessees\u201d (za\u0161ti\u0107eni najmoprimci, see paragraphs 31 and 40 below). Under the Act such lessees are subject to a number of protective measures, such as the duty of landlords to contract a lease of indefinite duration, payment of protected rent (za\u0161ti\u0107ena najamnina), the amount of which is set by the Government and significantly lower than the market rent; and better protection against termination of the lease.", "12. The applicant refused to conclude a lease contract with I.T. stipulating the protected rent pursuant to section 31(1) of the Lease of Flats Act (see 40 below). On 16 May 1997 I.T. brought a civil action against him in the Split Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Splitu), relying on section 33(3) of the same Act (see paragraph 43 below), with a view to obtaining a judgment in lieu of such a contract.", "13. Shortly afterwards in 1997 the applicant brought a civil action in the same court seeking to obtain a judgment ordering I.T. and her son to vacate the flat in question. He argued that she had not been \u201ca child without parents\u201d and thus could not have been considered a member of P.A.\u2019s household within the meaning of section 9(4) of the 1974 Housing Act or section 12(1) of the 1985 Housing Act (see respectively paragraphs 28 and 29 below). Consequently, she could not have taken over the specially protected tenancy after P.A. had moved out of the flat in 1973, and thus had not had any title to use it.", "14. The two proceedings were subsequently joined.", "15. By a judgment of 2 September 2002 the Split Municipal Court found in favour of I.T. and her son in part. It ordered the applicant to conclude with I.T. a lease contract stipulating protected rent in the amount of 102.14 Croatian kunas (HRK) \u2013 approximately 14 euros (EUR) at the time \u2013 per month within fifteen days; otherwise the judgment would substitute such a contract. Since the existence of a specially protected tenancy was a necessary precondition for acquiring the status of a protected lessee under the Lease of Flats Act (see paragraph 11 above) the court had first to determine, as a preliminary issue, whether I.T. had become the holder of the specially protected tenancy after P.A. had moved out of the flat in 1973. The court held that, unlike the subsequent legislation relied on by the applicant, the legislation in force at the material time, namely the Housing Act of 1962, had not defined who could have been considered a member of the household of a holder of a specially protected tenancy (see paragraph 27 below). Thus, given that I.T. had been in foster care by P.A. and lived with her in the flat in question, she could have been considered as a member of her household and therefore could, after P.A. had moved out of the flat in 1973, taken over the specially protected tenancy from her and become the holder thereof. Consequently, when in November 1996 the Lease of Flats Act entered into force, I.T. had, as the holder of the specially protected tenancy, become a protected lessee by the operation of law and was entitled to conclude a lease contract stipulating protected rent with the applicant (see paragraphs 39-40 below). While the court ruled that I.T.\u2019s son could be listed in the lease contract as a member of her household, it also held that her daughter-in-law and her grandson could not because they had not moved into the flat until after the entry into force of the Lease of Flats Act, when specially protected tenancies could no longer be obtained.", "16. On 28 June 2006 the Po\u017eega County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Po\u017eegi) dismissed an appeal by the applicant and upheld the first-instance judgment, which thereby became final.", "17. The applicant then lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) alleging violations of his right to equality before the law, his right to a fair hearing and his right of ownership under the Constitution (see paragraph 23 below).", "18. On 17 September 2009 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint and served its decision on his representative on 2 November 2009.", "19. According to the information submitted by the parties, the monthly protected rent for the applicant\u2019s flat changed as follows, in line with the increase in the construction price index (see paragraphs 52 and 85 below):", "20. It appears from the documents submitted by the Government that the applicant refused to receive the protected rent for the flat and that I.T. therefore had to deposit it with a court.", "21. According to the parties the condominium fee paid into the common reserve fund (see paragraph 67 below) by the owner of the flat \u2013 the applicant and later his heir \u2013 for maintenance etc., was set at HRK 102.81 on 1 January 1998 and has not been changed since.", "22. The Government also submitted information from the tax authorities according to which the applicant had never declared any income from renting out the flat. On the other hand, the applicant\u2019s heir did so in his tax returns for 2011 and 2012 where he also asked for a tax deduction on account of costs corresponding to the amount of the condominium fee paid (see paragraphs 67-70 below). The Government did not specify what tax rate was applied."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1", "P1-1-2"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
