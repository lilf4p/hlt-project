In 1993 the Karm\u0117lava Circuit Council of the Kaunas Region (Kauno rajono Karm\u0117lavos apylink\u0117s tarnyba) assigned a plot of land measuring 1.97 hectares to the first applicant (hereinafter \u201cthe land\u201d), Ms Noreikien\u0117 (hereinafter \u201cthe first applicant\u201d), for individual farming.

On 2 August 2004 the first applicant signed a land purchase agreement with the Kaunas County Administration to acquire the land from the State. The plot was subsequently registered in the Land Registry in the joint names of both applicants.", "8. In 2005 a third party, V.A., brought a civil claim against the Kaunas County Administration and the both applicants, seeking restoration of his ownership rights to the land. He argued that a request for restitution of property had already been submitted in 1991, so the land had been assigned and later sold to the first applicant unlawfully.", "9. On 14 April 2006 the Kaunas District Court (Kauno rajono apylink\u0117s teismas) allowed V.A.\u2019s claim. It held that the first applicant had been assigned the land unlawfully because the local authorities had an obligation to resolve restitution claims before assigning plots to new owners, and because she did not fulfil the legal criteria for being assigned land. Applying the principle of priority of former owners\u2019 rights, the court annulled the administrative decisions assigning the land to the first applicant and the land purchase agreement, and ordered the Kaunas County Administration to return LTL 129 (EUR 37) to the applicants.", "10. On 31 October 2006 the Kaunas Regional Court quashed the lower court\u2019s decision and dismissed the civil claim. V.A. lodged a cassation appeal. On 15 May 2007 the Supreme Court quashed the disputed decision and remitted the case to the Kaunas Regional Court for re-examination.", "11. On 24 September 2007 the Kaunas Regional Court upheld the firstinstance decision of 14 April 2006 and allowed V.A.\u2019s claim.", "12. On 30 November 2007 the Supreme Court refused to examine the applicants\u2019 cassation appeal, on the grounds that it did not raise any important legal issues."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
