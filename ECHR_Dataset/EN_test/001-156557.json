The applicant, Mr Zorislav Sekul, is a national of Croatia and Australia, who was born in 1936 and lives in Supetar. He was represented before the Court by Ms L. Ku\u0161an, a lawyer practising in Ivani\u0107 Grad.", "2. The Croatian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms \u0160. Sta\u017enik.", "3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "4. The applicant and his wife moved to Croatia from Australia sometimes in 1997/1998 and they bought a flat in Supetar from B.M. and D.M.E. Although there was no written purchase agreement, the applicant paid the full purchase price and moved into the flat.", "5. Meanwhile, the applicant\u2019s wife was admitted to a nursing home in Nere\u017ei\u0161\u0107a and the applicant moved to a rest home in Supetar.", "6. On 18 January 1999 the applicant brought an action in the Supetar Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Supetru) against B.M. and D.M.E., seeking a court order for the conclusion of a written sale and purchase agreement concerning the flat.", "7. On 10 May 1999 the Supetar Municipal Court ruled in the applicant\u2019s favour but on 4 October 2002 the Split County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Splitu), as the court of appeal, quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case on the grounds of inadequate reasoning of the judgment.", "8. In the resumed proceedings, on 14 January 2003, the applicant, represented by lawyer Z.I., amended his civil action seeking the award of title of ownership over the flat and the performance of certain construction works by B.M. and D.M.E.", "9. During the proceedings, B.M. and D.M.E. lodged a counterclaim against the applicant seeking annulment of the oral sale and purchase agreement.", "10. On 22 August 2003 the Supetar Municipal Court accepted the applicant\u2019s action, awarded him the title of ownership over the flat and ordered B.M. and D.M.E. to perform the requested construction works. It also dismissed B.M.\u2019s and D.M.E.\u2019s counterclaim.", "11. On 9 June 2005 the Split County Court upheld the first-instance judgment concerning the title of the applicant\u2019s ownership and the dismissal of B.M.\u2019s and D.M.E.\u2019s counterclaim, whereas it quashed the part of the judgment concerning the performance of construction works and in that part remitted the case for re-examination.", "12. In the resumed proceedings the applicant complained to the Split County Court about the length of the proceedings before the Supetar Municipal Court.", "13. On 25 January 2008 the Split County Court found a violation of the applicant\u2019s right to a hearing within a reasonable time, awarded him 7,000 Croatian kunas (HRK) in compensation and ordered the Supetar Municipal Court to decide the case within six months.", "14. In September 2008 lawyer Z.I. informed the Supetar Municipal Court that he no longer represented the applicant, and in January 2009 lawyer J.A.M. informed that court that he was the applicant\u2019s representative.", "15. On 30 January 2009 the Supetar Municipal Court partially accepted the applicant\u2019s civil action concerning the construction works, ordering B.M. and D.M.E. to carry out some additional works on the doors and windows, fa\u00e7ade and the parquet floor in the applicant\u2019s flat. In addition, it authorised the applicant, in the case of a failure of B.M. and D.M.E. to comply with that order, to carry out the construction works himself at the expense of B.M. and D.M.E. The applicant was also awarded costs and expenses in the amount of HRK 88,732.", "16. This judgment was upheld on appeal by the Split County Court on 21 January 2010. It thus became final, and on 17 March 2010 it became fully enforceable.", "17. On 29 November 2011 the applicant, represented by lawyer D.R., instituted enforcement proceedings against B.M. and D.M.E. in the Supetar Municipal Court concerning the performance of construction works ordered in the judgment of 30 January 2009 (see paragraphs 15 and 16 above). Relying on section 217 of the Enforcement Act, the applicant requested that B.M. and D.M.E. should comply with their duty to finish the construction work within a period of eight days and, in case of a failure on their part to comply with the judgment, to pay an enforcement fine (sudski penali) of HRK 500 for every further day of delay.", "18. After unsuccessful friendly settlement arrangements, and several orders of the Supetar Municipal Court to correct his request for enforcement, on 29 June 2012 the applicant reiterated his request, under section 217 of the Enforcement Act, asking that B.M. and D.M.E. be given an additional period of fifteen days to comply with the judgment and, in case of a failure on their part, to pay an enforcement fine of HRK 500 for every further day of delay.", "19. On 5 July 2012 the Supetar Municipal Court accepted the applicant\u2019s request and ordered B.M. and D.M.E. to comply with the judgment of 30 January 2009 within a period of fifteen days, and, in case of a failure to that effect, to pay an enforcement fine in the amount of HRK 500 to the applicant for every further day of delay.", "20. On 13 July 2012 B.M. and D.M.E. challenged the time-limit set out for the enforcement, seeking its postponement due to the upcoming tourist season. On 10 May 2013 the Supetar Municipal Court dismissed the request unfounded.", "21. On 27 May 2013 B.M. and D.M.E. appealed to the Split County Court against the dismissal of their request for the postponement of the enforcement, arguing in particular that the construction works could not be performed during the tourist season and that the applicant had denied their workers access to the flat.", "22. On 23 July 2013 the Split County Court dismissed the appeal lodged by B.M. and D.M.E. as unfounded, upholding the Supetar Municipal Court\u2019s order for the payment of an enforcement fine.", "23. The applicant did not seek the enforcement of that order by seeking payment of the awarded amount.", "24. On 23 October 2008 lawyer Z.I., who represented the applicant in his civil proceedings instituted against B.M. and D.M.E. (see paragraphs 8-14 above), asked a public notary in Solin to issue an enforcement order on the applicant\u2019s property in general for the payment of lawyer\u2019s fees in the amount of HRK 83,229.86, together with the statutory default interest.", "25. The following day the public notary accepted the request and issued an enforcement order on the applicant\u2019s property. It instructed the applicant that he could lodge an objection against the order with the competent civil court within a period of eight days following its service on him.", "26. The material available to the Court contains a delivery note of this decision dated 31 October 2008, bearing in handwriting the applicant\u2019s last name.", "27. As there was no objection against the public notary\u2019s decision it became final on 8 November 2008.", "28. On 12 February 2009 the applicant, represented by lawyer J.A.M., requested the public notary to re-open the proceedings arguing that he had not received the enforcement order on 31 October 2008, and that he had only later learnt of its existence. He also challenged the validity of the enforcement order.", "29. After receiving the request, the public notary forwarded it to the Supetar Municipal Court for its examination and decision.", "30. On 9 June 2009, after hearing the parties\u2019 arguments, the Supetar Municipal Court declared the applicant\u2019s request inadmissible as being lodged out-of-time. In particular, the Supetar Municipal Court found that there was no doubt that the enforcement order issued by the public notary had been served on the applicant on 31 October 2008, which was therefore taken as the date when the three-month time-limit for lodging a request for re-opening had started running. Accordingly, as the applicant\u2019s request had been lodged on 12 February 2009, it followed that it was lodged out-of-time.", "31. The Supetar Municipal Court informed the applicant that he could lodge an appeal against this decision with the Split County Court. The applicant did not avail himself of that possibility.", "32. Meanwhile, Z.I. asked the Supetar Municipal Court to enforce the public notary\u2019s enforcement order by the judicial sale of the applicant\u2019s flat. Following the applicant\u2019s protests, the Supetar Municipal Court on 8 February 2010 invited the parties to provide further comments on the case.", "33. After receiving the parties\u2019 further submissions, on 23 February 2010 the Supetar Municipal Court, in view of the applicant\u2019s specific complaints, advised him to institute a separate set of civil proceedings requesting an interdiction of the further enforcement on his property based on Z.I.\u2019s enforcement request. The applicant did not avail himself of this possibility.", "34. On 20 May 2010 a hearing was held before the Supetar Municipal Court with a view of establishing the value of the applicant\u2019s flat. It was decided that the competent tax authority would be requested to provide the relevant information in that respect.", "35. On 3 February 2011 the Supetar Municipal Court, on the basis of available information, set the value of the flat at HRK 84,000 and ordered its judicial sale on 13 April 2011.", "36. On 7 April 2011 Z.I. asked the Supetar Municipal Court to postpone the judicial sale of the applicant\u2019s flat for a further six months so as to allow him the possibility to settle the debt by other means.", "37. In October 2011 Z.I. requested the Supetar Municipal Court to resume the enforcement proceedings.", "38. In January 2014 Z.I. informed the Supetar Municipal Court that so far he managed to receive HRK 22,307.21 from the applicant and that the applicant still owned him HRK 60,922.55. He therefore adjusted his claim, asking seizure of the amount awarded to the applicant on account of costs and expenses of the proceedings against B.M. and D.M.E. (see paragraph 15 above).", "39. On 7 February 2014 the Supetar Municipal Court accepted Z.I.\u2019s revised enforcement request.", "40. It appears that the enforcement proceedings are still pending.", "41.
