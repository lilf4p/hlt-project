On 4 April 2011 the District Court held a preliminary hearing in the case. Following the request of the prosecutor, it ordered that the preventive measure in respect of the applicant should be changed and that the applicant should be placed in pre-trial detention. The court, paying regard to the fact that the applicant denied his guilt, considered that the applicant could influence witnesses, conceal or remove traces and evidence of the crime. It stated that the applicant was charged with a serious crime and his actual place of residence did not coincide with his registered address. It therefore concluded that the applicant could behave negatively and his isolation was necessary. The court noted that the applicant was of middle age, he was not a disabled person, he did not suffer from chronic illnesses, he had a family and a minor son, and that he worked as director of a company.", "11. On a number of occasions during the trial the applicant requested the District Court to change the preventive measure in his respect and release him.", "12. On 5 July, 19 August, 23 November 2011 and 17 January 2012 the District Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s requests maintaining the impugned preventive measure. The court referred to its decision of 4 April 2011 and repeated that the applicant\u2019s actual and registered addresses did not coincide, he was charged with a serious crime, and that there were grounds to believe that the applicant could behave negatively, if released. The court also repeated that the applicant was of middle age, he was not a disabled person, he did not suffer from chronic illnesses, he had a family and a minor son, and that he worked as director of a company. The court then found that there had been no grounds to change the preventive measure for health reasons or to apply bail; furthermore, the applicant showed no remorse and had refused to admit his guilt.", "13. On 30 January 2012 the District Court found the applicant guilty of fraudulent appropriation of property and sentenced him to six years\u2019 imprisonment and ordered confiscation of his property.", "14.
