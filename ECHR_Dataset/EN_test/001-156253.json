The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Kallithea-Attaki, Greece.", "7. The applicant is one of the heirs of Mr Serkis G\u00f6vderelio\u011flu, who used to live in Istanbul. On 7 July 1988 Mr G\u00f6vderelio\u011flu purchased movable and immovable goods from the bankrupt estate of a company by way of a public tender.", "8. On 5 February 1996 the sale in question was annulled by a court order on the ground that the instalments had not been paid in time. The decision annulling the sale became final on 3 October 1997 and on 14 November 1997 Mr G\u00f6vderelio\u011flu was requested by the Istanbul Bankruptcy Office to return the purchased goods within seven days. He did not comply with that request.", "9. On 10 August 2000 Mr G\u00f6vderelio\u011flu died.", "10. Due to his non-compliance with the Bankruptcy Office\u2019s order to return the goods, on 5 June 2001 the bankrupt estate of the aforementioned company filed an action against Mr G\u00f6vderelio\u011flu\u2019s heirs, including the applicant, before the \u015ei\u015fli Court of First Instance (hereinafter \u201cthe \u015ei\u015fli Court\u201d) for the recovery of the goods or their equivalent value.", "11. A lawyer acting on behalf of the applicant and the other heirs of Mr G\u00f6vderelio\u011flu submitted a petition to the \u015ei\u015fli Court on 3 December 2001, arguing, inter alia, that the case had been lodged outside the statutory time-limit and thus had to be rejected. The lawyer submitted that the statutory one-year time-limit had started to run on 14 November 1997 but that the plaintiffs had not lodged their action until 2001.", "12. On 15 April 2002 three experts appointed by the \u015ei\u015fli Court submitted their opinion on the value of the goods. Two of the experts considered the value to be approximately 245,000 euros (EUR), whereas the third expert considered it to be in the region of EUR 45,000.", "13. On 11 June 2002 the \u015ei\u015fli Court issued an interim decision, rejecting a request to hear two witnesses who, according to the applicant, would have provided pertinent information about the value of the goods in question. The \u015ei\u015fli Court considered that the existence of the expert reports made it unnecessary to hear the applicant\u2019s witnesses.", "14. In its decision of 13 December 2002 the \u015ei\u015fli Court ordered Mr G\u00f6vderelio\u011flu\u2019s heirs to return the goods which were still in their possession and to pay a certain sum of money corresponding to the value of the goods which had been disposed of in the meantime. The amount of money ordered was based on the calculations made by the two experts. The \u015ei\u015fli Court further awarded statutory interest on this amount accruing from 21 November 1997, the original due date for the return of the goods. No response was given by the \u015ei\u015fli Court in its decision to the applicant\u2019s objection concerning the issue of the time-limit.", "15. The applicant appealed against the judgment and argued, inter alia, that the action for recovery should have been dismissed by the \u015ei\u015fli Court as it had been instituted outside the statutory time-limit. He also submitted that the \u015ei\u015fli Court had acted unlawfully by ordering the payment of interest on the amount due, given that no request for interest had been made by the plaintiff. He also added that the \u015ei\u015fli Court had failed to hear the witnesses he had proposed. The applicant asked the Court of Cassation to hold a hearing before rendering its decision.", "16. On 10 July 2003 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the \u015ei\u015fli Court without holding a hearing and without providing any answers to the applicant\u2019s objections.", "17. On 22 December 2003 the Court of Cassation rejected a request by the applicant for rectification of its previous decision."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
