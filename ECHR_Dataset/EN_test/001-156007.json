According to a report of the police officer M.D. of 15 January 2007, at around 7.35 p.m., while he was held in the police station, the applicant started shouting and disobeying the orders to calm down. M.D. therefore approached him and twisted his arm behind his back after which he was handcuffed.", "11. On the same day, at around 8.40 p.m., the applicant was examined by a doctor at the police station. The medical examination indicated signs of alcohol intoxication but did not disclose any injuries.", "12. On 16 January 2007, at 2.20 p.m., the applicant was again examined by a doctor who found no injuries but indicated that the applicant had low blood sugar.", "13. Following the applicant\u2019s release from detention (see paragraph 31 below), on 22 January 2007 he underwent another medical examination in a hospital in S. The examination indicated spinal and abdominal contusions which could, as alleged, relate to a beating dating back one week before.", "14.

Municipal State Attorney\u2019s Office (Op\u0107insko dr\u017eavno odvjetni\u0161tvo u Z.) against the police officers A.H., M.M. and M.D. alleging that they had ill-treated him during his arrest on 15 January 2007. In particular, he submitted that he had been knocked to the ground and then beaten.

Municipal State Attorney\u2019s Office rejected the applicant\u2019s criminal complaint on the grounds that there was no evidence that he had been ill-treated as alleged in his criminal complaint. The applicant was instructed that he could take over the criminal prosecution as a subsidiary prosecutor by lodging an indictment before the competent criminal court.", "23. Meanwhile, the applicant submitted another criminal complaint before the Z. Municipal State Attorney\u2019s Office against the police officers M.M., A.H., S.G., P.S., M.Mi. and M.P. alleging unlawful search of his flat and their unlawful conduct in the processing of his case related to the alleged domestic violence.", "24.

Municipal Criminal Court (Op\u0107inski kazneni sud u Z.) against the police officers A.H., M.M., M.D. and M.Mi. in connection with his alleged ill-treatment (see paragraph 22 above).", "26. On 28 November 2008 the applicant sent a letter to the Z. Municipal State Attorney\u2019s Office expressing his dissatisfaction with the manner in which the circumstances of his criminal complaint had been assessed and with the decision of 12 July 2007 (see paragraph 22 above).", "27. The Z. Municipal State Attorney\u2019s Office replied on 5 March 2009 indicating that all the applicant\u2019s objections should be addressed in the criminal proceedings which he had instituted as a subsidiary prosecutor.", "28. On 6 April 2010 the Z. Municipal Criminal Court declared the applicant\u2019s indictment inadmissible as he had failed to inform that court of the change of his whereabouts for which reason he could not be summoned to amend the indictment in accordance with the formal requirements of the relevant domestic law. This decision was placed on the Z. Municipal Criminal Court\u2019s public notice board from which it was taken on 26 April 2010. It was thereby considered to be served on the applicant (see paragraph 59 below).", "29. On 15 January 2007 the police instituted minor offences proceedings against the applicant in the Z.

On 16 January 2009 the resumed minor offences proceedings concerning the charges of domestic violence were discontinued on the grounds that they had become time-barred.", "34. According to the applicant, on 25 May 2008, at around 2.30 p.m., while celebrating his wedding anniversary with friends, he was attacked and injured by A.H., the same police officer who had been involved in his alleged ill-treatment on 15 January 2007 (see paragraphs 9, 19 and 25 above). He sustained injuries to his head and arms. Thereafter he was arrested and placed in a psychiatric hospital from which he was released on 27 May 2008.", "35. According to the documents submitted by the Government, on 25 May 2008, at around 2.30 p.m., the police received an anonymous call informing them that a person was lying on the ground in front of a residential building in Z. The police officers I.Z. and A.H. immediately drove to the address.", "36. A report signed by the police officers I.Z. and A.H., dated 25 May 2008, indicates that upon their intervention at the scene they established that the person lying on the ground was the applicant, who was severely intoxicated. He also had visible injuries on his head and arms. Soon afterwards an emergency team joined them and they decided that the applicant should be taken to a hospital for further treatment. During the transfer to the hospital the applicant became aggressive and the police officer A.H. and one of the members of the medical team tried to calm him down. At the hospital, the applicant continued his aggressive behaviour and threatened to kill them all once released. The police officers thus used physical force and the measures of restraint to calm him down. It was decided that he should be taken to another hospital.", "37. A medical report of the emergency service of 25 May 2008 indicates contusion of the applicant\u2019s head and superficial injuries on both arms.", "38. A medical report prepared on the applicant\u2019s release from the hospital on 27 May 2008 indicates that the applicant sustained his injuries during a fall caused by his intoxication.", "39. Following his release the applicant contacted another doctor on 28 May 2008. His report of the same date indicates that the applicant had contusions to the head, and hematomas on the right upper arm and left forearm which could have been caused by blows three days before, as alleged by the applicant.", "40. On 25 May 2008 the police officers I.Z. and A.H. reported on the use of force against the applicant to their superiors. They explained that the applicant had been aggressive during his medical treatment in the hospital and that therefore I.Z. grabbed him by the left arm and twisted it behind his back while A.H. did the same thing with his right arm. He was then handcuffed.", "41. On the same day the Chief of the police station accepted the report finding no irregularities in the use of force. These findings were forwarded to the Chief of the Z. Police Department.", "42. On 28 May 2008 the Chief of the Z. Police Department found that the use of force against the applicant had been lawful and justified.", "43.

He stressed that he had only refused to undergo the medical examination to which the police officer A.H. had been forcing him.", "45. At a hearing on 7 April 2009 doctor N.L., who received the applicant in the hospital on 25 May 2008 (see paragraph 36 above), stated that the applicant had arrived at the hospital with a head injury and under the influence of alcohol. He also explained that he had not seen any violent behaviour on the part of the applicant.", "46. At a hearing on 23 September 2010 the Z. Minor Offences Court questioned the police officer I.Z. who could not remember any details of the event at issue.", "47. On the same day the Z. Minor Offences Court acquitted the applicant on the grounds of lack of evidence of his alleged violent behaviour and breach of public peace and order.", "48. On 10 June 2008 the S. Police Department instituted disciplinary proceedings against the applicant in the First-instance Disciplinary Court on charges of inappropriate behaviour related to the events of 25 May 2008.", "49. At a hearing on 13 November 2008 the applicant submitted that on the critical day he had been with his friends \u017d.K., I.B. and M.V., drinking and celebrating his wedding anniversary. When they approached the building where he lived, they came across two police officers one of whom was A.H., who approached him and asked him whether they had settled their dispute. The applicant answered that the competent court would decide about that and at that point A.H. pulled him by the hand as a result of which he fell to the ground and then he lost his conscience.", "50. On 22 December 2008 the First-instance Disciplinary Court questioned the applicant\u2019s friends \u017d.K., I.B. and M.V. and the police officers I.Z. and A.H.", "51. \u017d.K. stated that he had seen the applicant in front of the building talking with two police officers and that at one moment one of the police officers, without any particular reason, pulled the applicant by the hand after which he fell to the ground and hurt his head. I.B. and M.V. confirmed this version of the events.", "52. In their statements the police officers I.Z. and A.H. denied any ill-treatment reiterating that they had only used force as a result of the applicant\u2019s aggressive behaviour during his medical treatment.", "53. On 3 March 2009 the First-instance Disciplinary Court found the applicant guilty on charges of inappropriate behaviour and sentenced him to dismissal from service suspended for twelve months. It considered that the statements of \u017d.K., I.B. and M.V. were inconsistent in particular given that an analysis of I.B.\u2019s mobile phone at about the time of the events showed that he had been in another city. It therefore rejected the applicant\u2019s allegations that he had been ill-treated by the police officers I.Z. and A.H.", "54. On 23 April 2009 the Second-instance Disciplinary Court upheld the first-instance decision.", "55.
