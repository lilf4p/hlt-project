FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Guido Raimondi;Ledi Bianku;Nona Tsotsoria;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Paul Mahoney;Yonko Grozev", "TEXT": ["1. The applicants, Mr Ilpo Kuokkanen and Mr Harri Johannesdahl, are Finnish nationals who live in Helsinki. They were represented before the Court by Mr Kari Uoti, a lawyer practising in Helsinki.", "2. The Finnish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr Arto Kosonen of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.", "3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "4. The case concerns criminal proceedings in which a judgment was rendered against the applicants by the Helsinki Appeal Court (hovioikeus, hovr\u00e4tten) on 28 May 2009. On 10 March 2010 the Supreme Court (korkein oikeus, h\u00f6gsta domstolen) refused the applicants leave to appeal and the Appeal Court judgment thus became final.", "5. On 6 April 2010 the first applicant lodged an extraordinary appeal before the Supreme Court, requesting it to annul the Appeal Court judgment of 28 May 2009 and to refer the matter back to it for a new examination. He claimed that the composition of the court had not been competent (p\u00e4\u00e4t\u00f6svaltainen, domf\u00f6r) as one of the appeal court justices had been biased in the matter.", "6. On 1 November 2010 the Supreme Court found that the justice in question had been biased in the case and that therefore the composition of the court had not been competent. The Supreme Court thus annulled the Appeal Court judgment as far as the first applicant was concerned and referred the matter back to the Appeal Court for a new examination.", "7. Subsequently, the second applicant also requested the annulment of the Appeal Court judgment of 28 May 2009 as far as he was concerned. The outcome of his request was the same as for the first applicant: the Supreme Court annulled the Appeal Court judgment as far as he was concerned and referred the matter back to the Appeal Court for a new examination. The public prosecutors never requested annulment of the Appeal Court judgment of 28 May 2009.", "8. During the reopened Appeal Court proceedings the applicants claimed that the Appeal Court could no longer examine those charges which had been dismissed by the final Appeal Court judgment of 28 May 2009 as the applicants\u2019 request for reopening did not concern these parts of the case. They referred both to the prohibition of reformatio in peius and to the ne bis in idem principle. On the other hand, the public prosecutors claimed that the case had been referred back to the Appeal Court in its entirety. They claimed that, as the competency of the composition was a matter that concerned all parties, the prohibition of reformatio in peius did not apply and the examination of the case was to be conducted as if the case had only now become pending before the Appeal Court.", "9. On 15 April 2011 the Appeal Court dismissed, without examining the merits, those charges which had already been finally decided by the Appeal Court judgment of 28 May 2009. The court noted that the public prosecutors had not challenged the impartiality of the composition of the court but that only the applicants had made such claims. Therefore, also taking into account the case-law of the Strasbourg Court, the previously dismissed charges could no longer be examined.", "10. By letter dated 31 May 2011 the public prosecutors appealed to the Supreme Court against this Appeal Court decision. They claimed that the rules on impartiality were designed to protect all parties to the proceedings. In such a situation the prohibition of reformatio in peius was no longer applicable. As the earlier judgment had been annulled in respect of the applicants, there existed no earlier final judgment concerning them. The applicants disagreed with the public prosecutors\u2019 conclusions. They pointed out that they did not even have any interest or right to appeal against the Appeal Court judgment of 28 May 2009 in so far as it was favourable to them. A final judgment could not be annulled without any specific request to that effect.", "11. On 26 September 2011 the Supreme Court granted the public prosecutors leave to appeal.", "12. On 29 December 2011 the Supreme Court quashed the Appeal Court decision and referred the case back to it for a new examination. It found that the prohibition of reformatio in peius was valid in the Finnish legal system and that it was applied both in ordinary and extraordinary appeal proceedings. The question of whether a case was annulled and referred back for a new examination in its entirety or only in part depended on the nature of the procedural error in the case at hand. If the procedural error affected the whole judgment and the proceedings, the case was referred back in its entirety, even if the judgment had been favourable to the appellant. The court noted that in the Convention or in its Protocols there was no specific mention of the prohibition of reformatio in peius but that it formed a part of the general fair trial guarantees. The Committee of Ministers had made a Recommendation on this subject in 1992. However, in the case-law of the Court no similar case was to be found. On the other hand, there was caselaw about a judge\u2019s partiality, which issue had been considered by the Court to be such a grave procedural error that it always led to the annulment of a judgment. The principle of ne bis in idem did not prevent new examination of the case if in earlier proceedings a grave procedural error had taken place. All partiality grounds were unconditional. In the present case the lack of competence of the composition concerned the whole Appeal Court proceedings and the judgment in its entirety. Therefore the court had earlier annulled the Appeal Court judgment of 28 May 2009 in its entirety. As the prohibition of reformatio in peius only applied to judgments which had become partially final, it did not apply to the present case in which a final judgment had been completely annulled. The Appeal Court judgment of 28 May 2009 was thus no longer binding in any respect. The Supreme Court reached this conclusion by 3 votes to 2. The decision contains two dissenting opinions.", "13. There is no explicit provision concerning the principle of reformatio in peius in the domestic law. The established interpretation is, largely on the basis of the national case-law, that this principle is valid in the national legal system. This principle is inferable from Chapter 26, section 2, subsection 1, of the Code of Judicial Procedure (oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari, r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken; as amended by Act no. 381/2003) which reads as follows:", "\u201c[i]n a criminal case, the Court of Appeal may amend, in favour of the defendant, the judgment that the District Court has given on the charges even if only the public prosecutor has appealed against this.\u201d", "14. The Supreme Court has dealt with the principle of reformatio in peius in some of its precedent cases.", "KKO:1998:161: After the Appeal Court had referred the criminal case back to the District Court on the basis of the defendant\u2019s appeal, the complainant claimed damages in the retrial proceedings, although he had declared in the earlier proceedings that he had no claims for damages. Because the question about the complainant\u2019s right to damages had not been examined or determined by a judgment before, no impediment existed for examining the claim for damages.", "KKO:2008:97: When sentencing the defendant to a punishment for robbery, the District Court had obliged him to pay the complainant damages for mental suffering. When the defendant appealed to the Appeal Court, the complainant, in a counter-appeal, claimed an increase in the damages for mental suffering. The Appeal Court upheld the judgment of the District Court. The complainant abided by the Appeal Court judgment but, on the basis of the defendant\u2019s appeal, the Supreme Court referred the matter back to the Appeal Court for a main hearing. In the new proceedings the complainant, on the basis of the counter-appeal, continued to claim an increase in the damages. The Supreme Court held that the counter-appeal could be examined in the retrial proceedings.", "15. Moreover, Chapter 31, section 1, subsection 1, of the Code of Judicial Procedure (as amended by Act no. 109/1960) provides that:", "\u201cOn the basis of a complaint invoking procedural fault, a final judgment may be annulled:", "1) if the court had no quorum or if the case had been taken up for consideration of the merits even though there was a circumstance on the basis of which the court should have dismissed the case on its own motion without considering the merits;", "...\u201d", "16. According to Chapter 31, section 6, of the same Code,", "\u201c[i]f it is found that a procedural fault has occurred, the judgment shall be annulled in full or for the part necessary and, if the case is to be retried, it shall be referred back to the court where the procedural fault had occurred. In this event, the Supreme Court shall also order the deadline and manner for the bringing of the case to a retrial.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
