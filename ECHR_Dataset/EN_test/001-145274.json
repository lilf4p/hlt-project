On 19 May 2009 the Yenakiyivskyy Town Court found that the applicant, in accordance with section 49 of the Chernobyl Victims (Status) Act, was entitled to a State pension and to an additional health-damage pension. In accordance with sections 50 and 54 of the Act, from 22 May 2008 the applicant was entitled to a pension of six times the minimum old-age pension and should also receive an additional health-damage pension of 50% of the minimum old-age pension. The applicant had requested the recalculation of her pension on 26 November 2008, so her claims in this respect should have been granted for the period between 1 December 2008 and 1 January 2009. On 1 January 2009 the relevant provisions were changed, so the applicant\u2019s claims were rejected.", "6. On 19 January 2010 the Donetsk Administrative Court of Appeal amended the decision of 19 May 2009 and granted the applicant\u2019s claims in full as of 1 December 2008.", "7. On 14 June 2011 amendments were introduced to the State Budget Act 2011, in accordance with which the amount of the pension under sections 50 and 54 of the Chernobyl Victims (Status) Act was to be determined by the Cabinet of Ministers. The Chernobyl Victims (Status) Act itself was not amended.", "8. Pursuant to the amendments in the State Budget Act 2011, on 6 July 2011 the Cabinet of Ministers adopted decision no. 745, which entered into force on 23 July 2011.", "9. By letter of 25 January 2012 the Pension Fund of Ukraine informed the applicant that as of 1 January 2012 the amount of her pension would be 1,849.50 Ukrainian hryvnas (UAH) (around 176 euros (EUR)). This amount comprised a minimum pension (UAH 822) and various additional payments. The applicant instituted court proceedings, complaining that as of 1 November 2011 her pension had been reduced despite the court decision of 19 January 2010.", "10. On 20 February 2012 the Yenakiyivskyy Town Court rejected the applicant\u2019s claim. It held that as of 22 July 2011 the amounts of the payments under sections 50 and 54 of the Chernobyl Victims (Status) Act were to be established by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. On 26 December 2011 the Constitutional Court of Ukraine had found these changes to be constitutional. The Cabinet of Ministers had adopted the relevant decision no. 745 on 6 July 2011 and it had entered into force on 23 July 2011. Therefore, from 23 July 2011 the applicant\u2019s pension had to be calculated in accordance with decision no. 745.", "11. On 4 April and 3 May 2012 the Donetsk Administrative Court of Appeal and the Higher Administrative Court of Ukraine, respectively, upheld that decision.", "12. By the Law of 14 June 2011 the following changes were introduced to the State Budget Act, 2011:", "\u201cTo establish that in 2011 the provisions of sections ...50, 54... of the Chernobyl Victims Act, Children of War Social Protection Act and Military Personnel Pensions Act ... are implemented in the amounts established by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine in accordance with available financial resources in the Pension Fund Budget for 2011.\u201d", "13. The State Budget Act for 2012 has similar provisions.", "14. On 6 July 2011, in its decision no. 745, the Cabinet of Ministers fixed the amounts concerned. This decision was in force between 23 July 2011 and 1 January 2012. On 23 November 2011 the Cabinet of Ministers adopted further decision no. 1210 on the same matter.", "15. The amount of the minimum pension between 1 December 2008 and 1 November 2011 was raised from UAH 498 to UAH 784 (from around EUR 51 to EUR 80).", "16. The relevant extracts from this decision read as follows:", "\u201c1. ... members of Parliament addressed the Constitutional Court of Ukraine with a request to declare unconstitutional ... provisions of the State Budget Act, 2011.", "According to point 4 of Chapter VII \u201cClosing Provisions\u201d of the 2011 Act, the norms and provisions of sections 39, 50, 51, 52 and 54 of the Chernobyl Victims (Status) Act, section 6 of the Children of War Social Protection Act, and sections 14, 22, 37 and part 3 of section 43 of the Military Personnel Pensions Act are implemented under the conditions and in the amounts determined by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, in accordance with the available financial resources in the budget of the Pension Fund of Ukraine for 2011.", "The Members of Parliament consider that by adopting this Act the Verhovna Rada of Ukraine has given the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine the right to establish the modalities and amounts of the social payments provided for by the above laws ..., thereby limiting the citizens\u2019 constitutional right to social protection.", "The authors of the request state that the subject matter of the State Budget Act is an exhaustive list of legal matters, provided for by the Constitution of Ukraine and the Budget Code of Ukraine, which excludes the issue or implementation of other legal acts.", "...", "2.1 In accordance with part 1 of section 46 of the Constitution of Ukraine citizens have a right to social protection, which includes the right to welfare in the event of total, partial or temporary loss of fitness for work ..., in old age and under other circumstances provided for by law. It is the duty of the State to ensure this constitutional right.", "...", "The size of welfare benefits depends on the State\u2019s social and economic possibilities, but they must secure the constitutional right of every person to a decent standard of living for himself and for his family as enshrined in section 48 of the Constitution of Ukraine.", "In its decision of 19 June 2001 (case on service record in science) the Constitutional Court of Ukraine pointed out that the amounts of welfare benefits depended on economic factors. The right to a pension, its amount and the amount of separate payments could be related to the financial situation of the State, economic feasibility and social and economic circumstances during different periods of development, as well as to the time of adoption of the relevant legal acts.", "Furthermore, in its decision of 8 October 2008 on insurance payments, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine pointed out that the modes and amounts of social services and payments to victims ... were determined by the State based on affordability.", "The Constitutional Court of Ukraine, when examining this issue, also took into account international legal provisions. Thus, according to Article 22 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights the amounts of social payments and assistance are determined in accordance with the State\u2019s resources. The European Court of Human Rights, in its decision of 9 October 1979 in Airey v. Ireland, considered that social and economic rights are largely dependent on the situation - notably financial - reigning in the State. This conclusion also concerns reductions in welfare benefits, as is noted in the judgment of 12 October 2004 in the case of Kjartan \u00c1smundsson v. Iceland.", "Therefore, one of the main elements in the regulation of relations in the social sphere is the principle of proportionality between the social protection of citizens and the financial situation of the State, as well as guaranteeing the right of everybody to a sufficient standard of living.", "...", "Therefore, the social and economic rights provided for by laws are not absolute. The mechanism of implementation of these rights can be changed by the State \u2013 in particular because it is impossible to finance them \u2013 by way of a redistribution of costs, with the aim of securing the interests of society as a whole. Moreover, these measures can be brought about by the need to prevent or remove a real threat to the economic security of Ukraine, which, according to Article 17 of the Constitution of Ukraine, is the most important function of the State. ... It is unacceptable to introduce legal measures under which the amount of pensions and other social benefits and allowances is lower than the amount indicated in part 3 of Article 46 of the Constitution of Ukraine and insufficient to guarantee a decent standard of living and preserve the beneficiaries\u2019 human dignity, which would be contrary to Article 21 of the Constitution of Ukraine.", "Thus, the change of method of calculation of certain types of welfare benefits is constitutionally possible until it reaches the limit when the very essence of the right to social protection is impaired.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
