The applicant, Mr Gintautas Jurgelaitis, is a Lithuanian national, who was born in 1970 and lives in the village of \u017d\u016bklijai, in the \u0160akiai Region. He was represented before the Court by Mr J. Gabraitis, a lawyer practising in K\u0117p\u0161tai.", "2. The Lithuanian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms K. Bubnyt\u0117.", "3. At around 2.45 a.m. on 26 February 2011, A.A. was wounded with a knife in the village of \u017d\u016bklijai. He sustained injuries to the face and abdomen, which were initially categorised as a minor health impairment and later as a severe health impairment. On the same day the \u0160akiai district prosecutor (hereinafter \u201cthe prosecutor\u201d) opened a pre-trial investigation.", "4. On the same day the applicant was served with an official notice informing him that he was suspected of having injured A.A. while acting together with another unidentified individual and while being under the influence of alcohol. He was suspected of having caused A.A. a minor health impairment, as defined in Article 138 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 22 below). The applicant was questioned and denied having injured A.A.", "5. On unspecified dates the prosecutor questioned the victim, A.A., and several individuals who had been with him on the night of the incident. They all stated that that night they had been celebrating a birthday in the house next to the applicant\u2019s. At some point they had decided to go to the applicant\u2019s house to buy more alcohol because they had heard that he was selling it. However, nobody had let them into the house, so they had left. Soon afterwards they had noticed two men following them \u2013 one of them had been the applicant and the other had been unknown to them at that time. It was the latter who had assaulted A.A. with a knife; subsequently, in an identification parade, A.A. identified his attacker as S.B.", "6. On 17 March 2011 the prosecutor discontinued the pre-trial investigation in respect of the applicant. The prosecutor\u2019s decision stated that during the investigation it had been established that the applicant had not injured A.A. \u2013 this had been confirmed by A.A. himself and by other witnesses (see paragraph 5 above). The investigation in respect of the applicant was therefore discontinued on the grounds that his actions had not constituted a criminal offence under Article 138 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code. The decision stated that a copy of it had been sent to the applicant, who had the right to appeal against it within fourteen days. He did not lodge an appeal. The applicant later submitted to the domestic courts that he had never received a copy of that decision (see paragraph 18 below).", "7. On 18 March 2011 S.B. became a suspect in the investigation. In the course of the investigation against S.B., the applicant was questioned as a witness once and participated in four confrontations with S.B., A.A. and two other witnesses. On each of those occasions the applicant signed to confirm that he had been informed about his rights and obligations as a witness, and had been warned that if he gave false testimony he would incur criminal liability under Article 235 of the Criminal Code (see the contents of the protocol for witness testimonies in paragraph 26 below). The applicant stated that on the night of the incident he, his friend K.B. and the suspect, S.B., had gone to the applicant\u2019s house to get alcohol and cigarettes. At some point S.B. had walked away from the house towards a nearby road and soon thereafter the applicant had heard screams coming from that direction. He had gone there with his car, had seen a group of young men beating up S.B. and had gone back to his house because he had not wanted to get involved. He had not seen S.B. assault anyone, nor had he known whether S.B. had had a knife.", "The applicant repeated a similar account of events, with some changes, in confrontations with S.B. and K.B., and the latter stated that they agreed with the applicant\u2019s version.", "8. On an unspecified date S.B. was charged with causing A.A. a severe health impairment, as defined in Article 135 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 22 below).", "9. On 6 September 2011 the applicant was questioned as a witness at a court hearing. He was warned that if he gave false testimony he would incur criminal liability under Article 235 of the Criminal Code and signed an oath. He was asked whether on the night of the incident S.B. had had a knife, whether the victim and his friends had been armed, and who had attacked whom during the incident. The applicant provided essentially the same account of the events as before (see paragraph 7 above).", "10. On 16 December 2011 the \u0160akiai District Court found S.B. guilty of causing A.A. a severe health impairment, as defined in Article 135 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code, and sentenced him to six years of imprisonment. The court considered that the victim, A.A., and the witnesses who had been with him on the night of the incident had given consistent statements which it had no reason to doubt (see paragraph 5 above). Furthermore, their account had been corroborated by police officers and was consistent with the items seized at the scene of the incident. The court also held that the applicant, K.B. and S.B. had given conflicting statements and had changed certain details in their statements when questioned on different occasions. Accordingly, the court viewed their testimonies as an attempt to help S.B. avoid criminal responsibility and dismissed them as unreliable.", "11. On the same day the \u0160akiai District Court also instructed the prosecutor to consider whether a pre-trial investigation should be opened in respect of the applicant and K.B. for giving false testimony under Article 235 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code.", "12. On 11 October 2012 the applicant and K.B. were served with official notices informing them that they were suspected of having given false testimony in the proceedings against S.B., as set out in Article 235 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code.", "13. When questioned on the same day, K.B. admitted his guilt. He stated that he had been afraid to testify against S.B. because the latter was a former prisoner who had been carrying a knife and boasting about assaulting people. Therefore, K.B. had been afraid that S.B. might seek revenge against him for unfavourable testimony. The following day the prosecutor discontinued the investigation against K.B. on the grounds that he had not intended to interfere with the criminal proceedings but that he had been afraid to testify against S.B., which was \u201cunderstandable\u201d in the light of the serious charges against S.B.", "14. The applicant was also questioned on 11 October 2012. He explicitly refused a lawyer, denied his guilt and refused to answer questions. On 15 October 2012 the applicant was informed that the investigation had been completed and that he had the right to acquaint himself with the case file, but he refused to do so. On 17 October 2012 the applicant was charged with giving false testimony under Article 235 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code. The indictment stated that, when questioned as a witness in the criminal proceedings against S.B. (see paragraphs 7 and 9 above), the applicant had lied about not being present at the scene when S.B. had assaulted A.A. and about not knowing whether S.B. had had a knife, whereas it had been established in those proceedings that he had been present and had witnessed the assault.", "15. When questioned at the trial, the applicant insisted that the testimony he had given in the criminal proceedings against S.B. had not been false. In addition, he submitted that he should not have been obliged to give truthful testimony in those proceedings because he had been questioned not only about S.B.\u2019s actions but also about his own role in the assault. The applicant submitted that he had been suspected of having taken part in the assault (see paragraph 4 above), and that even though the investigation against him had been discontinued, the domestic law allowed its reopening if new circumstances emerged (see paragraph 25 below). He further submitted that by giving truthful testimony he might have also revealed information about his possible drunk driving on the night of the incident or the possible unlawful sale of alcohol. The applicant therefore argued that convicting him of giving false testimony would be contrary to his right not to incriminate himself.", "16. The prosecutor contested the applicant\u2019s arguments and submitted that at the time when the applicant had been called as a witness, it had been established that he had not assaulted A.A., so he had not been questioned about his own actions. The applicant\u2019s testimony had only been relevant for establishing S.B.\u2019s actions on the night of the assault, in order to help the authorities determine all the circumstances of the criminal offence, and there had been no intention to reopen the proceedings against the applicant.", "17. On 17 January 2013 the \u0160akiai District Court found the applicant guilty of giving false testimony. The court held that the material collected in the proceedings against S.B. demonstrated that the applicant had knowingly given false testimony in order to help S.B. avoid criminal liability \u2013 the inaccuracy of his testimony had been established by the court in those proceedings (see paragraph 10 above). The court dismissed the applicant\u2019s arguments concerning his right not to incriminate himself. It held that at the time when the applicant had been questioned as a witness, the investigation against him had been discontinued on the grounds that his actions had not constituted a criminal offence (see paragraph 6 above), and that the applicant had been questioned only about S.B.\u2019s actions and not his own. The court also stated that the applicant had not been suspected of any other criminal activity, such as drunk driving or the unlawful sale of alcohol, so his arguments in that respect were also dismissed. The applicant was given a fine of 1,950 Lithuanian litai (LTL, approximately 570 euros (EUR)).", "18. The applicant appealed against that judgment. He submitted that he had not been served with a copy of the prosecutor\u2019s decision to discontinue the investigation against him (see paragraph 6 above), so he had continued to regard himself as a suspected accomplice to S.B. The applicant therefore argued that he had had an obvious interest in the outcome of the proceedings and should not have been obliged to give truthful testimony.", "19. On 17 May 2013 the Kaunas Regional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal. It endorsed the lower court\u2019s arguments that the false nature of the applicant\u2019s testimony in the proceedings against S.B. had been established (see paragraph 17 above). It further stated that it was clear from the case file that before each questioning as a witness, the applicant had been informed about his rights and duties, as required by domestic law, and warned that he would be held criminally liable if he gave false testimony (see paragraphs 7 and 9 above and paragraph 26 below), so he had had no grounds to consider himself a suspect. The court also reiterated that the applicant had been called to testify only about S.B.\u2019s actions which he had seen and not about his own role in the assault. However, the Kaunas Regional Court found that the lower court had erred when determining the sentence because it had applied an old version of Article 235 of the Criminal Code. It therefore changed the applicant\u2019s sentence in line with the version of that provision which had been in force at the time when the applicant had given his last testimony in the criminal proceedings against S.B. (see paragraph 9 above), and fined him LTL 15,600 (approximately EUR 4,520).", "20. The applicant submitted an appeal on points of law, again arguing that his right not to incriminate himself had been breached. However, on 23 December 2013 the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal. It reiterated that the applicant had been informed about his rights and duties as a witness and warned about criminal liability for giving false testimony, and that he had been questioned about the actions of S.B. and not about his own actions, so it must have been clear to him that his testimony could not have incriminated him.", "21. The relevant part of Article 31 of the Constitution provides:", "\u201cIt shall be prohibited to compel anyone to give evidence against himself, or his family members or close relatives.\u201d", "22. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code, valid at the material time and currently, read:", "\u201c1. Anyone who has injured another person or caused him or her to be ill, if as a result the victim has lost his or her eyesight, hearing, ability to speak, fertility or pregnancy, or sustained another serious mutilation, or contracted a terminal or longlasting illness posing a real threat to his or her life or seriously affecting his or her mental health, or lost a considerable part of his or her professional or general capacity to work, or sustained permanent disfigurement, shall be punished by imprisonment for a term of up to ten years.", "...\u201d", "\u201c1. Anyone who has injured another person or caused him or her to be ill, if as a result the victim has lost a small part of his or her professional or general capacity to work or was ill for a long time but did not suffer the consequences set out in Article 135 \u00a7 1 of this Code, shall be punished by restriction of liberty or by detention or by imprisonment for a term of up to three years.", "...\u201d", "\u201c1. Anyone who, during a pre-trial investigation or trial or before the International Criminal Court or another international judicial institution, has submitted a false complaint, application or report of a criminal activity, or given false testimony when questioned as a witness or a victim, or has given false conclusions or explanations when acting as an expert or specialist, or provided a false or knowingly inaccurate translation when acting as an interpreter, shall be sentenced to a term of community service or a fine or restriction of liberty or detention or imprisonment for a term of up to two years.", "...\u201d", "23", "24. Article 80 \u00a7 1 of the CCP provides that persons who are to give testimony about their own possibly criminal activity cannot be questioned as witnesses unless they agree to be thus questioned. Article 82 \u00a7 3 of the CCP provides that when such persons are questioned, they have the right to legal representation and to apply for status as a suspect, and they are exempted from liability for refusing to testify or giving false testimony.", "25. Article 217 \u00a7 2 of the CCP allows the reopening of a previously discontinued pre-trial investigation following the discovery of essential circumstances which are relevant for the proper examination of the case and which had not been established at the time the decision to discontinue the investigation had been adopted.", "26. The protocol for witness testimonies, adopted by the Prosecutor General on 11 April 2003 and valid, with some amendments, until 29 December 2014, provided that a witness must be informed about his or her right, in line with Article 31 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution, not to give evidence against himself or herself, or his or her family members or close relatives (see paragraph 21 above), about his or her rights and obligations as set forth in the CCP (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above), and about criminal liability for giving false testimony (see paragraph 22 above). That protocol had to be signed by the witness to confirm that he or she had been so informed.", "27. In its ruling of 31 January 2017 in criminal case no. 2K55699/2017, the Supreme Court, relying on its previous case-law (ruling of 23 June 2009 in criminal case no. 2K-255/2009 and ruling of 16 June 2015 in criminal case no. 2K-348-303/2015), held:", "\u201cArticle 80 \u00a7 1 of the CCP provides that persons who are to give testimony about their own possibly criminal activity cannot be questioned as witnesses unless they agree to be thus questioned, in line with the conditions provided for in Article 82 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ...
