The licence was granted for a period of seven years.

The report stated that the indicated amounts were payable to the State budget within a period of ten days.", "9.

Furthermore, it was alleged that the applicant company had manufactured and sold fireworks without a government licence.", "10. The SRS\u2019s report was based, inter alia, on:", "a) documents requested from and subsequently submitted by Gr.A., the head of the NTRC;", "b) statements by the heads of companies and individual businessmen that they had placed advertisements on Gala TV but had not received any documents acknowledging payment to the applicant company for such services.", "11. The applicant company objected to the allegations of tax evasion as fabricated and politically motivated as home-made advertisements that had a social function, which Gala TV had broadcast for free, had been taken into account by the authorities in calculating the tax arrears.", "12. On an unspecified date the SRS instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant company\u2019s chief executive, K.H., for tax evasion. The investigating authorities discontinued the proceedings after the required amount had been paid.", "13. Having received no payment from the applicant company as regards the amounts stated in its report of 12 November 2007, on 26 November 2007 the SRS brought a claim with the Commercial Court to oblige the applicant company to pay AMD 25,212,800 (approximately EUR 50,000) in tax debt and to freeze its bank accounts and other assets in the amount of the alleged tax shortfall.", "14.

He claimed that those tax records contained tax reports and other documents which could rebut the evidence submitted by the SRS. This application was rejected.", "20. On the same day the applicant company\u2019s lawyer also asked the Administrative Court to summon, inter alia, the heads of the relevant companies and the businessmen, namely A.J., S.A., S.M., H.P., G.S., G.A. and H.M. to whose statements the SRS had referred in its report.", "21.
