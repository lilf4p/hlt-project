The first applicant was born in 1981 and lives in Si\u00f3fok. The second applicant was born in 1995 and lives in Leps\u00e9ny.", "6. On 6 August 2012 the applicants were on an excursion to Lake Balaton. In the evening, they decided not to return home, but to spend the night in their car, a Fiat Punto, parked in a car park next to a pizzeria in Z\u00e1nka. Waking up, they noticed that a car was passing by theirs, coming back and forth several times. They found this frightening and drove on to the village of Tagyon, where they stopped their car in the parking lot of a private house.", "7. At the same time, around 3.05 a.m., an unknown person telephoned Mr S., a volunteer law enforcer, to tell him about a Fiat Punto suspiciously moving around in the neighbourhood, near a local grocery store. Mr S. informed off-duty police officer K., who was serving with the Balatonf\u00fcred Police Department.", "8. Subsequently, officer K., driving his private car and taking a self-defence pistol, went to inspect the grocery store, together with Mr S. Not having found any trace of a criminal offence, they notified the duty officer of Balatonf\u00fcred Police Department about the sighting of the suspicious car. They were informed about the identity of the owner of the Fiat Punto, following which they continued to look for the vehicle in the surrounding area.", "9. At about 3.30 a.m., they noticed the Fiat Punto parked in front of a private house. Officer K. stopped his vehicle, a black Ford Mondeo, perpendicularly to the applicants\u2019 car, about a metre away. Both officer K. and the volunteer law enforcer started to run towards the applicants\u2019 car, approaching from the back. The police officer shouted: \u201cPolice! Get out!\u201d and held up his police identification card.", "10. Ms Ha\u00e1sz, sitting at the steering wheel, only noticed two people getting out of a dark civilian car and running towards them in civilian clothes. Finding this frightening, she attempted to drive away, forcing the garden gate of the adjacent property and driving into its yard. Inside the garden, the dimensions of which were 67 x 17.6 metres, and noticing that there was no other way to exit, she turned the car around and drove back towards the gate.", "11. When the car was on its way out, officer K. waved at the car shouting \u201cPolice! Stop!\u201d and fired a warning shot. As it appears from the case file, at this time Mr S. was standing in front of the police officer\u2019s car, rather than in the prospective way of the applicants\u2019 car. When the car passed officer K., he shot twice more, at the car. The first shot was fired downwards from about 6 metres\u2019 distance, hitting the mudguard of the car on the left side at the level of the lights. The other shot was fired from about 4-4.5 metres following a downward trajectory. It went through the rear window, which fell into the car, missed the head of Ms Szab\u00f3 by 5-10 centimetres and then went through the window of the right front door.", "12. Ms Ha\u00e1sz continued to drive, trying to leave the garden by passing around the police officer\u2019s car to the left. She finally hit the officer\u2019s car at its right side, at the passenger front door. At this moment Mr S. was standing next to the police officer\u2019s car, at its left side, next to the open driver\u2019s door.", "13. Officer K. again called on the applicants to get out of the car, which they did. He put his gun away, presenting his police ID. Since the two men wore plain clothes and neither they nor their car had any police signs, the applicants realised that officer K. was a police officer and his associate a volunteer law enforcer only at this point in time.", "Thereupon it became clear that the incident was based on a misunderstanding, since the applicants had only been frightened but had had no intention whatsoever of countering a police measure.", "14. Subsequently the Veszpr\u00e9m District Investigating Prosecutor\u2019s Office (Veszpr\u00e9mi Nyomoz\u00f3 \u00dcgy\u00e9szs\u00e9g) initiated proceedings against officer K. on charges of attempted manslaughter (the charge being later on re-characterised as intentional endangerment committed by a public official). The applicants were questioned several times as witnesses, and a confrontation took place. Other witnesses were also heard and the opinion of a forensic firearms expert was obtained.", "15. Simultaneously, officer K.\u2019s superior, the Head of Balatonf\u00fcred Police Department, investigated the use of a firearm by officer K. He found that the officer had had no intention of endangering human life \u2013 his purpose had been to halt the applicants\u2019 car, which had represented a danger for him and his associate \u2013 but that the officer\u2019s action, although not criminal, had been unprofessional. According to the superior\u2019s internal report, following a first warning shot, a second, intentional shot had been directed at the car, while the third one had been accidental, endangering the life of Ms Szab\u00f3. The supervisor initiated disciplinary proceedings, which were suspended pending the criminal proceedings.", "16. The applicants also lodged a complaint formally challenging the lawfulness of the police measures with the Balatonf\u00fcred Police Department. These proceedings were suspended on 8 October 2012 pending the outcome of the criminal investigation.", "17. On 3 July 2013 the Veszpr\u00e9m District Investigating Prosecutor\u2019s Office discontinued the investigation. It found that officer K.\u2019s use of firearms was lawful in the face of the danger represented by the conduct of the applicants, namely driving, at a speed of 14-16 km/h, in the direction of his associate.", "The Prosecutor\u2019s Office accepted officer K.\u2019s statements, according to which he had given a warning before shooting and had first shot on perceiving a danger to the life of his associate. It also accepted the police officer\u2019s account of the events, namely that at the material time he could believe that his associate was standing between his car and the car of the applicants, which was approaching rather fast. Nonetheless, relying on the evidence furnished by a ballistic expert, the Prosecutor\u2019s Office dismissed officer K.\u2019s statement that the second shot following the warning had been accidental.", "The decision also relied on the report of the Chief of the Balatonf\u00fcred Police Department stating that officer K.\u2019s conduct had been unprofessional as regards the second shot fired at the applicants\u2019 car.", "The applicants\u2019 lawyer filed a complaint against the discontinuation.", "18. On 22 July 2013 the Veszpr\u00e9m County Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office (Veszpr\u00e9m Megyei F\u0151\u00fcgy\u00e9szs\u00e9g) dismissed the complaint, holding that the danger caused by the applicants had directly concerned the life and limb of officer K.\u2019s associate. Relying on section 56 (2) of the Act on the Police, the Prosecutor\u2019s Office found that the risk that the associate might be hit by their car had justified the shots by officer K. even if they had not been preceded by the requisite procedure, in particular a warning about the use of firearms, since any delay caused by the warning could have compromised the success of the measure. According to the decision, the applicants\u2019 behaviour had constituted a direct threat to the life and limb of both Mr S. and officer K.", "The applicants were informed that the complaint had been dismissed under section 199 (2) point b) of the Criminal Procedure Code and that they had the possibility of filing a motion for prosecution, acting as substitute private prosecutors, under sections 229-230 of the Criminal Procedure Code.", "The decision was served on the applicants on 29 July 2013.", "19. On 15 August 2013 the Veszpr\u00e9m County Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office rejected the applicants\u2019 renewed complaint. The County Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office informed the applicants that the prosecution authorities would not deal with any further complaint unless it disclosed relevant new facts.", "In a letter of 27 June 2014 the Attorney General\u2019s Office informed the applicants that there was no legal ground to quash the decisions on the discontinuation of the investigation in respect of officer K.", "20. Meanwhile, on 14 October 2013 the Head of Balatonf\u00fcred Police Department dismissed, in its resumed proceedings (see paragraph 16 above), the applicants\u2019 complaint about the actions of officer K. He concluded that although the latter\u2019s conduct had been unprofessional because of the way he had halted the applicants\u2019 car and the use of a self-defence pistol rather than a service pistol, it had not been unlawful. The applicants\u2019 appeal was dismissed by the Veszpr\u00e9m County Chief Police Department on 19 December 2013.", "Since the incident, the applicants have been suffering from psychological troubles."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
