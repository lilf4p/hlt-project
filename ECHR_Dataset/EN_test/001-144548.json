The applicant\u2019s son, A.S., had been serving as a lieutenant in the State Border Service (\u201cthe SBS\u201d) in Samukh region since May 2002. The frontier station where A.S. had been serving was situated at the AzerbaijaniGeorgian border, not far from the village of Burungovag. He was a deputy commander of his unit.", "5. On 18 November 2002, at the request of his commander, A.S. and seven soldiers under his supervision went to a belt of woodland near their barracks to cut some wood. The objective of the mission was to provide the frontier station with wood for its domestic needs. A.S. and the other soldiers were sent on the mission without any weapons, other than axes for cutting wood and ropes.", "6. After their arrival at the forest they divided into two groups: A.S. stayed with two of the soldiers, F.R. and A.A., and the other five soldiers worked in another part of the forest not far from them. At approximately 3 p.m. as A.S., F.R. and A.A. were approaching the road crossing the forest, where they met a hunter (B.N.) with a shotgun. A.S. asked B.N. to produce his gun licence. As B.N refused to do so, A.S. ordered the soldiers to take B.N. to the frontier station. At that moment, B.N. fired at A.S. He then attempted to shoot F.R., who prevented him from doing so by seizing his shotgun. However, B.N. managed to escape.", "7. The soldiers took A.S. to the frontier station on a tractor trailer.

B.N. confessed to his crime during the investigation. He stated that he lived in the Burungovag village and on 18 November 2002 he had gone to the forest next to the village to hunt because it had been his daughter\u2019s birthday. At approximately 3 p.m. he met A.S. and two soldiers in the forest. A.S. asked him for his gun licence, and as he failed to produce it, A.S. ordered the soldiers to take him to the frontier station. Following A.S.\u2019s order the two soldiers began to punch him and at that moment he shot A.S., who was standing between the two soldiers. He justified his action as retaliation for A.S.\u2019s order to take him to the frontier station. However, B.N. denied that he had also attempted to shoot another soldier.", "11.

They stated that on 18 November 2002 they had gone on a mission to the forest to cut wood and that during the mission they had been under A.S.\u2019s orders. When they arrived at the road crossing the forest, they met B.N., who was armed. A.S. asked B.N. for his gun licence. As B.N. failed to produce that document, A.S. ordered them to take B.N. to the frontier station. At that moment, B.N. shot A.S. and then tried to shoot F.R., but did not manage to do so because F.R. seized B.N.\u2019s shotgun.

Following a forensic examination carried out during the investigation, it was established that A.S. had died as a result of the shooting of 18 November 2002. The investigation further established that B.N. was not in possession of a gun licence. On 28 February 2008 a psychiatric expert concluded that B.N. was not of unsound mind when he had shot A.S.", "15. Having requested recognition as a legal heir of the victim (z\u0259r\u0259r\u00e7\u0259kmi\u015fin h\u00fcquqi varisi), on 11 March 2003 the investigator granted the request and the applicant was then heard as such.

The unit commander was also heard before the court. He stated that on 18 November 2002 A.S. and seven other soldiers went at his request to the forest to cut some wood for the domestic needs of the frontier station. At approximately 3.10 p.m. a tractor approached the frontier station and he learned that A.S. had been shot by a hunter.

The court also noted that the rules on hunting in the border area should be coordinated with the border troops.", "19. On an unspecified date the applicant and B.N. appealed against the Assize Court\u2019s judgment. The applicant asked the appellate court to sentence B.N. to life imprisonment, while B.N. asked the court to reduce his prison term.", "20. On 11 August 2003 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s and B.N.\u2019s appeals and upheld the Assize Court\u2019s judgment.

He also noted that B.N. had been given a lenient sentence and that the responsibility of the SBS\u2019s officers for his son\u2019s death had not been established.", "24. It appears from the case file that, in the proceedings before the Nasimi District Court, a representative of the Ministry of Finance objected to the judge sitting in the case, claiming that the judge in question had taken no action despite the fact that the applicant had insulted her at the hearings.", "25.

The court held that the applicant had failed to substantiate his objection.", "28. On 25 May 2006 the Nasimi District Court delivered a judgment on the merits, dismissing the applicant\u2019s claim. The court held that it had been established in the criminal proceedings that A.S. had been killed by B.N. and that a civil judge was obliged to take the findings of the criminal proceedings into account in order to establish the facts. Therefore the applicant should lodge a compensation claim against B.N., but not against the State, which was not responsible for the death of his son.", "29. The applicant appealed against that judgment. He claimed that his son had been killed because A.S. and other soldiers had been sent on a mission without weapons. He further complained that the civil proceedings had been unfair, claiming in particular that the judge had not examined his claim within the statutory time-limits and that the hearing had not been held in accordance with the formal requirements of the law.", "30. On 13 September 2006 the Court of Appeal upheld the first-instance court\u2019s judgment. It held that the State had no civil responsibility for A.S.\u2019s death, because his death had not resulted from any wrongful acts of the State authorities or their officials. The court further held that B.N. was responsible for A.S.\u2019s death and that the applicant could bring an action against him.", "31. On 12 December 2006 the applicant lodged a cassation appeal, reiterating his previous complaints.", "32. On 31 January 2007 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal. It noted that in accordance with Article 1100 of the Civil Code, the State was responsible for the damage caused to individuals by wrongful acts or omissions of the State authorities or their officials. However, the State was not responsible for A.S.\u2019s death because his death had not resulted from any wrongful acts of the State authorities or their officials.", "33. Article 32 of the Law on the Border Troops of 6 January 1994 provides that military personnel of the border troops, while directly protecting the State border of the Republic of Azerbaijan, will use firearms and weaponry.
