Under the first police report, at 2.30 a.m. on 19 July 2007, the applicant was noted in a public place while being in a state of manifest alcohol intoxication, swearing and disturbing passers-by. When the police ordered him to produce his documents and follow them to their vehicle, he resisted in a vehement manner.

It appears from the materials of the criminal proceedings against the applicant, which were instituted later (see paragraph 19 below), that on 19 July 2007 he was questioned in respect of Ms O.\u2019s murder. He submitted that he had bought cigarettes at her kiosk on 17 July 2007, without anything unusual having happened. The case file does not contain any further information regarding that questioning.", "12. On the same day the applicant had a conversation with his cell-mate in the temporary detention facility, Yu., who convinced him to confess to the murder. He also promised the applicant money in exchange for the information as to where the applicant had thrown the knife. The applicant drew a scheme. Subsequently the police found the knife at the indicated place. Yu.\u2019s statements and the related material evidence were eventually relied on by the trial court in the criminal proceedings against the applicant.", "13. Still on 19 July 2007, from 6.30 to 7.30 p.m., the police carried out a search in the applicant\u2019s flat in the context of the investigation of the murder of Ms O.

He confessed to having stabbed her several times after she had refused to give him cigarettes without payment.", "17. On the same day the applicant repeated his confession during a reconstruction of the crime. He also showed where he had thrown the knife.", "18. Later on 21 July 2007 the applicant was questioned as a criminal suspect. The questioning took place in the presence of a lawyer appointed for him. As noted in the investigator\u2019s decision to that effect, there were sufficient reasons to suspect the applicant of the murder and, given the fact that he suffered from a mental disorder, his legal representation was mandatory. During that questioning the applicant retracted his earlier confession and submitted that he had not been at the tobacco kiosk on the day of the murder. He explained that he had invented his confession being scared that otherwise he would not be released.", "19. On 23 July 2007 at 9.20 p.m. the applicant was formally arrested on suspicion of Ms O.\u2019s murder. The arrest report noted that there were eyewitnesses who had directly pointed at him as the offender.
