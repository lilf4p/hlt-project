The second applicant is the mother of Mr P., who died of the same disease in the same hospital on 19 June 2009.", "8. The applicants live in Moscow.", "9. On 13 October 2004 Mr B. was arrested on suspicion of robbery. The next day the Frunzenskiy District Court of St Petersburg authorised his detention pending investigation. He was then taken to remand prison no. IZ47/6 in the Leningrad Region. Twelve days later he was diagnosed with HIV.", "10. In November 2004 Mr B. was transferred to remand prison no. IZ47/1 in St Petersburg. On admission he informed the prison doctor about his HIV status. A relevant entry was made in his medical file, but no treatment was prescribed.", "11. On 1 December 2005 the Frunzenskiy District Court of St Petersburg convicted Mr B. and sentenced him to seven years\u2019 imprisonment. In August 2006 he was sent to serve the sentence in correctional colony no. IK-5 in the Leningrad Region.", "12. Having complained of abdominal pain, on 4 March 2007 Mr B. was admitted to the prison hospital, where he was later diagnosed with tuberculosis of the peripheral lymph nodes. It was decided that he should stay in the hospital for tuberculosis treatment.", "13. On 16 March 2007 Mr B. was seen by an infectious diseases doctor, who ordered a CD4 count to be conducted. The test, performed five days later, showed that the level of CD4 cells was 163 cells/mm3, which corresponded to an advanced stage of the disease.", "14. On 31 May and 16 June 2007 the infectious diseases doctor visited Mr B. According to the medical records, the latter asked for antiretroviral therapy. In response, the doctor \u201cgave him a talk\u201d. No HIV treatment was prescribed.", "15. On 20 June 2007 Mr B. was discharged from the prison hospital. Until April 2008 he was transferred from one prison medical facility to another for anti-tuberculosis treatment. Although the treatment was successful, the patient\u2019s overall medical condition continued to deteriorate. Medical specialists interpreted that as a sign of progressing HIV.", "16. On 2 April 2008 Mr B. was admitted to prison hospital no. RB-2 in the Republic of Karelia. At that time he was unable to walk, was feverish and extremely emaciated. Eight days later he was transferred to an infectious diseases unit. His doctor alleged that his grave medical condition resulted from a lack of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Mr B. was prescribed antibacterial and disintoxication therapy.", "17. On 22 April 2008 the medical authorities applied for Mr B.\u2019s early release on medical grounds. Three days later the Medvezhyegorsk Town Court of the Republic of Karelia granted the request. On the same day Mr B. was released from detention.", "18.

Having undergone a routine medical examination, on 31 July 2006 Mr P. was diagnosed with infiltrative tuberculosis of the right lung.

He was sent to prison medical facility no. 4 in the Republic of Karelia.", "23. Mr P.\u2019s medical condition worsened. The result of a sputum culture test performed on 26 February 2007 was smear-positive. By April 2007 Mr P.\u2019s tuberculosis had developed resistance to six of the drugs he had been taking. Following a decision of the prison medical board on 16 June 2007, his drug regimen was adjusted.", "24. On 26 June 2007 Mr P. was admitted to prison hospital no. RB-2 in the Republic of Karelia, where the tuberculosis treatment continued as prescribed. It appears that the change in medication improved the patient\u2019s lung condition. However, doctors noted a further development of opportunistic infections. A viral load test was performed, the results of which, as alleged by the second applicant, were not given to Mr P.", "25. On 13 July 2007 Mr P. returned to the prison medical facility. Chest X-ray examinations carried out on 24 July and 26 September 2007 showed that the condition of Mr P.\u2019s lungs had improved.

On 26 May and 4 June 2010 a Russian non-governmental organisation, Agora, complained to the Russian Prosecutor General\u2019s Office of the lack of HIV treatment for detainees, including Mr B. and Mr P. The complaint was referred to the prosecutor\u2019s office in the Republic of Karelia.", "28. In a letter to the Russian Prosecutor General\u2019s Office dated 6 July 2010 the prosecutor\u2019s office in the Republic of Karelia observed that in 2007 and 2008 prison authorities in Karelia had experienced difficulties with providing medical assistance to HIV-infected convicts in view of the fact that a large number of infected inmates had been sent to the Republic from other regions. The prosecutor\u2019s office said that the supply of drugs had been limited and the number of medical professionals had been insufficient, and acknowledged that the medical care of Mr B. and Mr P. had fallen short of the domestic standards. In particular, they had not received HAART. The prosecutor\u2019s office had sent the evidence it had gathered to the investigative committee in the Republic of Karelia to determine whether a criminal case should be opened.", "29. On 5 August 2010 the investigative authorities refused to open a criminal case into the deaths of Mr B. and Mr P. Citing the difficulties encountered by the prison authorities of the Karelia Republic in 2006-08, including the large number of HIV-positive inmates, a lack of specialists trained to treat inmates suffering from that infection, the absence of an immunological laboratory and the lack of medication, the investigators concluded that the prison authorities had taken all possible measures to provide medical assistance to HIV-infected inmates. No causal link between the absence of HIV therapy and the deaths of Mr B. and Mr P. was established. The investigative authorities stressed that Mr B. had managed to live in detention without the antiretroviral therapy for almost three years and that Mr P. had died more than seven months after his release. The conduct of the prison and medical authorities, in the investigators\u2019 opinion, did not reveal any signs of a criminal offence.", "30. The above decision was not challenged.", "31. In 2011 the applicants lodged a claim for non-pecuniary damages against the Russian Ministry of Finance, arguing that their relatives\u2019 death from HIV had been caused by the authorities\u2019 failure to provide appropriate medical care.", "32. On 28 October 2011 the Tverskoy District Court of Moscow examined the claim. It found that the burden of proof was on the applicants, who had to prove the unlawfulness of the prison officials\u2019 conduct, the alleged damage, and the causal links between the officials\u2019 conduct and that damage. Having noted the absence of a decision establishing a breach of the law by the prison authorities, and having referred to the decision not to open a criminal case into the deaths of the applicant\u2019s relatives, the court dismissed the claim as unsubstantiated.", "33. On 22 February 2012 the Moscow City Court upheld the judgment on appeal, fully endorsing the District Court\u2019s reasoning."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
