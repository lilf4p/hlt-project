By 30 August 1999 one of the passengers had been found alive on the Montenegrin shore, and thirty-five bodies had been found in the sea, thirteen of which were identified by their relatives. The forensic specialists who had performed autopsies on the bodies by 30 August 1999 stated that the cause of death could not be established with certainty on the basis of autopsies alone. In their opinion, however, the cause of death was drowning.", "9. On 1 September 1999 the Court of First Instance (Osnovni sud) in Bar initiated a formal judicial investigation (rje\u0161enje o sprovo\u0111enju istrage) against seven individuals on suspicion of illegally crossing the State border in connection with reckless endangerment.", "10.

The eleventh applicant was questioned on 10 September 1999. She stated that she had been living with her brother and sister-in-law and their children in Kosovo, but that her brother and sister-in-law had decided to go to Montenegro. They had not called her from Podgorica or mentioned that they had intended to go to Italy. She also stated that she had not recognised them amongst the bodies found, but had recognised her brother\u2019s arm in one of the photographs shown to her during questioning.

Four were adjourned because some of the defence lawyers, defendants, witnesses and an interpreter did not attend court; there is no information in the case file about one of the hearings. During the hearings that did take place, the court questioned four defendants and eleven witnesses.", "15. On 24 September 2003 the court decided to recommence the trial hearing due to the passage of time. By 14 April 2004 ten hearings had been scheduled, six of which took place.

During the hearings that did take place, the court read out the indictment again, questioned four defendants and sixteen witnesses, including the eleventh applicant, and read out the earlier statements made by the witnesses; the fifth defendant chose to remain silent. The eleventh applicant was heard on 8 October 2003. She stated that she had come to Podgorica with her brother and his family and had had no idea that her brother and his wife had intended to go to Italy. When asked to explain the differences between that and her previous statement of 10 September 1999, she stated that she was certain that they had all been together since they had all been living together in one tent. She also confirmed that she was illiterate.", "16. On 14 April 2004 the Supreme State Prosecutor (Vrhovni dr\u017eavni tu\u017eilac) in Podgorica instructed the State prosecutor in Bar to specify the indictment in terms of the facts and legal classification of the criminal offences, after which the court in Bar would declare that it lacked competence to deal with the case and would transfer it to the High Court in Podgorica (hereinafter \u201cthe High Court\u201d), as the competent court to deal with it. Accordingly, the indictment was amended and the case file transferred to the High State Prosecutor (Vi\u0161i dr\u017eavni tu\u017eilac) and the High Court.", "17.

By 31 October 2009 the translation of the indictment into Romani had become available.", "29. In the course of 2010 seven hearings were scheduled. One was held on 8 October 2010, during which the indictment was read out and four defendants were heard, the fifth having chosen to remain silent. Six hearings scheduled for 5 February, 29 April, 4 June, 2 July, 17 November and 17 December 2010 were adjourned because some of the defendants, defence lawyers, the interpreter for Romani and a witness did not attend court.", "30. On 25 January 2011 another judge of the High Court took over the case. In the course of 2011 eight hearings were scheduled, seven of which were adjourned: (a) three because there was no permanent court interpreter for Romani; (b) two because the defence lawyers and witnesses did not attend court; (c) one because one defendant and several defence lawyers did not attend court and an interpreter had not yet been appointed; and (d) one because of changes to the Criminal Procedure Code, which made the relevant court panel incomplete. One hearing was held on 21 November 2011, during which four defendants were heard and their earlier defence statements made in 1999, 2003, 2004 and 2010 read out. The fifth defendant chose to remain silent.", "31.

Five hearings were held, two of which by 24 September 2012, when several witnesses were heard.

The fifth defendant remained silent.", "32. In the course of 2013 nine hearings were scheduled, five of which were adjourned because one of the defendants, two lawyers, an expert witness, a judge, and/or the interpreter did not attend. The lawyers were fined 500 euros (EUR) for their unjustified absence. By 18 December 2013 three hearings had been held, during which one expert witness was heard, and a number of other pieces of documentary evidence were read out, such as an earlier statement of another expert witness, earlier statements of other witnesses from 1999, 2003 and 2004, including the statements of the eleventh applicant, autopsy reports and reports from the Port of Bar of 1995 and 1998 relating to the boat. On 18 December 2013 the trial hearing was recommenced due to the passage of time. Four defendants and one of the expert witnesses were heard and their earlier statements read out.", "33. In the course of 2014 five hearings were scheduled, two of which were adjourned because the interpreter and one of the expert witnesses did not attend court and because one defendant was justifiably absent. By 4 June 2014 one hearing had been held, at which earlier statements of witnesses, including the eleventh applicant\u2019s statements, official reports, autopsy reports and experts witness statements were read out. On 4 June 2014 the trial hearing was recommenced due to the passage of time. At that and the subsequent hearing held in 2014 the court read out the indictment, the defendants\u2019 earlier statements and some witness statements, including the eleventh applicant\u2019s, as well as other written evidence. One of the witnesses was also heard.", "34. On 24 July 2014 the High Court acquitted all the accused for lack of evidence.

On an unspecified date prior to 7 December 2009 the Roma Centre complained to the Ombudsman, asking for the criminal proceedings to be expedited and the responsible persons punished, as well as for a DNA analysis of the bodies which had been buried.", "36. On 7 December 2009 the Ombudsman issued a report in this regard noting, in substance, that the investigation had lasted for more than seven years and that ten years after the impugned event the criminal proceedings had not yet been terminated, which was unjustified. He recommended that the High Court undertake all necessary steps to terminate the proceedings as soon as possible.", "37.

In the course of 2002 a number of family members of those who had disappeared, two of them applicants in the present case, urged that the proceedings at issue be expedited.

On 15 June 2011 the president of the High Court requested the Ministry of Justice to appoint a permanent court interpreter for Romani as soon as possible, stressing that one of the reasons for the criminal proceedings in question having \u201clasted too long\u201d had been the absence of an adequate interpreter for Romani.", "41. It would appear that on several occasions the Roma Centre requested the High Court to expedite the proceedings, and that on 16 August 2010 it issued a statement that the investigation had not been effective.", "42. The eleventh applicant\u2019s initial representative submitted an authority form signed by her. He also specified that her two sons, two daughters-in-law and five grandchildren had died or disappeared in the impugned event."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
