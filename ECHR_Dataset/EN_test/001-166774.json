On 20 September 2007 the applicant was arrested in a hotel in Moscow. His passport was confiscated.", "8. On 21 September 2007 the Tverskoy District Court of Moscow authorised the applicant\u2019s detention pending investigation. In particular, the court noted:", "\u201cWhen deciding that [the applicant] should be detained [pending investigation], the court notes that he is suspected of having committed a grave and serious offence, that he does not have a permanent residence in Russia, that there are reasons to believe that, if released, the applicant might abscond or continue his criminal activity, destroy the evidence or in any other way interfere with the criminal proceedings against him. Under such circumstances, application of any restrictive measure other than deprivation of liberty would not be feasible\u201d.", "9.

The court dismissed the applicant\u2019s arguments noting as follows:", "\u201cThe court takes into account the arguments presented by the defence, including the references concerning his character. It discerns no new material facts or circumstances justifying [the applicant\u2019s] release or application of another restrictive measure.", "It follows from the materials submitted that [the applicant] is charged with a very serious offence, he is a national of another state. The medical documents presented do not demonstrate that [the applicant] is unfit for detention.", "The court concludes that the grounds for the [applicant\u2019s] detention have not ceased to exist.

E., S., and [the applicant] should be detained pending investigation which means that the grounds and the circumstances ... taken into consideration by the court when deciding on their detention have not changed and it is still necessary to detain them.", "In view of the above, it is not possible to use a less strict restrictive measure in respect of E., S., and [the applicant], including release on bail.", "When deciding on the extension of the defendants\u2019 detention, the court takes into account the circumstances as required by [law], notably their family status, age, health condition, and character information submitted by the defence.\u201d", "17.

The applicant is a national of another state, he does not have a permanent place of residence in the Russian Federation...", "The above information about the applicant\u2019s character and the gravity of the charges are, in the court\u2019s opinion, sufficient to assume that he may abscond, despite his and his defence\u2019s declarations and assurances. Furthermore, according to the report of policemen Z. and V., the applicant..., if released, is planning to flee abroad and continue criminal activities connected to illegal fishing in the exclusive economic zone of the Russian Federation, put pressure on witnesses, try to destroy physical evidence. In addition, [the applicant] repeatedly tried to bribe the officials in order to influence the investigation.
