The applicants were employed as police officers. They were all charged with the commission of various criminal offences. They were dismissed from the police force pursuant to Article 45 of the Ministry of Interior Act 1991 which was in force at the time. Subsequently, all the applicants were acquitted. However, their dismissals remained in force. They unsuccessfully challenged their dismissals in civil proceedings before the national courts.", "6. On 26 April 2004 a criminal complaint was lodged against the first applicant with the Jagodina District Court (\u201cthe District Court\u201d). He was reported to have instigated his superior, the second applicant, to abuse his power. He was arrested the same day and criminal proceedings were instituted against him.", "7. On 26 April 2004, simultaneously with the initiation of criminal proceedings, the Ministry of Interior instituted disciplinary proceedings against the applicant. He was suspended from the police force on the same day, pending the decision of the Disciplinary Court.", "8. On 5 May 2004 the \u0106uprija Municipal Prosecutor charged the applicant for alleged instigation to abuse of power.", "9. On 7 June 2004 the competent directorate of the Ministry of the Interior rendered a decision by which the applicant was dismissed from the police force. The decision noted that criminal proceedings had been instituted against the applicant and that Article 45 of the Ministry of Interior Act 1991 which was in force at the time of the dismissal could be applied. The applicant lodged an appeal against this decision. On 16 July 2004 the Minister, acting as a second-instance administrative body, rejected his appeal, confirming the dismissal.", "10. On 27 August 2004 the disciplinary proceedings against the applicant were stopped without any decision on the merits. The Disciplinary Court concluded that the applicant had already been dismissed from the police force as a result of the initiation of the criminal proceedings against him and that this fact rendered the disciplinary proceedings redundant.", "11. On 29 November 2004 the \u0106uprija Municipal Court (\u201cthe Municipal Court\u201d) acquitted the applicant. The Prosecutor appealed against this decision. On 29 March 2005 the District Court confirmed the Municipal Court\u2019s decision and the applicant\u2019s acquittal became final.", "12. Shortly after the applicant\u2019s acquittal in the criminal proceedings, he instituted civil proceedings in which he requested the annulment of the above decisions on dismissal. On 10 March 2006 the Municipal Court accepted the applicant\u2019s claim and ordered the Ministry of Interior to reinstate him in his former post. The court held that the formulation of Article 45 of the 1991 Ministry of Interior Act left broad discretionary powers to the Ministry of Interior to dismiss its employees even when no criminal responsibility was attributable to them. It concluded that this legal solution \u201cmost certainly left the possibility of abuse of this authority.\u201d It also observed that the applicant had been acquitted in criminal proceedings instituted against him. Finally, the court noted that the applicant had been dismissed without any determination of his disciplinary responsibility but solely through the use of the discretionary power given to the Ministry by Article 45 of the 1991 Ministry of Interior Act and without any further reasoning.", "13. The Ministry of the Interior appealed against this decision. On 2 November 2006 the District Court upheld the decision and reasoning of the Municipal Court.", "14. The Ministry of the Interior lodged an appeal on points of law before the Supreme Court. On 25 April 2007 the Supreme Court quashed the District Court\u2019s decision and decided that the applicant\u2019s dismissal was lawful. According to the Supreme Court, the Ministry of Interior had used its discretionary power under Article 45 of the Ministry of Interior Act 1991 in accordance with the law. It concluded that the applicant\u2019s acquittal in the criminal proceedings and the absence of a decision on the merits in the disciplinary proceedings were irrelevant to his dismissal. It also held that the lower courts had overstepped the limits of their authority in considering the necessity, proportionality and correctness of the dismissal decision.", "15.

He was arrested the same day and criminal proceedings were instituted against him.", "16.
