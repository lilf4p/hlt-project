The applicant, Mr Mustafa G\u00fcr, is a Turkish national who was born in 1979 and is currently serving a prison sentence in Silifke. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.", "2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "3. On 14 October 2004 the applicant, who was being searched for on suspicion of murder, surrendered himself to the gendarmerie.", "4. On 15 October 2004 he was taken to the S\u00fctl\u00fcce Central Gendarmerie Station for questioning. According to a form explaining arrested persons\u2019 rights and which the applicant signed in acknowledgement, he was advised of the charges against him, as well as of his right to remain silent and to have access to a lawyer, and was asked to make a statement regarding the murder of M.S., a shepherd, by poisoning on 13 October 2004. The applicant stated that he did not wish to benefit from the assistance of a lawyer and then proceeded to give a detailed account of how he had poisoned M.S. He alleged that he had been blackmailed by his creditors into killing M.S. in order to steal his sheep.", "5. At 4.25 p.m. on 15 October 2004 the applicant was examined by a doctor, who stated that there were no traces of ill-treatment on his body. In addition, the medical report indicated that the applicant had not complained of any physical ailments or psychological conditions.", "6. On the same date he was brought before the G\u00fclnar Public Prosecutor, where he was again advised of his right to remain silent and to request a lawyer. The applicant refused the assistance of a lawyer and repeated the statement he had given at the gendarmerie station. He stated that he had surrendered to the gendarmerie and that he regretted what he had done.", "7. Later on the same day the applicant was questioned at the G\u00fclnar Magistrates\u2019 Court. Having refused legal assistance, he confirmed his statements given before the gendarmerie and the public prosecutor. He stated that he was in debt and that to secure payment of his debt his creditors had coerced him into killing the shepherd in order to steal his sheep. Subsequently he had agreed to kill the shepherd, and had bought an agricultural poison. He had also rented a lorry with a driver to transport the sheep. They had gone to the village and he had asked the driver to wait outside the village until he brought the sheep. Then, when he had approached the shepherd, a dog had attacked him. He had thrown a piece of bread laced with poison to the dog and it had calmed down. Subsequently, he had found the shepherd, had a chat with him and offered him a soft drink laced with poison. Right after the shepherd had drunk it, the applicant had gone away, regretting what he had done. At the end of the questioning, the judge ordered the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention.", "8. An expert report dated 20 October 2004 established that the fingerprints found on the lorry\u2019s rear-view mirror matched those of the applicant.", "9. On 26 October 2004 the G\u00fclnar Public Prosecutor filed an indictment with the Silifke Assize Court against the applicant and three other people, accusing the applicant of a number of offences including premeditated murder and the other three individuals of murder and/or incitement to murder.", "10. During the trial, the assize court heard more than twenty witnesses.", "11. A.K.K., the head of the village (muhtar), stated that a villager had noticed a lorry parked outside the village and had brought its driver to the village. The driver had explained that he had brought a person to the village who had told him that he was going to buy 68 sheep from someone. He had been asked to stay until 5.00 p.m. but the person had not come back. A.K.K. had asked gendarmerie officers to come to the village, and when they arrived they had started to search for the sheep with the villagers. The next day the body of the deceased had been found.", "12. H.H.K. testified that he had spotted the deceased walking with a man outside the village. However, two hours later he had seen that person a long distance away, herding the sheep himself.", "13. M.A., the driver of the lorry, stated that on the day of the incident the applicant had rented his lorry to transport some sheep. On the way to the village the applicant had bought bread and a soft drink. The applicant had asked him to stay outside the village until 5.00 pm. After a while, a dog had passed by which appeared to have been poisoned. The applicant had not come back and he had begun to suspect that there was something wrong. He had gone into the village and had explained the events to the head of the village and gendarmerie officers.", "14. A.T. testified that the applicant had rented his car three or four times before the incident. He had been called in by the gendarmerie for questioning. While he had been at the gendarmerie station the applicant and B.D. had arrived at the station.", "15. B.D. stated that the applicant had rented his colleague\u2019s (A.T.\u2019s) car three or four times. B.D. had been invited to the gendarmerie station for questioning. Thereafter the applicant had come to rent the car again. B.D. had mentioned the phone call he had received from the gendarmerie to the applicant. Upon B.D.\u2019s suggestion they had gone to the station together.", "16. According to the crime scene examination report dated 14 October 2013 drawn up by the gendarmerie, the deceased\u2019s body was found lying face down on the ground. His arms were under his abdomen. There was foam and blood around his mouth, and there was vomit residue around his feet. There were no signs of a firearm wound, open wound or blood on his body. The report further revealed that 68 sheep had been found hidden some distance away.", "17. Following a toxicological examination, on 23 February 2005 the Adana Branch of the Forensic Medicine Institute prepared a report finding that there were no traces of toxic substances, alcohol or drugs in the deceased\u2019s blood, urine and internal organs.", "18. Lastly, on 3 May 2006 a report was prepared by the Forensic Medicine Institute upon the request of the Pathology Department of the Forensic Medicine Institute. The report revealed that the crime scene and the residue of vomit would lead to the conclusion that the deceased had been poisoned. It further disclosed that traces of toxic substances could not be detected in the deceased\u2019s tissue or fluids due to the time which had elapsed. However, taking into account the fact that there was no medical evidence to show that the deceased had been poisoned, the report was unable to establish the exact cause of death.", "19. During the trial, the applicant was represented by a lawyer. In his defence submissions before the Silifke Assize Court, the applicant denied the statements he had made before the gendarmerie, the public prosecutor and the magistrates\u2019 court. He alleged that his statement at the gendarmerie station had been extracted under duress and that he had been forced to sign a statement dictated by the gendarmerie. Moreover, he alleged that the gendarmerie had forced him to repeat the same statement before the public prosecutor and the magistrates\u2019 court and he had done so because he was scared that if he did not comply he would be ill-treated again. In the written defence submissions presented to the trial court, the applicant\u2019s lawyer stated that the applicant had been forced by the authorities to sign self-incriminating statements which included his alleged refusal to be assisted by a lawyer. He maintained that the statements in the case file had no legal validity.", "20. On an unspecified date, the public prosecutor submitted his written opinion on the merits of the case to the Silifke Assize Court, in which he recommended the applicant\u2019s acquittal, along with the three other defendants, due to a lack of evidence establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the applicant had committed the offence with which he was charged.", "21. On 30 October 2007 the Silifke Assize Court convicted the applicant of murder and robbery and sentenced him to life imprisonment under Articles 82 \u00a7 1 and 149 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code (Law no. 5237), but acquitted his co-defendants due to a lack of evidence. In convicting the applicant, the assize court principally relied on his statements before the gendarmerie, the public prosecutor and the magistrates\u2019 court, the witness statements of approximately twenty witnesses, identification reports, the scene of incident report and fingerprint evidence. It did not give credence to the defence submissions made by the applicant during the proceedings in which he denied all his previous statements, finding that he had only made them to avoid conviction. The trial court moreover stated that a number of the witness statements were perfectly consistent with the applicant\u2019s initial self-incriminating statements, which suggested their accuracy. As regards his allegations of ill-treatment, the assize court stated that the medical reports issued prior to and following the applicant\u2019s detention at the gendarmerie station indicated no traces of illtreatment on his body. These allegations were, therefore, held to be unfounded.", "22. On 8 July 2009 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the Silifke Assize Court with a correction. Noting that the deceased had been a minor at the material time, it changed the sentence to aggravated life imprisonment (a whole life tariff).", "23. The relevant domestic law and practice in force at the material time can be found in Salduz v. Turkey ([GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7\u00a7 27-44, 27 November 2008)."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
