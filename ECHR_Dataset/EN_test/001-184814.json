On 16 December 2003 the Supreme Court of the Tatarstan Republic upheld that decision on appeal. The applicant subsequently served the full two years of the custodial sentence.", "6. On 13 July 2016 the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Tatarstan Republic quashed the decision of 14 November 2003 and the appeal decision of 16 December 2003, noting that the offence of disorderly acts had been decriminalised on 11 December 2003 and that the original sentence had been unenforceable. It held however that the applicant was not eligible for compensation for the unlawful detention because he had been initially found guilty and because the \u201cright to the rehabilitation\u201d did not cover the situations of ex post facto decriminalisation."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-5"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
