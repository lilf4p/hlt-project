The applicant was born in 1949 and is currently serving a prison sentence in Lepoglava.", "6. The applicant was a vice-president of the Croatian Privatisation Fund (Hrvatski fond za privatizaciju \u2013 hereinafter \u201cthe Fund\u201d), a legal entity established by the State and tasked with carrying out the privatisation of publicly owned property.", "7. In August and October 2006 M.M., a businessman from Russia, approached the State Attorney\u2019s Office for the Suppression of Corruption and Organised Crime (Ured za suzbijanje korupcije i organiziranog kriminaliteta \u2013 hereinafter: \u201cthe State Attorney\u2019s Office\u201d) alleging that he had been trying to make various business investments in Croatia and that he had been introduced to a certain A.P., allegedly an official of the Fund, who had offered his assistance in pursuing the project in the State. In return, A.P. had asked M.M. to deposit 2,250,000 euros (EUR) in various bank accounts.", "8. In March 2007 an investigating judge of the Zagreb County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Zagrebu) authorised the secret surveillance of a number of individuals, including A.P., in connection with suspicions of bribe-taking and abuse of power and authority. M.M. was granted informant status.", "9. In the course of further investigation using secret surveillance, several meetings were recorded in which M.M., assisted by a consultant, J.K., discussed with a lawyer, A.Pi., the measures that needed to be taken in order to carry out a business project in the Zadar region. On that occasion A.Pi. mentioned the applicant as her contact in the Fund. She also stated that everybody should make out well in this business undertaking. J.K. also explained that he knew the applicant from before and that very soon they would have a meeting concerning the investment at issue.", "10. On 3 April 2007 J.K. approached the State Attorney\u2019s Office claiming that he was the representative of M.M. and that he had already had a number of contacts with various officials concerning M.M.\u2019s investment in Croatia. In this connection, the day before he had also contacted the applicant, in his capacity as vice-president of the Fund, who had allegedly requested a provision of 5% of the total investment value, which was approximately between EUR 23,000,000 and 25,000,000, to help with the realisation of the project. The applicant had explained to J.K. that that amount would have to be distributed to the bank accounts of three (out of five) vice-presidents of the Fund who would take part in the decision-making process. J.K. consented to act as an informant under the further guidance of the prosecuting authorities.", "11. On 3 April 2007 the State Attorney\u2019s Office asked an investigating judge of the Zagreb County Court to authorise the use of special investigative measures in respect of the applicant, specifically the tapping of his telephone, covert surveillance of him, the use of J.K. as an informant, and conducting a simulated purchase operation.", "12. On the same day the application was allowed and the investigating judge ordered the use of special investigative measures in respect of the applicant. The relevant part of the order reads:", "\u201cThe application is accompanied by the submission of the Ministry of the Interior\u2019s Criminal Police Department, and the relevant official notes, statements and other material.", "The application is well-founded since the case at issue concerns the offences under Article 181 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the investigation into these offences by other means would either not be possible or would be extremely difficult.", "Therefore, all the necessary requirements under Articles 180 and 181 of the Code of Criminal Procedure have been met and the order should be issued with a view to securing the information and evidence necessary for the criminal case.\u201d", "13. In the course of the investigation, the investigating judge issued several further orders to the same effect. Various meetings between the applicant and J.K. took place. At a meeting on 11 April 2007 J.K. gave to the applicant EUR 50,000 in connection with his investment project.", "14. On 16 June 2007, on the basis of an application by the State Attorney\u2019s Office, the investigating judge ordered the termination of the special investigative measures, indicating that their use had produced the results sought.", "15. On 16 June 2007 the applicant was arrested and detained in connection with a suspicion that he had taken bribes and abused his power and authority in several privatisation cases.", "16. On 18 June 2007 the State Attorney\u2019s Office forwarded to the investigating judge 288 CD recordings of the secret surveillance operation, and on 19 June 2007 it forwarded a further thirty-six CD and twenty DVD recordings.", "17. On 19 June 2007 the State Attorney\u2019s Office asked an investigating judge of the Zagreb County Court to open an investigation in respect of the applicant and seven other individuals in connection with a suspicion of bribe-taking and offering bribes related to several investment projects in Croatia, including the one in the Zadar region (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above).", "18. In its request for investigation the State Attorney\u2019s Office relied on the results of the special investigative measures suggesting that the applicant, in his capacity as vice-president of the Fund, had requested bribes in order to support M.M.\u2019s investment project in the Zadar region. In particular, it was alleged that he had requested bribes amounting to EUR 220,000 and 5% of the total investment, which amounted to EUR 1,700,000. The secret recordings showed that the sealing of this agreement had taken place first on 11 April 2007 when J.K., acting as M.M.\u2019s representative, had paid the applicant EUR 50,000, and then on 24 April 2007 when J.K. had deposited a further EUR 150,000 in a notary public\u2019s safe in the applicant\u2019s favour. The State Attorney\u2019s Office also alleged that the applicant had organised the bribery of the President of the Fund in respect of the investment in the Zadar region, and had agreed to further bribe-taking with J.K. concerning another investment project related to the privatisation of the hotels \u017d. and P.", "19. When questioned with regard to the charges against him, the applicant decided to remain silent and not to give evidence. On the basis of the available evidence, the investigating judge accepted the request of the State Attorney\u2019s Office and opened an investigation.", "20. Meanwhile, on 20 June 2007 the State Attorney\u2019s Office forwarded 191 CD recordings to the investigating judge. It also forwarded an additional ninety-eight CD recordings to the investigating judge containing secret surveillance of individuals in respect of whom an investigation had not been opened at that time.", "21. On 21 June 2007 the investigating judge in charge of the supervision of the special investigative measures forwarded to the investigating judge conducting the investigation 191 CD recordings and the relevant reports concerning the secret surveillance of the suspects and the informants M.M. and J.K.", "22. On 26 July 2007 the applicant asked to have access to and to have copies of the secret surveillance CD and DVD recordings.", "23. The investigating judge conducting the investigation commissioned a telecommunications expert report including transcripts of the relevant secret surveillance recordings. These were produced by M.\u0110., a telecommunications expert. By a letter of 30 November 2007 M.\u0110. returned ninety-eight secret surveillance CD recordings in the case at issue that did not contain the communications of the suspects in respect of whom the investigation had been opened.", "24. In the course of the investigation the investigating judge authorised numerous search and seizure operations and questioned a number of witnesses in connection with the offences for which the applicant and the other suspects had been charged.", "25. When questioned as a witness by the investigating judge, M.M. explained that J.K. had offered him the services of his company to help with a business investment in Croatia. In particular, J.K. had explained that he knew how to contact the competent State institutions and how these things could be done in a legal way. Soon afterwards they had sent a letter of intent to the Fund concerning M.M.\u2019s investment but they had not received a reply. J.K. had then contacted the applicant, who had been his colleague at university, and arranged a meeting with him at the Fund. M.M. also explained that it was J.K. who had been in contact again with the applicant concerning the investment in the Zadar region.", "26. The investigating judge also questioned J.K. but he was unable to give evidence owing to his medical condition and hospitalisation.", "27. On the basis of the results of the investigation, the investigating judge twice extended the scope of the investigation to other alleged instances of bribe-taking and abuse of power and authority by the applicant.", "28. Following the completion of the investigation, the investigating judge forwarded the case file to the State Attorney\u2019s Office for further assessment and a decision.", "29. On 12 February 2008 the State Attorney\u2019s Office indicted the applicant and nine other individuals and brought them before the Zagreb County Court on charges of bribe-taking, offering bribes and abuse of power and authority. The applicant was indicted in his capacity as a public official on two counts of bribe-taking and bribery of the President of the Fund related to M.M.\u2019s investment project in the Zadar region, two counts of bribe-taking related to the privatisation of the hotels \u017d. and P. and the company P.O., and one count of abuse of power and authority related to the privatisation of the company B.", "30. The indictment was based on voluminous evidence obtained during the investigation and the recordings of the applicant\u2019s telephone communications and secret surveillance of him obtained by the use of special investigative measures. In particular, the State Attorney\u2019s Office indicated the particular sequence of the relevant recordings which it intended to submit as evidence at the trial. The State Attorney\u2019s Office also asked that the case file concerning the special investigative measures be examined.", "31. On 6 March 2008 the applicant lodged an objection against the indictment, arguing that it was confusing and incomplete. He pointed out that his position in the Fund did not fall within the scope of the definition of \u201cpublic official\u201d under Article 89(3) of the Criminal Code. He further stressed that J.K., a central figure in the case, had not been questioned during the investigation. The applicant also contended that his defence rights had been breached since the defence had \u201cneither seen nor heard\u201d the audio and video recordings on which the indictment had been based.", "32. On 30 April 2008 a three-judge panel of the Zagreb County Court returned the indictment to the State Attorney\u2019s Office on the grounds that one count of the indictment, concerning the applicant\u2019s alleged participation in the bribery of the President of the Fund, had been confusing. It accordingly instructed the State Attorney\u2019s Office to submit an amended indictment consonant with that finding. The State Attorney\u2019s Office complied with the order and submitted an amended indictment on 9 May 2008, following which the Zagreb County Court confirmed it.", "33. On 15 October 2008 the president of the trial panel examined the case file of the special investigative operation. On the same day she commissioned a further expert report from the telecommunications expert M.\u0110. ordering him to produce transcripts of the relevant recordings relating to two meetings between the applicant and J.K.", "34. An order for further transcription of the recordings was made on 24 October 2008. This concerned the recordings of three meetings between the applicant, J.K. and several other individuals, and the sequences of the telephone conversations and text messages concerned.", "35. On 7 November 2008 M.\u0110. produced transcripts of the recordings indicated in the Zagreb County Court\u2019s order of 15 October 2008 (see paragraph 33 above).", "36. On 10 November 2008 the first hearing was held before the Zagreb County Court. At the hearing the trial bench forwarded the expert report of 7 November 2008 (see paragraph 35 above) to the defence. The applicant pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, contending that he had been entrapped by J.K., who was an agent provocateur. The defence lawyer of one of the co-accused contended that the defence had not been provided with the surveillance recordings and that those measures had been ordered contrary to the requirements of the relevant domestic law. The trial bench dismissed these arguments as unfounded and scheduled the examination of evidence.", "37. On 17 November 2008 M.\u0110. produced further transcripts of the secret surveillance recordings related to the Zagreb County Court\u2019s order of 24 October 2008 (see paragraph 34 above).", "38. At the hearings on 27 and 28 November 2008 the Zagreb County Court heard evidence from J.K., who explained that he had represented Russian investors in Croatia regarding their interest in the construction of luxury villas on the site of a former brick factory in the Zadar region. He had therefore contacted the Fund and the local authorities in Zadar in order to complete all the relevant administrative matters for the investment. J.K. stated that he had had several meetings with the applicant and that at one point the applicant had requested a bribe in order to ensure the realisation of the project. J.K. had reported that to the State Attorney\u2019s Office and then he had consented to act as an informant. He further explained that he had given EUR 50,000 in cash to the applicant and that, at the applicant\u2019s request, he had deposited a further EUR 150,000 in a notary public\u2019s safe. It had been also agreed that J.K. would pay EUR 1,500,000 on completion of the project.", "39. On 2 December 2008 the Zagreb County Court commissioned another expert report from M.\u0110. concerning several particular sequences of the secret surveillance recordings.", "40. On 9 December 2008 M.\u0110. produced further transcripts of the secret surveillance recordings related to the Zagreb County Court\u2019s order of 2 December 2008 (see paragraph 39 above).", "41. The expert report was served on the defence at a hearing on 10 December 2008. At the same hearing the trial bench heard evidence from M.M. He explained that the relevant contacts with the applicant had been arranged and directed by J.K., and that he had not personally participated in any illegal transactions in the applicant\u2019s favour.", "42. At the same hearing the defence counsel reiterated their application for access to the secret surveillance recordings (see paragraphs 31 and 36 above). They argued that according to the available information there were in total 515 CD and 160 DVD recordings which had never been provided to the defence. In these circumstances, the defence counsel contended that they had not had an effective opportunity to prepare for the case. They also asked for access to all the recordings since it was possible that some of them contained exonerating information, which the defence could then submit as evidence.", "43. The trial bench dismissed the application by the defence on the grounds that the recordings which were to be examined at the trial as evidence had been duly transcribed by an expert and that the relevant transcripts had been served on the defence. In the trial bench\u2019s view, this allowed the defence sufficient time and facilities to prepare for the case as they would be able to raise all objections concerning the recordings after their examination at the trial. Moreover, the trial bench stressed that the sole purpose of the recordings was to examine them during the trial and that Article 155 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, although providing for the possibility of access to and copying of the case file, did not envisage the copying of CD and DVD material. The trial bench also stressed that the defence could have examined the relevant material in the court-house in the same manner as they had generally examined the case files.", "44. On 10 December 2008 the defence counsel sent a joint statement to the Croatian Bar Association (Hrvatska odvjetni\u010dka komora) complaining that they had been unable to effectively carry out their tasks as defence lawyers since they had been denied access to the secret surveillance recordings. They also contended that the evidence had been hidden from the defence and that it had been impossible for them to identify whether certain recordings could exonerate their clients or whether there had been suggestions of unlawfulness in some of them.", "45. At a hearing on 11 December 2008 the trial bench found that there were in total 212 CD and twenty-seven DVD recordings which had been provided to the court with the indictment of the accused. There were also ninety-eight CD recordings from the same secret surveillance operation but which concerned different persons and not the accused.", "46. On 12 December 2008 another hearing was held before the Zagreb County Court at which the defence asked for an adjournment in order to examine the case file concerning the secret surveillance operation. The defence argued that they wanted to examine all the circumstances in which the secret surveillance had been ordered and conducted. The trial bench dismissed the request by the defence on the grounds that the case file concerning the secret surveillance order had been incorporated into the case file concerning the criminal proceedings at issue and could therefore have been consulted by the defence. The trial bench also reiterated its previous arguments concerning the reason for the dismissal of the application by the defence to obtain the copies of the CD and DVD material.", "47. On 12 December 2008 the defence counsel sent a letter to the Zagreb County Court asking for access to and the possibility to examine the secret surveillance recordings. They stressed that the CD and DVD material had never been made available to the defence and that there were no technical means available in the court-house which would allow for the examination of the recordings by the defence. They also pointed out that because of the technical impossibility of examining the recordings in the court-house, the practice of the Zagreb County Court in several other cases had been to make copies of the CD and DVD recordings and to send them to the defence. In these circumstances, the defence argued that the Convention rights of the accused to effectively prepare their defence had been breached.", "48. On 12 December 2008 the president of the trial panel commissioned another expert report from M.\u0110. concerning several further secret surveillance recordings.", "49. On 14 December 2008 defence counsel for one of the co-accused sent a letter to the President of the Zagreb County Court indicating that it had been impossible for the defence to obtain access to and to examine the secret surveillance recordings by any means whatsoever.", "50. Further hearings before the Zagreb County Court were held on 15 and between 17 and 19 December 2008 at which the secret surveillance recordings were played back. The applicant argued that the recordings were incomplete and confusing and that there were discrepancies between the transcripts and the recordings. He contended that it was impossible for his counsel to work thoroughly since they had not had access to the recordings. The lead prosecutor also indicated that there were certain discrepancies between the transcripts and the recordings, which she then tried to clarify at the hearing. The trial court ordered the State Attorney\u2019s Office to provide the relevant clarifications and it also commissioned a report from the expert M.\u0110. in order to provide explanations concerning his particular findings.", "51. Meanwhile, on 18 December 2008 M.\u0110. produced further transcripts of the secret surveillance recordings related to the Zagreb County Court\u2019s order of 12 December 2008 (see paragraph 48 above).", "52. On 22 December 2008 the president of the trial panel commissioned another expert report from M.\u0110. concerning several other secret surveillance recordings. The expert produced his additional report on 2 January 2009.", "53. At the hearings between 12 and 14 January 2009 additional secret surveillance recordings were examined. The applicant argued that he had been entrapped and that the recordings were unlawful evidence.", "54. Further hearings before the Zagreb County Court were held between 26 and 29 January; 11-13 and 16-17 February; 4-6 and 9-10 March 2009 at which the trial court heard witnesses and examined further secret surveillance recordings.", "55. On 9 March 2009 the applicant asked the Zagreb County Court to again question the informant J.K. and to take further evidence concerning his activities in the Fund.", "56. A hearing was held on 12 March 2009 where the trial bench heard further witnesses.", "57. At a hearing on 16 March 2009 the State Attorney\u2019s Office asked that further secret surveillance recordings be admitted into evidence and examined. The applicant contended that the recordings had been unlawfully obtained as the use of secret surveillance measures had been ordered contrary to the requirements of the relevant domestic law. The trial bench accepted the request of the State Attorney\u2019s Office and commissioned an expert report from M.\u0110., instructing him to provide transcripts of the recordings.", "58. Further hearings were held on 17, 23-26 and 30 March 2009 at which the trial bench heard evidence from several witnesses.", "59. On 30 March 2009 M.\u0110. produced transcripts of the secret surveillance recordings related to the Zagreb County Court\u2019s order of 16 March 2009 (see paragraph 57 above).", "60. Further hearings were held on 15-17 and 20 April 2009 at which the trial bench heard further witnesses. The applicant contended that the initial contacts of J.K. and M.M. with the State Attorney\u2019s Office showed that they had been prepared to act as agents provocateurs and that he had been entrapped into engaging in illegal activities. He therefore asked that the evidence obtained by the use of informants be excluded as unlawfully obtained. The trial bench dismissed the applicant\u2019s arguments on the grounds that nothing suggested that he had been entrapped.", "61. At the hearings between 22-24 and 27-28 April 2009 the trial bench questioned the accused. The applicant stated that he had been incited to engage in illegal activities by J.K. but he refused to answer any further questions on the matter.", "62. On 29 April 2009 the State Attorney\u2019s Office submitted an amended indictment specifying the charges against the accused on the basis of the evidence adduced at the trial. At a hearing on 5 May 2009 the applicant pleaded not guilty to the amended indictment. He reiterated his arguments that he had been entrapped by J.K. and that he had not taken any actions which he had not been entitled to take as vice-president of the Fund.", "63. Further hearings were held between 8 and 12 May 2009 at which the trial bench heard the parties\u2019 closing arguments.", "64. On 15 May 2009 the Zagreb County Court delivered a judgment finding that the applicant, in his capacity as a public official as defined under Article 89(3) of the Criminal Code, had taken bribes (Article 347 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code), facilitated bribe-taking (Article 348 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code) and abused his power and authority (Article 337 \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3 and 4 of the Criminal Code) in connection with M.M.\u2019s investment project in the Zadar region, the privatisation of the hotels \u017d. and P. and the privatisation of the company B. The court sentenced him to eleven years\u2019 imprisonment. At the same time, it acquitted the applicant on charges of bribe-taking related to the privatisation of the company P.O. (see paragraph 29 above).", "65. The Zagreb County Court explained that all the relevant facts concerning the circumstances of the case had been duly established and that therefore there was no reason for the examination of further evidence requested by the applicant.", "66. As regards the application by the defence to obtain the secret surveillance recordings and a complaint of non-disclosure of certain recordings, the Zagreb County Court noted:", "\u201cWith regard to the recordings which [the State Attorney\u2019s Office] asked to be examined at the trial, an expert report was commissioned, that is to say, transcripts were prepared which were served on all the parties, the accused and their lawyers, who were thereby fully informed of the substance of the recordings submitted into evidence. In addition, this panel finds, that, with regard to the recordings which were to be examined at the trial, there was no obstacle to the defence lawyers examining [those recordings] in the court-house before the commencement of the trial.", "With regard to the other conversations of the accused, these [recordings] were not submitted into evidence but the defence could have examined their substance by the examination of the written reports filed in the [special investigation case file] after the submission of the indictment.", "This panel also considers that the recordings at issue were made solely for their examination at the trial and had they been provided to the parties, the court would not have had any legal basis at its disposal to prevent and prohibit the parties from reproducing [them] outside of the court[-house] before their examination at trial, and [the court would not have had any legal means] to prevent possible misuse of the recorded material.", "This in particular concerns the recordings which were not submitted into evidence; that is to say [the recordings] which concern other individuals and not the accused. Since these recordings were not submitted into evidence, the application by the defence to obtain them is completely unfounded.", "Furthermore, this panel has found that ... 212 CD and twenty-seven DVD recordings were given [to the court] whereas the remaining ninety-eight CD recordings concern individuals who had been under secret surveillance ... but were not [subsequently indicted].", "...", "Moreover, as was noted above, the defence had knowledge of the substance of the material submitted into evidence and they had no right to examine material which does not concern these proceedings; that is to say [material which concerns] individuals who were not indicted in these criminal proceedings ...", "This is because section 42(7) of the Office for the Suppression of Corruption and Organised Crime Act provides that if within six months following the termination of a secret surveillance operation criminal proceedings have not been instituted against the [individual under surveillance], all the material collected [during the operation] must be destroyed.", "It is clear that, since criminal proceedings were not instituted against these individuals, the recordings at issue are still confidential and should have been destroyed; they could not be and were not evidence in these criminal proceedings ...", "If these recordings were put at the disposal of the defence, that would amount to a breach of the above-cited provisions of law, particularly because [the recordings constitute] confidential material concerning individuals who are not under indictment.", "Moreover, Article 35 of the Constitution guarantees respect for the private life of every individual, and the court is obliged to act under the Constitution ..., so if it provided the defence with the recordings concerning other individuals ... that would amount to breach of the above-cited provision of the Constitution ...\u201d", "67. As to the applicant\u2019s plea of entrapment, the Zagreb County Court noted:", "\u201c... This panel finds that [the evidence obtained by the use of informants] is not unlawful evidence because it was obtained on the basis of an investigating judge\u2019s orders. The substance of the adduced evidence and the examined recordings do not show that there was incitement by the informant ... as was further demonstrated.\u201d", "68. With regard to the charges against the applicant and the evidence obtained by the use of informants, the Zagreb County Court extensively examined the secret surveillance recordings. It in particular analysed the recordings concerning a meeting on 3 April 2007 where the applicant had indicated to J.K. that a deposit should be made with regard to the investment and where he had also assured J.K. that the project would pass the procedure. During the conversation the applicant had explained to J.K. that it was usual to remunerate for lobbying and he had further stated the following:", "\u201cHowever, for [the investor], these [things], this information, this access and the [action] which will be taken while the project is [in the pipeline] \u2013 for this lobbying ... that is worth ... what I told you the last time. And he can do it, that is fifty thousand euros ... for them that is for a drink, for this company ... That is three or four [glasses of] wine compared to [our other possibilities]. So that\u2019s that and then, then we can make a deposit as you said. After that, if the decision goes through something ... is to be given to me, that is, for him... let\u2019s say one hundred thousand euros more or less when the whole thing goes through. Because on an investment of twenty-two million euros to give one hundred thousand ... for him that would not be even 2% ... I would be overly modest if that would be so, you understand [sic].\u201d", "69. The applicant challenged the first-instance judgment by lodging an appeal with the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske). He contended that he had been entrapped and unlawfully and unjustifiably placed under secret surveillance. He pointed out in particular that the secret surveillance orders had not been properly reasoned and had been issued under the Code of Criminal Procedure and not the Office for the Suppression of Corruption and Organised Crime Act (hereinafter \u201cthe OSCOC Act\u201d). He also complained that the relevant evidence had not been disclosed to the defence, and that the first-instance court had erred in the legal qualification of his position as falling under the term \u201cpublic official\u201d under Article 89 \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code.", "70. On 17 February 2010 the Supreme Court quashed the first-instance judgment in respect of the charges of bribery of the President of the Fund related to M.M.\u2019s investment project in the Zadar region and ordered a retrial. At the same time, it upheld the applicant\u2019s conviction on charges of bribe-taking under Article 347 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code and abuse of power and authority under Article 337 \u00a7 4 of the Criminal Code.", "71. As to the applicant\u2019s complaint concerning the unlawfulness of the secret surveillance measures, the Supreme Court noted:", "\u201cThe first complaint to the effect that the results of the special investigative measures are unlawfully obtained evidence because the investigating judge\u2019s orders were made under the Code of Criminal Procedure and not the [OSCOC Act] is ill-founded.", "It is true that the [OSCOC Act] is lex specialis, but the appellants failed to observe that section 41(1) of that Act provides that the investigating judge may order, \u2018save for the measures under Article 180 of the Code of Criminal Procedure\u2019, two additional measures which are not provided under the Code of Criminal Procedure, namely the use of simulated business services and simulated business contracts. The special investigative measures ... applied in the case at issue are not provided for under the [OSCOC Act] and therefore the [investigating judge\u2019s] orders could have been based only on the Code of Criminal Procedure. Had the investigating judge authorised any of the measures provided for in section 41(1) of the [OSCOC Act], he would have been obliged to rely on that Act.", "...", "The further arguments that the results of the special investigative measures are unlawfully obtained evidence because the investigating judge, when making the orders, around thirty of them, failed to comply with the requirements set out in the case-law of the Constitutional Court [no. U-III-857/2008] to the effect that the orders must be sufficiently reasoned, are also ill-founded ...", "...", "This court considers that mere flaws in the reasoning of the secret surveillance orders do not make the results of such measures unlawfully obtained evidence. This is because Article 9 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that unlawfully obtained evidence is evidence which has been obtained in breach of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and is expressly provided for by the [Code of Criminal Procedure].", "Article 182 \u00a7 6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that evidence obtained by the use of secret surveillance, under Article 180 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, cannot be used as evidence in criminal proceedings only [in a case where] it is unlawful. That is to say, evidence which is obtained without a warrant issued by the investigating judge, or if the [police] acted contrary to Articles 180 and 182 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but [this does not concern] the evidence obtained contrary to Article 182 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides that the order [authorising special investigative measures] should, inter alia, refer to the facts which warrant the application of such measures, specifically that there is a reasonable suspicion that an individual has committed a criminal offence and that the investigation could not have been carried out by other means or that [to do so] would have been extremely difficult.", "Article 182 \u00a7 6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is compatible with the legal nature of [special investigation] orders. Such orders [made by the investigating judge] are transmitted to the State Attorney, who is authorised to request them, and they are executed by the police. There is no legal avenue [to challenge] such orders since the [State Attorney] has no legal interest in challenging them. The police were therefore, moreover, not allowed to challenge the orders. If the argument of the appellants that secret surveillance orders would be unlawful when they are not sufficiently reasoned were to be accepted, it would call into doubt the [use of] secret surveillance measures, particularly in situations where all other legal conditions had been met but the order was merely not sufficiently reasoned, which would be absolutely unacceptable.\u201d", "72. As to the applicant\u2019s plea of entrapment, the Supreme Court held:", "\u201cThe complaints ... that the informants J.K. and M.M. had incited the accused were raised by all the accused during the first-instance proceedings, and the [first-instance] court correctly found that [this claim] was not clear from the reviewed material. The same complaints are now raised by the accused, Matanovi\u0107, P. and Pa., and this court considers that their complaints are ill-founded.", "The witnesses M.M. and J.K. testified that they had become informants after certain accused asked them for bribes [for carrying out the investment]. [M.]M. consented to act as an informant on 2 March and J.K. on 3 April 2007. After that the activity of gathering evidence commenced.", "...", "The offence of bribe-taking, which is the subject matter of these proceedings, is committed [just] by making a request for a gift or benefit, and since the witnesses contacted the State Attorney after they had been asked to make a payment to the accused ... the plea of incitement cannot be accepted.\u201d", "73. With respect to the complaint about the non-disclosure of evidence, the Supreme Court noted:", "\u201cThe argument that the rights of the defence were violated by the non-disclosure of 515 CD and 177 DVD recordings, which were the result of the secret surveillance operation, cannot be accepted ...", "...", "It is undisputed that at the hearing held on 11 December 2008 the trial court established the exact number of recordings and found that 212 CD and twenty-seven DVD recordings had been submitted with the indictment, while it was found that the [special investigation] case file contained a further ninety-eight CD recordings concerning the secret surveillance of other persons who are not accused in the proceedings at issue. It is also not disputed that the State Attorney asked that eighteen CD and twenty-three DVD recordings be examined as evidence, and that the telecommunications expert made transcripts of these recordings, which were then forwarded to the parties. It is further undisputed that the recordings were reviewed at a hearing, that the accused and their lawyers were present, and that they made their objections concerning the transcripts and not concerning the recordings. It is to be noted that the transcripts are not evidence on which a conviction can be based but are only of auxiliary technical assistance. The only evidence on which a conviction can be based is the recordings, in respect of which no objections were made.", "Therefore, the defence had access to all the evidence from the secret surveillance, and the trial court allowed them to comment on the evidence adduced and they exercised that right.", "The trial court rightly held that, given that the defence had been informed of the substance of the evidence adduced, they had no right to have the other material which did not concern the accused in the proceedings at issue disclosed. The trial court also rightly pointed to the provision of section 42(7) of the OSCOC Act, which provides that the material obtained by the use of secret surveillance shall be destroyed if, within the six-month time-limit, criminal proceedings have not been instituted against the persons under surveillance ...", "Whether the State Attorney, when he was making his selection of the secret surveillance material [to be submitted to the court], excluded certain evidence in favour of the accused ... is of no relevance to the lawfulness of the proceedings at issue. Under the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure the State Attorney adduces only relevant evidence concerning the substance of the charges, and therefore he is in a position to make a selection of the evidence.\u201d", "74. As regards the applicant\u2019s complaint of the erroneous legal qualification of his position, the Supreme Court noted that the applicant\u2019s position in the Fund had not been one of a \u201cpublic official\u201d but rather of a \u201cresponsible person\u201d under Article 89 \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 7 of the Criminal Code. However, in the Supreme Court\u2019s view, this did not render the conviction unlawful. In this connection the Supreme Court explained:", "\u201c... [T]he omission at issue had no bearing on the legal qualification of the offence because the criminal offence under Articles 347 \u00a7 1 and 337 \u00a7 4 of the Criminal Code can be committed by public officials and responsible persons when they take the actions for which the court found ... Matanovi\u0107 guilty ...\u201d", "75. On 20 April 2010 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) reiterating his arguments of entrapment, the unlawfulness of the secret surveillance orders, the lack of access to evidence and the erroneous legal qualification of his conviction. He relied, inter alia, on Articles 29 \u00a7 1, 31, 35 and 36 of the Constitution and Articles 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (b) and 8 of the Convention. The applicant also complained that the statements of various public officials breached of his right to the presumption of innocence.", "76. On 30 June 2011 the Constitutional Court, relying on the Court\u2019s case-law in Pe\u0161a v. Croatia (no. 40523/08, 8 April 2010) found a violation of the applicant\u2019s right to the presumption of innocence but dismissed his other complaints, endorsing the findings and reasoning of the Supreme Court.", "77. Meanwhile, on 19 September 2011, following a retrial in respect of the charges of bribery of the President of the Fund related to M.M.\u2019s investment project in the Zadar region (see paragraph 70 above), the Zagreb County Court acquitted the applicant, and this judgment was confirmed by the Supreme Court on 18 January 2012.", "78. On 1 June 2012 the applicant, represented by I.F., a lawyer, lodged an application for the reopening of the proceedings before the Zagreb County Court. He relied, in particular, on a document allegedly issued by the Ministry of the Interior (Ministarstvo unutarnjih poslova Republike Hrvatske) on 3 March 1993 indicating that J.K. had worked as a police officer in the period between 1974 and 1993. Together with the document in question the applicant submitted a written statement by A.P., a lawyer, indicating that the document had been \u201caccidently\u201d left in her office by M.M. some time in May 2007. The applicant contended that this shed light on the actions of J.K., who had acted as an agent provocateur in his case.", "79. On 24 January 2014 the Zagreb County Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s application for the reopening of the proceedings on the grounds that, even if the document submitted by the applicant suggested that J.K. had worked as a police officer, there was no doubt that he had not been a police officer at the moment when he had acted as an informant in the applicant\u2019s case. The Zagreb County Court also considered that there were no new relevant facts warranting the reopening of the proceedings.", "80.
