On 16 October 2007 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of attempted drug trafficking and placed in custody. He remained in detention throughout the investigation and trial.", "8. On 28 May 2008 the Volzhsk Town Court (\u201cthe Town Court\u201d) convicted the applicant of attempted drug trafficking and sentenced him to six years\u2019 imprisonment in a high-security correctional colony. The court noted that the term of the applicant\u2019s detention was to be calculated with effect from the date of his arrest on 16 October 2007.", "9. On 9 September 2008 the Volgograd Regional Court upheld the sentence on appeal. It mentioned, inter alia, that at the time of the hearing the applicant was detained in temporary detention facility no. IZ-34/5 in the town of Leninsk in the Volgograd Region.", "10. The applicant asked the Presidium of the Volgograd Regional Court to re-examine his case by way of a supervisory review. In February and March 2009 the applicant submitted additional observations to the Presidium, which were dispatched from facility no. IZ-34/5. The application for supervisory review was rejected.", "11. The applicant\u2019s request for a re-examination of his case by way of a supervisory review was, however, granted by the Supreme Court of Russia, which on 13 January 2010 reduced the applicant\u2019s sentence to five years and six months\u2019 imprisonment.", "12. Having served his sentence in full, the applicant was released from detention on 15 May 2013.", "13.

According to the applicant, from 18 October 2007 to 27 June 2009 he was detained mostly in facility no. IZ-34/5. His letters to the Court dated 13 May and 7 December 2008 and 26 August 2009 were dispatched from that facility. A letter from the Court dated 8 June 2009 was sent to and received by the applicant in the same facility.", "18. The applicant also submitted that on several occasions he had been transported to court hearings and to penal medical institution no. LIU-15 in Volgograd (\u201cinstitution no. LIU-15\u201d) and that he had spent very short periods, in transit, in temporary detention facility no. IZ-34/1 of the town of Volgograd. In particular, the applicant had been sent to institution no. LIU15 in 2008, where he had undergone successful treatment for tuberculosis. A chest X-ray examination on 14 January 2008 indicated that his tuberculosis had been cured, although extensive calcification and fibrosis remained in his lungs. On 17 January 2008 a medical commission confirmed his recovery. The applicant was prescribed anti-relapse treatment, but this was never provided to him after his return to the temporary detention facility.", "19. The applicant filed a number of complaints \u2012 for instance with the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of the Volgograd Region \u2012 arguing that he had not been afforded adequate medical treatment in facility no.

In their observations of 31 January 2014, however, the Government mentioned the applicant\u2019s detention in facility no. IZ-34/5, but did not provide any further details.", "21. Despite the Court\u2019s request for the applicant\u2019s entire medical file, the Government submitted no medical documents dating from the period after his arrest and up until 29 October 2009.

On 27 June 2009 the applicant was transferred to correctional colony no. IK-154/9 of the Volgograd Region.", "23. According to the applicant, the medical service in the colony was very poor.

LIU-15 and the head of the detention ward, the applicant refused to take the drugs pyrazinamide, ethambutol, prothionamide and cycloserine \u2012 citing their adverse effects on his health through inducing negative development of his hepatitis C \u2012 and claiming that doctors should first treat his hepatitis. According to the same record, the applicant also refused to give a written explanation of the reasons for his refusal.", "35.
