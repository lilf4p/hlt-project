By a letter of the same day, the Head of the Izmail SIZO replied to the applicant\u2019s lawyer that, under the Code of Criminal Procedure, after the forwarding of the criminal case file to the trial court it was for that court to decide on the applicant\u2019s continued detention.", "11.

The judge concluded that there had been no grounds for the applicant\u2019s release on 28 February 2013.", "14. On 25 March 2013 the Odessa Regional Court of Appeal upheld the decision of 14 March 2013.", "15. On 15 April 2013 the Izmayil Local Court of the Odessa Region held a preliminary hearing in which it ordered the applicant\u2019s continued detention.", "16.
