The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Lublin.", "6. The parties gave partly different descriptions of certain factual elements of the case concerning the \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d regime (see paragraphs 42-45 below). The remaining facts were not in dispute.", "7. The applicant has a history of criminal convictions. For several years he was sought by the law-enforcement authorities pursuant to a \u201cwanted\u201d notice.", "8. On 6 May 2005 an international search warrant was issued against the applicant on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed, as a member of an organised criminal group, several counts of robbery, extortion, uttering threats, causing bodily harm and placing an explosive with intent to damage property. Earlier, on 4 May 2005 the Lublin District Court had also ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody for a period of fourteen days.", "9. On 24 November 2005 the applicant was arrested by the Italian police.", "10. On 21 December 2006 the applicant was handed over to the Polish authorities.", "11. On 28 December 2006 the Lublin District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) remanded him in custody, relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed, as a member of an organised criminal group, several counts of robbery, extortion, uttering threats, causing bodily harm and placing an explosive with intent to damage property. It attached importance to the serious nature of those offences and the likelihood of a heavy prison sentence being imposed on the applicant. The court also considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary in order to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given the risk that he might abscond. With regard to the latter possibility, the court relied on the fact that he did not have a permanent place of residence in Poland and that he had already been hiding from the police. Finally, the court emphasised that the applicant was a member of an organised criminal group and that certain other members of that group were still at large, which increased the risk that the detainee, if released, might obstruct the proceedings.", "12. The applicant\u2019s appeal against the detention order, like his further appeals against decisions extending his detention and all of his subsequent, numerous applications for release and appeals against refusals to release him, were unsuccessful.", "13. On 19 March 2007 the Lublin District Prosecutor lodged a bill of indictment with the Lublin District Court. The applicant was charged with several counts of robbery, extortion, uttering threats, causing bodily harm and placing an explosive with intent to damage property. The bill of indictment comprised numerous charges against five defendants.", "14. During the court proceedings the authorities further extended the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention on 14 September 2007 (to 20 December 2007) and 17 December 2007 (to 20 March 2008). The courts repeated the grounds previously given for the applicant\u2019s continued detention. They also found no grounds warranting the applicant\u2019s release from detention as provided for by Article 259 of the Criminal Code.", "15. On 7 March 2008 the Lublin District Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to nine years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine.", "16. The applicant appealed. He was kept in detention pending his appeal.", "17. On 30 January 2009 the Lublin Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) heard the applicant\u2019s appeal. It quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case. The court also extended the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention to 30 April 2009, repeating the grounds previously given.", "18. On 27 February 2009 the case file regarding the applicant\u2019s case was transmitted to the Lublin District Court for re-trial.", "19. On 7 April 2009 the Lublin District Court requested the Prosecutor to complete the bill of indictment. However, on 25 June 2009 the Lublin Regional Court quashed that decision, remitted the case to the District Court and ordered it to proceed with the trial.", "20. On 30 April 2009 the Lublin District Court further extended the applicant\u2019s detention to 30 July 2009, repeating the grounds previously given.", "21. On 9 July 2009 the Lublin District Court extended the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention to 30 October 2009. The applicant lodged an interlocutory appeal against this decision. On 23 July 2009 the Lublin Regional Court quashed the District Court\u2019s decision, finding that it had been taken by a judge who should have been excluded ex lege from deciding in the applicant\u2019s case.", "22. On 24 July 2009 the Lublin District Court, in a different composition, again extended the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention to 30 October 2009. The court further extended the applicant\u2019s detention on 27 October 2009 (to 30 January 2010), 22 January 2010 (to 30 April 2010), 21 April 2010 (to 31 July 2010), 16 July 2010 (to 31 October 2010), 28 October 2010 (to 31 January 2011), 12 January 2011 (to 30 April 2011) and 28 April 2011 (to 31 July 2011). On each occasion the court repeated the grounds previously given and found no grounds warranting the applicant\u2019s release from detention as provided for by Article 259 of the Criminal Code. In addition, the court observed that while it appeared from medical reports that the applicant was suffering from various health problems, treatment could be provided within the penitentiary facility.", "23. In its decision of 19 November 2009 dismissing the applicant\u2019s appeal against the decision of 27 October 2009 extending the applicant\u2019s detention, the Lublin Regional Court addressed the applicant\u2019s argument that his detention had exceeded the reasonable time requirement referred to in Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. The court cited the relevant provisions of the Convention and held that taking into consideration the complexity of the case and the fact that the applicant had been charged with numerous and various offences committed in cooperation with other persons the detention, although considerably long, had not exceeded the \u201creasonable time\u201d within the meaning of the Convention. The court also considered that \u201cdetention was indispensable because, other, less severe preventive measures would not properly secure their aim\u201d.", "24. In the meantime, on 16 November 2009 the Lublin District Court examined the applicant\u2019s request for release and dismissed it. The court relied on the same grounds as previously albeit it additionally observed that the applicant had no permanent place of residence in Poland that he had been previously convicted and once, when he had been granted home leave during his sentence, he went into hiding abroad. In Poland he used a fake passport. The court considered that in these circumstances and taking into account that the applicant still had an outstanding sentence to be served in Poland, there was a reasonable fear that he might abscond or go into hiding. The court concluded that other preventive measure, not involving deprivation of the applicant\u2019s liberty, would not secure the proper conduct of the proceedings.", "25. On 5 May 2011 the Lublin District Court convicted the applicant. The applicant appealed.", "26. On 28 February 2012 the Lublin Regional Court again quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case.", "27. Since 17 December 2010 the applicant has been serving a prison sentence imposed on him in another set of criminal proceedings.", "28. On 4 May 2011 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Lublin Regional Court under section 5 of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to an investigation conducted or supervised by a prosecutor and to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w post\u0119powaniu przygotowawczym prowadzonym lub nadzorowanym przez prokuratora i post\u0119powaniu s\u0105dowym bez nieuzasadnionej zw\u0142oki) (\u201cthe 2004 Act\u201d). He claimed that the proceedings had commenced in 2005 and were still pending. He sought an acknowledgement that the proceedings had been lengthy and just-satisfaction in the amount of PLN 10,000.", "29. On 26 May 2011 the Lublin Regional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint. The court did not accept the applicant\u2019s view that the proceedings had lasted since 2005. It examined only the course of the proceedings after 27 February 2009, stating that the applicant\u2019s complaint could only refer to the current stage of the proceedings, i.e. after the Lublin Regional Court had remitted the case to the Lublin District Court and had duly transmitted the case file. As regards the period after 27 February 2009 it considered that the proceedings before the trial court had been conducted with the requisite speed, especially given the complexity of the case. In particular, the court observed that the hearings had been held frequently and at regular intervals and that only a few had been adjourned for reasons not imputable to the trial court. It further observed that at the request of the applicant, on 24 May 2010 four witnesses who had their permanent place of residence in Italy were summoned to be heard at the hearing on 9 July 2010. The four summons were returned with notes \u201caddressee unknown\u201d. On 9 July 2010 the applicant indicated a Polish address of one of these four witnesses. The court adjourned the hearing until 25 August 2010 and summoned the witnesses again. On 25 August the court heard one witness; the remaining three failed to appear. On the same day the applicant requested the court to hear another witness who had been deprived of his liberty in the United Kingdom. The court granted the request and decided that the witness in question be heard through the consular office. The court also observed that there had been objective difficulties in appointing expert witnesses of several specialities and that some of the expert reports obtained were incomplete and had to be returned for rectification.", "30. On 3 January 2007 the Lublin Remand Centre Penitentiary Commission (Komisja Penitencjarna) classified the applicant as a \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d. It considered that this was necessary in view of the fact that he was charged with numerous offences against human life and health. The commission also referred to the applicant\u2019s serious lack of moral character and the fact that he was a recidivist. Finally, the commission emphasised that the applicant had already escaped twice from custody and had been hiding from the police for several years.", "31. Every three months the commission reviewed, and upheld, its decision classifying the applicant as a \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d. The commission underlined that the initial grounds for imposing the special confinement measure were still valid.", "32. The applicant appealed to the Lublin Regional Court against the decisions extending his status as a \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d. All his appeals were dismissed. In particular, the court gave decisions on 5 June 2008, 29 January and 10 June 2009. The authorities relied on the grounds set out in the initial decision. They laid particular emphasis on the risk posed by the seriousness of the offences and the fact that the applicant had already escaped previously from custody and had been in hiding for several years.", "33. On 17 July 2009 the Head of Lublin Remand Centre ordered that the applicant be placed in solitary confinement for a period of 14 days as a disciplinary punishment, after he had refused to undergo a strip-search. The applicant asked the Head of Lublin Remand Centre to reconsider his decision. The penalty was implemented between 18 July and 1 August 2009.", "34. On 24 August 2009 the Head of Lublin Remand Centre upheld his original decision, stating that it had been well-founded in view of the applicant\u2019s refusal to strip and his aggressive behaviour towards the prison guards who were to perform a body search. The applicant appealed.", "35. On 23 September 2009 the Lublin Regional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal, arguing that the impugned decision had been lawful and as such could not be contested before the court.", "36. On 17 December 2009 another disciplinary punishment was imposed on the applicant: he was refused permission to receive any food packages. The punishment was imposed on the applicant for allegedly aggressive behaviour prior to a full strip-search (kontrola osobista) on 13 December 2009.", "37. As a \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d, the applicant was subjected to a full body search every time he entered or left his cell, which meant that he had to strip naked in front of three prison guards and was required to carry out deep knee-bends at least twice a day.", "38. On several occasions the applicant complained about the full stripsearches. In particular, on 19 October 2010 he complained about a stripsearch of 13 October 2010. In reply, the Lublin Regional Inspectorate of Prison Service, after verifying the circumstances of this check, confirmed that it had been carried out in accordance with the relevant procedures.", "39. The applicant\u2019s visiting rights were also severely restricted. According to the list of visits submitted by the Government, which was not contested by the applicant, between 22 December 2006 and June 2012 the applicant received visits on 94 occasions. However, between 22 December 2006 and 10 December 2007 the applicant did not receive any visits. On 11 December 2007 he received a visit from his defence lawyer. From 14 April 2008 he was visited by his sisters, initially once a month and subsequently, after August 2008, twice a month. Furthermore, the applicant could leave his cell for one hour of outdoor exercise per day in a 16m\u00b2 courtyard surrounded by walls.", "40. Between 2007 and 2010 the applicant made many requests to the prison authorities, asking them to allow him to take part in training sessions, workshops, courses or other sports activities organised for the other inmates. All those requests were rejected.", "41. On 25 November 2010 the dangerous detainee status was lifted. The prison authorities stressed that the applicant\u2019s attitude had improved significantly and that he did not raise any security concerns.", "42. In respect of the full strip-search, the applicant submitted that during periods when he had been detained in a cell with another inmate, the strip-search had been carried out in the cell, and consequently had occurred not only in the presence of at least three prison guards, but also in the presence of the other inmate.", "43. The Government argued that the strip-searches had been performed in an adequately furnished separate room, which was monitored; the recording could be viewed in a duty room. Any recordings from the surveillance system had been automatically deleted after 7 days.", "44. The applicant further maintained that whenever he was outside his cell, including during his appearances at court hearings and medical visits, he had been required to wear the so-called \u201cjoined shackles\u201d (kajdany zespolone) on his hands and feet.", "45. However, the Government argued that the applicant had been required to wear \u201cjoined shackles\u201d only outside the Lublin Remand Centre and that inside the prison he had merely been handcuffed.", "46. On 7 June 2009 the applicant asked the prison authorities to allow him to vote in the European Parliament elections, in the polling station set up for that purpose within the confines of the prison. After carrying out a basic body search with a metal detector, the prison guard took the applicant to a separate room and ordered him to strip naked. As the applicant refused to do so, requesting the guard to allow him to vote without undergoing a full strip-search, he was taken back to his cell without being allowed to vote.", "47. On 8 June 2009 the applicant complained to the Lublin Regional Court that he had to undergo a strip-search and that consequently he had not been allowed to vote. His complaint was referred to the Head of the Lublin Remand Centre.", "48. On 16 July 2009 the Head of the Lublin Remand Centre dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint. He stated that as a \u2018dangerous detainee\u2019 the applicant was subjected to a body search every time he entered or left his cell. Since the applicant had refused to undergo a full strip-search on 7 June 2009 while being taken to the prison polling station, the guards had to take him back to his cell. Later that day the applicant was again asked whether he wished to participate in the elections but he refused, stating that he would not strip naked.", "49. On 16 July 2009 the Head of the Lublin Remand Centre confirmed that all detainees who wished to participate in the parliamentary elections on 21 October 2007 had voted.", "50. On 21 December 2006 the applicant was sent to the Warsaw Remand Centre. From 3 January 2007 he was detained in the Lublin Remand Centre. He was subsequently detained in the Radom Remand Centre and then again in the Lublin Remand Centre.", "51. The applicant suffers from hyperthyroidism, asthma, severe back pain, bilateral epididymal cysts and hypertension. During his detention in the Lublin Remand Centre he received pharmacological treatment. He also underwent a thyroid ultrasound (on 13 May 2008) and a testicular ultrasound. He also consulted specialist doctors.", "52. On several occasions he complained about the delay in obtaining appointments with specialists. In reply, he was informed on 5 February 2009 that the waiting time for specialist consultations had been similar to that for the population in general.", "53. The applicant submitted that throughout his detention he was held in conditions which fell below the basic levels of hygiene. He also alleged that his cell in Lublin Remand Centre had had no ventilation, had little natural light, poor artificial lighting and was badly furnished.", "54. The applicant submitted three envelopes from correspondence received from his sister, bearing an illegible signature and the stamps \u201ccensored on 1 July 2010\u201d, \u201ccensored on 12 July 2010\u201d and \u201ccensored on 6 August 2010\u201d respectively. In respect of the letter censored on 12 July 2010, an authorisation to receive a package containing copies of the court case files and the applicant\u2019s medical records had been issued by the Head of the Penitentiary Department of Lublin Remand Centre and was attached to the envelope. A similar authorisation to receive a copy of the court case files had been issued in respect of the letter censored on 6 August 2010 and was also attached to the envelope.", "55. On 6 September 2010 the Lublin District Prosecutor instituted criminal proceedings against the medical and nursing staff of the hospital ward of Lublin Remand Centre, for making false statements and forgery of the applicant\u2019s signature.", "56. On 29 April 2011 the Lublin District Prosecutor discontinued the proceedings."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "5", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3", "6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
