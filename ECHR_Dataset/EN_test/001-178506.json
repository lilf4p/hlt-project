The applicant was born in 1984 and lives in Mardin. At the time of the events giving rise to the present application, the applicant was a student at the Philosophy Department of the Faculty of Arts and Science at Dicle University.", "6. On 28 March 2006 a funeral of four militants of the PKK (Kurdish Workers\u2019 Party), an illegal armed organisation, took place in Diyarbak\u0131r.", "7. An incident report regarding events that took place between 28 March and 1 April 2006 was prepared on 3 April 2006 by the police and was signed by more than 220 officers. It stated that on 24 March 2006 fourteen PKK militants had been killed by the security forces and that the remains of four of the militants were released to their families in order to be buried in Diyarbak\u0131r. On 28 March 2006 at around 7 a.m., the remains were taken to a mosque where around 1,5002,000 people had gathered. The crowd blocked the traffic as they carried the coffins, chanted separatist, hostile slogans in Turkish and Kurdish in support of the organisation and Abdullah \u00d6calan, the leader of the PKK, and waved PKK posters and banners. The crowd then walked to a cemetery for the burial of the deceased. The security forces did not intervene as there were relatives of the deceased, including children and old people, in the crowd. The police report stated that after the burial ceremony had been completed, a group of about 1,000 people continued to march. They were warned by the police that they were not allowed to chant illegal slogans, disseminate propaganda in support of the organisation or wave illegal flags. However, the crowd became agitated and started throwing stones at the police officers on duty, injuring a number of them and causing extensive damage to State buildings and vehicles, banks, shops and other vehicles belonging to private individuals. According to the police report, more people later joined the illegal demonstration, which continued on 29, 30 and 31 March and 1 April. The report further stated that prior to those events some media organs controlled by the PKK had called for mass protests.", "8. On 5 March 2007 a demonstration was held on the campus of Dicle University to protest about the conditions of Abdullah \u00d6calan\u2019s detention, and in particular about his alleged poisoning by the Turkish authorities. A group of forty people entered the university building and asked the students to leave. They held a press conference on the premises of the university and chanted slogans in favour of the PKK and Abdullah \u00d6calan.", "9. On 9 March 2007 the applicant was arrested.", "10. On 10 March 2007 he was questioned at the anti-terror branch of the Diyarbak\u0131r police headquarters where he denied taking part in both the demonstration of 5 March 2007 and the funeral of 28 March 2006 and the subsequent events.", "11. On the same day, the applicant made a statement to the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor. He was shown photographs that had been taken of him on 28 March 2006 and 5 March 2007 during the funeral and the demonstration at the university. The applicant accepted that he had participated in the funeral of one of the PKK militants. He stated that the militant had been a relative of a friend of his, that he had attended the funeral as a religious duty, but that he had not attacked the police with stones. The applicant also stated that on 5 March 2007 he had stood in front of the university building with other students for a short while and that his photograph must have been taken then. He stated that he had not chanted slogans with the demonstrators.", "12. The applicant was brought before a judge of the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court later that day. He maintained that his statements to the public prosecutor had reflected the truth. The judge remanded the applicant in custody on the basis of a strong suspicion that he had committed the offence of disseminating propaganda in support of a terrorist organisation or its purposes.", "13. On 8 May 2007 the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment against the applicant with the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court. The applicant was charged with disseminating propaganda in support of the PKK and with membership of an illegal organisation under section 7(2) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713) and Article 314 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code (Law no. 5237), on the basis of Articles 220 \u00a7 6 and 314 \u00a7 3 of the same Code. The public prosecutor noted that on 28 March 2006 the applicant had participated in an illegal demonstration held under the pretext of a funeral; had chanted a slogan; and had covered his face with the hood of his coat during the demonstration. The public prosecutor also noted that the applicant had supported the chanting of slogans in favour of the PKK by applauding during the demonstration of 5 March 2007. The public prosecutor further claimed that the applicant had regularly, willingly and knowingly participated in illegal demonstrations organised by political parties, associations and persons who supported the PKK and that therefore he should be punished for membership of an illegal organisation.", "14. In support of the indictment, the public prosecutor submitted police video recordings of the funeral held on 28 March 2006 and the demonstration at Dicle University of 5 March 2007 to the court. In the first recording, the applicant was seen in a crowd next to a coffin making a \u201cV\u201d sign. In the second recording the applicant was again seen in a crowd with the hood of his coat on his head. In the third recording, the applicant was seen applauding with other students.", "15. On 19 June 2007 the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court held the first hearing during which the applicant made defence submissions. He stated that he had attended the funeral on 28 March 2006 and that he had briefly participated in the gathering at the university on 5 March 2007. He accepted that he was the person in the photographs. He denied the accuracy of the allegation that he had chanted slogans during the funeral and the demonstration. He noted that he did not remember that he had made a \u201cV\u201d sign, but that he might have done so, along with the rest of the crowd. A witness was also heard by the trial court, and confirmed the applicant\u2019s version of events of 5 March 2007. At the end of the hearing the court ordered the applicant\u2019s continued detention on remand.", "16. On 30 November 2007, at the end of the fourth hearing, the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court convicted the applicant of membership of an illegal organisation, the PKK, pursuant to Article 314 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code, on the basis of Articles 220 \u00a7 6 and 314 \u00a7 3 of the same Code, and sentenced him to six years and three months\u2019 imprisonment. The applicant was also convicted of two counts of disseminating propaganda in support of the PKK under section 7(2) of Law no. 3713, for which he received a sentence of a total of one year and eight months\u2019 imprisonment.", "17. The court first gave a summary of the applicant\u2019s defence submissions, the public prosecutor\u2019s observations on the merits of the case and the evidence in the case file. That evidence was the applicant\u2019s statements to the police, the public prosecutor and the judge, dated 10 March 2007; a photograph relating to the funeral of 28 March 2006; printed versions of news articles published by various media in support of the PKK which had been downloaded from the Internet; the arrest and incident reports; reports on the video recordings; a copy of the leaflet distributed at Dicle University on 5 March 2007; reports by experts on the examination of the video recordings; the applicant\u2019s identity documents; and a document showing that he had no previous criminal record.", "18. In its judgment, the Assize Court observed, on the basis of the police video recordings and the photographs extracted from those recordings, that the applicant had attended the funeral of four PKK militants on 28 March 2006; that he had walked in front of one of the coffins during the funeral; and that he had made a \u201cV\u201d sign. Noting that the funeral had subsequently turned into propaganda for the PKK-KONGRA/GEL, thus an illegal demonstration, and considering that the applicant had walked close to the coffins, the court considered that the applicant had played an active role in the illegal demonstration. The court noted that it was not established that the applicant had chanted slogans during the funeral. As to the demonstration held on 5 March 2007 at Dicle University, the trial court noted that the applicant had applauded while other demonstrators had chanted slogans in support of Abdullah \u00d6calan.", "19. The Assize Court noted that the funeral of the PKK militants and the demonstration of 5 March 2007 had both been held in line with calls and instructions issued by the PKK. They had subsequently turned into propaganda events in favour of the PKK and had become illegal demonstrations. Hence, the court found it established that the applicant had acted with the intention of supporting the deceased on 28 March 2006 and had acted together with illegal demonstrators on 5 March 2007, thereby committing the offence of disseminating propaganda in favour of the PKK and its leader.", "20. The Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court further referred to a decision dated 22 March 2007 (case no. 2006/9165, decision no. 2007/2432) of the Ninth Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation, in which the latter had considered that the acts of the accused demonstrators (participation in the demonstration of 28 March 2006 after calls for a demonstration had been made by the PKK, in accordance with the latter\u2019s aims; the chanting of slogans in support of the PKK and Abdullah \u00d6calan; singing the PKK\u2019s youth march song; burning tyres and blocking traffic; carrying PKK flags and banners and \u00d6calan posters; attacking public buildings, as well as police and civilian vehicles with stones and Molotov cocktails; carrying the bodies of the PKK militants who had been killed by the security forces) should be considered as offences committed on behalf of that organisation. The Court of Cassation found therefore that the accused should be punished for those offences and also be convicted of membership of an illegal organisation. Noting that the applicant had acted together with the aforementioned demonstrators on 28 March 2006, the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court considered that the applicant\u2019s participation in the funeral and demonstration and his conduct at that time had also occurred as a result of instructions and calls by the PKK. The court considered that the applicant had acted on behalf of the organisation, in line with the goals and activities of the PKK, and that therefore he should be punished for not only disseminating propaganda, but also for membership of an illegal organisation.", "21. One of the three judges sitting on the bench of the assize court dissented. In his dissenting opinion, the judge stated that neither Article 220 \u00a7 6 of the Criminal Code nor the explanatory memorandum on Article 220 \u00a7 6 explained the concept of committing an offence on behalf of an illegal organisation. The dissenting judge noted that such an offence should be capable of producing a result for a terrorist organisation and its aims, such as the offences of aggravated injury, kidnapping, deprivation of liberty, murder or bombing. He also noted that such an offence should have devastating repercussions for society when the way of committing the offence, the time of the offence and its effects were taken into consideration. He finally opined that in order to conclude that non-members of an illegal organisation had committed an offence on behalf of that illegal organisation, there should be a decision to commit an offence on behalf of that organisation and an intention to join the organisation in question. The judge therefore concluded that the applicant should only have been convicted under section 7(2) of Law no. 3713.", "22. The applicant appealed.", "23. On 29 January 2009 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of 30 November 2007 in so far as it related to the applicant\u2019s conviction under Article 314 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code, on the basis of Articles 220 \u00a7 6 and 314 \u00a7 3 of the same Code, for membership of an illegal organisation. The higher court, however, quashed the applicant\u2019s conviction under section 7(2) of Law no. 3713 on procedural grounds.", "24. On 23 March 2009 the Court of Cassation\u2019s decision of 29 January 2009 was deposited with the registry of the first-instance court.", "25. On 28 April 2009 the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court once again convicted the applicant under section 7(2) of Law no. 3713.", "26. On 17 October 2012 the Court of Cassation quashed the applicant\u2019s conviction under section 7(2) of Law no. 3713.", "27. On 14 December 2012 the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court decided to suspend the criminal proceedings against the applicant under section 7(2) of Law no. 3713, pursuant to Law no. 6352, which had entered into force on 5 July 2012. The suspension was for a period of three years, on the condition that he did not commit an offence when expressing ideas and opinions through the medium of the press or other media, or by any other method.", "28. In the meantime, on 25 October 2010 the applicant was expelled from Dicle University by the administrative board of the Faculty of Arts and Science because he had failed to complete his degree within the maximum period of seven years for an undergraduate programme. The case lodged by the applicant against that decision was dismissed by the Diyarbak\u0131r Administrative Court on 5 June 2012. The court considered that the fact that the applicant had been serving a prison sentence did not justify his nonattendance at classes and examinations.", "29. After serving four years and eight months of his sentence, the applicant was released from prison on 15 November 2011."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["11"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["11-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
