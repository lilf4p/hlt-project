On 20 September 2012 the Sverdlovsk Region office of the Federal Migration Service ordered his deportation to Armenia. It seems that the deportation order was executed on 11 October 2012.", "6. On 3 August 2008 the applicant, while under the influence of alcohol, took a car without the owner\u2019s consent and crashed into a tree. As a result of this accident he sustained multiple injuries, including a thighbone fracture, a dislocated hip and facial wounds.", "7. The applicant was taken by ambulance to Kurgan Town Hospital where he was admitted to an intensive care unit. He was connected to a medical ventilator and subjected to emergency anti-shock treatment. The doctors sutured his wounds. A metal pin for skeletal traction was inserted through the heel bone of his broken leg and the applicant was placed in a special metal frame with weights attached to his injured leg.", "8. Several days later his condition improved and he was transferred to a trauma department, where he remained bedridden in a skeletal traction frame. Osteosynthesis surgery was to be performed in due course.", "9. On 6 August 2008 the police opened a criminal case into car theft.", "10. It appears that during the investigation the authorities learned that the applicant was wanted by the authorities of the Republic of Belarus for a murder allegedly committed in 2003 in Minsk.", "11. A police investigator asked the attending doctor whether the applicant could be discharged from hospital and transferred to a detention facility.", "12. On an unspecified date the doctor informed the investigator that the applicant was in need of inpatient treatment on account of multiple injuries, including facial injuries, a dislocated hip and a thighbone fracture. Citing the seriousness of his condition the doctor noted that the applicant could not be transported to a court or police station. The doctor stated that police detention centres and remand prisons in Kurgan were unable to ensure the appropriate medical care to the applicant.", "13. On 8 August 2008 the investigator reported the content of the above letter to his superior.", "14. Four days later, upon a request from an investigator, a medical expert commenced an examination of the applicant to assess the seriousness of his injuries. Without informing the hospital administration and without having received the results of the expert examination, the police arrested the applicant and took him to remand prison no. IZ-45/1 in Kurgan. It does not seem that any special arrangements for the applicant\u2019s transport were made.", "15. It was noted in the expert report completed on 3 September 2008 that the applicant\u2019s injuries were of \u201cmedium\u201d seriousness.", "16. On 13 August 2008 the Kurgan Town Court, at the request of the Kurgan prosecutor and in the absence of the applicant, ordered his detention pending the receipt of an extradition request from the Belarusian authorities. That ruling was based on Article 466 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of Russia (\u201cthe CCrP\u201d) and Article 61 of the Convention on Legal Assistance and Legal Relations in Civil, Family and Criminal Matters (\u201cthe Minsk Convention\u201d).", "17.

On 23 March 2010 the Belarusian authorities closed the criminal case due to the absence of corpus delicti in the applicant\u2019s actions. He was then returned to Russia.", "25.

On 23 September 2008 the Town Court changed the measure of restraint to detention pending investigation.

The Regional Court upheld that detention order on appeal.", "27.

The latest detention order was upheld on appeal by the Regional Court on 15 January 2009.", "29. On 27 March 2009 the Kurgan Town Court convicted the applicant of car theft and sentenced him to four years\u2019 imprisonment in a correctional colony.", "30. On 26 May 2009 the Regional Court upheld the conviction and sentence, but amended the type of the detention facility where the applicant was to serve his sentence to a settlement colony.", "31. It is clear from entries made by civilian doctors in the applicant\u2019s medical history on 12 August 2008, the day of his arrest, that he was in satisfactory health; his body temperature, which had fluctuated for several days, was 37.7\u02daC; the pain syndrome was decreasing; his stitches were dry; and no signs of inflammation were present. The metal pin remained in his leg. In the discharge summary drafted on account of the applicant\u2019s arrest, \u201ccontinued medical treatment\u201d and crutches were prescribed. The attending doctor explicitly noted that the patient had been taken from the hospital without the consent of the chief doctor.", "32.

It was not disputed by the parties that the next day the applicant had been placed in a cell designed to accommodate a maximum of four inmates. The cell measured 15.4 sq. m. On 13 August and between 15 and 19 August 2008 the applicant had to share that cell with seven other inmates, with each inmate thus having no more than 1.9 sq. m of floor space. Several inmates, including the applicant, had no places to sleep.", "34. According to the applicant, in the remand prison he experienced a leg pain, nausea and loss of consciousness.", "35. Medical entries show that the applicant was seen by a prison doctor for the first time on 18 August 2008, in response to his complaints of pain, nausea and vertigo. After a visual examination, the doctor ordered the transfer of the applicant to Regional Anti-Tuberculosis Prison Hospital no. OF-73/1 in Kurgan (\u201cthe prison hospital\u201d) \u201cfor treatment and skeletal traction\u201d. The transfer was performed the next day.", "36. In the prison hospital several medical tests were performed. Owing to technical problems the applicant could not undergo an X-ray examination of his legs ordered by a doctor. He was seen by a surgeon and a neurologist.", "37. The surgeon, having considered the time that had passed from the termination of the skeletal traction, removed the metal pin from the applicant\u2019s leg. A walking stick was prescribed.", "38. The neurologist diagnosed the applicant with vegetative-vascular dystonia and prescribed a month-long drug regimen.", "39. The applicant was discharged from hospital on 27 August 2008 in a \u201csatisfactory condition\u201d.", "40. The medical documents in the Court\u2019s possession cover the period up to 21 May 2009. They show that at that time the applicant was seen by the prison doctor on account of his chronic peptic and liver conditions. It does not appear that he underwent any medical examination or treatment related to the leg condition.", "41. As to the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention during that period, the Government submitted that the applicant had been transferred between several cells of the remand prison, some of which were overcrowded. In particular, between 30 September and 8 October 2008, between 26 January and 19 March, 24 March and 10 April, 11 April and 2 June 2009 the applicant was afforded less than 2.7 sq. m of floor space, and occasionally less than 2 sq. m.
