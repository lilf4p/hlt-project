The applicant made numerous journeys in 2003-2004 between Volokolamsk remand centre and the temporary detention centre in Solnechnogorsk, which took three to four hours in an overcrowded van, which was cold in the winter and stuffy in the summer.", "8. On 11 July 2005 the applicant sued the State for compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage caused by the allegedly appalling conditions of his detention in the temporary detention centre.", "9. On 14 November 2005 the Solnechnogorsk Town Court rejected the applicant\u2019s claims. It established that the material conditions of his detention could be explained by insufficient funding.", "10.

However, the applicant did not receive the summons as it contained an error in the address, which was written as \u201c2, Vishnevskaya Street\u201d instead of \u201c2, Vishnevaya Street\u201d.", "13.

However, the competent authority would not issue them unless they were requested by a judge. However, the judge considered that the evidence adduced by the plaintiff sufficed.", "19. On 4 May 2005 the Solnechnogorsk Town Court of the Moscow Region granted the plaintiff\u2019s claim. It held that the housing law provided that minors living with a tenant in a flat leased under a social lease agreement enjoyed the same rights as the tenant as of the privatisation date. Accordingly, where flats were privatised without payment, they could become owners of the flat together with the adults. Furthermore, under the privatisation law then in force, a privatisation agreement had to contain a reference to the minors who enjoyed the right to use the premises in question.", "20. On 14 June 2005 the Moscow Regional Court upheld the decision of 4 May 2005 on appeal."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
