LITHUANIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Effective investigation) (Procedural aspect)", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3;Egidijus K\u016bris;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Nona Tsotsoria;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque;Vincent A. De Gaetano;Gabriele Kucsko-Stadlmayer", "TEXT": ["5. The applicant was born in 1985 and lives in Vilnius.", "6. At around 12.30 p.m. on 28 April 2006, the applicant\u2019s motorcycle collided with a car driven by M.N. in a residential area of Vilnius. M.N. was not injured, but the applicant suffered multiple spinal fractures and serious damage to his spinal cord. As a result of the accident, he lost the ability to walk and became disabled.", "7. On the day of the accident, 28 April 2006, the Vilnius City Police Department opened a pre-trial investigation concerning a possible violation of road traffic safety regulations resulting in an accident that caused nonsevere impairment to another person\u2019s health (Article 281 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code). The pre-trial investigation was supervised by the Vilnius City District Prosecutor\u2019s Office (hereinafter \u201cthe district prosecutor\u201d).", "8. On the same day M.N. was questioned as a witness. He stated that before the collision he had been driving at a speed of around 50 km/h and had decided to overtake the car in front of him. The road had two lanes. He checked that there were no cars in the left-hand lane, coming either from in front or from behind, indicated left and overtook the car. He then indicated right and began returning to the right-hand lane. At that moment he felt a blow to the back of his car but did not understand what had happened. He drove for another thirty metres and stopped the car. Then he noticed that a motorcycle and its rider were lying on the ground, and called the police and the ambulance service. He had not seen the motorcycle before the collision.", "9. On the same day the police investigator examined the scene of the accident. The investigator\u2019s report indicated that the accident had occurred on a sunny day, on a straight paved road which had been dry. It described the location of the applicant\u2019s motorcycle and M.N.\u2019s car as they had been found after the accident, as well as the presence of skid marks and fragments of glass and plastic on the road. All those elements were also indicated in a sketch drawn by the investigator. The sketch included a column for drivers to sign if they agreed that the scene of the accident had been depicted accurately, but it was not signed by either the applicant or M.N.", "10. On the same day the investigator examined the applicant\u2019s motorcycle and M.N.\u2019s car. The investigator\u2019s report described the damage to the front, back and both sides of the motorcycle, and to the back of the car. It also stated that before the accident both the motorcycle and the car had been in good technical condition and working properly.", "11. On the same day a court medical expert took blood samples from the applicant and M.N. in order to determine whether they had been sober. The examination detected no traces of alcohol in the blood of either of them.", "12. On 4 May 2006 the applicant was granted victim status in the investigation and questioned about the details of the accident. He stated that before the collision he had been driving at about 60 km/h and had decided to overtake a bus and two cars. Seeing that the left-hand lane was free, he began overtaking the bus and the cars and accelerated to about 70 km/h. After overtaking them, while still in the left-hand lane, he slowed down to 50 km/h, but as that lane was free, he decided to also overtake three more cars and a truck. He began to accelerate again, but then one of the three cars, which at that moment was about fifteen metres in front of him, suddenly pulled out into the left-hand lane without indicating. The applicant applied the brakes but started losing control of the motorcycle, so he released the brakes before applying them again. The front wheel of the motorcycle hit the back of the car. The applicant fell off the motorcycle and landed on the road. He did not see what happened to the motorcycle after the collision. He lay on the ground until the ambulance arrived and took him to hospital.", "13. On 5 May 2006 a court medical expert concluded that the applicant\u2019s injuries corresponded to severe health impairment.", "14. On an unspecified date the legal ground for the pre-trial investigation was changed to Article 281 \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code \u2013 violation of road traffic safety regulations, which resulted in an accident causing severe impairment to another person\u2019s health.", "15. From 3 to 16 May 2006 the police investigator questioned the applicant\u2019s mother and five eyewitnesses to the accident. It appears that the eyewitnesses provided contradictory testimonies as to the location and speed of the two vehicles immediately before the collision, the distance between them and the exact account of the events leading up to the collision.", "16. On 15 May 2006 the investigator examined the scene of the accident together with M.N. The latter indicated the trajectory of his car before the collision and the exact location of the collision.", "17. On 20 June 2006 the applicant was informed that a forensic expert would be instructed to examine the circumstances of the accident and establish an account of the events. The applicant\u2019s lawyer submitted additional questions to be forwarded to the expert. The relevant order adopted on 14 July 2006 by the Vilnius City Second District Court and forwarded to the expert on 1 September 2006 does not appear to have included the questions submitted by the applicant\u2019s lawyer.", "18. The examination was carried out by an expert from the Forensic Science Centre of Lithuania (Lietuvos teismo ekspertiz\u0117s centras), a governmental institution responsible for carrying out forensic examinations required by courts and other pre-trial investigation bodies. The expert was provided with the sketch of the accident (see paragraph 9 above) and photographs of the two vehicles, and asked to determine the location of the collision, to estimate the speed of the motorcycle before the collision, and to establish who had been responsible for the accident. The expert report, delivered on 31 January 2007 (hereinafter \u201cthe first expert report\u201d), stated that the description of the skid marks and the fragments of glass and plastic on the road indicated that the collision had occurred in the right-hand lane. The expert estimated the speed of the motorcycle immediately before the collision as at least 70.3 km/h and, assuming that the speed limit on that road was 50 km/h, noted that the applicant had exceeded that limit. The expert concluded that the accident had been caused by the applicant because he had been exceeding the speed limit and had started applying his brakes too late to avoid the collision.", "19. On 22 February 2007 the district prosecutor instructed the police investigator to carry out a number of additional investigative actions, including:", "\u2212 interviewing the officer who had sketched the accident scene (see paragraph 9 above) in order to determine whether the sketch was accurate and why it had not been signed by the applicant and M.N.;", "\u2212 examining the scene of the accident together with the applicant in order to verify his account of the events leading to the collision;", "\u2212 finding out whether, at the time of the accident, there were any traffic signs on the road indicating the speed limit, or any restrictions on overtaking;", "\u2212 additionally questioning an eyewitness who had claimed that following the collision the applicant\u2019s motorcycle had risen up in the air and landed in the right-hand lane, in order to clarify the details of that testimony; and", "\u2212 questioning another eyewitness identified by the applicant\u2019s mother.", "20. On 26 February 2007 the applicant\u2019s mother, R.K., whom the applicant had authorised to act on his behalf, complained to the district prosecutor that the pre-trial investigation was being carried out slowly and ineffectively. She claimed that the sketch of the accident was inaccurate, as proven by the absence of the drivers\u2019 signatures. She also complained that the investigators had not questioned all the eyewitnesses to the accident and had not eliminated the contradictions between different testimonies. R.K. further complained that the questions of the applicant\u2019s lawyer had not been forwarded to the expert examining the circumstances of the accident (see paragraph 17 above). Lastly, she complained that the prosecutor had sent that expert\u2019s report to the wrong address, so she and the applicant had not received it. R.K. asked the court to change the investigator in charge of the pre-trial investigation and to ensure that essential investigative measures were carried out.", "21. On 16 March 2007 the district prosecutor upheld R.K.\u2019s complaint. The pre-trial investigation was transferred to a different investigator within the Vilnius City Police Department and the investigator was instructed to carry out the investigative measures requested by R.K. As to the forensic expert\u2019s report, the prosecutor informed R.K. that the questions to be submitted to the expert had been approved by a court decision, which the applicant had not challenged.", "22. On 27 March 2007 the district prosecutor notified the Vilnius City Police Department that the newly appointed investigator was conducting the pre-trial investigation \u201cin a sluggish manner\u201d (vangiai), contrary to the requirement to complete it in the shortest possible time.", "23. In March and April 2007 the police investigator carried out the additional investigative measures ordered by the district prosecutor (see paragraph 19 above).", "24. On 18 April 2007, in response to R.K.\u2019s complaint, the district prosecutor informed her that the police officer who had drawn up the sketch of the accident had been questioned and confirmed its accuracy, so there were no grounds to suspect that the sketch had been falsified. The prosecutor also noted that an internal inquiry had been opened concerning the absence of the drivers\u2019 signatures on the sketch of the accident.", "25. Subsequently, in his order to the Vilnius City Police Department the district prosecutor pointed out that the absence of the drivers\u2019 signatures on the sketch had given R.K. legitimate doubts as to its accuracy, and asked the police to look into the officers\u2019 actions when drawing up the sketch. On 29 May 2007 the inquiry found that the police investigator who had carried out the initial investigative measures and who had been responsible for ensuring that the drivers signed the sketch had not performed her duties properly. However, the investigator was not given a disciplinary penalty because more than one year had passed since the breach and she was no longer working in the interior affairs system.", "26. On 21 May 2007 R.K. complained to the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office that the district prosecutor was not properly supervising the pre-trial investigation, which was slow and ineffective. She raised similar complaints to those she had raised before (see paragraph 20 above) and asked for the removal of the prosecutor who had been in charge of supervising the investigation. On 15 June 2007 the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office dismissed R.K.\u2019s complaint, finding no serious breaches in the prosecutor\u2019s actions. The Prosecutor General\u2019s Office also held that although the prosecutor had sent some documents to an incorrect address, those same documents had also been sent to the applicant\u2019s lawyer, so the applicant had in fact received them.", "27. On 10 December 2007 the Vilnius City Second District Court ordered an additional forensic examination of the circumstances of the accident. The examination was carried out by the same expert from the Forensic Science Centre as before (see paragraph 18 above). The expert report, delivered on 16 June 2008 (hereinafter \u201cthe second expert report\u201d), did not make a fresh estimate of the speed of the applicant\u2019s motorcycle but relied on the findings of the first expert report and considered that the applicant had been travelling at a speed of at least 70.3 km/h. It found that the speed limit at the location of the accident had been 60 km/h and not 50 km/h, as assumed in the first expert report, which nonetheless meant that the applicant had exceeded the speed limit. Having examined the sketch of the accident and the damage to both vehicles, the second report confirmed the conclusion of the first report that the collision had occurred in the righthand lane, while the motorcycle was moving into it from the left-hand lane. It found no data indicating that M.N. had been driving at speeds in excess of the speed limit or that he had done anything which might have caused the accident. The report concluded that the accident had been caused by the applicant: the main cause had not been the speed of the motorcycle but the difference between the speed of the two vehicles, and the fact that the applicant had not started to brake in time to avoid the collision.", "28. On 13 August 2008 the district prosecutor discontinued the pre-trial investigation on the grounds that M.N.\u2019s actions had not amounted to a crime as provided for by Article 281 \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code. R.K. appealed against that decision before a senior prosecutor, arguing that the investigation had been biased and incomplete. She stressed in particular that the sketch of the accident had been inaccurate, as proven by the absence of the drivers\u2019 signatures (see paragraph 9 above). She also submitted that the prosecutor had disregarded the testimonies of some eyewitnesses that the collision had occurred in the left-hand lane and that it had caused the applicant\u2019s motorcycle to rise up in the air and land in the other lane (see paragraph 19 above). Her appeal, however, was dismissed. The senior prosecutor pointed out that two expert reports had concluded that the accident had been caused not by M.N. but by the applicant himself, and that the testimonies of several eyewitnesses had confirmed that conclusion.", "29. R.K. appealed before the Vilnius City First District Court. She again argued that the sketch of the accident was inaccurate, as proven by the absence of the drivers\u2019 signatures. She also submitted an opinion by a specialist in the field of road traffic accidents, issued at R.K.\u2019s request on 17 October 2008 (hereinafter \u201cthe specialist\u2019s opinion\u201d), which had concluded that although both the applicant and M.N. had exceeded the speed limit, that fact had not been the cause of the accident. The specialist considered that the accident had occurred in the left-hand lane and that it had been caused by M.N. suddenly entering that lane \u2013 despite the applicant\u2019s attempts to brake and slow down, it had not been objectively possible for him to avoid the collision.", "30. On 20 November 2008 the Vilnius City First District Court upheld R.K.\u2019s appeal and reopened the pre-trial investigation. The court noted the contradictory findings of the expert reports on one hand and the specialist\u2019s opinion on the other hand, and considered that it was necessary to conduct a fresh forensic examination by a different expert in order to eliminate those contradictions.", "31. On 23 February 2009 the police investigator ordered a fresh examination of the circumstances of the accident. The examination was carried out by a different expert from the Forensic Science Centre. In his report, delivered on 15 May 2009 (hereinafter \u201cthe third expert report\u201d), the expert examined the sketch of the accident and photographs of the two vehicles, and estimated that immediately before the collision the applicant had been travelling at a speed of at least 70 km/h, and that it was not possible to determine the speed at which M.N. had been driving. The report also stated that the motorcycle had hit the right side of the car, so even if, as claimed by the applicant, the car had entered the left-hand lane suddenly and unexpectedly, that would not have caused the collision, which had occurred in the right-hand lane. The report concluded that the accident had been caused by the applicant, who had exceeded the speed limit and had not slowed down in time to avoid the collision.", "32. On 3 June 2009 the district prosecutor discontinued the pre-trial investigation on the grounds that M.N.\u2019s actions had not amounted to the crime stipulated in Article 281 \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code. On 7 July 2009 a senior prosecutor upheld that decision, noting that the third expert report had confirmed that the accident had been caused by the actions of the applicant and not of M.N.", "33. R.K. lodged an appeal with the Vilnius City Second District Court, submitting that the third expert report was inaccurate, in particular because it concluded that the collision had occurred in the right-hand lane, which was contrary to the material in the case file. She also submitted that the third expert report had not refuted the conclusions of the specialist\u2019s opinion. R.K. further argued that the testimonies of some eyewitnesses had clearly demonstrated that the accident had been caused by M.N. (see paragraph 28 above), but they had not been properly considered by the prosecutor.", "34. On 5 August 2009 the Vilnius City Second District Court upheld the appeal and reopened the pre-trial investigation. The court held that it was necessary to address the arguments presented in R.K.\u2019s appeal and that the third expert report had to be assessed together with the other available evidence, such as reports concerning the location of the accident and eyewitness testimonies.", "35. On 23 November 2009 the Vilnius City Second District Court ordered a fresh expert examination of the circumstances of the accident. The order was forwarded to the Forensic Science Centre on 4 March 2010, together with the specialist\u2019s opinion. The examination was carried out by a different expert from the Forensic Science Centre. The expert report, delivered on 11 June 2010 (hereinafter \u201cthe fourth expert report\u201d), examined the sketch of the accident and photographs of the two vehicles, and estimated that immediately before the collision the applicant had been travelling at a speed of at least 70.3 km/h. It found that although it was not possible to estimate the speed at which M.N. had been driving, the fact that the motorcycle had hit the back of the car meant that the car had been going slower than the motorcycle. The expert considered that it was not possible to determine the trajectory of the two vehicles before the collision. However, even if the applicant\u2019s version was to be believed and M.N.\u2019s car had suddenly entered the left-hand lane at a distance of fifteen metres from the applicant\u2019s motorcycle (see paragraph 12 above), the applicant could have slowed down and avoided the collision. The fourth expert report concluded that the accident had occurred in the right-hand lane and that it had been caused by the applicant who had exceeded the speed limit and had not slowed down in time to avoid the collision.", "36. In January and February 2010 the police investigator again questioned the applicant, M.N. and some of the eyewitnesses questioned previously.", "37. R.K. was informed about the findings of the fourth expert report on 2 August 2010. She complained to the district prosecutor that she had not been given the opportunity to submit additional questions to the expert, in particular, whether having collided with the car, the motorcycle could have risen up in the air and landed in a different lane, as claimed by some eyewitnesses (see paragraph 28 above). R.K. also complained that the expert had relied on low-quality photographs of the motorcycle but had not examined the motorcycle itself, and that the report\u2019s findings had been incorrect. On 8 September 2010 the district prosecutor upheld R.K.\u2019s complaint and ordered the police investigator to examine the applicant\u2019s motorcycle and to forward R.K.\u2019s questions to the expert who had conducted the fourth examination. On 18 October 2010 the expert responded that the description of the location of the accident showed that during the collision the motorcycle had not risen up into the air.", "38. On 2 November 2010 the district prosecutor again discontinued the pre-trial investigation on the grounds that M.N.\u2019s actions had not amounted to the crime stipulated in Article 281 \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code. On 22 December 2010 a senior prosecutor upheld that decision, considering that the fourth expert report had assessed all the material collected during the pre-trial investigation, including the specialist\u2019s opinion, and that R.K. had been given sufficient opportunity to present her questions to the expert.", "39. On 17 February 2011 the Vilnius City Second District Court dismissed an appeal lodged by R.K. and upheld the prosecutor\u2019s decision. The court considered that expert reports and eyewitness testimonies demonstrated that M.N. had entered the left-hand lane within a safe distance from the applicant\u2019s motorcycle, and thus had not violated road traffic safety regulations. Although there had been contradictory eyewitness testimonies as to the exact distance between M.N.\u2019s car and the applicant\u2019s motorcycle, the court considered that any doubts had to be interpreted in M.N.\u2019s favour. The court also held that the conclusions of the specialist\u2019s opinion that the collision had occurred in the left-hand lane had been contrary to the description of the location of the accident as provided in the sketch (see paragraph 9 above).", "40. On 22 March 2011 the Vilnius Regional Court quashed the lower court\u2019s decision and reopened the pre-trial investigation. It held that the decision to discontinue the investigation had not been based on a comprehensive assessment of all the collected material but had relied exclusively on evidence favourable to M.N., disregarding the applicant\u2019s statements, eyewitness testimonies, and the specialist\u2019s opinion. The court disagreed with the conclusion that M.N. had started overtaking within a safe distance from the applicant\u2019s motorcycle, and noted that M.N. had also had an obligation to make sure that none of the drivers behind him had started overtaking, so it was possible that he had committed the crime stipulated in Article 281 \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code. The court observed that the question of M.N.\u2019s criminal responsibility would be best determined by a court examining the case on the merits.", "41. On 30 May 2011, at R.K.\u2019s request, another expert from the Forensic Science Centre submitted an opinion that, judging from the damage to both vehicles, there were no grounds to believe that the motorcycle had risen up in the air when it had collided with M.N.\u2019s car.", "42. On 31 May 2011 the district prosecutor discontinued the pre-trial investigation as time-barred, while also observing that the investigation had not identified any grounds to believe that a crime may have been committed (the prosecutor did not refer to the Vilnius Regional Court\u2019s decision of 22 March 2011 \u2013 see paragraph 40 above). The prosecutor\u2019s decision does not appear to have been appealed against.", "43. On 18 August 2011 the applicant submitted a civil claim for damages against M.N. He stated that the accident and the resulting injuries and disability had caused him significant distress, inconvenience and emotional trauma. The applicant claimed 600,000 Lithuanian litai (LTL \u2212 approximately 173,772 euros (EUR)) in non-pecuniary damages and LTL 76,739.37 (EUR 22,225) in pecuniary damages for medical expenses and rehabilitation.", "44. On 26 September 2012 the Vilnius Regional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim. It relied on the expert reports delivered during the pretrial investigation and noted that all of them had established that the accident had been caused not by M.N. but by the applicant himself. Although the specialist\u2019s opinion, delivered at the request of the applicant\u2019s mother, had reached a different conclusion, the court considered that the fourth expert report had taken its findings into consideration, and that it was thus unnecessary for the court to discuss the specialist\u2019s findings separately. It also observed that the judgment of the Vilnius Regional Court of 22 March 2011 (see paragraph 39 above) could not be interpreted as affirming M.N.\u2019s responsibility for the accident. As a result, the court concluded that it had not been established that M.N. had breached any legal requirements, which was a pre-condition for his civil liability to arise. The court also noted that the applicant had bought the motorcycle only two days before the accident, that he had not had any prior experience in driving that kind of vehicle, and that the motorcycle had not undergone a technical examination before the accident. Accordingly, the court found that the applicant himself may have breached road traffic safety regulations. The civil claim was dismissed and the applicant was ordered to pay LTL 1,521 (EUR 440.5) in legal expenses to M.N. and the State.", "45. On 2 December 2013 the Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the lower court in its entirety."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
