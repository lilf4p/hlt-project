On 1 November 2007 the applicant was convicted by the Arad County Court on two counts of robbery and theft and was sentenced to seven years\u2019 imprisonment. The court also ordered the applicant\u2019s committal to the psychiatric section of the Bucharest Jilava Prison Hospital until his recovery.", "8. In his application forms and letters sent to the Court since 2009, the applicant complained of the severe overcrowding he had had to endure in Gala\u0163i Prison, where thirteen to fifteen detainees were held in a cell of between 20 and 24 sq. m, as well as in Rahova and Jilava Prisons.", "9. The applicant also alleged that the quality of food and drinking water had been very poor in these prisons, that he had not always been served a diet in accordance with his Muslim religious beliefs and that most of the time he had been starving as the portions had not been sufficient.", "10. In all three prisons hot water had only been provided for short periods of time in which there had not been enough time to brush his teeth. Furthermore, in Jilava Prison there had not been enough cold water provided.", "11.

Throughout his detention in Gala\u0163i Prison the applicant received no visits and was considered unfit for work. He did not have any income.", "17.

On 30 September 2009, the Bucharest District Court rejected with final effect the applicant\u2019s complaint concerning the lack of adequate provision of drinking water in Jilava Prison, reasoning that this situation was a result of budgetary constraints.

On several occasions the applicant complained to the post-sentencing judge that the food served in prison was of very poor quality and the portions were not adequate.

On 7 March 2013 while he was held in Rahova Prison the applicant requested one pair of shoes, two pairs of socks and one tracksuit.

In November 2011 the applicant, who was in a nervous state, refused to be seen by the prison dentist. On 3 February 2014 the applicant refused to have a tooth extracted.", "45. On 15 October 2009 the applicant complained before the prison authorities and the post-sentencing judge that he was not receiving the liquid and semi-liquid diet prescribed by the doctor. On 3 November 2009 the post-sentencing judge in Rahova Prison rejected the complaint, agreeing with the prison authorities that there was no prescription from a doctor for such a diet in the applicant\u2019s medical file. Another similar complaint lodged by the applicant in January 2013 had been rejected by the post-sentencing judge for the same reason.", "46. On 21 May 2012, in August 2012 and on 10 September 2012 the applicant complained to the prison administration that he had toothache and that he could not eat as he had not been given a liquid diet, as requested. No replies to these complaints could be found in the applicant\u2019s prison file submitted by the Government.", "47. In January 2013 the applicant complained before the post-sentencing judge of the poor quality of the food served in prison; the vegetables were undercooked; he received bones without meat. He further complained that he had not been given the liquid diet prescribed by the doctors and that he had thus constantly received food that he could not chew and eat. The prison administration averred before the judge that no special diet had been prescribed to the applicant by a doctor and that the food served in prison was in accordance with the regulations and within the limits of the budget of 4.06 Romanian lei per prisoner per day (approximately 1 euro). On 8 January 2013 the post-sentencing judge rejected the applicant\u2019s complaint as ill-founded, considering that the food received by the applicant had been in accordance with the regulations and the budget.", "48. In March 2013 the applicant complained again before the post-sentencing judge. He alleged that, due to his dental problems, he could not eat the food served in prison. He mentioned that the meat was not cooked through and very often during transport he had received raw, unsliced bacon and biscuits that he could not eat. On 21 March 2013 the post-sentencing judge rejected the applicant\u2019s complaint because the facts described by him had been refuted by the prison authorities. At that time, no doctor had prescribed that the applicant be given a liquid or semi-liquid diet. On 14 May 2013 the Bucharest District Court rejected this complaint with final effect holding that the prison menus were prepared and administered in accordance with the internal regulations and within the limits of the budget.", "49. On 16 and 25 June, 23 December 2013 and 12 and 24 March 2014 the applicant complained to the prison administration of toothache and requested treatment for his periodontitis. The authorities replied to these complaints that the doctor was on holiday and that an appointment would be scheduled in the future.", "50. According to the applicant, on 14 February 2013 when he was being transported to an infirmary outside the prison, he was ill-treated by a prison guard escorting him.", "51.
