The applicant, Ms Lumini\u0163a Chiriac, is a Romanian national, who was born in 1969 and lives in Ia\u015fi. The applicant was allowed to represent herself in the proceedings before the Court.", "2. The Romanian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mrs C. Brumar, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.", "3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "4. On 12 April 2004, two individuals, one of whom was the applicant\u2019s brother, were taken to an Ia\u015fi Police station charged with disturbance of public order due to drunken behaviour. Following a call from her brother, the applicant went to the same police station in her capacity as a lawyer in order to represent the two aforementioned individuals.", "5. On 23 April 2003 a local newspaper published an article entitled \u201cBig row in the middle of the night between a lawyer and police officers from Station II\u201d (Mare t\u0103r\u0103boi \u00een miez de noapte \u00eentre un avocat \u015fi poli\u0163i\u015ftii de la Sec\u0163ia II). The article related the events of 12 April 2004. It included the following quote from the deputy to the head of the police station: \u201c... both the lawyer and her client were under the influence of alcohol and caused a furore in the police station\u201d.", "6. On 16 May 2003 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint of defamation against the journalist who had written the article and the police officer who had been quoted in it. She argued that as a result of the publication of the article, including the allegation that she had been under the influence of alcohol, her reputation had been damaged. Several clients had rescinded their representation agreements with her and her family had been negatively affected subsequent to the publication of the article. On 2 December 2003 the applicant joined the proceedings as a civil party claiming 25,000 euros in compensation.", "7. On 20 April 2004 the Ia\u015fi Court of Appeal sent the file to the prosecutor\u2019s office attached to it, instructing the prosecuting authorities to examine the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 37 \u00a7 2 of the Legal Profession Act (Law No. 51/1995).", "8. On 29 November 2004 the prosecutor attached to the Ia\u015fi Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint in respect of the police officer for lack of sufficient evidence that he had made defamatory statements and in respect of the journalist on the grounds that he had not acted with the intention to defame. The prosecutor based his decision on Article 10 (a) of the Criminal Code.", "The prosecutor noted that on the evening of 22 April 2004 the journalist had had a private conversation with police officer B.P. but that, according to a few witnesses who had been present, B.P. had refused to give any details about the incident of 12 April 2004 and had invited the journalist to seek the information from the officer tasked with providing information to the press. The prosecutor noted that the versions of the two defendants concerning the journalist\u2019s source for his article of 23 April 2004 differed. While the journalist contended that police officer B.P. had given him information concerning the applicant\u2019s alcoholic intoxication on the evening of 12 April 2004, officer B.P. denied it.", "9. On 26 January 2005 the chief prosecutor upheld his decision.", "10. The applicant lodged a complaint with the Ia\u015fi Court of Appeal against the prosecutor\u2019s decision not to open a criminal investigation. She contended that the circumstances of the incident of 12 April 2003 had not been accurately reflected by the prosecutor in his decision. She maintained that on the evening of the incident she had complained to the prosecutor in charge about the abusive behaviour of the police officers towards her and the two individuals who had been handcuffed and taken to the police station (one of whom was her brother) and that a criminal investigation had been opened in this connection.", "11. On 12 May 2005 the Ia\u015fi Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law.", "12. By a judgment of 12 January 2006 the High Court of Cassation and Justice allowed the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law and remitted the case for further investigation to the prosecutor\u2019s office attached to the Court of Appeal. The court reasoned that the applicant\u2019s complaint had been dealt with superficially and that the investigation should have addressed the crime of defamation of a lawyer, as provided for under Article 37 \u00a7 2 of the Legal Profession Act.", "13. On 4 May 2006 the prosecutor\u2019s office attached to the Ia\u015fi Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s criminal complaint, basing its decision on Article 10 (a) of the Criminal Code. It concluded that police officer B.P. had not made any defamatory statements about the applicant and that the journalist had written the article on the basis of a report drawn up by the police on the evening of 12 April 2003 without the intent to defame the applicant.", "14. On 5 June 2006 the chief prosecutor upheld that decision.", "15. On 10 October 2006 the Ia\u015fi Court of Appeal allowed an appeal lodged by the applicant against the prosecutor\u2019s decisions. It quashed the prosecutor\u2019s decision on the grounds that the applicant\u2019s complaint should have been examined in the light of Article 37 \u00a7 2 of the Legal Profession Act and sent the case-file back to the prosecutor\u2019s office for a fresh examination.", "16. By a decision of 27 September 2007 the prosecutor\u2019s office attached to the Ia\u015fi Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s criminal complaint.", "17. The applicant challenged the prosecutor\u2019s decision before the courts.", "18. An appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant was finally dismissed by the High Court of Cassation and Justice on 6 March 2008. The court upheld the reasoning of the lower courts that the offence did not fall under the provisions of the Legal Profession Act, as the acts complained of had not occurred during the exercise of the applicant\u2019s duties. Furthermore, the High Court of Cassation and Justice held that although the acts complained of may have fallen under the provisions of the Criminal Code regarding defamation, those charged with such acts could no longer be prosecuted because from 2006 to 2007 defamation had been decriminalised. The defendants were therefore able to benefit from the application of the more favourable law. No reference was made to the civil action lodged by the applicant.", "19. Article 206 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP), as in force at the time of the events, read as follows:", "\u201cAnyone who makes a statement or allegation in public concerning a particular person which, if true, would render that person liable to a criminal, administrative or disciplinary penalty or expose them to public opprobrium shall be liable to a fine ....\u201d", "20.
