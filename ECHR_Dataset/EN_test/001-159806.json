THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Expulsion) (Conditional) (Afghanistan)", "JUDGES": "Branko Lubarda;George Nicolaou;Helen Keller;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Johannes Silvis;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra;Pere Pastor Vilanova", "TEXT": ["6. The applicant is of Pashtun origin, was born in 1964 and has been in the Netherlands since 1998.", "7. The applicant entered the Netherlands on 3 August 1998 and on 4 August 1998 applied for asylum, submitting the following account in his interviews with immigration officials held on 4 August 1998, 26 August 1998 and 21 March 2000.", "8. After completing his elementary education in 1976, the applicant had attended the military academy in Kabul. He had graduated in 1982 and had started working in 1982 with the rank of second lieutenant at an administrative department of one of the directorates of the Afghan security service KhAD/WAD (\u201cKhadimat-e Atal\u2019at-e Dowlati / Wezarat-e Amniyat-e Dowlati\u201d) during the former communist regime in Afghanistan. He had become head of this department \u2013 which was responsible for handling confidential documents \u2013 in 1988, which function he had continued to hold until the fall of the ruling communist People\u2019s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (\u201cPDPA\u201d) in 1992. In 1990 he had been promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel.", "9. The applicant\u2019s directorate had been assigned the task of negotiating and concluding agreements with groups that opposed and fought the communist Government, namely the mujahideen. These agreements entailed remunerated cooperation with the ruling PDPA. The applicant had attended meetings between thus \u201cemployed\u201d mujahideen commanders and executives of the directorate. During these meetings the performance of such commanders was assessed and decisions were taken on whether or not they should continue to be paid. The applicant had taken minutes at those meetings. He believed that the mujahideen were holding him personally responsible for the discontinuation of their pay where decisions to that effect had been taken. In addition, these mujahideen commanders had never admitted to cooperating with the KhAD and were very keen on keeping this a secret, for which reason they were interested in eliminating the applicant.", "10. In 1992, after the fall of Kabul, these mujahideen commanders had come looking for the applicant. They were said to have come to his office and asked for him. The applicant had been informed of this by the president of the directorate he had worked for, who had maintained good relations with the mujahideen and hence had remained in post there.", "11. The applicant and his family had fled to Mazar-e-Sharif, where they had led a quiet life until 1997, when various mujahideen groups had come to the city, including those mujahideen feared by the applicant. He had gone into hiding, during which period his house had been searched by the mujahideen. The applicant and his family had then fled to Pakistan.", "12. On 15 September 1999, a person-specific official report (individueel ambtsbericht) not concerning the applicant was drawn up by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken). According to this report, torture was systemic in WAD interrogation centres and within the KhAD the loyalty of its staff was carefully controlled. It was considered impossible that persons belonging to the higher management of the KhAD/WAD had not been involved in the implementation of the above methods. This report was taken into account in the applicant\u2019s asylum procedure.", "13. The applicant\u2019s asylum claim was also examined in the light of an official report, drawn up on 29 February 2000 by the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on \u201cSecurity Services in Communist Afghanistan (1978-92), AGSA, KAM, KhAD and WAD\u201d (\u201cVeiligheidsdiensten in communistisch Afghanistan (1978-1992), AGSA, KAM, KhAD en WAD\u201d) and concerning in particular the question whether and, if so, which former employees of those services should be regarded as implicated in human rights violations (see A.A.Q. v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 42331/05, \u00a7\u00a7 50-52, 30 June 2015).", "14. By a decision of 18 July 2000 the Deputy Minister of Justice (Staatssecretaris van Justitie) rejected the applicant\u2019s asylum claim. The Deputy Minister held, inter alia, that serious reasons had been found for believing that the applicant had committed acts referred to in Article 1F of the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (\u201cthe 1951 Refugee Convention\u201d).", "15. Referring to the official report of 29 February 2000 (see paragraph 13 above), the Deputy Minister emphasised the widely known cruel character of the KhAD, its lawless methods, the grave crimes it had committed such as torture and other human rights violations and the \u201cclimate of terror\u201d which it had spread throughout the whole of Afghan society, including the army. The Deputy Minister underlined the vague definition of \u201cenemy of the communist regime\u201d used by the KhAD, how it found those enemies through an extensive network of spies, and how all of this led to widespread and often random arrests of suspects. It was also noted that the KhAD was considered to be an elite unit of the communist regime, and that only those whose loyalty was beyond doubt were eligible for recruitment to the service. Furthermore, new recruits were initially assigned to KhAD/WAD sections actively engaged in tracking down \u201celements that posed a threat to the State\u201d, where \u2013 in order to prove their loyalty unequivocally \u2013 they were directly involved in the human rights violations the KhAD was associated with. In this regard the Deputy Minister emphasised that every promoted officer had been involved in arrests, interrogations, torture and even executions.", "16. Having established, on the basis of elaborate argumentation based on various international documents, that those involved in the KhAD were likely to fall within the scope of Article 1F of the 1951 Refugee Convention, the Deputy Minister proceeded to an analysis of the applicant\u2019s individual responsibility under that Convention. In the light of the above, the applicant\u2019s plea that he had never been involved in any human rights violations and had worked his whole career for one department only was dismissed. In view of the applicant\u2019s career and several promotions, the Deputy Minister excluded the possibility of the applicant not having been involved in human rights violations committed by the KhAD.", "17. The Deputy Minister underlined that the application of Article 1F of the 1951 Refugee Convention did not require proof that the applicant had personally committed the alleged crimes; it sufficed that serious reasons existed to consider that the applicant had, or should have had, knowledge of those crimes and that he bore responsibility for them, which responsibility he had voluntarily assumed. In this context the Deputy Minister referred, inter alia, to paragraphs 42 and 43 of \u201cThe Exclusion Clauses: Guidelines on their Application\u201d (UNHCR, 1 December 1996), stating:", "\u201cpersons who are found to have performed, engaged in, participated in orchestrating, planning and/or implementing, or condoned or acquiesced in the carrying out of any specified criminal acts by subordinates, should rightly be excluded. ... voluntary continued membership of a part of a government engaged in criminal activities may constitute grounds for exclusion where the member cannot rebut the presumptions of knowledge and personal implication.\u201d", "18. The Deputy Minister further referred to a letter of 28 November 1997 sent by the Deputy Minister of Justice to the President of the Lower House of Parliament (Tweede Kamer) stating that Article 1F was also applicable when the person concerned had not himself committed any acts referred to in this provision but had been an active and conscious member of an organisation known for committing war crimes and crimes against humanity. As the applicant had not in any way distanced himself from or resisted the crimes committed by the KhAD, the Deputy Minister concluded that Article 1F was applicable to the applicant\u2019s case. Consequently, the applicant\u2019s asylum request was rejected and Article 1F held against him.", "19. The Deputy Minister further found no grounds on the basis of which the applicant would be eligible for a residence permit on compelling humanitarian grounds (klemmende redenen van humanitaire aard). As regards the applicant\u2019s plea under Article 3 of the Convention the Deputy Minister held that, even assuming that a real risk existed of the applicant being subjected to treatment contrary to that provision in Afghanistan, Article 3 did not guarantee a right to residence. The Deputy Minister considered in this context that granting residence to the applicant would conflict with the State\u2019s interest in terms of its credibility on the international stage, particularly regarding its responsibility towards other States. In the Deputy Minister\u2019s view, a situation in which the Netherlands was forced to become a host State for individuals who had elsewhere shocked public and international legal order with acts considered to constitute grave crimes under both Dutch and international law was to be avoided.", "20. The applicant\u2019s objection (bezwaar) to this decision was rejected, after he had been heard on it on 16 May 2003 before an official board of enquiry (ambtelijke commissie), on 11 August 2003 by the Minister of Immigration and Integration (Minister van Vreemdelingenzaken en Integratie), the successor to the Deputy Minister of Justice. The Minister endorsed the Deputy Minister\u2019s impugned decision and proceeded, in addition thereto, to an analysis of the applicant\u2019s individual responsibility under the 1951 Refugee Convention on the basis of the prescribed and so-called \u201cpersonal and knowing participation test\u201d and held Article 1F against him.", "21. As regards the \u201cknowing\u201d element, the Minister \u2013 having regard to the official report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 29 February 2000 (see paragraph 13 above) \u2013 found that the applicant had known or should have known about the criminal character of the KhAD. The Minister did not attach any credence to the applicant\u2019s submissions that he had not known about the human rights violations committed by the KhAD. Basing herself on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs official report of 29 February 2000, the Minister held that the commission of human rights violations by the KhAD under the PDPA rule was a fact of common knowledge and that, therefore, it was unthinkable that the applicant would have been ignorant of those acts. The Minister emphasised in this regard the high rank the applicant had held, the long period he had worked for the KhAD and the fact that he had attended meetings with the executives of the Directorate in which he had been employed. The Minister concluded that the applicant had knowingly participated in torture and executions.", "22. As regards the applicant\u2019s personal participation in human rights violations attributed to the KhAD, the Minister found, basing herself to a large extent on the same factual information as the Deputy Minister had done in his previous decision, that the applicant had failed to demonstrate that he had not committed such violations himself or that his conduct, or lack thereof, had prevented these violations from being committed. The Minister held, therefore, that the applicant had personally participated in the commission of acts referred to Article 1F of the 1951 Refugee Convention.", "23. The Minister did not attach credence to the applicant\u2019s rebuttal, which amounted to his case having to be distinguished from the general situation with regard to the KhAD and its officers as described in the official report of 29 February 2000. The applicant had claimed that he had obtained a desk job not by proving his loyalty to the KhAD in sinister ways \u2013 as the official report stated \u2013 but rather through bribes. The Minister held that, based on the applicant\u2019s position and description of his tasks (including the processing of high-level classified information), he had attempted to trivialise his activities and had greatly impaired his credibility in consequence. On this point, the Minister relied, inter alia, on Amnesty International\u2019s \u201cReports of torture and long-term detention without trial\u201d of March 1991, according to which the Directorate in which the applicant had been employed was engaged in systematic torture.", "24. The Minister further identified several inconsistencies in the applicant\u2019s declarations and rebuttals, from which it was concluded that his declarations concerning certain of the tasks he stated he had performed were highly implausible. As regards the applicant\u2019s various rebuttals, it was found, in the relevant part, that the burden of proof in terms of Article 1F of the 1951 Refugee Convention was less stringent than in a criminal prosecution (\u201cserious reasons for considering\u201d that the applicant might have been guilty of human rights violations sufficed to render this provision applicable). Taking into account that the applicant had never sought to leave the KhAD or the WAD, for which he had worked for about ten years, in which his last held rank was that of lieutenant-colonel, and in which he had been promoted to head of his department, the Minister concluded that there were no indications that the applicant had been forced or had involuntarily worked for the KhAD/WAD.", "25. As regards the applicant\u2019s claim that the official report of 29 February 2000 of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was not accurate and was based on unreliable sources and that, therefore, it was too general in scope and could not be applied to his case, the Minister held that this report was founded on several acclaimed sources, such as the United Nations Special Rapporteur, Human Rights Watch, numerous Amnesty International reports, and a variety of United Nations publications.", "26. The Minister went on to analyse, of her own motion, the applicant\u2019s eligibility for a residence permit for reasons not related to asylum. It was held that no such permit could be issued, since the application of Article 1F of the 1951 Refugee Convention gave rise to \u201ccontraindications\u201d against the applicant in terms of his eligibility for other types of residence permit. However, while reiterating that Article 3 of the Convention did not guarantee a right to residence, the Minister considered that it could not be ruled out that the applicant, in the present circumstances, would run a real risk of treatment contrary to that provision if expelled to Afghanistan, for which reason the applicant was not to be expelled.", "27. The applicant lodged an objection against the refusal by the Minister to grant him a residence permit for reasons not related to asylum. This objection was rejected by the Minister on 16 January 2004, confirming her impugned refusal.", "28. The applicant appealed against the Minister\u2019s decisions of 11 August 2003 and 16 January 2004 before the Regional Court (rechtbank) of The Hague, arguing, inter alia, that the factual underpinning of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs official report of 29 February 2000 contained errors, which had led the Minister to draw incorrect conclusions as to the applicant\u2019s personal and knowing participation in the crimes referred to in Article 1F of the 1951 Refugee Convention.", "29. In its judgment of 10 February 2005, the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Utrecht held that the official reports issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which lay to a great extent at the basis of the Minister\u2019s decisions, had been drafted in an unbiased manner, were accurate and objective, and provided the required insight in the relevant information, and that therefore, the Minister had been entitled to rely on them. In addition, the Regional Court noted that the evaluation of the credibility of facts adduced by asylum seekers fell to a large extent within the Minister\u2019s discretion and could, therefore, only be evaluated marginally by the court. The Regional Court agreed with the Minister on all points as to the latter\u2019s decision to hold Article 1F of the 1951 Refugee Convention against the applicant and, consequently, to refuse him an asylum-based residence permit. As regards the Minister\u2019s separate decision of 16 January, refusing the applicant a residence permit for reasons not related to asylum, the Regional Court adopted a different reasoning, but reached the same conclusion.", "30. In respect of Article 3 of the Convention, the Regional Court held, with reference to case-law of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division (Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak) of the Council of State (Raad van State), that the Minister should, wherever possible, avoid creating a situation in which an asylum seeker is refused a residence permit but cannot be expelled to his/her country of origin for reasons based on Article 3 of the Convention. For that reason, the decision should demonstrate that the Minister had examined whether Article 3 of the Convention would lastingly (duurzaam) stand in the way of expulsion to the country of origin and of the possible consequences for the residence situation of the person concerned. This, the Regional Court found, the Minister had failed to do in the present case, for which reason it quashed the Minister\u2019s decision of 11 August 2003 and remitted the case back to the Minister for a fresh decision.", "31. After the applicant had once more been heard on 20 May 2005 before an official board of enquiry, the Minister rejected the asylum request anew in a fresh decision of 2 August 2005. In this fresh decision, the Minister limited herself to Article 3 of the Convention. She dismissed the applicant\u2019s fear of returning to Afghanistan as a (former) member of the PDPA and former officer of KhAD, referring to an official report issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in January 2005 and holding that the sole fact that an asylum seeker had been a PDPA member was not enough in itself to render Article 3 applicable in the eventuality of expulsion. The Minister further noted that the mere fact that the applicant had a different political conviction from those currently in power in Afghanistan similarly did not suffice to render Article 3 applicable. The Minister further took into account that the applicant had stated that he was not a known person in Afghanistan. The applicant had no concrete indication that he would be searched for by any group or person. In addition, relatives of the applicant \u2013 including his father and brother \u2013 were still living in Afghanistan without ever having encountered any problem.", "32. The Minister further addressed the applicant\u2019s claim that he had reason to fear certain named mujahideen commanders, who would identify him as the KhAD officer who had not paid them, or paid them less than agreed upon. The applicant had submitted that he had attended meetings \u2013 where he had only taken minutes \u2013 in the course of which cooperation agreements had been reached between the KhAD and a mujahideen commander. In addition, the applicant had alleged that these mujahideen commanders were keen on ensuring that nobody in present-day Afghanistan would find out that they had cooperated with KhAD in the past, for which reason they were interested in eliminating the applicant. On this point, the Minister held that the applicant had failed to establish these commanders\u2019 whereabouts and current influence in Afghan society. The Minister noted that according to the applicant\u2019s own statements, he did not believe that these individuals occupied high positions in today\u2019s Afghanistan. Furthermore, the Minister considered that the mujahideen commanders were aware of the applicant\u2019s role in those meetings as well as of the identity of the person taking the decisions as regards financial support of the mujahideen, and that it was therefore implausible that they would be after the applicant. Finally, it was underlined that the applicant had been able to stay in Afghanistan until 1997 without any problems. For these reasons, the applicant\u2019s claim that he was being sought by the mujahideen was dismissed as founded on nothing but suspicion and speculation. The claim based on Article 3 was consequently rejected.", "33. The applicant appealed anew to the Regional Court of The Hague, arguing, inter alia, that the Minister had erred in finding him guilty of participation in torture under the auspices of the KhAD. In his view, the Minister had disregarded the fact that the applicant had held an administrative position in KhAD which was only concerned with maintaining contacts with the mujahideen and reaching agreements with them. Furthermore, the Minister had been inconsistent in finding, on the one hand, that the applicant had participated in human rights violations, but, on the other hand, that the applicant had not held an important position within the PDPA party. The applicant submitted that it was likely that he was well known enough for his former adversaries, who were now those in power in Afghanistan, to find him and subject him to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention.", "34. The Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Amsterdam rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal on 12 April 2006. It noted that, according to a general official report on Afghanistan of July 2005 by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that some former military officials, members of the police and the KhAD/WAD security services possibly risk falling victim to human rights violations \u2013 not only by the authorities but also by the population (victims\u2019 relatives), unless they maintained relations with influential Islamic and political parties or tribes. According to the court, this did not mean that every former KhAD officer ran a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3, and the applicant was thus required to establish the existence of such a risk in the particular circumstances of his case. The Regional Court agreed with the Minister that the applicant had failed to do so, as his claims were found to be merely based on unsubstantiated expectations, including his claimed fear of persecution by the mujahideen commanders who had been paid by the KhAD/WAD. No further appeal lay against this ruling."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
