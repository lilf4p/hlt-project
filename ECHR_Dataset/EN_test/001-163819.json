Eight masked men in black uniforms and armed with pistols and machine guns got out of the Priora cars, knocked Mr Kamil Mutayev off his feet and forced him into one of their vehicles. They threatened his son with firearms and ordered him to stay in the car. The abduction took place approximately two hundred metres from the district police station (the department of the interior) and the public prosecutor\u2019s office. After the abduction the perpetrators drove away through the local traffic police checkpoint.", "8.

In addition, the witness stated that the abductors had scared him by threatening to shoot him if he disobeyed their orders not to move.", "16.

At the same time she stated that on several occasions he had received threats from unidentified persons on account of his religious beliefs. Those persons had visited their house and had thrown hand-written threats inside. The applicant did not specify whether she had had any suspisions or theories concerning the identities of those persons.", "26. On 15 June 2012 the local police informed the investigators that Mr Kamil Mutayev was a member of an illegal armed group, belonged to an extremist religious movement and had, therefore, most probably, staged his own abduction.", "27. On 29 June 2012 the investigators questioned five local residents, all of whom stated that they had not witnessed the abduction and found out about it from others.", "28. On 6 August 2012 the investigators examined the registration log of detainees of the OVD. No records concerning Mr Kamil Mutayev were found therein.", "29.

They also questioned again his son Muradis and the first applicant who reiterated their earlier statements.", "36. From the documents submitted it follows that between November 2012 and August 2015 the investigation was suspended and resumed on several occasions. The last resumption of the investigation took place on 10 September 2015. The proceedings are still pending.", "46. The applicants alleged that State agents were responsible for Mr Kamil Mutayev\u2019s disappearance. They stressed that the authorities had suspected him of membership of illegal armed groups and, therefore, had motives for his abduction. The abductors had used Priora cars with heavily tinted windows; only law-enforcement agencies could use such vehicles. Moreover, after the abduction the perperators had passed through a permanent road traffic police checkpoint. The applicants referred to statements of local residents who had not witnessed the abduction but had seen vehicles similar to those of the abductors driving to that police station. Lastly, the applicants referred to a number of cases of abduction perpetrated in Dagestan in which some of the abducted persons had been later found in State custody.", "47. The Government submitted that the applicants\u2019 relative Mr Kamil Mutayev had been abducted by unidentified men or could have staged his own abduction. The only witness to the events was Mr Kamil Mutayev\u2019s son Muradis, who was a minor, and the other persons, including the applicants, learnt of the events from him. In such circumstances the applicants\u2019 allegations concerning involvement of State agents in the incident were groundless.", "48. A summary of the principles concerning the assessment of evidence and establishment of facts in disappearance cases and the life-threatening nature of such incidents may be found in Sultygov and Others v. Russia, nos. 42575/07, 53679/07, 311/08, 424/08, 3375/08, 4560/08, 35569/08, 62220/10, 3222/11, 22257/11, 24744/11 and 36897/11, \u00a7\u00a7 393-96, 9 October 2014).", "49. The Court notes that in reply to its request for a copy of the investigation file into the abduction the Government produced the relevant documents from the file (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above).", "50. The Court has already found the Russian authorities responsible for disappearances of civilians perpetrated in Dagestan (see, for example, Umarovy v. Russia, no. 2546/08, 12 June 2012, and Alpatu Israilova v. Russia, no. 15438/05, 14 March 2013). In doing so, it has taken into account the length of time during which the applicants had not had any news of their missing relatives and witness statements and other documents attesting to the presence of security or law-enforcement personnel in the area concerned at the relevant time. It has relied on witness accounts and other information on security operations.", "51. However, in the present case the circumstances in which the events occurred cannot warrant an unequivocal conclusion that State agents were responsible for the abduction of the applicants\u2019 relative for the following reasons. As regards the general background, the events complained of took place in May 2012 and there was neither a curfew in place nor any restrictions on driving in civilian vehicles. Furthermore, from the documents submitted it appears that the applicants\u2019 version of the events was based on the statements of the only witness, Mr Kamil Mutayev\u2019s son, who according to his own statement had been scared during the incident (see paragraph 19 above), and of persons who had not witnessed the actual abduction and whose statements were not included in the investigation file (see paragraph 8 above). In addition, the Court notes that the first applicant stated to the investigation that Mr Kamil Mutayev had received threats but did not specify whom she had suspected or the nature of the threats received (see paragraph 25 above). In such a situation the Court has little evidence on which to draw such conclusions as the factual circumstances of the incident as presented by the applicants do not include any evidence corroborating their account to a decisive extent.", "52. Accordingly, the information in the Court\u2019s possession does not suffice to establish that the perpetrators belonged to the security forces or that a security operation was carried out in respect of Mr Kamil Mutayev.", "53. To sum up, it has not been established to the required standard of proof that State agents were implicated in the disappearance of Mr Kamil Mutayev; nor does the Court consider that the burden of proof can be entirely shifted to the Government, having regard, in particular, to the fact that they submitted a copy of the relevant documents from the investigation file as requested by the Court."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
