BULGARIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "George Nicolaou;Ineta Ziemele;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Ledi Bianku;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Vincent A. De Gaetano;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["1. The applicant, Mr Samuil Robertov Hadzholov, is a Bulgarian national, who was born in 1954 and lives in Zlatograd. He was represented before the Court by Mr M. Ekimdzhiev and Ms K. Boncheva, lawyers practising in Plovdiv.", "3. Until 1987 the applicant worked as a coal miner for Gorubso \u2013 Second Mining Department Zlatograd (a State enterprise, transformed into a State-owned company in the early 1990s and later, apparently in 2002, privatised following the opening of winding-up proceedings; currently a joint-stock company Gorubso Zlatograd AD). In 1988 the applicant brought proceedings against the mining company seeking payment of compensation for the occupational disease he had developed as a result of exposure to hazardous conditions in the mine. On 26 November 1988 the Regional Court granted the claim. The company was ordered to pay a sum of 3,566 old Bulgarian levs (BGL) (the equivalent of around USD 1,800) as compensation, as well as monthly payments for a period of 26 years, from October 1988 to March 2014, the amounts varying between BGL 197 and BGL 80, depending on the period.", "4. In 1989 the applicant requested that the enforcement judge institute enforcement proceedings against the debtor. It appears that in May 1989 the enforcement judge attached the company\u2019s bank accounts. There is no information in the case file about the development of the enforcement proceedings between May 1989 and February 2003. In particular, there is no evidence about requests made by the applicant for enforcement measures, claims lodged in the winding-up proceedings relating to the mining company\u2019s assets, or information sought by the applicant on the payment of the debt.", "5. On 17 February 2003 the enforcement judge discontinued the enforcement proceedings on the basis of Article 330 \u00a7 1 (\u0434) of the Code of Civil Procedure 1952, as the applicant had not requested enforcement actions for more than two years.", "6. On 19 October 2005 the applicant and his lawyer consulted the file of the enforcement proceedings. The applicant submits that only then did he find out that the proceedings had been discontinued in 2003, and that he was shown a document \u2013 the enforcement judge\u2019s register of 1989 for the incoming and outgoing amounts \u2013 which indicated that in 1989 the mining company had paid the applicant an amount of BGL 5,234 by means of bank transfer. The applicant sent a letter of 21 October 2005 to the enforcement judge, in which he maintained that he had never received the aforementioned amount and that he was unable to obtain a copy of the payment order as the case file had been destroyed.", "7. By a letter of 27 October 2005, the enforcement judge informed the applicant that, as was clear from the information in the file, on 13 April 1989 the applicant had received payment from the mining company in the amount of BGL 5,234 (representing the initial compensation of BGL 3,566 plus several monthly payments). In a letter of 3 November 2005, the bank which had effected the payment on 13 April 1989 informed the applicant that the documents concerning the money transfer had already been destroyed as the ten-year time-limit for keeping them had expired.", "8. In November 2005 the applicant submitted a complaint to the prosecution authorities requesting an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the payment of 13 April 1989. In a letter of 11 November 2005, the enforcement judge informed the investigation authorities that, as could be seen from the enforcement judge\u2019s register of 1989, on 13 April 1989 the applicant had received payment from the mining company in the amount of BGL 5,234. As to the payment orders of that date, the enforcement judge noted that they had been destroyed as the ten-year time-limit for keeping payment documents under the Accounting Act had expired.", "9. On 24 November 2005 the public prosecutor refused to open criminal proceedings, noting that a long period of time had elapsed since the alleged offence had been committed, and that the time-limits for keeping the relevant documents at the respective institutions had already expired. The applicant appealed against that decision on 2 December 2005. On 7 December 2005 the hierarchically superior prosecutor upheld those conclusions.", "10. In December 2006 the applicant requested that the Zlatograd District Court issue a document certifying that the case file of the enforcement proceedings had been destroyed. In a letter of 13 December 2006 the President of the District Court informed him that the file had not been destroyed and that he and his lawyer had consulted it.", "11. In the period between 1990 and 1999 inflation in Bulgaria was running high and the national currency was depreciating. As of the entry into force of a law on 5 July 1999, BGL 1,000 became 1 new Bulgarian lev (BGN). The applicant submitted that due to the enforcement judge\u2019s inactivity over the years and the inflation and the devaluation of the national currency, the total amount of monthly payments he was entitled to receive for the period from May 1989 to 5 July 1999 had devalued to BGN 21.71 (approximately 11 euros (EUR)). He claimed that the amount he was entitled to receive from 5 July 1999 to March 2014 had devalued to BGN 18.17 (approximately EUR 9).", "12. In accordance with Article 400 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure 1952 (\u201cthe 1952 Code\u201d), in force at the material time, enforcement proceedings against State enterprises were to be directed firstly towards their bank accounts in State banks. When payment upon a writ of execution against the State enterprise could not be received because of lack of such bank accounts or of available funds in them, enforcement was to be carried out by an enforcement judge. Certain articles of property belonging to the State enterprises could not be subject to enforcement, other than in winding-up proceedings. These provisions were repealed in December 1997.", "13. Article 323 of the 1952 Code provided that enforcement proceedings against private parties were to be instituted upon the request of the creditor. The creditors were under the obligation to state against which debtor\u2019s possessions (bank accounts, immovable property, and so forth) they would like the enforcement to be directed (Article 323 \u00a7 3). Throughout the proceedings the creditors could request the enforcement actions to be directed against different possessions of the debtor. If the creditors did not request enforcement actions to be undertaken for a period of two years, the enforcement proceedings had to be terminated (Article 330 \u00a7 1 (\u0434)). The new Code of Civil Procedure 2007 (\u201cthe 2007 Code\u201d), which came into force on 1 March 2008, contained similar provisions.", "14. Section 45 of the Accounting Act 1991 stipulated that the accounting registers and reports were to be kept for ten years. This provision was superseded in January 2002 by section 42 of the Accounting Act 2002.", "15. By virtue of Section 91 of the Organisation of the Judiciary Act 1976, the enforcement judges were part of the district courts system. Under the Regulations on the Organisation and Work of the District, Regional and Military Courts 1977, the general statutory time-limit for keeping the case files of archived cases in the district courts was five years. The Judiciary Act 1994, which superseded the Organisation of the Judiciary Act 1976 and which was in force until August 2007, as well as the regulations adopted on its implementation contained similar provisions."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
