The doctor in the admissions unit, however, refused to admit him, finding no pathology, and recommended outpatient treatment in a district polyclinic.", "9. Desperate for relief, on the same day the first applicant cut the veins on his forearm. Another ambulance was called for him by the second and third applicants, and he was taken to N.V. Sklifosovsky Research Institute of Emergency Medicine (\u041d\u0418\u0418 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u0438 \u0438\u043c. \u041d.\u0412. \u0421\u043a\u043b\u0438\u0444\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e).

In the meantime, on 18 April 2008 a forensic psychiatric examination was conducted which established that the first applicant\u2019s involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation on 25 May 2005 had been justified (psychiatric pathology of an acute character accompanied by expressed depression with attempted suicide). It was further established, however, that his subsequent stay in the psychiatric ward had been unlawful. In particular, contrary to the provisions of the relevant domestic law (the Psychiatric Treatment Law of 2 July 1992), no report had been drawn up by a panel of psychiatrists in the forty-eight hours following the first applicant\u2019s involuntary hospitalisation on the need for a further stay in the psychiatric hospital, and no application had been made to the court by the head of the psychiatric hospital on the need for the first applicant\u2019s continued involuntary stay in the psychiatric hospital.
