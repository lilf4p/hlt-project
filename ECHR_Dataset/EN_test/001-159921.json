The applicant was born in 1953 and is serving his sentence in correctional colony no. 2 in the Astrakhan Region.", "6. On 9 May 2012 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of murder committed during a fight with the victim. Two days later the Kirovskiy District Court of Astrakhan authorised his remand in custody, having noted the gravity of the charges, his previous convictions, including for violent crimes, his failure to \u201cget on the road to improvement\u201d, the absence of an \u201cofficial\u201d source of income, and his lack of dependants.", "7. That decision was upheld on appeal by the Astrakhan Regional Court, which fully endorsed the District Court\u2019s reasoning. In addition, the Regional Court took into account that the applicant was suffering from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) but stated that there was no medical evidence that he could not continue being detained in the conditions of a temporary detention facility.", "8. Another extension of the applicant\u2019s detention followed on 9 July 2012, when the District Court accepted the investigator\u2019s arguments that he was likely to re-offend, abscond and interfere with the investigation. The District Court linked those risks to the gravity of the charges against the applicant, his having received \u201cnegative characteristics\u201d at his place of residence, as well as his having already been \u201cthe subject of criminal prosecution\u201d. At the same time the court examined medical evidence produced by the applicant in support of his claim that the fact that he was suffering from an advanced stage of HIV precluded his detention. The District Court dismissed the claim, stressing that the applicant regularly received medication prescribed by a prison doctor and that his detention in the temporary detention facility did not pose a risk to his health.", "9. The District Court issued further orders extending the applicant\u2019s pretrial detention on 2 August, 6 September and 7 November 2012. Each time, it relied on the gravity of the charges and the risk flowing of the applicant absconding, interfering with the course of justice and reoffending. Neither detention order mentioned that the applicant had a criminal record. The applicant\u2019s arguments about the progress of his HIV infection and the rapid deterioration of his health did not convince the District Court. The order of 7 November 2012 extended the applicant\u2019s detention until 9 December 2012. It was upheld on appeal by the Astrakhan Regional Court on 14 November 2012, with reference to the gravity of the charges and the applicant\u2019s \u201cpersonality\u201d. The relevant part of the decision reads as follows:", "\u201cOn 11 May 2012 ... the Kirovskiy District Court of Astrakhan ordered [the applicant\u2019s] detention. Subsequently, the detention was lawfully extended. ...", "In extending the detention for up to seven months, the court reasonably took into account that [the applicant] was charged with a particularly serious criminal offence and that, in view of hiswas liable to reoffend or destroy the evidence.", "The court also correctly held that the case was particularly complex, due to the large number of investigatory activities and complex expert examinations to be conducted. The court also took into account the applicant\u2019s lengthy treatment in the prison hospital.", "The court correctly concluded that there were no grounds for changing the measure of restraint.\u201d", "The Regional Court did not address the applicant\u2019s arguments, raised in his statement of appeal, that the investigating authorities significantly delayed a number of procedural actions, including the expert examination scheduled as early as June 2012 and not yet performed.", "10. The District Court further extended the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention on 8 December 2012, summarily referring to his \u201cpersonality\u201d and \u201csocially dangerous conduct\u201d. The court also pointed out that some unspecified expert examinations had been conducted, which had \u201cobjectively influenced the length of the investigation\u201d.", "11. On 30 December 2012 the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention was again extended on the grounds of the gravity of the charges and the continued risk of his absconding and interfering with the course of justice. The court used similar wording as in the previous detention orders.", "12. On 16 March 2013 the applicant was served with the final version of the bill of indictment. The bill indicated that the applicant had no criminal record.", "13. On 6 August 2013 the District Court convicted the applicant of murder. The court found that he had killed the victim in the course of an altercation caused by the victim\u2019s insults. The District Court sentenced the applicant to seven years of imprisonment, having taken into account the following mitigating circumstances: the applicant had no criminal record, was \u201cpositively characterised\u201d, had surrendered himself to the police, had confessed to the killing and felt deep remorse, and the victim had behaved provocatively having initiated the conflict with the applicant.", "14.

On the same date he was examined by a doctor, who recorded no complaints and diagnosed him with a stomach ulcer in remission.", "17.

Since August 2012 the doctors have again recorded a deterioration in the applicant\u2019s condition and an increase in his viral load. They linked the deterioration to prior interruptions in the antiretroviral therapy. It is not clear from the documents submitted by the applicant when and why those interruptions occurred.", "21.
