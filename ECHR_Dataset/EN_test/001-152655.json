The applicants were born in 1936 and 1967. Until his death the first applicant lived in Novska, Croatia. The second applicant lives in Dieskau, Germany.", "7. According to the applicants, on 18 December 1991, during the armed conflict in Croatia, a number of the first applicant\u2019s neighbours, together with the other members of their family, gathered in the first applicant\u2019s home in Novska, Croatia, because the town was being shelled. At about 9.45 p.m. several soldiers broke into the house and immediately started to hit and kick the first applicant. He could not see them well because the house, like the rest of the town, was without electricity. When he fell to the ground, they dragged him into the kitchen where V.M., the first applicant\u2019s wife and the second applicant\u2019s mother, and G.M., the first applicant\u2019s daughter and the second applicant\u2019s sister, and B., one of their neighbours, were sheltering. In the candlelight, the first applicant saw five men in military uniforms of the Croatian Army with balaclavas on their heads. They continued to hit and kick the first applicant and one of the men cut through the first applicant\u2019s palm with a knife. The other man cut one of B.\u2019s fingers off with the knife. One of the soldiers shot G.M. in the head, the other then cut B.\u2019s throat with a knife and subsequently shot at her with a firearm. The soldiers then ordered V.M. to make coffee for them. One of the soldiers introduced himself as Grgi\u0107 from a nearby village, Bro\u010dice. He asked the first applicant if he knew him and then hit him on the head with the shotgun. One soldier then cut a muscle in the first applicant\u2019s right hand. Next, the soldiers shot V.M. dead. After that, a soldier shot the first applicant through his right cheek. The soldiers then left the kitchen. The first applicant escaped through the window and ran away, reaching a nearby medical centre. From there he was transferred to a hospital in Kutina, then to Zagreb where he lay in a coma for three days. When he came round, one of the doctors told him that three men had been looking for him and wanted him killed. His sister sent an ambulance from Germany and he was transferred from Zagreb to Germany, where he was treated from 6 January to 15 May 1992.", "8. When the first applicant returned to his home in Novska on 19 July 1992, he found refugees accommodated in part of the house. In the intervening period, all of his possessions had been taken away.", "9. It appears that the police were alerted of the above-described events the following day.

On 10 December 2008 the Sisak County State Attorney\u2019s Office dismissed the complaint against D.L. since he had died in 1997.", "16. On 12 January 2009 an investigating judge of the Sisak County Court heard evidence from the first applicant. On 13 January 2009 the first applicant asked that two witnesses be called and provided their addresses and telephone numbers to the County Court.", "17. On 9 February 2009 the Police interviewed the potential witnesses, M.B. and P.U.", "18. On 30 July 2009 the State Attorney\u2019s Office in Sisak County submitted a request to the Sisak County Court to open an investigation into the above-mentioned criminal complaint. The request was denied on 1 October 2009. However, upon an appeal lodged by the Sisak County State Attorney\u2019s Office of 6 October 2009, the Supreme Court of Croatia ordered on 30 March 2010 that the investigation in respect of \u017d.B., D.M., I.G. and Z.P. be carried out.", "19.

The report on the autopsy was submitted on 2 November 2010 and the psychiatric report on 11 November 2010.", "23. Hearings were held on 15, 16 and 19 November 2010. On the last-mentioned date a judgment dismissing the charges was delivered on the ground that the accused had already been tried for the same offence before the Zagreb Military Court. The charges against I.G. and Z.P. had been dropped by the prosecutor and the proceedings against \u017d.B. and D.M. had been terminated under the General Amnesty Act.", "24. The Sisak State Attorney\u2019s Office lodged an appeal on 23 February 2011 and on 21 February 2012 the Supreme Court upheld the judgment in respect of I.G. and Z.P. and quashed the judgment in respect of \u017d.B. and D.M. As regards I.G. and Z.P. the Supreme Court concluded that the prosecutor had dropped the charges against them because there had not been sufficient evidence that they had participated in the shooting of the victims. Neither had the evidence adduced in the proceedings before the Sisak County Court indicated their involvement in the killing and wounding of the victims. The relevant part of the judgment referring to the actions of I.G. and Z.P. reads:", "\u201cThe evidence presented [at the trial] ... did not establish any activity on the part of the accused I.G. and Z.P. so as to indicate [that they had committed] acts of violence towards Petar Mileusni\u0107 or any other person in the house, before \u017d.B., D.M. and the late D.L. started to shoot at the victims. The [first-instance] court concluded that the accused I.G. had not entered the house at all and that the accused [D.]P. had quickly entered and exited the house of the victim Petar Mileusni\u0107, without having committed any act in the house.\u201d", "The Supreme Court further held as follows:", "\u201cSince no new facts were established in the fresh criminal proceedings in which the impugned judgment was delivered ... save for those [facts] in respect of which the State Attorney had already dropped the charges, irrespective of their different legal qualification, the conclusion of the first-instance court that [the situation] was a matter of res judicata is correct and, contrary to the assertion of the State Attorney in the appeal, the indictment was correctly dismissed in respect of the accused I.G. and Z.P. in accordance with Article 353 point 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (1997).\u201d", "25. The case was then transferred to the Zagreb County Court.", "26. Hearings before the Zagreb County Court were held on 28 November 2012 and 23 January 2013.", "27. On 29 October 2013 that court found the accused \u017d.B. and D.M. guilty as charged and sentenced them to ten and nine years\u2019 imprisonment respectively. The judgment was upheld by the Supreme Court on 7 March 2013.", "28.
