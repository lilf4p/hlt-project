By a decision of 6 November 2007 the misdemeanour court judge in Leskovac (sudija Op\u0161tinskog organa za prekr\u0161aje u Leskovcu) found that at about 5.30 p.m. on 12 October 2006 in Leskovac R.C. had verbally insulted the applicant\u2019s children, and the applicant had then punched him several times on the head and injured him. The judge concluded that these actions had been in breach of public order and peace and had thus been contrary to Article 6(3) of the Public Order Act 1992 (see paragraph 21 below under Relevant domestic law and practice). The relevant part of the decision reads:", "\u201cDefendant[s] R.C. ... and Mom\u010dilo Milenkovi\u0107 are guilty in that at about 5.30 p.m. on 12 October 2006, in Suboti\u010dka street in Leskovac, [the former first swore and insulted the applicant\u2019s children], while the latter punched R.C. several times on the head and injured him ...\u201d", "8.

After an investigation had been conducted, on 4 April 2007 the Leskovac Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office (\u201cthe LPPO\u201d) charged the applicant with the criminal offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm on R.C. in connection with the above incident, contrary to Article 121 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code 1998. The LPPO, as well as the applicant and his family in the capacity of private prosecutors, lodged separate indictments against R.C. for several offences. All the indictments were joined in the same proceedings before the Leskovac Municipal Court.", "10. In a judgment of 13 April 2011 the Leskovac Municipal Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to three months\u2019 imprisonment. R.C. was found guilty and fined for insulting the applicant\u2019s family and causing minor bodily injuries to the applicant\u2019s mother.

On 20 March 2012 the Ni\u0161 Appeals Court upheld the judgment in respect of the applicant and dismissed the charges against R.C. as statute-barred. As regards the principle of ne bis in idem, the court held that the applicant had been found guilty of a misdemeanour against public order and peace in the misdemeanour proceedings, whereas he had been convicted of the criminal offence of grievous bodily harm in the criminal proceedings. According to the court, the descriptions of the acts sanctioned therefore clearly differed.", "13. On 19 September 2012, the Leskovac Basic Court converted the prison sentence to house arrest without electronic monitoring.", "14. On 29 November 2012 the Leskovac Basic Court amnestied the applicant at his request, finding that the conditions for a statutory amnesty were applicable (see paragraph 22 below).", "15.
