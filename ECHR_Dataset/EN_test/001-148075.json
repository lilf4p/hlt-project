THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Alvina Gyulumyan;J\u00e1n \u0160ikuta;Johannes Silvis;Josep Casadevall", "TEXT": ["1. The applicant, Mr Fuat \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, is a Turkish national, who was born in 1968 and lives in Rotterdam. He is represented before the Court by Ms J. Serrarens, a lawyer practising in Maastricht. The Netherlands Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr R.A.A. B\u00f6cker, and their Deputy Agent, Ms L. Egmond, both of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.", "2. The Government of the Republic of Turkey were informed of their right to take part in the proceedings (Article 36 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) but did not express the desire to do so.", "3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "4. In April 2007 the applicant, a convict prisoner who had been in detention since 1999, was transferred to the Penal Institution \u201cDordtse Poorten\u201d in Dordrecht.", "5. By letter of 2 April 2007 the Correctional Institutions Agency of the Ministry of Justice (Dienst Justiti\u00eble Inrichtingen van het Ministerie van Justitie) informed the Governor of \u201cDordtse Poorten\u201d about a project for the taking of prisoners\u2019 biometric data (photographic likenesses and fingerprints), referred to by the name of \u201cBiometrics\u201d, which was prompted by the finding that a number of prisoners in a different institution had assumed a false identity. The project, referred to as a \u201ccatch-up exercise\u201d (inhaalslag), was intended to constitute the initial phase of a complete overhaul of the prisoner identification system. As part of this project, the Governor of \u201cDordtse Poorten\u201d was asked to take biometric data of certain prisoners in his institution.", "6. As one of the prisoners chosen, the applicant was informed by letter of the intention of the Governor to take his fingerprints and digital photograph. The letter did not provide information on the storage or use of the data taken. The applicant states that the penal institution\u2019s staff members, when asked, told him that the data would be stored for \u201cdecades\u201d in a national database that would be accessible to the police and the judicial authorities.", "7. On 23 April 2007 the applicant was asked to submit to the taking of his fingerprints and a digital photograph. He refused to do so, firstly, because he had already given these data when he was admitted to the penal institution and, secondly, because he opposed the fact that his data would be stored in a national database for an unknown length of time and that they would be accessible to the police and the judicial authorities.", "8. Because of the applicant\u2019s refusal to cooperate, the Unit Director of the penal institution imposed on the applicant three days\u2019 solitary confinement in his own cell which included the removal of his television, starting on 24 April 2007. Later that day, the applicant submitted a complaint against this punishment to the Complaints Commission (beklagcommissie) of the penal institution\u2019s Supervisory Board (Commissie van Toezicht), stating that he had complied with his obligations under Section 28 (2) of the Prisons Act (Penitentiaire Beginselenwet) when he had submitted to the taking of his fingerprints and digital photograph during his admittance to the penal institution. He further argued that he was not obliged to submit his data again because they would not be used internally, within the penal institution, but for a national database for which there was no legal basis in the Prisons Act or any other act.", "9. On 25 July 2007 the Unit Director sanctioned the applicant a second time and the institution\u2019s staff members threatened to report the applicant to the Public Prosecution Service for refusal to comply with an official order if he continued to refuse to provide his fingerprints and digital photograph. Following this threat, the applicant cooperated and submitted his data. He was, neither then, nor after his release, given any information on the way his data would be stored or used.", "10. On 24 June 2008 the Complaints Commission of the penal institution\u2019s Supervisory Board rejected the applicant\u2019s complaint. It held that the sanction had not been unreasonable because the Governor had been obliged to comply with the instructions of the Correctional Institutions Agency; because the refusal of a prisoner to comply with an order of the Governor was a disciplinary offence; and because the applicant had refused to submit his data when ordered to do so by the Governor.", "11. In his appeal to the Appeals Board (beroepscommissie) of the Council for the Application of Criminal Justice and Protection of Juveniles (Raad voor Strafrechtstoepassing en Jeugdbescherming) the applicant largely restated his arguments. He further submitted that the existence of a Determination of the Identity of Suspects, Convicted Persons and Witnesses Bill (Wetsvoorstel Wet identiteitsvaststelling verdachten, veroordeelden en getuigen), which provided a legal basis for the taking and processing of prisoners\u2019 biometric data in a national database, proved that section 28 (2) of the Prisons Act did not yet confer any such power.", "12. On 3 December 2008 the Appeals Board noted that in practice the identity of prisoners was checked at the time of admission to the institution. It further noted that on entering the institution the applicant had complied with this obligation to submit identifying data as provided for in section 28 (2) of the Prisons Act. It held that, even though the collection of the data itself had not been unlawful, it had been up to the Governor to explain to the applicant why his data needed to be taken a second time and to provide him afterwards with another opportunity to submit his data. As the Governor had failed to do so, the Appeals Board held that the sanction had been unreasonable. The Appeals Board awarded the applicant financial compensation in an amount of 22.50 euros (EUR).", "13. The applicant was released on 7 September 2009.", "14. In their further observations submitted in response to the applicant\u2019s observations, the Government submitted a written statement on paper bearing the letterhead of the Judicial Information Service (Justiti\u00eble Informatiedienst) and dated 22 March 2013.

A detainee may lodge a complaint with the Complaints Committee against a decision concerning him taken by or on behalf of the Governor.", "2. A failure or refusal to give a decision is equated with a decision as referred to in subsection 1. If no decision has been given within the statutory time limit or, in the absence thereof, within a reasonable time limit, this is deemed to be a failure or refusal to give a decision.", "3. The Governor must ensure that a detainee wishing to lodge a complaint is given an opportunity to do so as quickly as possible.\u201d", "17. The following is taken from the drafting history of the Prisons Act (Explanatory Memorandum (Memorie van Toelichting), Lower House of Parliament, no. 24,263, 1994-95 session, no. 3):", "\u201c...", "Chapter VI of the Bill specifies permissible interferences with the constitutional rights of respect for one\u2019s privacy and for the integrity of the body, the clothing and of the prisoner\u2019s bodily secretion.", "...", "The following powers are granted to the Governor to exercise control over the prisoners and the use of force against them:", "a. to impose a duty to provide proof of identity;", "...", "a.
