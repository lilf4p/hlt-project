The applicant, who was born in 1963, is a member of the Turkish Parliament and lives in Ankara. At the time of the events giving rise to the present application he was the president of the Diyarbak\u0131r Bar Association.", "6. On 2 June 2005 the daily newspaper H\u00fcrriyet reported statements by a senior intelligence officer, who claimed that the National Intelligence Agency of Turkey (\u201cM\u0130T\u201d) had been intercepting the telephone conversations and email correspondence of a number of people on the basis of approximately ninety court decisions over the previous ten years. The intelligence officer stated that the surveillance had been continuous until March 2005, when the M\u0130T had stopped it in order to wait for the entry into force of the new Criminal Code. However, when a bomb attack had occurred in March in Ku\u015fadas\u0131, killing a police superintendent, the M\u0130T had gone to the Sixth Division of the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court (\u201cthe Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court\u201d) to seek permission for the interception of communications.", "7. In a decision dated 6 May 2005, relying on Article 22 of the Constitution and sections 2, 4, 11 and 16 of Law no. 4422, the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court had granted the M\u0130T permission to monitor and examine all electronic communications in order to identify and arrest terrorist suspects with international connections as well as to collect evidence and to prevent crime by having early intelligence of it. The M\u0130T had obtained permission to intercept all domestic or international telephone calls and communications provided between 8 April and 30 May 2005 by national telecommunications company T\u00fcrk Telekom, private mobile network operators and Internet providers and to obtain information contained in SMS, MMS, GPRS and fax communications, as well as caller IDs, correspondents\u2019 IP addresses and all other communication-related information.", "8. On 6 June 2005, after reading the article, the applicant filed a criminal complaint with the Diyarbak\u0131r Principal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office against the judge, S.T., who had delivered the Assize Court decision in question, the public prosecutor, the M\u0130T agents who had sought permission to monitor and examine communications, and the M\u0130T agents who had implemented the decision. Relying on a number of newspaper and online articles, the applicant alleged that S.T. had decided that the records of all domestic and international electronic communications between 8 April and 30 May 2005 should be given to the M\u0130T by the telecommunications companies. The judge had made that decision in complete disregard of the legislation then in force and without carrying out any research or requiring proof. The impugned decision had been of a very general nature since it had not included the names of any suspects or indicated the date, location or address of people whose communications would be intercepted. As a consequence, any person, including himself, who had used a landline or mobile telephone to communicate between the above-mentioned dates, had been a victim of the impugned decision. The applicant maintained that the decision had violated his rights protected by Article 8 of the Convention and had also contravened Articles 20 and 23 of the Constitution, which protected private life and the freedom of communication respectively, since the accused had obtained records of his communications and restricted his freedom of communication without any justification. Lastly, the applicant contended that the implementation of the decision, which had been in contravention of section 2 of Law no. 4422, required the punishment of those responsible.", "9. On 20 June 2005 the Diyarbak\u0131r Principal Public Prosecutor decided to disjoin the case concerning the M\u0130T officials and to register it separately because the prosecution of M\u0130T officials required the Prime Minister\u2019s permission.", "10. On 30 September 2005 the Diyarbak\u0131r Principal Public Prosecutor decided not to prosecute the M\u0130T officials who had implemented the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court\u2019s decision. He decided that the M\u0130T officials had merely implemented the court\u2019s decision when intercepting and examining communications and that the implementation of court decisions was required by law and did not constitute a crime. In any event, there was no evidence that the telecommunications companies had given any records to the M\u0130T officials or that they had monitored communications over the Internet. The Public Prosecutor also referred to a decision by the Ankara Principal Public Prosecutor not to prosecute over the same issue (decision no. 2005/35575, 17 June 2005) in relation to a number of other complaints brought against the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court\u2019s decision.", "11. On 25 October 2005 the applicant filed an objection with the Siverek Assize Court against the above decision, alleging that the Diyarbak\u0131r Public Prosecutor had failed to carry out an investigation into his complaints concerning an alleged violation of his rights guaranteed by Articles 8 and 13 of the Convention.", "12. On 30 November 2005 the Siverek Assize Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s objection, holding that the Principal Public Prosecutor\u2019s decision against prosecution had complied with the legislation since the M\u0130T officials had implemented a court decision and had not committed any offence.", "13. On 6 April 2006 the Ministry of Justice decided not to take an action against the public prosecutor and the judge as it found that their acts fell within judicial discretion. The Ministry considered that although the impugned interception decision had been in breach of the national and international legal norms, the aim was to locate the terrorists before they acted and to take the necessary security measures against them. For the Ministry, the decision did not display \u2018ill-will\u2019 towards any individual or institution and the complainants had failed to demonstrate that they had been affected by the impugned decision in any way. On an unspecified date the applicant filed an objection against this decision. On 31 October 2007 the Third Division of Ankara Administrative Court dismissed the objection."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
