The court reasoned that the detention had been unlawful, since the sanction for the crime she was suspected of did not provide for any form of deprivation of liberty. The applicant did not initiate any further proceedings in this regard.", "9. On 4 November 2003 the prosecution made an application for the court to order an involuntary forensic psychiatric examination of the applicant at the Forensic Psychiatry Centre.", "10. On the same day the Town Court granted the prosecutor\u2019s application. The relevant part of its order reads:", "\u201cBy virtue of paragraph 1 of Article 203 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a defendant may be placed in a psychiatric hospital if a forensic psychiatric examination requires his assessment in the hospital.", "... the court considers that it should allow the application by the investigator, Ms D., to place [the applicant] in [the Forensic Psychiatry Centre] for a forensic psychiatric evaluation, because [the applicant] is in need of such a hospital examination.\u201d", "11. The applicant and her representative did not attend the hearing, because they had not been summoned to it. However, both the prosecutor and the investigator attended and made oral submissions.", "12.

On 13 April 2004 a panel of psychiatrists issued a report, concluding that the applicant suffered from \u201cparanoid personality development\u201d, and that she had not been able to understand or control her actions during the events of 22 December 2002 (contempt of court) and 29 December 2003 (criminal slander). The report further stated that she presented a danger to others and therefore needed compulsory treatment in a psychiatric facility. On the same day the applicant was released.", "16. Two weeks later on 27 April 2004 the Moscow Regional Court (\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0434) (\u201cthe Regional Court\u201d) held a hearing on the applicant\u2019s appeal against the the Town Court\u2019s decision of 4 November 2003 authorising psychiatric examination, and rejected it. As regards the applicant\u2019s complaint about the hearing taking place in her absence, the Regional Court noted that Article 165 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provided for ex parte hearings where there was judicial authorisation of investigative actions, including internment in a psychiatric facility for forensic examination (as set out in Article 203 of the Code).", "17. On 14 September 2004 the Moscow City Court (\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0434) (\u201cthe City Court\u201d) adopted decisions in two sets of criminal proceedings against the applicant. The first decision terminated the criminal proceedings relating to the contempt of court charges in respect of the events of 22 December 2002. The applicant\u2019s statements, while offensive, were found to have been lacking the degree of insult requisite for incurring criminal liability. In the second decision, the City Court established the principal facts of the events of 29 December 2003. Concluding that the applicant had acted in a state of insanity, it terminated the criminal proceedings against her and ordered her to undergo compulsory medical treatment in a psychiatric facility. It relied on the findings and recommendations of the Forensic Psychiatry Centre\u2019s report of 13 April 2004 in its reasoning.", "18. On 22 December 2004 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation upheld the lower court\u2019s decisions.", "19.

On 16 May 2006 a panel of hospital psychiatrists concluded that the applicant\u2019s mental health had improved and she no longer posed a danger to society. On the same day an application to discharge the hospital order and discontinue the compulsory treatment was sent to the Town Court.", "22. On 22 May 2006 the Town Court scheduled the hearing of the application for the next day. However, it was adjourned until 2 June 2006, because the applicant\u2019s representative failed to appear and additional medical records and statements had to be obtained. Two subsequent hearings were adjourned following applications by the applicant\u2019s representatives.", "23. On 10 July 2006 the Town Court ordered the applicant\u2019s compulsory treatment to be discontinued. Her representative lodged an appeal, arguing that the proceedings should have been discontinued from the very beginning, and that the applicant should have been released, since there had been no need for any compulsory treatment. On 31 August 2006 the Regional Court dismissed the appeal and upheld the lower court\u2019s decision.", "24.
