The applicants were born in 1975, 1957 and 1955 respectively and live in Baku.", "6. The applicants stood as candidates for the opposition parties in the parliamentary elections of 7 November 2010 in the single-mandate Khatai First Electoral Constituency No. 33. Mr Fuad Gahramanli was nominated by the coalition of the Popular Front and Musavat parties, Mr Zalimkhan Mammadli by the Classic Popular Front Party and Mr Namizad Safarov by the Karabakh electoral bloc.", "7. The constituency was divided into thirty-five electoral precincts, with one polling station in each precinct. It is apparent that there were a total of eight candidates running for election in the constituency.", "8. According to the official election results, Mr H.M., the candidate nominated by the ruling Yeni Azerbaijan Party, won the election with 9,805 votes. Mr Zalimkhan Mammadli finished second with 1,893 votes, Mr Fuad Gahramanli third with 1,571 votes and Mr Namizad Safarov last with 157 votes.", "9. On 10 November 2010 the applicants, together with one other candidate, jointly lodged nearly identical complaints with the Constituency Electoral Commission (the \u201cConEC\u201d) and the Central Electoral Commission (the \u201cCEC\u201d). They complained that the election results had not reflected the true opinion of the voters because there had been numerous instances of electoral fraud and irregularities on election day, and they requested the annulment of the election results in their constituency. They alleged that:", "(a) In all the constituency polling stations, employees of the Khatai District Executive Authority and people affiliated with Mr H.M. had, in an organised manner, brought a number of persons not registered as voters into constituency polling stations to cast voting ballots;", "(b) There had been instances of ballot-stuffing in numerous polling stations;", "(c) The number of ballots cast in all the polling stations had been more than three times higher than the number of voters who had come to cast votes in all the polling stations;", "(d) In one polling station, observers and consultative members of precinct electoral commissions (\u201cPECs\u201d) (commission members with no voting rights) had been prevented from participating in the vote-counting process.", "10. The applicants also requested that their presence be ensured at the commission hearings concerning their complaints.", "11. In support of their allegations, the applicants submitted to the electoral commissions more than a hundred statements (akt) made by election observers documenting specific instances of the irregularities complained of.", "12. The applicants submitted copies of approximately fifty of the abovementioned statements to the Court concerning alleged irregularities in Polling Stations nos. 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29, 30, 33, 34 and 35. Some examples of those statements are summarised below.", "13. Two observers in Polling Station no. 34 claimed to have witnessed an incident of ballot-box stuffing by two PEC members. They noted that, although fewer than 240 voters had been counted throughout the day, a total of 534 ballots had been found in the ballot box and officially counted.", "14. Three observers in Polling Station no. 9 witnessed an incident where the PEC chairman had given a stack of several pre-marked ballots to a voter, who then accidentally dropped them on the floor near the ballot box. Despite this, the ballots were gathered up and put into the ballot box in plain view of all those present. In a separate statement, the same three observers noted two other incidents of similar ballot-box stuffing allegedly initiated by the PEC chairman.", "15. Three observers in Polling Station no. 19 noted that, although a total of only 259 voters had been counted throughout the day, the number of ballots found inside the ballot box at the end of the day had exceeded 400.", "16. One consultative member of the PEC and two observers in Polling Station no. 18 noted that they had been prevented from standing at a place where they could observe, in an unobstructed manner, the checking of voters\u2019 forefingers for election ink. This had presumably been done by persons in charge in the precinct,", "17. Three observers in Polling Station no. 25 noted that, although a total of only 235 voters had been counted throughout the day, 496 ballots had been found in the ballot box. The ballot box contained clumps of ballots, suggesting that ballot-box stuffing had taken place.", "18. Observers in a number of other polling stations had also noted similarly significant differences between the numbers of ballots in the ballot boxes and the numbers of voters who had been observed casting votes throughout the day.", "19. According to the applicants, they did not receive any reply from the ConEC and their complaint had been examined by the CEC only.", "20. On 13 November 2010 the CEC extended the statutory three-day period for examining the complaint for an indefinite period of time, noting that \u201cadditional enquiries\u201d were required.", "21. On 21 November 2010, R.I., the member of the CEC\u2019s expert group who had been charged with dealing with the complaint delivered his opinion, stating that the complaint should be dismissed as unsubstantiated.", "22. By a decision of 21 November 2010, the text of which was essentially a repetition of the opinion delivered by the expert R.I., the CEC dismissed the applicants\u2019 complaint as unsubstantiated. It appears that the applicants were not present at the CEC hearing.", "23. In its decision, the CEC noted that the applicants should first have taken their complaints to the relevant PECs. They could then have appealed against the decisions of the various PECs to the ConEC, and only then should they have complained to the CEC, whereas \u2012 in breach of the above procedure \u2012 they had applied directly to the CEC. The CEC nevertheless decided to examine the complaint on the merits.", "24. As to the merits of the complaint, the CEC found, in particular, that \u201cthe majority of the observers\u2019 statements [as submitted by the applicants] were of a general character and did not reflect the principle that an observation must be based on fact\u201d. It furthermore found that a number of the statements contained an assessment of the alleged irregularity based solely on observers\u2019 \u201csubjective opinions\u201d. As an example of this, the CEC mentioned the statement of three observers from Polling Station no. 25 (see paragraph 17 above).", "25. Furthermore, the CEC noted that the information in the observers\u2019 statements which the applicants submitted \u2012 of which there were more than hundred \u2012 was refuted by the statements of over one hundred other observers from \u201call thirty-five polling stations\u201d who had not registered any breaches of electoral law that could affect the election results. According to the CEC, some of those observers represented the opposition. In particular, the CEC mentioned the names of a number of observers from Polling Stations nos. 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 15 who, according to the CEC, \u201chad confirmed that no breaches of the electoral legislation had been observed\u201d. Moreover, the CEC noted that PEC members in all the polling stations had stated that, on election day, they had not received any statements or complaints by any observer or candidate concerning any election irregularities and that the election process in their respective polling stations had been lawful and conducted under adequate conditions.", "26. In conclusion, the CEC found that the examination of the written evidence refuted the allegations made by the applicants and that no grounds for invalidating the election results could be established.", "27. On 25 November 2010 the applicants, together with one other candidate, lodged an appeal against the CEC decision with the Baku Court of Appeal. In the appeal, they reiterated the complaints made to the CEC about the alleged irregularities on election day. They also complained that \u2012 contrary to the requirements of Article 112-1.7 of the Electoral Code \u2012 their presence at the CEC hearing had not been ensured and that the CEC had deliberately not investigated the serious allegations of electoral fraud and irregularities.", "28. By a judgment of 26 November 2010 the Baku Court of Appeal dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal, mostly reiterating the CEC\u2019s reasoning. In particular, it noted that the applicants and their observers had not immediately complained of the alleged irregularities directly to the relevant PECs on election day. It furthermore found that the CEC had properly investigated the allegations and had found that they had been refuted by a number of other observers representing various political parties, including opposition parties, who had stated that no serious irregularities had taken place in any polling station.", "29. A copy of the Baku Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment was made available to the applicants on 30 November 2010.", "30. In the meantime, on 22 November 2010 the CEC had sent its final election results record and other relevant documents for review and final approval by the Constitutional Court. On 29 November 2010 the Constitutional Court confirmed the country-wide election results, including the election results in the applicants\u2019 constituency, as final.", "31. On 1 December 2010 the applicants lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court against the Baku Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment. They reiterated the complaints and arguments raised before the CEC and the Baku Court of Appeal. They also complained of the following:", "(a) as to the CEC\u2019s and the appellate court\u2019s remark that the irregularities allegedly observed on election day had not been communicated to the PECs immediately on that same day, the applicants noted that it had been precisely the conduct of the PECs \u2012 which had created a hostile environment for opposition observers and had themselves been largely responsible for those irregularities \u2012 that had made it impossible or difficult for the applicants and their observers to attempt to deal with the irregularities at the PEC level;", "(b) both the CEC and the Baku Court of Appeal had given more weight to the statements of pro-Government observers, which had assessed the election process positively, than to those of the applicants\u2019 observers. The CEC and the Baku Court of Appeal did not explain the reasons for doing so. Moreover, while the CEC noted that positive statements about the conduct of the election had been made even by some observers from opposition parties, the applicants claimed the CEC had simply fabricated the existence of such statements by purported pro-opposition observers.", "32. On 6 December 2010 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal, agreeing with the lower court\u2019s reasoning. It also added that the applicants\u2019 appeal and the Baku Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment had to be assessed in the light of Article 63.4 of the Law on the Constitutional Court, which stated that the Constitutional Court\u2019s decisions were final and could not be subject to quashing, amendment or official interpretation by any authority or person. In this regard, the Supreme Court reasoned as follows:", "\u201cThe results of the [parliamentary] elections of 7 November 2010 were recognised as valid by [the CEC\u2019s] election results record of 22 November 2010 and the candidates elected as members of parliament from all 125 electoral constituencies were determined.", "The aforementioned results record was approved by the CEC decision of 22 November 2010, and [on the same date] the final election results record, together with the [ConEC] results records and additional documents, were submitted to the Constitutional Court for verification and approval of the election results.", "By a decision of the Plenum of the Constitutional Court on the results of the [parliamentary] elections of 7 November 2010 ..., dated 29 November 2010, the CEC\u2019s final results record of 22 November 2010 was deemed compliant with the requirements of Articles 100.2, 100.12, 108.2 and 171.2 of the Electoral Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan, and the election results concerning 125 electoral constituencies, including Khatai First Electoral Constituency no. 33, were approved, that decision becoming final at the moment of its delivery.", "It follows from that decision that the Constitutional Court did not establish any circumstances that may have taken place during the voting or the determination of the election results that could have prevented the establishing of the will of the voters in Khatai First Electoral Constituency no. 33.", "Taking into account the fact that the aforementioned decision [of the Constitutional Court] is final and not subject to quashing, amendment or official interpretation by any authority or person, the court considers that the judgment of the appellate court [dismissing the applicants\u2019 complaints] must be upheld.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
