On 11 October 2012 the Federal Migration Service (FMS) issued a deportation order against the applicant and asked the Abakan Town Court of the Khakassiya Republic to authorise the applicant\u2019s placement into the detention centre for aliens pending his deportation.

The Town Court pronounced unlawful the FMS\u2019s failure to act but refused to fix a time-limit for the applicant\u2019s detention, referring to the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 24 January 2013 (see paragraph 13 above).", "18.
