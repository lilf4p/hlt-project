De Gaetano;Gabriele Kucsko-Stadlmayer", "TEXT": ["5. The applicants are all Romanian nationals of Roma origin and heirs of I.B., who, together with some of the applicants, initiated the domestic proceedings. Those proceedings were still pending when I.B. died on 1 April 2010.", "6. I.B.\u2019s heirs pursued the case before the domestic courts and lodged a complaint before the Court on his behalf and on their own behalf.", "7. On 30 March 2006 at around 5 p.m. A.N., I.B.\u2019s daughter-in-law, was attacked near I.B.\u2019s home. I.B.\u2019s three sons (the applicants nos. (1)-(3) in the appendix) and C.G.M., the victim\u2019s father, went to Clejani Police Station to report the assault.", "8. In front of the police station they were allegedly attacked by a group of fifty villagers. When I.B. arrived there, attracted by the noise, he saw C.G.M. injured, with his head covered with blood. His sons\u2019 car was also damaged (the windows were broken and the car\u2019s bonnet was concertinaed). I.B. also saw the villagers chasing his sons and attacking them with stones, bats and bricks.", "9. At around 6 p.m. police officers T.B. and M.N. from Clejani police station, accompanied by colleagues from the Giurgiu Rapid Intervention Squad (Deta\u015famentul Poli\u0163iei pentru Interven\u0163ie Rapid\u0103) arrived at I.B.\u2019s home to take him into custody. The police intervention team entered the yard and took him by force to the police car, while shouting abuse and calling him a gypsy (\u0163igan). To I.B.\u2019s question whether they had a search warrant, T.B. pointed to the special squad and said \u201cThey are my search warrant!\u201d. Then the police made two children from the household, one aged 13 and one 14, lie down on their stomachs and called them wretched disgraceful gypsies (\u0163igani bor\u00e2\u0163i). The sixth applicant, Marian Boac\u0103, who was 13 at the time, and M.D., I.B.\u2019s daughter-in-law, were taken to the police station in the same car.", "10. Later, the first three applicants, I.B.\u2019s other sons, were apprehended on the street by ten masked police officers, who shouted at them to lie down and then kicked them in the stomach and face while shouting abuse and calling them \u201cwretched disgraceful gypsies\u201d. They were also taken to Clejani police station, where they found the sixth applicant and M.D. standing with their arms up, facing the wall.", "11. The interrogations took place in the chief of police\u2019s office. I.B. was taken there first. He was beaten up first by police officer T.B. and two masked officers. Two more masked officers joined them later. They kicked I.B. in the ribs, on his right side; they punched him and beat him with their weapon butts and shouted abuse. I.B. lost consciousness. The first three applicants were brought to the same office and tripped over their father\u2019s body, which was lying unattended on the floor. They were ordered to lie down and were hit and shouted at. T.B. called the chief of the Letca Noua Police Station and told him to come for \u201ca match with the boys\u201d (la o partid\u0103 cu b\u0103ie\u0163ii). Some ten to fifteen minutes later officers from Letca Noua joined the interrogations and started hitting the applicants. According to the applicants, the police officers who beat them up had been drinking alcohol.", "12. At the applicant\u2019s request, the officers eventually allowed I.B. to leave the police station, but told the first three applicants that they had to sign confessions concerning the rape of a foreign woman and the theft of pipes. The statements had been written by the police officers. The applicants were not allowed to read the contents of those confessions. They denied committing any crime, but eventually signed the confessions and were allowed to leave the police station.", "13. On 30 March 2006 an altercation broke out between the Boac\u0103 family and the G. family, both parties behaving aggressively towards each other and armed with dangerous objects. The altercation occurred in front of the Clejani police station, where the G. family (belonging to the Ursari Roma community \u2013 \u021bigani ursari) was going to make a criminal complaint against the applicants\u2019 family about a previous altercation that had occurred the same day. In their statements to the police, members of the G. family related that the third applicant had tried to hit them with the car and, driving dangerously, had managed instead to hit his father, I.B.", "14. In this context, at 6.30 p.m. the Giurgiu Rapid Intervention Squad was called to restore public order. A team of four officers and a driver was in place from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. the next day. According to the police agents\u2019 statements, there were no incidents during this operation, as the Boac\u0103 family members concerned willingly complied with the police orders given when they were apprehended. Four eyewitnesses, all proposed by I.B., declared they had seen him come out of the police station feeling ill, but with no apparent indications that he had been attacked.", "15. M.N., the head of Clejani police station, did not participate in the investigation out of fear of reprisals from the Boac\u0103 family.", "16. I.B. was taken by ambulance to Giurgiu County Hospital, where he underwent pulmonary X-ray investigations but received no treatment. He was then taken to Bucharest University Hospital, where he remained from 31 March to 4 April 2006.", "17. On 11 April 2006 a forensic doctor examined him. The medical certificate concluded that he had suffered a thoracic trauma inflicted by a \u201cblow caused by a hard object or by body impact\u201d. He needed fifteen to nineteen days to recover.", "18. Mih\u0103ile\u015fti Police started investigating the events of 30 March 2006. The accusations were of theft of pipes by members of the Boac\u0103 family and of a brawl involving twenty-one people, mainly belonging to the two families (Boac\u0103 and G.). Statements were taken from all those involved in the altercation and from some eyewitnesses. In their various statements made during those investigations, I.B. and the applicants declared that they had been beaten up by police. Some members of the opposing family declared that I.B. had been hit by the car driven by his son, the third applicant.", "19. On 9 May 2007 the prosecutor\u2019s office attached to Giurgiu County Court decided not to prosecute any of those involved in the incidents. He noted that the pipes had been returned to their rightful owner, who did not wish to seek damages from the applicants\u2019 family; as for the brawl, the prosecutor noted that there had been \u201creciprocal violence\u201d and therefore decided to impose administrative fines on all involved.", "20. It appears that the decision was not contested.", "21. On 1 June 2006 I.B. and the first three applicants lodged a criminal complaint with the prosecutor\u2019s office attached to Giurgiu County Court against the police officers who had allegedly ill-treated them. In his complaint to the police, I.B. stated that the police chief was friendly with the Ursari Roma from Clejani, with whom the Boac\u0103 family were in conflict. They also complained of discrimination, arguing that because of their Roma origin the police officers had been aggressive towards them and had called them racist names.", "22. The prosecutor started the investigations. He took statements from the six police officers involved in the events, including T.B. and M.N. They all denied having harmed the plaintiffs in any way. The prosecutor examined the intervention squad\u2019s official report from 30 March 2006 as well as the prosecution file concerning the accusations brought against the members of the two families involved in the fight on 30 March (see paragraph 18 above).", "23. On 18 December 2006 the prosecutor\u2019s office dismissed the complaint on the ground that the police officers\u2019 actions did not disclose any appearance of a criminal offence. The prosecutor noted that the rapid intervention squad was called to the scene of an altercation which the local police could no longer contain. In the squad\u2019s official report it was explained that intervention was required \u201cfor an altercation between two Gypsy clans\u201d (scandal \u00eentre dou\u0103 grupuri de \u0163igani). The prosecutor considered that the plaintiffs had failed to provide medical evidence of the injuries they had sustained, or that injuries had been inflicted by police officers.", "24. The plaintiffs appealed against that decision to the prosecutorinchief, but their objection was dismissed on 29 January 2007. The applicants challenged that decision before the Giurgiu County Court, reiterating their complaints of ill-treatment and discrimination.", "25. On 16 April 2007 the Giurgiu County Court upheld the prosecutor\u2019s decision, considering that the applicants had not provided proof of their allegations.", "26. The plaintiffs appealed, and on 27 June 2007 the Bucharest Court of Appeal quashed the above-mentioned decision and ordered the prosecutor to continue the investigation. It considered that the prosecutor had not taken into account the forensic medical certificate delivered to I.B., had not heard either the applicants or the eyewitnesses, and had not allowed the applicants to produce evidence (medical evidence or witnesses).", "27. On 29 August 2008 the prosecutor\u2019s office refused to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers. The prosecutor considered that the plaintiffs had not substantiated their allegations of ill-treatment and discrimination. It found that the police officers had acted lawfully and had been trying to counter the plaintiffs, who had used gas guns and sharp objects. One eyewitness was heard by the prosecutor.", "28. I.B. and the first three applicants appealed against the prosecutor\u2019s decision, but on 21 October 2008 the prosecutor-in-chief dismissed their objections and thus upheld that decision. On 28 October 2008 I.B. and the first three applicants appealed once again before the Giurgiu County Court.", "29. On 3 February 2009 the Giurgiu County Court allowed the appeal lodged by the four plaintiffs, quashed the decisions of the prosecutor and of the prosecutor-in-chief, and sent the case back to the prosecutor, on the ground that the investigations ordered by the court had not been carried out by the prosecutor.", "30. The prosecutor\u2019s office challenged that decision, and on 12 June 2009 the Bucharest Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on points of law in part. It found that the criminal investigation should be continued regarding I.B.\u2019s injuries. As far as the first three applicants were concerned, it considered that the criminal investigation should be closed because, in failing to sign the appeal against the decisions of 29 August 2007 and of 21 October 2008, they had in fact not endorsed the application for an investigation. The court considered that by failing to sign the application for leave to appeal within the assigned deadline the applicants had lost the right to lodge that appeal.", "31. On 28 October 2009 the prosecutor\u2019s office refused to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers, on the ground that their actions were consistent with their professional duties. He heard evidence from four eyewitnesses, who had seen I.B. being taken into the police station and then had seen him coming out. They reported that they could not see any signs of violence on him. One witness said that he could hear I.B. screaming and wailing in the police station, and that when he came out he had asked them to call an ambulance because he did not feel well.", "32. On 4 December 2009 the prosecutor-in-chief upheld that decision. I.B. appealed against both decisions before the Giurgiu County Court, which on 22 April 2010 dismissed his appeal. The court noted that the prosecutor heard I.B. and four villagers who were in front of the Clejani police station during the incidents. The four villagers declared that I.B. did not have any signs of violence on him when he left the police station. The court dismissed as unsubstantiated the allegations of discrimination made by I.B.", "33. On 1 April 2010 I.B. died of causes unrelated to the present case and the first six applicants continued the proceedings instituted before the domestic courts.", "34. On 14 December 2010 the Bucharest Court of Appeal upheld the decision delivered by the Giurgiu County Court and dismissed an appeal on points of law raised by I.B.\u2019s heirs. It reiterated that the four witnesses had not seen the police officers beating the victims, and considered that the fact alone that there had been other witnesses who could have been heard by the prosecutor was irrelevant, given the evidence already gathered in the case."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
