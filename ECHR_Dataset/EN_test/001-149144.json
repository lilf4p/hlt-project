CROATIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Dmitry Dedov;Elisabeth Steiner;Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Khanlar Hajiyev;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Ksenija Turkovi\u0107", "TEXT": ["1. The applicant, Mr Slavko Vukovi\u0107, is a Croatian national, who was born in 1937 and lives in Split. He was represented before the Court by Mr I. Miro\u0161evi\u0107, an advocate practising in Split.", "2. The Croatian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms \u0160. Sta\u017enik.", "3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "4. By decisions of 15 February and 10 November 1983 the Split Municipality (a) declared that four plots of land in Split in the applicant\u2019s possession had been nationalised and become socially-owned already on 8 August 1968 with the entry into force of the Croatia\u2019s Act Designating the Construction Land in Towns and Urban Areas (see paragraphs 23-24 below), and (b) dispossessed the applicant of the land at issue with a view to constructing a block of flats and an elementary school on them.", "5. By a decision of 5 April 1985 the Split Municipality expropriated the house owned by the applicant which was built on one of the plots in question.", "6. On 11 December 1989 the Split Municipality offered the applicant as compensation permanent usage (trajno kori\u0161tenje) of another plot of land for the construction of a house. The applicant refused the offer and instituted non-contentious proceedings with the Split Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Splitu) with a view to obtaining compensation for his nationalised and expropriated property under the 1978 Expropriation Act.", "7. On 18 February 1994 the new Expropriation Act (hereafter \u201cthe 1994 Expropriation Act\u201d, see paragraph 26 below) entered into force. Shortly afterwards, the case was transferred to the administrative authorities, in particular to the regional office of the state administration in the Split-Dalmatia County (Ured dr\u017eavne uprave u Splitsko-dalmatinskoj \u017eupaniji, hereinafter \u201cthe County Office\u201d).", "8. On 17 September 1995 the tax authorities carried out an onsite inspection of the nationalised land and assessed its value at 3,302,604.77 Croatian kunas (HRK).", "9. On 23 May 1996 the applicant requested a total amount of HRK 9,430,140 for the land and the house.", "10. On 22 September 2000 the applicant amended his request, asking for HRK 7,446.227.95 in total.", "11. On 23 October 2000 the tax authorities carried out another onsite inspection and assessed the value of the nationalised land at HRK 5,304,992. On 23 April 2001 the tax authorities assessed the value of the expropriated house at HRK 514,009.01.", "12. At the hearing of 6 March 2002 the applicant contested the findings of the tax authorities and undertook to submit proof of the current market value of the appropriated property.", "13. The applicant engaged a court expert, Mr R., to carry out the property valuation. On 3 April 2002 Mr R. drew up a report establishing the market value of the nationalised land at HRK 7,338,715.80. The applicant submitted the report to the County Office on 19 April 2002.", "14. On 12 October 2003 the applicant increased his request for compensation, arguing that the value of the nationalised land had meanwhile risen to HRK 10,361,736. He relied on the rise of land prices in 2002 and 2003 caused by the construction of the Split ring-road.", "15. By a decision of 23 June 2004 the County Office awarded the applicant compensation in the overall amount of HRK 8,344,393.72. Specifically, it relied on Mr R.\u2019s expert opinion of 19 April 2002 (see paragraph 13 above) and awarded HRK 7,338,715.80 for the nationalised land. It further awarded HRK 514,009.01 for the expropriated house, relying on valuation by the tax authorities of 23 April 2001. Lastly, it awarded HRK 491,668.91 for the construction improvements and agricultural crops, relying on an older valuation by the tax authorities. The relevant part of that decision reads as follows:", "\u201cThe market value is the price which an immovable property can obtain on the market, dependent on supply and demand at the time of its determination.", "According to the ... valuation by the tax authorities of 1995, the immovable property\u2019s value is HRK 368 per square metre ... according to the 2000 valuation, it is HRK 616 per square metre.", "According to the valuation submitted by [the applicant], carried out by the court expert for civil engineering and property valuation, Mr. R., in 2002, the immovable property\u2019s value is EUR 100 per square metre (HRK 741).", "As the valuation of the court expert Mr. R. is newer and does not significantly differ from the valuation [by the tax authorities] ... there were no reasons for dismissing the [Mr R.\u2019s] valuation as it represents the price of construction land in that location.\u201d", "16. The applicant lodged an appeal against the above decision before the Ministry of Justice (Ministarstvo pravosu\u0111a Republike Hrvatske, hereinafter \u201cthe Ministry\u201d), arguing, inter alia, that under section 33 of the 1994 Expropriation Act (see paragraph 26 below) the compensation should have been calculated on the basis of the market value at the time when the decision on compensation was adopted. He submitted a number of items of evidence, such as newspaper articles and decisions on compensation in other cases, pointing out that the market value had risen during 2002 and 2003.", "17. On 31 May 2005 the Ministry dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal in the part concerning the compensation for the nationalised land. At the same time it quashed the first-instance decision in the remaining part (including the compensation for the expropriated house) and remitted the case. The relevant part of that decision reads as follows:", "\u201cThe level of compensation for the undeveloped construction land [the applicant] was dispossessed of was correctly determined. The first-instance authority accepted the expert opinion of Mr R. of 3 April 2002, and not the earlier valuations by the tax authorities ...", "The argument raised in the appeal ... that the compensation was set ... too low is unfounded.", "Namely, in proceedings involving dispossession compensation is fixed by applying provisions of the Expropriation Act on market value compensation. However, [in such cases] the market value compensation must be determined with regard to the state of the immovable property and the modes of its usage at the time of deprivation. [The applicant\u2019s data on the higher price of construction land] concern construction land with the entire necessary infrastructure, whereas the land in question did not have the entire infrastructure at the time of deprivation [i.e. dispossession in 1983]. Therefore, the current market value of the land in the same [location] in Split (Pujanke) cannot be used for comparison, as the state of immovable property in question in 1983 and today differs significantly in terms of infrastructure. In addition, the construction of roads and the ring-road in 2003 and 2004 contributed significantly to the rise of the price of construction land, but has no significance for the level of compensation correctly established in 2002. Therefore, the expert opinion cannot be deemed too old with regard to the date of the adoption of the first-instance decision... as it sets the price in euros as well ...", "However, [the applicant\u2019s] appeal is well-founded in part concerning the compensation for the house, the construction improvements and the agricultural crops. ... [Valuations] by the tax authorities [in respect of that property] do not include any reasoning and it is unclear on the basis of which criteria this part of the compensation has been determined.", "Therefore, such findings cannot serve as a starting point for fixing the compensation for that property ...\u201d", "18. The applicant then brought an action for judicial review in the Split County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Splitu) against the Ministry\u2019s decision, maintaining that the amount of compensation for the nationalised land had not been established in accordance with the relevant legislation (see paragraph 16 above). He requested HRK 11,199,192 for the land in question.", "19. By a judgment of 26 March 2007 the Split County Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s action, endorsing the reasoning given by the Ministry. The relevant part of that judgment reads as follows:", "\u201cIt is undisputed that in the present case the compensation for the immovable property ... the plaintiff was dispossessed of must be determined in accordance with [section 46 of the 1994 Expropriation Act] given that he was dispossessed of [that] property by the final decisions ... of the Split Municipality of 15 February and 10 November 1983 and because ... a final decision on compensation has not been rendered [before the entry into force of the 1994 Expropriation Act].", "When compensation ... is being determined by applying section 46 of the [1994] Expropriation Act it must be fixed with regard to the state of the immovable property and the modes of its usage at the time of deprivation and the market value [of such property] ... at the time the compensation was being determined (section 33 of the [1994] Expropriation Act).", "...", "In determining level of compensation the administrative authorities assessed all the relevant circumstances, in particular the state of the immovable property at the time of deprivation (construction land without any infrastructure) [and] market supply and demand of the land of the same or similar characteristics ... at the time of assessing its value. ...", "[Therefore,] by fixing the compensation for the immovable property the plaintiff had been dispossessed of at HRK 7,338,715.80 the first- and the second-instance administrative authority correctly applied section 33 of the [1994] Expropriation Act.\u201d", "20. The applicant then lodged an appeal on points of law (revizija) with the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) against that judgment, reiterating his previous arguments.", "21. By a judgment of 29 April 2008 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law, endorsing the reasoning of the Split County Court and the Ministry. The relevant part of that judgment reads as follows:", "\u201cAs regards the plaintiff\u2019s arguments that the compensation was not determined in accordance with the market value [of the land] at the time of adoption of the first-instance decision ... the County Court was correct to agree with the findings of the first- and the second-instance [administrative authority] whereby those arguments had been dismissed as unfounded.", "In so doing sufficient reasons were given, the evidence submitted by the plaintiff was examined and it was established that the data submitted [by the plaintiff] concern the immovable property which significantly differ (in terms of infrastructure) from that he had been dispossessed of. For that reason it was not possible to compare the state and the current market value of that immovable property with the state of the immovable property the plaintiff had been dispossessed of in 1983.\u201d", "22. By a decision of 29 September 2011 the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) dismissed the applicant\u2019s subsequent constitutional complaint.", "1.
