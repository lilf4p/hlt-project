The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Leskovac.", "6. On 5 September 1994 the Leskovac Municipal Court (\u201cthe Municipal Court\u201d) ordered the Leskovac branch of the \u201cJIK\u201d Bank (\u201cthe debtor\u201d), a predominantly socially-owned bank, to reinstate the applicant and to pay her outstanding salary and all work-related benefits for the period following her unlawful dismissal. That judgment became final on 1 September 1995.", "7. On an unspecified date, the applicant filed a request for the enforcement of the above judgment. On 17 October 1995 the Municipal Court issued a writ of execution (re\u0161enje o izvr\u0161enju).", "8. On 19 December 1995 the applicant was reinstated. However, as the debtor refused to pay the outstanding judgment debt, the applicant, on an unspecified date, filed a new request for the enforcement.", "9. On 18 November 1997, on the basis of a financial expert\u2019s analysis, the Municipal Court ordered the enforcement by debtor account transfer in the total amount of 72,076.55 Yugoslav dinars (YUM) in respect of salary arrears and all work-related benefits, for the period from 1 May 1992 until 31 December 1995, together with statutory interest and YUM 550 for legal costs.", "10. On 29 September 1999 the applicant requested the court to change the means of enforcement as it appeared that there were no funds in the debtor\u2019s account. On 1 October 1999 the Municipal Court ordered the enforcement by auctioning of the debtor\u2019s specified movable assets.", "11. On 26 July 2000 the applicant obtained a pledge (zalog) over certain movable assets which were seized from the debtor (two vehicles and some technical equipment).", "12.

On several occasions thereafter, the applicant petitioned the court to continue with the enforcement and to schedule a public auction for the sale of the pledged assets, arguing that their value was decreasing due to the passage of time and that she had to bear the maintenance costs. On 15 January 2002 she submitted the same request to the liquidation administrator (likvidacioni upravnik).", "15. The Municipal Court held two hearings concerning the applicant\u2019s requests, on 10 December 2003 and 30 October 2005, but it would appear that no decision was issued.", "16.
