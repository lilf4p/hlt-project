The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Oradea. He has been a lawyer since 1997.", "6. On 11 December 2008 the National Anticorruption Department instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant and a police officer for traffic of influence (trafic de influen\u0163\u0103). The applicant was accused, as a lawyer, of having requested and received money from a client in return for persuading certain judges, other than in the context of the judicial proceedings, to adopt a favourable judgment in his client\u2019s case.", "7. On the same day the case prosecutor authorised several police officers to enforce a warrant to appear (mandat de aducere) issued in the applicant\u2019s name on the basis of Articles 183 and 184 of the Criminal Procedure Code. According to the warrant, the applicant\u2019s presence was required in order to be heard as a suspect (\u00eenvinuit) in the criminal investigation instituted in File no. 206/P/2008. No other reasons or conditions were stated on the authorisation or the warrant itself.", "8. On 12 December 2008 at 8 a.m. a police officer went to the applicant\u2019s office in the city of Oradea to enforce the warrant to appear. According to the police officer\u2019s report, the applicant was shown the warrant to appear and was escorted to the police station in the nearby town of Salonta. At 9.40 a.m. the applicant was handed over to two other police officers who escorted him to the Timi\u015foara office of the National Anticorruption Department (T.N.A.D.).

On 13 December 2008 the prosecutor\u2019s request for the placement of the applicant in pre-trial detention for thirty days was allowed by the Timi\u015foara Court of Appeal. The applicant complained before the court that he had been unlawfully deprived of his liberty from 8 a.m. to 5.10 p.m. on the previous day. He requested that the above-mentioned period be deducted from his time in custody. The court considered that it was not competent to decide on this complaint and suggested that the applicant should have used the procedure provided by Article 1401 of the Criminal Procedure Code.", "13. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law (recurs) against that judgment, reiterating that he had been unlawfully deprived of his liberty.
