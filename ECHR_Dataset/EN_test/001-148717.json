Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.", "3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "4. In 1999 the applicant bought a desktop computer from a private company F. He subsequently brought proceedings claiming that he had been misled about the technical characteristics of the hardware, that he had not been provided with a user manual, that the seller had failed to comply with consumer protection legislation and that the warranty was partly void.", "5. On 26 October 1999 the Sverdlovskiy District Court of Perm (\u201cthe District Court\u201d) issued a summary judgment in the applicant\u2019s favour annulled the sale and ordered payment of damages. However, on 19 October 2000 the judgment was set aside on appeal by the Perm Regional Court (\u201cthe Regional Court\u201d) and the case was sent back for reconsideration.", "6. In order to secure enforcement of the future judgment the applicant requested the District Court to apply interim measures, namely the attachment of the hardware in the defendant\u2019s possession and an order for the defendant to deposit the amount of the damages claimed or, alternatively, the attachment of property in the same amount.", "7. On 11 March 2001 the District Court granted the applicant\u2019s request in part and ordered the attachment of the hardware in the defendant\u2019s possession. The other requested measures were refused in view of the defendant\u2019s solvency and active participation in the proceedings. The applicant did not appeal.", "8. On 5 February 2002 the District Court gave a new judgment allowing the applicant\u2019s claims in part concerning the warranty on the hardware and dismissing all the other claims. On 11 June 2002 the Regional Court set aside the judgment in part and required that the remaining claims be reconsidered.", "9. In a summary judgment of 19 December 2002 the District Court awarded the applicant 357,319 Russian roubles (RUB) (10,900 euros (EUR)) in damages and ordered the defendant to replace the original desktop computer.", "10. On 30 April 2003 the Bailiffs\u2019 Service at the request of the applicant initiated enforcement proceedings against the debtor company F.", "11. In view of the apparent lack of progress in the enforcement proceedings, in 2004 the applicant lodged a new action seeking annulment of the sale and recovery of damages. On 15 June 2004 the District Court in a summary judgment granted his claims, annulled the sale and awarded the applicant an additional RUB 265,879 (EUR 8,100) in damages.", "12. On 20 May and 8 October 2004 the competent authorities refused to open criminal proceedings against the debtor company for its failure to comply with the judgment. The decision of 8 October 2004 was upheld at last instance by the Regional Court on 8 February 2005.", "13. Discontent with the lack of progress in the enforcement of the judgment of 19 December 2002, the applicant requested that the bailiff\u2019s actions and inaction be recognised as unlawful. On 10 November 2004 the District Court found that the enforcement proceedings were indeed tainted by unjustified delays and inaction and the bailiff\u2019s inaction was ruled unlawful.", "14. In 2005 the applicant also brought proceedings against the regional Judicial Department seeking damages for the allegedly unlawful refusal of the District Court judge to apply the requested interim measures to secure enforcement of the judgment (see paragraphs 6-7 above).", "15. On 5 September 2005 the District Court dismissed the complaint without consideration on the ground that it lacked legal basis. The dismissal was upheld on appeal by the Regional Court on 4 October 2005.", "16. In 2007 the applicant attempted to initiate civil proceedings against the Treasury of the Russian Federation and the regional Bailiffs\u2019 Service for the failure to enforce the judgment in his favour. On 3 May 2007 the proceedings were adjourned by the District Court owing to the applicant\u2019s failure to formulate his claims against all of the defendants and to provide their postal addresses. The applicant was given time to correct these defects. On 12 July 2007 the Regional Court upheld the adjournment on appeal. It appears that the applicant has never corrected the defects indicated by the domestic courts and that the proceedings have remained adjourned.", "17. The basic principles regarding compensation for damage caused by public authorities and their officials are enshrined in the Constitution of the Russian Federation of 1993. In Article 53 the Constitution provides that everyone is entitled to compensation for damage caused by unlawful actions (or inaction) of State bodies and their officials.

However the Ruling clarified that the term \u201cadministration of justice\u201d applied only to judicial decisions on the merits of the case, while procedural rulings fell outside its scope. State liability for damage caused, unlawful procedural acts or failure to act could arise even in the absence of a final criminal conviction of a judge, if the fault of the judge had been established in civil proceedings.", "28. Both the Supreme Court and the Supreme Commercial Court of the Russian Federation (which until unification of the courts in 2014 was the highest court for commercial disputes) have issued case-law reviews and guidelines clarifying various procedural and substantive aspects of the right to receive compensation under Article 1069 of the Civil Code as established in the practice of the Russian courts.
