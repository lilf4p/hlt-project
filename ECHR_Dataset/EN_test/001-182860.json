The background facts relating to the planning, conduct and dispersal of the demonstration at Bolotnaya Square are set out in more detail in Frumkin v. Russia (no. 74568/12, \u00a7\u00a7 7-65, 5 January 2016), and Yaroslav Belousov v. Russia (nos. 2653/13 and 60980/14, \u00a7\u00a7 7-33, 4 October 2016). The parties\u2019 submissions on the circumstances directly relevant to the present case are set out below.", "7. On 6 May 2012 a public demonstration entitled the \u201cMarch of Millions\u201d was held in central Moscow to protest against the allegedly rigged presidential elections. The event had been approved by the city authorities in the form of a march followed by a meeting at Bolotnaya Square which was supposed to end at 7.30 p.m. The march was peaceful and held without any disruptions, but when the marchers arrived at Bolotnaya Square it transpired that barriers installed by the police had narrowed the entrance to the meeting venue, allegedly restricting the space allocated for the meeting. To control the crowd, a police cordon forced the protestors to remain within the barriers, and there were numerous clashes between the police and protesters. At 5.30 p.m. the police ordered that the meeting finish early and began to disperse the participants. It took them about two hours to clear the protestors from the square.", "8. On the same day the Moscow city department of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation opened criminal proceedings to investigate suspected acts of mass disorder and violence against the police (Articles 212 \u00a7 2 and 318 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code). On 18 May 2012 the file was transferred to the headquarters of the Investigative Committee for further investigation. On 28 May 2012 an investigation was also launched into the criminal offence of organising acts of mass disorder (Article 212 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code). The two criminal cases were joined on the same day.", "9. At the time of the events the applicant was a first-year student at the faculty of culture studies of the State Academic University for the Humanities. On 6 May 2012 he took part in the demonstration at Bolotnaya Square. According to him, he was beaten up by the police as they were dispersing the demonstration.", "10. At 4 a.m. on 7 May 2012 the applicant was admitted to the emergency ward of Sklifosovskiy hospital where he was examined by a trauma doctor and a neurosurgeon. The examination revealed multiple bruises on the applicant\u2019s chest, spine, shoulders, knees and head.", "11. After the events of 6 May 2012 the applicant continued to live at his usual address and pursue his studies. On 9 June 2012 he was arrested on suspicion of having participated in acts of mass disorder and of using violence against the police during the demonstration of 6 May 2012. On the same day the Basmannyy District Court of Moscow ordered the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention until 9 August 2012. It referred to the gravity of the charges and information about the applicant\u2019s personality. The District Court noted, in particular, that the applicant\u2019s father was a Ukrainian national living in Ukraine, and that the applicant might therefore flee to avoid the investigation and trial. It concluded that those circumstances gave sufficient reasons to believe that the applicant, if he were at liberty, was likely to continue his criminal activity, influence witnesses, destroy evidence or otherwise obstruct the investigation of the criminal case, which was at an initial stage.", "12. On 18 June 2012 charges were brought against the applicant under Articles 212 \u00a7 2 (participation in acts of mass disorder accompanied by violence) and 318 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code (use of violence against a public official). He was accused, in particular, of having torn a protection helmet off a police officer\u2019s head.", "13. On 11 July 2012 the Moscow City Court upheld the detention order of 9 June 2012.", "14. On 7 August 2012 the Basmannyy District Court of Moscow examined an investigator\u2019s request for an extension of the applicant\u2019s pretrial detention. The applicant requested that an alternative preventive measure be applied pending trial, such as house arrest or a written undertaking not to leave a specified place. On the same day the District Court found that the circumstances that had justified the detention order had not changed and extended the applicant\u2019s detention until 6 November 2012. On 5 September 2012 the Moscow City Court upheld that decision.", "15. On 2 November 2012 the Basmannyy District Court authorised a further extension of the applicant\u2019s detention until 6 March 2013. It reiterated the grounds given in the previous extension orders and stated that the circumstances justifying the detention order had not changed. On 3 December 2012 the Moscow City Court upheld that decision.", "16. On 21 November 2012 the charges against the applicant were reformulated. It was additionally stated that the applicant had shouted insulting slogans and used metal barriers to obstruct the police; that at least three times he had thrown stones and pieces of tarmac at police officers and had once punched a policeman; and that he had also grabbed a police officer\u2019s uniform and had snatched a protection helmet from his hands.", "17. On 29 November 2012 Police Officer P. identified the applicant during an identification parade as a participant in the mass disorder and the person who had twice thrown pieces of tarmac at the police and tried to snatch the protection helmet from a policeman\u2019s hands. He specified that he had not seen whether the applicant had in fact succeeded in snatching the helmet or not.", "18. On 7 December 2012 the investigator of the Zamoskvoretskiy Interdistrict Investigation Committee of Moscow refused to open a criminal case into allegations made by the applicant that he had been subjected to illtreatment by the police during his arrest. The investigator considered that the use of force by the police had been justified by the behaviour of the protesters, including the applicant, who had actively resisted their arrest and thrown various objects at the police officers.", "19. On 27 February 2013 the Basmannyy District Court granted an extension of the applicant\u2019s detention until 9 June 2013, essentially on the same grounds as earlier, noting that the applicant\u2019s state of health was satisfactory and did not warrant his release. That decision was upheld by the Moscow City Court on 27 March 2013.", "20. On 22 April 2013 the Moscow City Court authorised a further extension of the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention until 6 July 2013. The court noted that even though the applicant and his lawyer had already finished reading the case file, other defendants had not. It reiterated the grounds given in the previous extension orders and stated that the circumstances justifying the detention order had not changed.", "21. On 24 May 2013 the applicant\u2019s criminal case was transferred to the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow for the determination of criminal charges.", "22. On 6 June 2013 that court granted another extension of the applicant\u2019s detention until 24 November 2013. The decision concerned eleven defendants. Along with the gravity of the charges, the court based its decision on the findings that \u201cthe reasons which initially warranted the detention have not changed\u201d and that \u201cno other measures of restraint would secure the aims and goals of the judicial proceedings\u201d. The Moscow City Court upheld that extension order on 2 July 2013.", "23. On 19 November 2013 the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court examined an investigator\u2019s request for an extension of detention in respect of nine defendants, including the applicant. The applicant presented a personal guarantee from a member of the State Duma in support of an undertaking by him to appear before the investigating authorities and the courts for the examination of his case. However, the District Court did not consider that guarantee and ordered that the applicant and his co-defendants be detained until 24 February 2014 on the grounds of gravity of the charges and the nature of the offences imputable to them. On 17 December 2013 the Moscow City Court upheld that extension order.", "24. From 20 June 2012 until his conviction the applicant was held in remand prison IZ-77/5 in Moscow.

According to the applicant, prison cell no. 403 measured approximately 7 by 5 metres and housed ten inmates, including himself.

As regards the conditions of detention in the holding room of the Moscow City Court, the applicant submitted that the room had been poorly lit and that access to a toilet had been limited to once an hour. In addition, he had been required to strip naked and to perform sit-ups during the body search conducted in the holding room.", "31. The court proceedings began on 6 June 2013 in hearing room no. 338 at the Moscow City Court, moving at the end of July 2013 to hearing room no. 635. The defendants, including the applicant, were held in glass cabins in both hearing rooms. From mid-September 2013 to the end of 2013 the hearings continued in hearing room no. 303 at the Nikulinskiy District Court of Moscow. In January and February 2014 they took place in hearing room no. 410 at the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court.
