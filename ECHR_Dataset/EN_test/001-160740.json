The applicant, Mr Aleksandr Iosifovich Nagorskiy, is a Ukrainian national who was born in 1967. He is represented before the Court by Mr A. Fedosov, a lawyer practising in Strasbourg.", "2. The Ukrainian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, most recently Mr B. Babin, of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine.", "3. On 3 August 2010 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of a number of criminal offences.", "4. On 6 August 2010 the Obolosnky District Court of Kyiv remanded him in custody: this detention was further extended on a number of occasions.", "5. On 16 July 2013 the Obolonsky District Court of Kyiv found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to ten years\u2019 imprisonment. In the operative part of its judgment the court also ruled that the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention should be continued as a preventive measure pending the entry of that judgment into force. It further noted that the judgment could be challenged on appeal within fifteen days of the date of its pronouncement.", "6. On 12 May 2014 the above judgement was quashed on appeal, and the case was remitted to the investigative authorities for additional investigation.", "7. No information was submitted by the parties as to the further course of the proceedings.", "8. On an unspecified date between July and October 2014 the applicant was granted an amnesty and released.", "9. On 8 May 2014 the applicant was escorted from the Kyiv Pre-trial Detention Centre (\u201cthe SIZO\u201d) to the Shevchenkivsky District Court, Kyiv, for a hearing regarding the lawfulness of his detention. The hearing lasted about fifteen minutes and was further adjourned until 12 May 2014.", "10. After the closure of the hearing, the applicant, his co-accused and some others attending the hearing remained in the courtroom demanding that the judge rule that the applicant should be released immediately. One hour later, at about 4.30 p.m., officers of the \u201cGryfon\u201d (police special unit ensuring legal order on the court premises) arrived in the courtroom, having been summoned by the judge. Twelve officers split up into two groups: the first group held the applicant stretched out and started beating him with handcuffs and truncheons; the second group formed a human chain so that others in the room would not be able to see what was going on in the defendant\u2019s cage. As a result, the applicant sustained serious bodily injuries, including several wounds to his head. Somebody called an ambulance but a chief officer prevented the applicant from being taken to hospital and he was transferred back to the SIZO. No medical assistance was provided in the SIZO until 9 p.m., when following pressure from the media the applicant was transferred to the Emergency Care Hospital (\u201cthe Hospital\u201d) and received medical treatment.", "11. Dissatisfied with the adjournment of the hearing, the applicant, his co-accused and several others present demanded the applicant\u2019s immediate release and refused to comply with the escorting officers\u2019 request to leave the courtroom. The presiding judge called the police special unit to ensure order on the premises. The applicant continued to resist police officers and was therefore forcefully escorted out of the courtroom. As a result, he sustained bodily injuries. Upon return to the SIZO, the applicant was examined at the medical unit and was then transferred to the Hospital, where he was provided with the requisite medical assistance.", "12. On 8 May 2014 Mrs K. notified the police of the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment in the courtroom by unidentified police officers. On the same day, the relevant information was entered in the \u201cIntegrated Register of pre-trial investigations\u201d and criminal proceedings were commenced on suspicion of excess of powers by \u201cGryfon\u201d officers. Mrs K. was questioned and the courtroom was examined by the police. According to the police report, dark red drops which looked like blood were found on the floor next to the hearing room and in the defendant\u2019s cage. According to Mrs K., she arrived to the courtroom once she became aware that a \u201cGryfon\u201d officer had hit the applicant on the head with a rubber truncheon. Upon arrival, she saw that there was blood all over the courtroom.", "13. On 22 May 2014 the Kyiv Prosecutor\u2019s Office took over the proceedings.", "14. On 23 May 2014 Mrs B. was questioned as a witness. She stated that about ten or fifteen \u201cGryfon\u201d officers, equipped with handcuffs and truncheons, had entered the courtroom after the hearing was over. They had formed a human chain and separated the applicant from the other people in the room. A \u201cGryfon\u201d officer then went into the defendant\u2019s metal cage and started pulling the applicant by the arm. A few seconds later there was blood on the applicant\u2019s face. Mrs B. did not see who injured the applicant or how it happened, but noted that the latter did not resist the officers. At the same time, she saw \u201cGryfon\u201d officers twisting the applicant\u2019s hands forcefully while trying to handcuff him.", "15. On 17 June 2014 Mrs N. and Mr G. were questioned as witnesses. Mrs N. stated that she was not present at the hearing but was told by Mrs B. that the conflict arose because of the applicant\u2019s refusal to leave the courtroom. Mr G., who had been present at the hearing when \u201cGryfon\u201d arrived, stated that the applicant was not kicked or punched. Instead, he saw some officers, standing outside the metal cage, twisting the applicant\u2019s arms. As a result, the applicant hit his head on the metal cage and fell down. Then up to eight officers entered the cage and dragged the applicant out of the courtroom. According to Mr G., the officers did not identify themselves when they arrived and did not ask anybody to leave the premises.", "16. On 24 June 2014 the applicant was questioned as a victim. According to him, \u201cGryfon\u201d officers appeared in the courtroom wearing bulletproof vests and neck and face coverings which rendered their identification impossible. One of them, accompanied by an officer from the escorting unit, approached the applicant from the opposite side of the cage, pulled the applicant\u2019s hands forward and twisted his arms. \u201cGryfon\u201d officers then entered the cage and started beating him in the face with truncheons and dragging him in different directions. As a result, the applicant hit his face on the cage bars. He was also kicked in the head by the \u201cGryfon\u201d chief officer. Once the applicant started bleeding, he was stretched out on the floor, handcuffed and dragged out of the courtroom. On the way down, on the third floor, his head was intentionally banged against a metal case and he lost consciousness. According to the applicant, it was the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation that had ordered \u201cGryfon\u201d to kill him.", "17. On the same day, a forensic medical examination of the applicant was ordered.", "18. On 14 October 2014 a forensic medical examination report was issued. On the basis of the documents provided by the investigator, the expert stated that the applicant had sustained a contused head wound and numerous abrasions on the face and the left hand. The expert opined that those injuries had been caused by blunt objects; as to their date, it could not be excluded that they had been inflicted on 8 May 2014. The injuries were classified as minor. The expert further found no clinical evidence that the applicant had sustained concussion. He noted in this respect that no pathology was evident from the description of the applicant\u2019s neurological state during his first and subsequent medical examinations. Likewise, there was no description of any radial nerve disorder in the file. The expert observed that some changes revealed during the head and spine X-ray examination indicated the progress of the applicant\u2019s chronic diseases, either of which, taken separately or together with others, could present neurological signs similar to those which would appear with concussion.", "19. On 28 November 2014 the Kyiv Prosecutor\u2019s Office terminated the criminal proceedings. The relevant resolution referred to the results of the above forensic medical examination and gave details of the testimonies of the applicant and those of Mr G., Mrs B. and \u201cGryfon\u201d officers, questioned as witnesses. According to the \u201cGryfon\u201d officers, they had had no means of restraint during the operation and had used no force on the applicant. They stated that the applicant\u2019s injuries could have been self-inflicted when he resisted being escorted from the court. The resolution further referred to the provisions of the Criminal Code, according to which abuse of powers was criminally punishable only if the damage caused was in money terms at least 100 times greater than the citizen\u2019s tax-exempt minimum income. It noted that the case file contained no evidence that the applicant had sustained such damage. The prosecutor finally concluded that no proof of abuse of powers by \u201cGryfon\u201d officers was obtained during the investigation. It was noted that the resolution could be challenged within ten days of the date of its receipt. The resolution has not been appealed against by Mrs K. or the applicant.", "20. On unspecified dates Mrs B. lodged a number of complaints with different State authorities, including MPs, about the events of 8 May 2014.", "21. On 26 June 2014 the Kyiv Main Police Department, having completed their internal inquiry in respect of some of Mrs B.\u2019s complaints, found no misconduct by \u201cGryfon\u201d officers. According to the internal inquiry report, on 8 May 2014 the police special unit arrived at the courtroom as Mrs B. and others attending the hearing were refusing to leave; they impeded the applicant\u2019s being escorted out of the court premises. The officers identified themselves and demanded that the public cease offering resistance and leave the premises. As they did not comply, some of the \u201cGryfon\u201d officers and the escorting officers formed a human chain and pushed the members of the public back, allowing other officers to take the applicant out of the courtroom. The applicant behaved inappropriately, uttering obscenities and hanging on to the metal bars of the cage. As a result, he injured his arm. According to the report, no force or special means of restraint was used.", "22. On 8 March 2010 the applicant was admitted to the SIZO. On admission he underwent a medical examination, including an X-ray, and his medical file was studied.

He underwent an electrocardiogram and head X-ray and was diagnosed with a contused head wound, numerous bruises, abrasions on the head and left hand, and a number of other conditions he had previously been diagnosed with.
