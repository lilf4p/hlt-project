The applicants each owned a share in respective plots of land in the area of Firuzk\u00f6y, in the district of Avc\u0131lar, Istanbul.", "7. On 24 December 1987, a new zoning plan was put into force in the area of Firuzk\u00f6y, which encompassed the applicants\u2019 plots of land. Under the new plan, the plots of land were designated as \u201cuniversity area\u201d. Subsequently, in 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1991, annotations (\u015ferhler) were made in the land registry records indicating that the applicants\u2019 land would be expropriated by Istanbul University (hereinafter \u201cthe University\u201d).", "8. On 26 March 1998 the applicants both asked the University to either expropriate the disputed land or to remove the annotations from the land registry records.

In its respective judgments, the first-instance court held in particular that the land at issue had been under the effective control of the University and that access to the land was restricted due to the fences that had been built around the land.", "11. On 22 June 2004 the Fifth Civil Division of the Court of Cassation quashed the judgments of the K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck\u00e7ekmece Civil Court of First Instance, holding that the land in question had not been controlled or used effectively by the University.", "12. On 24 September 2004 both applicants requested the rectification of the respective decisions dated 22 June 2004. In their petitions, they drew the attention of the Fifth Civil Division of the Court of Cassation to its previous decisions, dated 28 September 1999 and 31 March 2003, in which it had held that neighbouring plots of land in the same area had been de facto expropriated by the University because the latter had built fences around the land and because of the annotations made in the land registry records.", "13. On 12 April 2005 the Fifth Civil Division of the Court of Cassation rejected the applicants\u2019 requests for rectification of the decisions of 22 June 2004.

On 27 March 2006 and 4 April 2006 respectively, the Fifth Civil Division of the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeals. In its decisions, it gave no reply to the applicants\u2019 arguments regarding the fact that it had given contradictory judgments in respect of similar cases.", "17. The applicants\u2019 requests for the rectification of the decisions were furthermore rejected and the judgments became final on 28 September 2006 and 3 October 2006 respectively.", "18.
