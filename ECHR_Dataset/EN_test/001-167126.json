On 3 November 2011 the public prosecutor requested that the Skopje Court of First Instance (\u201cthe trial court\u201d) launched preliminary proceedings against F.T. (seventeen-year old at the time) on account of aggravated robbery and remanded him in custody. On the same date, the trial court ordered F.T.\u2019s detention for fifteen days.

By a decision of 17 November 2011, an investigating judge of the trial court extended F.T.\u2019s detention for fifteen days for the same reasons as before. On 1 December 2011 the investigating judge ordered his release finding that \u201chis attendance at the trial can be secured with a more lenient measure (seizure of passport and obligation to report to the court) ... Taking into account the individual circumstances and needs of [F.T.], his age, the fact that he is a regular student in third year of secondary school and a young man in development, [the court] considers that there are grounds for termination of the detention order ...\u201d", "8. On 13 January 2012 the public prosecutor lodged an indictment against F.T. and a certain S.G.

On 7 June 2012 the Skopje Court of First Instance, after it had heard evidence from the accused, the applicants, witnesses, experts, representatives of a Social Welfare Centre (who suggested that F.T. should be sentenced to a prison term if he was found guilty), and admitted considerable material evidence, including several expert reports (including a psychiatric expert report which confirmed that F.T. had been mentally fit when the crime had been committed) established the following:", "\u201cAt 1.30 a.m. on 25 October 2011 the accused S.G. and F.T., on the basis of a prior agreement, arrived [at the applicants\u2019 house] with an intention to steal movable objects.

They were kept in hospital, since their injuries were life-threatening ...\u201d", "10. As stated in the judgment, \u201c[the second applicant] was not able to recognise her parents given their injuries. Her mother was so much beaten that she could not see; her eyes were closed and her face was so much coloured (\u043c\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e) that she could not recognise her.\u201d", "11. The court found S.G. and F.T. guilty of aggravated robbery and, relying on Article 237(4) in relation to sub-paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 16 below), sentenced them to six and five years\u2019 imprisonment respectively.

By judgments of 26 November 2012 and 12 March 2013, the Skopje Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, respectively, dismissed F.T.\u2019s complaints about alleged errors on the facts and law, as well as alleged violations of the procedural rules. Both courts upheld the lower court\u2019s judgment finding no grounds to depart from the facts as established by the trial court and the reasons given for the conviction.", "13. On 2 January 2013 an enforcement judge responsible for execution of the custodial sentence issued an incarceration order (\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043d \u0430\u043a\u0442) in respect of F.T. According to that order, F.T. was required to report to Ohrid Detention Centre on 30 January 2013 in order to serve the sentence. On 17 January 2013 F.T. requested that the sentence be postponed for family and health reasons. This request was dismissed by decisions of 21 January and 12 February 2013 by the enforcement judge and a three-judge panel of the trial court, respectively. On 21 February 2013 the detention centre informed the enforcement judge that F.T. had not arrived at the facility on the specified date. By letters dated 28 February, 8 April and 20 May 2013, the enforcement judge notified the trial court in Skopje responsible for minors about F.T.\u2019s failure to report to the detention facility and sought instructions \u201cgiven the urgent nature of the proceedings\u201d. These letters remained unanswered.", "14. The Government submitted that after the above correspondence, no enforcement judge had been appointed to deal with the case for over eight months. After such a judge had been appointed, on 27 March 2014 another incarceration order had been issued in respect of F.T. The latter sought, to no avail, for the custodial sentence to be adjourned.
