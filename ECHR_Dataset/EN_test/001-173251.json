They live in Orsk in the Orenburg region, Krasnoturinsk in the Sverdlovsk region and Orenburg, respectively.", "6. In May 2006 D. complained to the Department for Combating Organised Crime (the \u201cUBOP\u201d) of the Orenburg regional police department that the applicant was allegedly planning his murder. Kh. and P. \u2012 whom the applicant had allegedly hired to murder D. \u2012 agreed to cooperate with the UBOP and, acting on the latter\u2019s instructions, organised a meeting with the applicant, told him that they had killed D., showed him photographs simulating D.\u2019s death \u2012 which they had prepared as part of the UBOP covert operation \u2012 and asked for payment. After paying them later the same day, the applicant and his father, who had accompanied him, were taken to the UBOP office where they arrived at about 2 a.m. on 17 May 2006.", "7. According to the applicant, he was interviewed at the request of the head of the UBOP, K., until 7.30 a.m. by several operative police officers, including M., G. and O., who demanded that he confess to having ordered D.\u2019s murder. They allegedly subjected him to ill-treatment which the applicant described as follows. They handcuffed him, punched him and subjected him to nearsuffocation by use of a plastic bag put over his head. He fainted several times. They forced his legs apart until he fell and then lifted him by his hands, which were shackled behind his back. They tied him up in a painful position with a belt so that his knees were pressed against his neck, and pulled up his shackled hands. They lifted the applicant up whilst thus tied, and dropped him down onto his coccyx. One of them stepped on his head.", "8. At 7.30 a.m. the applicant was placed in a cell in which he stayed until 3 p.m. He was then again interviewed and signed a document entitled \u201cexplanation\u201d (\u043e\u0431\u044a\u044f\u0441\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435) drawn up by the UBOP operative officer O., in which he gave statements which he later reiterated at his trial.", "9. No record of the applicant\u2019s arrest was drawn up. At 6 p.m. the UBOP officers took the applicant home, carried out a search, and then left.", "10. The next day the applicant was taken by his father to the Pirogov hospital in Orenburg. According to the hospital medical records, the applicant had many bruises on his body, in particular on the head, neck, abdomen and the lumbar region.", "11. On the same day the applicant complained about his ill-treatment to the Leninskiy district police department no. 1 of Orenburg, which ordered a forensic medical examination.", "12. On 18 May 2006 an expert examined the applicant, his medical records, and his allegations of ill-treatment by the UBOP officers the previous day (namely being handcuffed and tied, punched and beaten with a bat), and concluded that bruises and abrasions on the applicant\u2019s body and upper and lower extremities had been inflicted by hard blunt objects at the time, as alleged by him (forensic medical expert report of 19 May 2006).", "13. On 22 May 2006 the applicant was diagnosed with a fractured vertebra and hospitalised. His X-ray examination confirmed fractures of two vertebrae.", "14. On 10 July 2006 the Leninskiy district prosecutor\u2019s office of Orenburg brought criminal proceedings against the applicant in relation to the attempted murder of D. On 12 July 2006 the applicant was arrested.", "15. On 12 and 13 July 2006 the applicant was examined by a forensic medical expert who concluded that, in addition to the injuries noted in the previous report of 19 May 2006, the applicant had a fracture of the seventh thoracic vertebra which resulted in health impairment of medium gravity and had been caused in May 2006 by the impact of a hard blunt object or as a result of hitting such an object with great mechanical force.", "16. According to an additional forensic medical expert opinion of 31 July 2006 produced on the basis of medical records, the fracture of the vertebra could not have resulted from being punched, kicked and beaten with a bat, or as a result of handcuffing, having the legs tied together with a belt, or lifting the applicant up by his hands. It could have resulted from an impact by a traumatic force along the axes of the spine.", "17. On 31 July 2006 an investigator from the Promyshlenniy district prosecutor\u2019s office of Orenburg \u2012 who had carried out a pre-investigation inquiry into the applicant\u2019s allegations of illtreatment by the UBOP officers \u2012 refused to initiate criminal proceedings, relying on statements by the UBOP police officers, in particular G. and O., that on 17 May 2006 the applicant had been arrested on suspicion of having ordered a murder, and had been taken to the UBOP and interviewed, and that no violence had been used against him. The investigator also referred to statements by the applicant\u2019s father and other persons who had been in the UBOP building at the same time as the applicant and had not seen or heard that the applicant had been subjected to ill-treatment. On 26 July 2006 the applicant had been diagnosed as suffering from a mental disorder. The investigator concluded that the applicant could not be trusted, that he had probably received his injuries as a result of hitting himself accidentally against some objects, and that the true circumstances in which he had received the injuries could not be established.", "18. On 14 May 2008 the Promyshlenniy District Court granted an appeal lodged by the applicant against the investigator\u2019s decision. Subsequently, further refusals to open a criminal case followed on 24 July and 4 August 2008 and were annulled as unlawful by the prosecutor\u2019s office.", "19. On 14 October 2008 the Orenburg Regional Court convicted the applicant of the attempted murder of D., sentenced him to five years\u2019 imprisonment and ordered him to pay damages to D. It took into account the fact that the applicant had no criminal record and also had positive references. At the trial the applicant denied his guilt, stating that his sister had been killed in a traffic accident caused by D.\u2019s drunk driving, that D. had unlawfully avoided serving his sentence of imprisonment, that he \u2012 the applicant \u2012 had wished to compel D. to serve his prison sentence by using the services of Kh. and P. \u2013 who had suggested planting drugs on D., inter alia \u2013 and had paid them out of fear for his family\u2019s safety. The applicant\u2019s argument that the crime of which he was accused was the result of police entrapment was dismissed by the court.", "20. On 23 October 2008 an investigator from the investigative committee of the Orenburg regional prosecutor\u2019s office ordered, pursuant to Article 24 \u00a7 1 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, that no criminal case be opened into the applicant\u2019s allegations for lack of the elements of a crime under Articles 285 and 286 of the Criminal Code (on abuse of powers) in the acts of the police officers. The decision relied on the same reasoning as that set out in the initial decision of 31 July 2006, adding that the applicant had recovered from his psychiatric disorder and had been convicted.", "21. On appeal by the applicant, the investigator\u2019s decision was found lawful by the Orenburg Promyshlenniy District Court in a decision of 15 January 2009, which was further upheld by the Orenburg Regional Court on 12 March 2009. The District Court held, in particular, that the fact that the applicant had been detained unlawfully for more than three hours at the UBOP premises was not in itself sufficient to prove that he had been illtreated by the police officers or that he had been deliberately subjected to unlawful detention. In reply to the applicant\u2019s criticism of the investigating authority\u2019s failure to carry out a thorough investigation and, in particular, to examine the room at the UBOP premises in which the applicant had been interviewed and allegedly illtreated, the District Court opined that there would be no sense in examining the UBOP office given the considerable length of time that had passed since the events in question.", "22. On 26 January 2009 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation upheld the applicant\u2019s conviction on appeal.", "23. On 21 May 2015 the acting head of the supervisory department of the Orenburg regional investigative committee annulled the decision of 23 October 2008 for being based on an incomplete inquiry and ordered an additional inquiry and the applicant\u2019s additional forensic medical examination.", "24. On 25 December 2010 between 8.43 a.m. and 11.50 a.m. the police searched the applicant\u2019s flat in Nizhniy Novgorod, pursuant to a decision of the Kanavinskiy District Court on 14 December 2010 concerning criminal proceedings against third persons, in order to find evidence of those persons\u2019 membership of extremist organisations. The police found explosives and bomb-making material. Once the search had been completed, they took the applicant to the Centre for Combating Extremism at the Nizhniy Novgorod regional police department.", "25. Between 4 p.m. and 5.08 p.m. the applicant was questioned as a witness in the criminal proceedings against third persons by investigator A. of the Kanavinskiy district investigative committee, who later stated that at the time of the questioning the applicant had had no injuries on the visible parts of his body.", "26. The investigator ordered that the case concerning the applicant\u2019s illegal possession of arms be transferred to an investigator at police department no. 1 of Nizhniy Novgorod.", "27. The applicant was then interviewed by the head of the Centre for Combating Extremism, T., his deputy K. and three operative police officers of the Centre A., S. and Sh. According to the applicant, they demanded that he confess to preparing a terrorist act and sign a \u201cstatement of surrender and confession\u201d (\u044f\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439). They allegedly subjected him to illtreatment which the applicant described as follows. They beat him up, punching and kicking him. With his hands handcuffed behind his back they bound him with a two-metre-long orange rope, so that his crossed legs were pressed to his torso. They pulled on the rope and lifted the applicant off the floor, subjecting him to near-suffocation as the knots in the rope were pressing against the front of his neck, making it impossible to breath. They then loosened the rope, so that the applicant fell and hit his buttocks on the floor, causing him severe pain. The applicant lost consciousness. At some point two other police officers Ch. and K. joined the others. K. punched the applicant in the face, making his lip bleed. The applicant\u2019s illtreatment lasted until approximately 8 p.m.", "28. At about 9 p.m. the applicant was taken to police station no. 1 of the Nizhniy Novgorod town police department, formally arrested at 11.30 p.m. and questioned as a suspect.", "29. In his report of 25 December 2010 to the head of the Centre for Combating Extremism, T., police officer Sh. stated that physical force had been used in order to apprehend the applicant when he tried to escape. According to subsequent statements made by Sh. and A. to the investigative authority, Sh. had tripped the applicant up in order to prevent his escape and the applicant had fallen over, whereupon Sh. \u201chad used physical force to overcome the applicant\u2019s resistance\u201d and kept the applicant on the ground until the arrival of A. They had then handcuffed the applicant. As a result, the applicant had allegedly received abrasions to the head, face and neck.", "30. After the applicant\u2019s questioning as a suspect he was taken to a temporary detention facility (an \u201cIVS\u201d). The IVS officer on duty saw the applicant\u2019s injuries and refused to admit him without a prior medical examination.", "31. At 2.45 a.m. on 26 December 2010 the police officers took the applicant to town hospital no. 40 in the Avtozavodskoy district of Nizhniy Novgorod, where a doctor recorded contusions and bruises on his face and assessed his condition as not precluding detention.", "32. On the applicant\u2019s arrival at the IVS, the officer on duty examined the upper part of his body above the waist and recorded bruises and abrasions. The applicant stated that his injuries were the result of illtreatment to which he had been subjected by the police officers at the Centre for Combating Extremism from approximately 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. on 25 December 2010. The applicant stated, in particular, in relation to the injuries on the face, that he had an abrasion in the temple area on the right side, a bruise under the right eye, an abrasion on the chin on the right side, and a damaged lip on the left side.", "33. On 27 December 2010 the applicant was detained on remand by a court order and at 11.55 p.m. transferred from the IVS to pre-trial detention facility IZ-52/1 (the \u201cSIZO\u201d), where an on-duty officer and medical assistant recorded the following injuries on his body: a bruise on the right of the abdomen, a bruise in the left axillary region and multiple bruises on the face and neck. The applicant reiterated that he had been illtreated by the police. The incident was reported to the head of the SIZO.", "34. On 25 January 2011 the Kanavinskiy district prosecutor\u2019s office received a communication from the SIZO about the injuries found on the applicant on his admission and forwarded it to the Kanavinskiy district investigation division of the Nizhniy Novgorod regional investigative committee (\u0421\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b \u043f\u043e \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0443 \u0433. \u041d.\u041d\u043e\u0432\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434 \u0421\u0423 \u0421\u041a \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u041d\u0438\u0436\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438). The applicant lodged a complaint with the investigative authorities about his alleged ill-treatment and on 4 February 2011 gave a statement.", "35. According to a forensic medical examination report of 24 February 2011 prepared on the basis of the applicant\u2019s SIZO medical records (and ordered on 11 February 2011 by an investigator who inquired, inter alia, whether the injuries could have been self-inflicted), the applicant\u2019s injuries could be classified as blunt trauma. Although the description of the injuries in the SIZO report made it impossible to determine reliably the date of their infliction, the expert suggested that the bruises on the right part of the abdomen and multiple bruises on the face and neck could have been inflicted within a period of three days prior to the applicant\u2019s examination at the SIZO on 27 December 2010 and the bruise in the left axillary region could have been inflicted more than three days before that examination. The expert noted that the injuries were located on parts of the body within the reach of the applicant\u2019s own hands.", "36. According to an additional forensic medical examination report of 2 September 2011, prepared on the basis of the applicant\u2019s medical documents, the applicant\u2019s injuries could have originated either as a result of being punched and kicked, or as a result of the use of force as alleged by police officers Sh. and A.", "37. According to a report of 23 March 2011, prepared on the basis of an internal inquiry and approved by the head of the internal security division of the Nizhniy Novgorod regional police department, Sh. stated that in order to overcome the applicant\u2019s resistance he had twisted the applicant\u2019s hand behind his back, and that the applicant had received the abrasions to the head and face as a result of falling over. The other four police officers who had interviewed the applicant had given similar statements. The report suggested that the question of the police officers\u2019 responsibility for the applicant\u2019s illtreatment could only be decided by the investigative committee pursuant to a pre-investigation inquiry.", "38. The Kanavinskiy district investigative committee issued six refusals to institute criminal proceedings concerning the applicant\u2019s alleged illtreatment (on 28 February, 8 April, 19 August, and 5 September 2011, 22 February and 1 July 2012). The first five decisions were revoked by the deputy head of the Kanavinskiy district investigative committee or the Kanavinskiy district deputy prosecutor for being based on an incomplete inquiry (decisions of 10 March, 20 July and 22 August 2011, 30 January and 22 June 2012).", "39. On 15 June 2011 the Avtozavodskoy District Court of Nizhniy Novgorod convicted the applicant of illegal storage of explosives under Article 222 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code. On 18 November 2011 the Nizhegorodskiy Regional Court upheld the judgment on appeal.", "40. In the decision refusing to open a criminal investigation into the allegations of the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment of 1 July 2012, pursuant to Article 24 \u00a7 1 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, for lack of the elements of a crime under Article 286 of the Criminal Code (on abuse of powers) in the actions of police officers Sh., A. and T., it was stated that the applicant had tried to escape during his transfer from the Centre for Combating Extremism to police station no. 1 on 25 December 2010 and could have received the injuries as a result of the lawful use of force by police officers Sh. and A. in their effort to stop him. That conclusion was based on statements by police officers based at the Centre, namely Sh., A., T., K., Ch., G., M. and S., who had conducted the applicant\u2019s interview (\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441) with a view to establishing his possible accomplices, in particular persons who had supplied him with the explosives. They denied the use of any violence against the applicant. The investigator confirmed that, in accordance with Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Operational-Search Activities Act, the police officers had the right to conduct the applicant\u2019s interview.", "41. The applicant appealed against the investigator\u2019s decision of 1 July 2012 to a court. He complained, in particular, that the investigator had not given him the opportunity to challenge the police officers\u2019 version. The applicant\u2019s appeal was rejected by a decision of 16 May 2013 of the Kanavinskiy District Court, which was satisfied that the decision was reasoned and lawful. That decision was upheld by the Nizhniy Novgorod Regional Court on 5 August 2013.", "42. On 25 May 2015 an acting prosecutor of the Nizhniy Novgorod region annulled the refusal of 1 July 2012 as unlawful and based on an incomplete inquiry and ordered an additional inquiry, finding that the applicant\u2019s statements contesting the police officers\u2019 version of events and alleging the use of violence by police officer K. had not been investigated.", "43. On 26 August 2011 a woman was attacked and robbed on the street.", "44. On 27 August 2011 nine police officers (Sh., R., P., G., S., M., Kh., Z. and A.S.) were ordered to arrest the applicant, who was suspected of having committed the robbery. At about 10 a.m. they apprehended the applicant on a street in Podmayachnyy village in the Orenburg Region. The applicant tried to flee because, according to him, he did not realise that those pursuing him \u2012 who were dressed in plain clothes \u2012 were police officers. Sh. and R. stopped him. According to the applicant, they tied his hands with a belt. The applicant was taken to the Orenburg town police department.", "45. The applicant described the events at the police station as follows. He was led through an entrance for staff only to an office on the first floor and handcuffed. The police officers, in particular O., demanded that he confess to having attacked the woman and stolen her gold chain and mobile phone. O. punched the applicant twice in the chest, then hit the applicant on his feet with a rubber truncheon for about forty minutes, while the other police officers, in particular A., pinned him down on the floor, holding onto his arms and legs. He was then asked to stand up on his feet but was unable to do so, fell over and was hit by the truncheon on the left side of his torso. His feet were stepped on and he was suffocated with a plastic bag. During the suffocation, which lasted three or four hours, he fainted several times. The applicant wrote a \u201cstatement of surrender and confession\u201d (\u044f\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439), as requested. O. threatened him with further torture if he did not reiterate his confession to an investigator.", "46. The \u201cstatement of surrender and confession\u201d, in which the applicant confessed to having attacked the woman and stolen her gold chain, was recorded by the police. The applicant also signed a document entitled \u201cexplanation\u201d, drawn up by operative police officer D., with a detailed description of the circumstances of the crime.", "47. At 8.40 p.m. an investigator drew up a record of the applicant\u2019s arrest as a suspect. The applicant gave selfincriminating statements when questioned as a suspect in the presence of a State-appointed lawyer, reiterating the confession statement he had given earlier to the police officers.", "48. At 12.25 a.m. on 28 August 2011 the applicant was placed in the temporary detention facility (the \u201cIVS\u201d) in Orenburg town police department, where the following injuries on his body were recorded: bruises on the chest, an abrasion on the face on the left cheek bone, many abrasions on the waist, abrasions on both wrists and scars on the left forearm. The applicant stated that those injuries had been inflicted during his arrest.", "49. On 29 August 2011 the applicant was taken to a traumatology centre, where he was diagnosed with contusion of the left side of his chest and both wrists.", "50. At 2.30 p.m. the applicant appeared before the Promyshlenniy District Court of Orenburg, which ordered his detention on remand. The court decision referred to the investigator\u2019s submissions that the applicant\u2019s involvement in the crime had been established on 26 August 2011 but he had been hiding from the lawenforcement authorities until his arrest on 27 August 2011.", "51. On the same day he was placed in pre-trial detention facility IZ56/3, where bruises on the left side of his chest, both wrists and both feet were recorded.", "52. On 30 August 2011 the applicant\u2019s lawyer A., who had been retained by his family, observed injuries on the applicant when visiting him in the detention facility. The applicant told her about his ill-treatment at the police station and the selfincriminating statements he had given as a result.", "53. On 31 August 2011 when questioned as an accused in the presence of lawyer A., the applicant retracted his selfincriminating statements, explaining that he had given them on 27 August 2011 as a result of his illtreatment by the police officers.", "54. According to the applicant\u2019s mother and brother, and his acquaintance Zh., the applicant had no injuries before his arrest.", "55. On 5 September 2011 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint concerning his alleged ill-treatment by the police. The Orenburg town investigative committee carried out a preinvestigation inquiry. The operative police officers who had arrested the applicant on 27 August 2011 gave explanations. They stated that as soon as the applicant had seen them he had run away and they had lost sight of him. When running away the applicant had fallen over several times. The police officers had split into several groups in order to find and stop him. Police officers Sh. and R. had caught up with the applicant, knocked him to the ground and handcuffed his hands behind his back. R. suggested that any bruises or abrasions on the applicant\u2019s body could have been received as a result of his falling over when trying to run away from them. The police officers denied any deliberate use of force against the applicant either during his arrest or afterwards at the police station when they interviewed him.", "56. On 5 October 2011 an investigator refused to initiate criminal proceedings pursuant to Article 24 \u00a7 1 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure for lack of the elements of a crime under Articles 285 and 286 of the Criminal Code (on abuse of powers) in the acts of the police officers. Relying on the police officers\u2019 statements, the investigator found that the police officers had acted lawfully in using handcuffs and \u201cblocking\u201d the applicant, a suspect in criminal proceedings, who had tried to escape and resisted his arrest. On 10 October 2011 a deputy head of the Orenburg town investigative committee annulled the investigator\u2019s decision on the grounds that the inquiry had been incomplete, and ordered an additional inquiry. Subsequently fourteen more refusals to open a criminal investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations of illtreatment were issued by investigators and annulled by their superiors within the investigative committee for being based on incomplete inquiries.", "57. On 28 December 2012 the Promyshlenniy District Court of Orenburg convicted the applicant of robbery and sentenced him to three years\u2019 imprisonment. The applicant pleaded guilty in relation to the assault against the victim but denied robbery, stating that he had given the selfincriminating statements at the pre-trial stage of the proceedings as a result of the ill-treatment by the police. The court considered his allegations of ill-treatment unfounded, relying on the results of the inquiry and one of the refusals to open a criminal case of 21 December 2012 which had not at that moment been annulled. The court declared the applicant\u2019s selfincriminating statements of 27 August 2011 admissible evidence. The applicant\u2019s \u201cstatement of surrender and confession\u201d served as a mitigating circumstance. The judgment became final.", "58. During one of the additional rounds of the pre-investigation inquiry into the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment two forensic medical expert reports were prepared, on 11 September and 18 October 2013, based on the applicant\u2019s medical documents. The experts concluded that the applicant\u2019s injuries \u2013 the bruises on his chest and both feet, numerous abrasions on his waist, the abrasion on the face, and numerous abrasions and bruises on both wrists \u2013 could have been inflicted as a result of impacts from a hard blunt object shortly before his injuries had been recorded at the IVS and possibly on 27 August 2011.", "59. On 7 May 2014 an additional forensic medical expert report was prepared at the investigator\u2019s request. The expert concluded that the applicant\u2019s injuries had originated from the impact of a blunt hard object with a limited contact surface (with a limited narrow elongated contact surface in the case of the injuries to his wrists). The nature, location and mechanism of the origin of the injuries were consistent with the applicant\u2019s version. All his injuries could have been received as a result of illtreatment by the police officers as described by him. As regards the police officers\u2019 version, the abrasions on the applicant\u2019s face and waist could have been received as a result of the applicant falling over when running away during his arrest. The abrasions on the wrists could have been received as a result of the use of handcuffs. There was nothing, however, in the police officers\u2019 statements to explain the bruises on the chest and feet.", "60. On 2 June 2014 investigator V. of the Orenburg north administrative circuit investigative committee initiated criminal proceedings into the applicant\u2019s allegations under Article 286 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Criminal Code (abuse of power with use of violence). He held that it was impossible to resolve the contradictions existing in the case-file material by means of a pre-investigation inquiry, and that it was therefore necessary to open a criminal case and examine the applicant\u2019s allegations by way of a criminal investigation, as there was sufficient data to indicate that a crime under Article 286 of the Criminal Code might have been committed.", "61. The next day the acting prosecutor of the Promyshlenniy district of Orenburg annulled the investigator\u2019s decision as unlawful and illfounded, disagreeing with the investigator that there was sufficient data to indicate that a crime could have been committed. The prosecutor stressed that it was possible to implement urgent measures aimed at establishing the circumstances of alleged illtreatment within the framework of a preinvestigation inquiry, in particular by ordering forensic medical examinations. He noted that the pre-investigation inquiry had established that the applicant had received the injuries during his arrest as a suspect, and that in the final judgment in the applicant\u2019s criminal case the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment had been found unsubstantiated and that it was therefore impossible to question that finding.", "62. The applicant appealed against the prosecutor\u2019s decision. On 9 February 2015 the Promyshlenniy District Court found the prosecutor\u2019s decision lawful. It held that under Article 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the court did not have competence to assess whether the evidence or the presence of data indicating the elements of a crime constituted grounds for instituting criminal proceedings. That decision was upheld on 16 April 2015 by the Orenburg Regional Court.", "63. Following the prosecutor\u2019s decision, on 30 July 2014 investigator V. refused to open a criminal case. His decision was annulled on 18 August 2014 by a deputy head of the second procedural supervision department of the investigative committee of the Russian Federation for being based on an incomplete inquiry. Subsequently two more decisions refusing to open a criminal case \u2012 of 2 October 2014 and 26 March 2015 \u2012 were also annulled for the same reason, on 16 March and 21 May 2015, respectively, by an acting head of the procedural supervision department of the Orenburg regional investigative committee.", "64. In the investigator\u2019s decision of 26 March 2015, as in the previous decisions, it was found that the police officers had acted lawfully in using handcuffs and physical force, in particular for the purposes of \u201cblocking\u201d the applicant, who had actively resisted arrest. The applicant had received the injuries when trying to escape and resisting arrest. The injuries on his wrists had been caused by the lawful use of handcuffs.", "65. On 22 May 2015 the acting district prosecutor pointed to flagrant violations of the criminal procedural law, in particular the reasonable time requirement for examination of reports about crimes. He noted that, due to the lack of supervision and the acquiescence of the investigative committee management, the investigative committee had failed to conduct a thorough and objective inquiry for more than four years \u2012 thereby violating the applicant\u2019s rights \u2012 and that this constituted a serious disciplinary offence.", "66. According to a report by a psychologist who examined the applicant in September 2015 the applicant complained that, as a consequence of the police illtreatment, he suffered from frequent headaches, blood pressure abnormalities and sleep disturbances. He displayed signs that the illtreatment experienced by him and the lack of justice still affected him. He was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and was recommended treatment and rehabilitation measures."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
