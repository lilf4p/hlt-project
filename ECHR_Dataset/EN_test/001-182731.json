On 10 March 2004, while participating in a meeting at Pushkin Square in Moscow, the applicant, personally and with the participation of an unidentified person, disseminated issues nos. 2 (40) and 3 (41) of the Radikalnaya Politika newsletter and informed people interested in it about the forthcoming issues, how to subscribe and other ways to financially support the newsletter, of which he was the editor-in-chief.", "38. On 18 December 2003 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant on suspicion that the views expressed in the Radikalnaya Politika newsletter amounted to appeals to extremist activities and incitement to racial, national, social and other hatred.", "39. A psychological-linguistic expert examination of the texts published by the applicant was carried out. In a report of 13 April 2004 the expert stated, in particular, that the impugned texts contained negative emotional assessments of Russia\u2019s servicemen; of people of Russian ethnicity; and of Orthodox believers. The report further mentioned that, by criticising Russia\u2019s actions in the Chechen Republic, the texts gave negative assessments of Russia, as a State; of the existing political regime; of Russia\u2019s army as a part of the machinery of the State. The report also pointed out numerous expressly negative words and expressions used by the applicants when describing Russia. It also mentioned that the impugned texts positively assessed and justified the actions and activities of a number of Chechen separatist leaders and fighters; terrorist attacks, including explosions, within the territory of Russia.", "40. On 26 April 2004 the applicant was formally charged with the above-mentioned offences and on an unspecified date the case was transferred to the Butyrskiy District Court of Moscow (\u201cthe District Court\u201d) for trial.", "41. At the trial, the applicant pleaded not guilty. He confirmed that he had been the editor-in-chief and publisher of the Radikalnaya Politika newsletter but argued that he had printed the newsletter only for himself and had not distributed it. He further argued that he had merely expressed his opinion regarding various political events in Russia, and, in particular, his civic position regarding the ongoing armed conflict in the Chechen Republic. In his words, he had never called for extremist activities or violent overthrow of the existing political regime in Russia; he had only called for a change of the leadership in the country.", "42. The District Court called and examined a number of witnesses, who submitted that they had bought the applicant\u2019s newsletter or seen him distribute it for free in public. It also examined the expert who had drawn up the report of 13 April 2004. The expert confirmed his conclusions made in the report. A number of witnesses on the applicant\u2019s behalf were also called and examined.", "43. The trial court further examined other pieces of evidence, including the expert report of 13 April 2004; written complaints from eight private individuals in which they had stated that the applicant\u2019s articles had aimed at inciting hatred and had contained insulting language in respect of Russians, Orthodox believers and law-enforcement officers; reports of seizure of issues of the applicant\u2019s newsletter; reports of a search of the applicant\u2019s flat and seizure of his computer; a report on the applicant\u2019s forensic psychiatric examination, which confirmed that he was fully able to understand the meaning of his actions and to control them.", "44. The District Court examined the applicant\u2019s arguments and those raised by his defence counsel and dismissed them as untenable on the facts of the case, with reference to the witness statements and other pieces of evidence.", "45. In a judgment of 20 November 2006 the District Court found the applicant guilty of \u201chaving publicly appealed to extremist activities through the mass media\u201d (Article 280 \u00a7 2 of the Russian Criminal Code) and of having committed \u201cactions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity as well as at humiliating the dignity of an individual or group of individuals on the grounds of ethnicity, origin, attitude towards religion and membership of a social group, through the mass media\u201d (Article 282 \u00a7 1 of the Russian Criminal Code).", "46. The trial court 6-7 above, and referred to the texts mentioned in the expert report of 13 April 2004 (see paragraph 39 above). It considered that the impugned texts had had a clear extremist leaning and incited actions prohibited by the Suppression of Extremism Act (see paragraph 69 below). In particular, in those texts the applicant had called for extremist acts, such as a forcible overthrow of the constitutional order and the President of Russia; had called for a breach of the territorial integrity of Russia; had justified and glorified terrorist acts; had called for violence against the Russian people and abased their dignity; and had incited religious discord by arguing that the Orthodox faith had been inferior and by insulting its followers. In those texts the applicant had used insulting language in respect of Russia as a State, the political regime in the country, and servicemen of Russia\u2019s armed and security forces.", "47. More specifically, the District Court observed that in various issues of his newsletter the applicant had represented the conflict in the Chechen Republic as a war between two States \u2013 Chechnya and Russia; had approved of terrorist attacks carried out in Russia, and of the actions of criminals and terrorists aimed at the extermination of the Russian people as a nation. In this respect, the District Court referred to the applicant\u2019s relevant texts in issue no. 1 (27) (see paragraph 16 above) and in issue no. 9 (35) (see paragraphs 21 and 23 above), stating that in those texts, while \u201cmentioning a number of persons implicated in terrorist and extremist activities\u201d, the applicant had used words and expressions aimed at creating positive public opinion about those persons and their criminal acts.", "48. The District Court also pointed out that \u201cthe texts of the applicant\u2019s articles contain[ed] positive assessment of the bombings in Russia perpetrated by Chechen terrorists as well as the acts of Chechen snipers from illegal armed groups who kill[ed] Russia\u2019s servicemen in Chechnya\u201d. In this respect, it quoted an extract from issue no. 1 (27) (see paragraph 11 above) and extracts from issue no. 3 (41) (see paragraphs 31-32 above).", "49. The trial court went on to note that the applicant had qualified Russia\u2019s actions in the Chechen Republic as aggression and had considered the Russian Army to be an occupying force. Accordingly, he \u201c[had] negatively assessed Russia\u2019s actions and those of Russia\u2019s armed forces; similarly negatively [the applicant had] assessed Russia as a State, the Russian Army as a part of the machinery of the State and Russia\u2019s servicemen as a social group\u201d. The District Court continued to state that, on the other hand, the applicant \u201c[had] represented the events in the Chechen Republic as a war waged by Russia against the Chechen people (the Chechen ethnic group) and as genocide against the Chechen people\u201d. The court corroborated these findings with reference to relevant texts published in issue no. 1 (27) (see paragraphs 8 and 12 above) and in issue no. 3 (41) (see paragraphs 33 and 34 above).", "50. The District Court also observed that the applicant had justified and positively assessed the acts of Chechen rebel fighters, and that he had regarded the Chechen Republic as an independent State with its own President (A. Maskhadov), capital (Dzhokhar), constitution, armed forces and Commander-in-Chief, courts (Sharia courts) and legislation. In particular, in issue no. 1 (27), the applicant had interpreted the events in the Chechen Republic as \u201ca national liberation struggle of the Chechen people against the colonial expansion of Russia\u201d (see paragraph 13 above), referred to \u201clawful convictions of the Sharia court of the CRI\u201d (see paragraph 17 above), and mentioned \u201cPresident Maskhadov\u201d, \u201cPresident of the CRI\u201d, \u201cCommander-In-Chief of the CRI Maskhadov\u201d, \u201cthe capital of the CRI, Dzhokhar\u201d (see paragraph 14 above). Also, in issue no. 3 (41) the applicant published a \u201cdecree by President Maskhadov\u201d and in the article \u201cNo comments\u201d he praised \u201cPresident Maskhadov\u201d as \u201cthe legitimate President of Chechnya\u201d (see paragraph 24 above).", "51. The District Court further referred to the texts in eight issues of the applicant\u2019s newsletter published in the column entitled \u201cGood news\u201d (see paragraph 35 above). It pointed out that the applicant had represented bad events in a positive way, that is to say as actions approved by the authors and by the applicant himself and as an example to be followed. The court pointed out that another example to be followed, according to the applicant, had been actions of Chechen women putting on \u201cshaheed belts\u201d; in the latter respect, the court quoted a relevant extract from the article \u201c\u2018Chechen syndrome\u2019 inside out\u201d (see paragraph 20 above).", "52. The District Court went on to observe that \u201cin all issues of his newsletter ... [the applicant had] wilfully made use of insulting characteristics, negative emotional assessments and attitudes towards ethnic, racial, national, religious and social groups\u201d. In particular, in respect of Russia as a State he had employed such negative emotional references as metaphors \u201cscary noisome abyss\u201d, \u201cbloody cannibalistic atrocity\u201d, \u201crotten block\u201d; humiliating characteristics \u201cimmeasurable scoundrelism, perfidy, pathological falsity\u201d and negative attitudes aimed at destruction (the metaphor \u201cto spit blood\u201d), which, according to the trial court, was a clear indication of an attitude aimed at inciting bloodshed. The court corroborated these findings with reference to relevant extracts from issue no. 1 (27) (see paragraph 15 above), issue no. 9 (35) (see paragraph 22 above) and issue no. 2 (40) (see paragraph 26 above).", "53. The District Court also considered that in the article headlined \u201cInsanity of Budanov, a guarantee of victory for Basayev\u201d, \u201cthe applicant [had] insult[ed ...] servicemen of the Russian Army and law-enforcement officers by launching an appeal to act criminally against them\u201d. In particular, the court stated that \u201cin that article [the applicant gave] an emotional and negative description of the servicemen of the Russian Army as a social group\u201d (see paragraph 9 above) and \u201c[made] an appeal for actions against [army] servicemen ..., such as requiring an immediate compulsory psychiatric examination of its commanders\u201d (see paragraph 10 above). In support of its relevant findings, the District Court also relied on an extract published in issue 2 (40) (see paragraph 29 above).", "54. It went on to state that \u201cby publishing and disseminating the Radikalnaya Politika newsletter [the applicant had] wilfully acted with a view to stirring up enmity and conflict, including armed conflict, on national, racial and religious grounds between citizens living in the European and Asian parts of the country and people living in the Caucasus\u201d. In this respect, the trial court referred to the applicant\u2019s \u201ceditorial note\u201d published in issue no. 2 (40) (see paragraph 30 above), observing that in that publication the applicant had \u201cdemonstrated a negative attitude towards the existing political system and Russia as a State\u201d. The trial court pointed out that \u201cthe stance taken by [the applicant] concerning the liquidation of the existing State regime (\u201cPutin\u2019s regime\u201d) presuppose[ed] not only actions in conformity with the constitution but also the possibility of deviating from it (\u201cto overthrow the regime, without really caring about the Constitution\u201d)\u201d.", "55. The court further noted that in the article \u201cRetribution-2\u201d the applicant had referred to \u201cthe following acts aimed against the State and the existing political regime in Russia: organisation of meetings concerning events in the Chechen Republic, participation in those meetings, writing inscriptions on the walls of buildings, fences and bus stops\u201d with the contents reflected in the relevant extracts of that article (see paragraph 25 above). The court also stated that \u201cthe applicant [had] also suggested carrying out other unlawful acts against the State and the political regime in the texts of his newsletters but [had] failed to specify which\u201d.", "56. The District Court then observed that in various issues of his newsletter the applicant had \u201cintentionally appealed for records to be kept of such acts as \u2018sweep operations\u2019, \u2018identity checks\u2019, \u2018counter-terrorist operations\u2019, \u2018unlawful searches and politically motivated criminal prosecutions\u2019, which he [had] qualified as \u2018crimes\u2019 and the persons who [had] carried them out as \u2018executioners in uniforms\u2019 and \u2018narks without uniforms\u2019\u201d. The court referred, in particular, to the applicant\u2019s appeal made in the relevant extract from the article \u201cRetribution-2\u201d (see paragraph 28 above).", "57. The trial court went on to note that in the article \u201cOrthodox [believers] went completely nuts\u201d (see paragraph 19 above) the applicant had made use of a heading carrying a negative and emotional assessment of the followers of the Orthodox denomination (\u201cwent nuts\u201d). However, in the court\u2019s words, \u201cthe content of the article [did] not correspond to its title, because it concern[ed] an isolated case (a statement that \u201cJesus Christ was crucified not by Jews but by Chechens\u201d, contained in a booklet called \u201cFoundations of the Orthodox Faith\u201d); this isolated case [was] generalised from and represented as a typical situation of Orthodox believers by virtue of using the impugned heading\u201d. In the same vein, the District Court pointed out that in issue no. 1 (27) the applicant had reproduced information concerning certain Uzbek nationals held in slavery by certain Russian citizens (see paragraph 18 above). The court noted that the applicant had entitled that article \u201cRussians have slaves and dare squawk something about Chechens\u201d and had represented an isolated fact to the readers as typical and characteristic of all Russians, whereby he had \u201cmade a negative and emotional assessment (\u2018to squawk\u2019) in respect of Russian citizens as a nation\u201d.", "58. Moreover, in issues nos. 1 (27) and 9 (35) the applicant had argued that \u201cOrthodox people [\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434] had been inferior by using insulting characteristics and negative emotional assessments of believers, discriminatory expressions in respect of the Orthodox denomination as a religion and stating that this religion, practised by Russians, should be abolished, thereby abasing the national dignity of the people practising [it]\u201d. According to the trial court, statements regarding the inferiority of the Orthodox faith had been made by the applicant in an attempt to stir up interethnic and racial conflicts in society so as to cause indignation in society and eventually to call for a change of the existing political regime. The court did not specify which particular articles in the above-mentioned issues contained those characteristics and assessments.", "59. Lastly, the court referred to the fact that \u201cat an unauthorised meeting on 23 February 2004 the applicant [had] called on individuals to support his movement by openly displaying banners with slogans condemning the regime\u201d (see paragraph 36 above) and during the meeting of 10 March 2004, \u201cto continue to commit crimes aimed at incitement to hatred and enmity among the population, abasement of dignity of an individual or group of individuals on the grounds of gender, nationality, language, origin or religious beliefs and membership of a social group, the applicant, personally and with a participation of an unidetified person, had distributed issues nos. 2 (40) and 3 (41) of the Radikalnaya Politika newsletter and had informed the persons interested in it about the forthcoming issues, how to subscribe and other ways to financially support the newsletter, of which he had been the editor-in-chief\u201d. In the trial court\u2019s view the applicant thus had called for extremist activities to be supported by way of their financing on a charitable basis.", "60. The District Court rejected the applicant\u2019s argument that in the relevant articles he had made no appeals to extremist activities, and, in particular, that he had not called for the overthrow of the constitutional order nor stirred up inter-ethnic discord; and that he supported the constitutional order, the Russian Constitution and the Chechen people\u2019s right to self-determination and had merely availed himself of the right to freedom of expression. The trial court noted, with reference to the expert report of 13 April 2004, that the language used by the applicant in the impugned texts enabled the court to conclude that the applicant\u2019s actions had constituted criminal offences and that he had clearly abused his right to freedom of expression secured by the Russian Constitution.", "61. The District Court furthermore dismissed the applicant\u2019s argument that he had been the author of only some of the articles held against him whereas the others had been written by other individuals. The court observed in this connection that the applicant had been the editor-in-chief of the newsletter and, in this capacity, had had the power to shape its editorial direction and he had been responsible for its content.", "62. As regards the punishment to be imposed on the applicant, the District Court had regard to the state of his health and the fact that he had no criminal record, had positive references and had a dependant mother. At the same time it stressed the \u201chigh social danger\u201d posed by the applicant\u2019s offences and his personality and sentenced him to five years\u2019 imprisonment. The court also prohibited the applicant from practising journalism for three years to run concurrently.", "63. The applicant appealed, referring, among other things, to Article 10 of the Convention and stating that as the editor-in-chief of the impugned newsletter he had expressed in it his personal views concerning political events in Russia and his attitude, as a citizen of that country, to the war in the Chechen Republic. He had not made any appeals for extremist activities and had not declared the superiority of any one religion over another. Nor had he called for the overthrow of the constitutional order, but he had expressed the view that the Government should be changed. The applicant further pointed out that the number of copies of the newsletter in question had been so miniscule that the statements published therein had presented no public danger. He also argued that the measure of punishment imposed on him was excessively severe, given, in particular, the fact that he had no criminal record and had positive references from the place where he lived.", "64. On 23 May 2007 the Moscow City Court upheld the applicant\u2019s conviction on appeal. It stated, in particular, that the applicant\u2019s newsletter had been a mass medium despite the low number of copies produced. It also considered that .", "65. The applicant was released on 21 March 2011 after he had served the prison sentence in full. In his submission, numerous requests by him for release on parole had been refused."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
