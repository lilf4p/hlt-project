On an unspecified date A.R., a member of the political party SelfDefence of the Republic of Poland (\u201cSamoobrona\u201d) sent Gazeta Wyborcza, a daily newspaper, an electronic mail containing information about an alleged \u201csex scandal\u201d in the party.", "7. The following day the applicant, who is a journalist, contacted A.R. on the telephone. After their conversation he informed her that he had recorded the call and that he intended to use the transcript for an article.", "8. On 6 December 2006 the applicant published an interview with A.R. in the Gazeta Wyborcza. The interview, entitled \u201cPayment for sex, the choice is yours\u201d (\u201cP\u0142aca ze seks, wyb\u00f3r nale\u017cy do pani\u201d) concerned the \u201csex scandal\u201d story which had broken in Poland earlier in 2006. Public figures, including Samoobrona activists, had offered and accepted sexual favours in the course of exercising public functions. A.R. told the newspaper that she had begun working with the party through her contacts with A.K. Initially, she had been unpaid and when she had demanded payment, one of the activists, K.Z., had told her:", "\u201cI will pay if you go to bed with me\u201d", "She also said that in July 2004 during a party organised by A.K. a prominent Samoobrona activist, B.S., had offered to find a post for her in a parliamentary deputy\u2019s office \u2013 specifically R.C.\u2019s \u2013 in return for sexual favours. According to A.R., B.S. was so forward that she had to ask K.S. for help. K.S. then called a taxi to take B.S. home", "9. Then the applicant asked A.R.:", "\u201cDid you get the job?\u201d", "A.R. replied:", "\u201cNo, the job was given to M.C.\u2019s daughter\u201d.", "10. On the same page, to the right of the article, the newspaper quoted three prominent Samoobrona activists referred to in the interview, namely K.Z., B.S. and K.S. They all, denied that there had been any sexual propositions made to A.R.", "11. Also on the same page the newspaper published a short interview with A.K. who confirmed that she knew A.R. but had never recommended her for any work. When asked about the \u201csex scandal\u201d A.K. said:", "\u201cWhat are you saying? I have never heard of it. This cannot be true.\u201d", "12. On 30 November 2007 M.C., a Member of the European Parliament, lodged a private bill of indictment against the applicant. He demanded that the applicant be charged with defamation. According to the indictment the defamation consisted of the publication of the interview with A.R. in which she said that B.S. could arrange a job for her in M.C.\u2019s office in return for sexual favours. According to M.C. this suggested to readers that he had been involved in the \u201csex scandal\u201d. He also claimed that he had been defamed in the published interview at the point where A.R. had accused him of nepotism by saying that he had employed his own daughter.", "13. On 16 March 2010 the Warsaw District Court ruled the indictment partially accurate: it then discontinued the proceedings for a probationary term of one year and ordered the applicant to pay 1,000 Polish zlotys (PLN \u2013 232 euros (EUR)) to charity and to pay the costs of the proceedings.", "14. The District Court found the applicant guilty of the defamation of M.C. with respect to his publication of the statements made by A.R. concerning nepotism (see paragraph 23 below). According to the court the applicant neglected his professional obligations because he did not verify that the job had been offered to M.C.\u2019s daughter. At the trial it became clear that this information could not be accurate because M.C. did not have a daughter. It did not accept the applicant\u2019s argument that he had acted with due diligence because before publication he had sent the text of the interview to A.R. who had accepted its contents and returned it to the applicant without making any objection or comment (autoryzacja).", "15. The District Court did not hold that the applicant was guilty of defamation when he had suggested that M.C. had been involved in the \u201csex scandal\u201d. It found that in this respect the applicant had fulfilled his professional obligations because he had published the statement of B.S., who had denied propositioning A.R. For the above reasons, in the District Court\u2019s view, the average reader should not have had the impression that M.C. was involved in the \u201csex scandal\u201d.", "16. The applicant and M.C.\u2019s lawyer appealed against the firstinstance judgment.", "17. On 18 June 2010 the Warsaw Regional Court upheld the challenged judgment, repeating in essence the same reasoning as the District Court. Regarding the applicant\u2019s arguments concerning his right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention, it noted that \u201cin the light of the journalist\u2019s right to publish critical comments (prawo do krytyki dziennikarskiej), an individual\u2019s right to legal protection of good name and reputation should also be taken into account\u201d.", "18. On 3 February 2011 the applicant\u2019s lawyer requested the Ombudsman to lodge a cassation appeal on the applicant\u2019s behalf.", "19. On 6 May 2011 the Ombudsman informed the applicant that she had found no grounds to lodge a cassation appeal."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
