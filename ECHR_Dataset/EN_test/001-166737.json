The record read as follows:", "\u201c4 March 2012", "I have made the following findings under Article 28.3 of the Code of Administrative Offences:", "[The applicant] was drunk and used foul language against passers-by, waving his arms in the air; he was trying to start a fight, and did not rectify his behaviour despite remarks from passers-by.

On 5 March 2012 the police officer submitted the record to his superior, who decided that the case should be transferred to a court for examination.", "11. On an unspecified date, the administrative offence file was submitted to a justice of the peace for adjudication.

On 29 March 2012 the justice of the peace held a hearing. It is unclear whether it was a public one.", "13.

The use of foul language in a public place is unacceptable and discloses a form of disorderly behaviour ... In the court\u2019s view, the use of aberrant language in a public place in the presence of at least one person constitutes an offence under Article 20.1 of the CAO. Moreover, the defendant continued to use foul language during his arrest and while being taken to the police station ...\u201d", "18. The applicant appealed to the Naberezhniye Chelny Town Court. He argued, inter alia, that although the offence record referred to his using foul language \u201cagainst passers-by\u201d, the justice of the peace had phrased the charge as using foul language \u201cin the presence of other people\u201d; the judge had not retained the phrase from the offence record, which stated that the applicant \u201c[had not rectified] his behaviour despite remarks from passersby\u201d.", "19.
