In an interlocutory judgment of 12 April 2011, the Bucharest County Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s request. However, it replaced the applicant\u2019s detention with an undertaking not to leave the city, given that the impact of his deeds on public order had diminished with the passage of time. It ordered the applicant\u2019s release from detention.", "8. The prosecutor did not appeal against the interlocutory judgment. Despite the fact that the judgment became final on 13 April 2011, the applicant was not released from Bucharest Prison until two days later, namely on 15 April 2011.", "9.

In a judgment of 2 March 2007 concerning an unlawful detention for two days, the Mehedin\u021bi County Court allowed the action for compensation and awarded the claimant 1,000 Romanian lei (RON) (approximately 350 euros (EUR)). The Craiova Court of Appeal upheld that judgment and increased the compensation to RON 2,000 (approximately EUR 700).

It noted that the claimant was entitled to compensation on the basis of Article 5 \u00a7 5 of the Convention, even though the extension of his detention by an additional thirty-six days after his prison sentence had been served had not been found unlawful by a decision of a prosecutor or a court, as required by Article 504 \u00a7 3 of the CCP.", "14. By a decision of 17 March 2011 the Oradea Court of Appeal allowed an action for compensation for unlawful detention and awarded the claimant RON 500. It found that, although Article 504 of the CCP was not applicable to the claimant\u2019s situation, he was entitled to compensation on the basis of Article 5 of the Convention.
