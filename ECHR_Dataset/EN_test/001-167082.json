However, he was known to be suffering from a severe dermatological disease since 1996.", "4. On 10 October 2000 the applicants\u2019 son\u2019s disease deteriorated, and he was transferred to the Ege University Hospital. He died on 19 January 2001.", "5. On 26 September 2001 the applicants initiated proceedings before the Supreme Military Administrative Court and requested pecuniary and non-pecuniary compensation. In their petition, the applicants each claimed 1,000 Turkish Liras (TRY) in respect of pecuniary damages.

On 21 July 2005 the Supreme Military Administrative Court rejected the case for additional compensation in respect of pecuniary damages on the basis of the failure to bring the claim within the statutory time-limit.

On 6 January 2004 the applicants lodged an application with the Supreme Military Administrative Court with a request for a pension.", "15. On 27 January 2005 the Supreme Military Administrative Court rejected the applicants\u2019 request on the ground that the applicants\u2019 son had died due to an illness he had had before joining the army, and it had a genetic basis. Also, the applicants had failed to prove that they fulfilled the requirements for a pension since no document showing that the applicants were dependent or disabled had been provided. Thus, the Supreme Military Administrative Court found that the applicants\u2019 request did not have any legal ground and rejected the application."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
