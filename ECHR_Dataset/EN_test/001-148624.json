It further decided that the measure of restraint applied to the applicant should remain unchanged.", "42. On 20 May 2004 the applicant lodged an application for release with the Vyborgskiy District Court.

On 4 August 2003 Mr Biryuchenko and on 16 September 2004 Mr Oynas complained to the Russian Constitutional Court about the de facto extension of their detention after their case files had been sent by the prosecution authorities to the respective trial courts. The Constitutional Court examined their complaints together with similar complaints lodged by other individuals. In a Ruling adopted on 22 March 2005 the Constitutional Court found that the challenged provisions of the new CCrP complied with the Constitution of the Russian Federation. However, their practical interpretation by the courts may have contradicted their constitutional meaning. In part 3.2 of the Ruling the Constitutional Court held:", "\u201cThe second part of Article 22 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation provides that ... the detention is permitted only on the basis of a court order ... . Consequently, if the term of detention, as defined in the court order, expires, the court shall decide on the extension of the detention, otherwise the accused person should be released ...", "These rules are common for all stages of criminal proceedings, and also cover the transition from one stage to another. ... The transition of the case to another stage does not automatically put an end to the preventive measure applied at previous stages.", "Therefore, when the case is transmitted by the prosecution to the trial court, the preventive measure applied at the pre-trial stage ... may continue to apply until the expiry of the term, for which it has been set in the respective court decision [imposing it] ...", "[Under Articles 227 and 228 of the Code of Criminal Procedure] a judge, after having received the criminal case concerning a detained defendant, should, within fourteen days, set a hearing and establish \u2018whether the preventive measure applied should be lifted or changed\u2019. This wording implies that the decision to detain the accused or extend his detention, taken at the pre-trial stage, may stand after the completion of the pre-trial investigation and transmittal of the case to the court, only until the end of the term, for which the preventive measure has been set.", "The prosecution, in its turn, while approving the bill of indictment and transferring the case file to the court, should check whether the term of detention has expired and whether it is sufficient to allow the judge to take a decision [on further detention of the accused pending trial]. If by the moment of transferal of the case-file to the court this term has expired, or if it appears to be insufficient to allow the judge to take a decision [on detention], the prosecutor, pursuant to Articles 108 and 109 of the Code of Criminal Proceedings, [should] request the court to extend the period of detention.\u201d", "53. On 1 August 2005 Mr Biryuchenko lodged a complaint with the General Prosecutor\u2019s office. He submitted that between 19 September 2002, which was after his case had been referred for trial to the City Court, and 18 March 2003, he had been detained unlawfully (see paragraphs 10-16 above). Subsequently, his detention had been extended six times: on 18 March, 18 June, 18 September and 16 December 2003, on 16 March and 29 March 2004. He pointed out that he had appealed against all the extension orders, but the appeal court had failed to take his arguments into account. Relying on the ruling of the Constitutional Court of 22 March 2005, the applicant argued that in his case the courts had wrongly interpreted Article 255 of the new CCrP and had taken an unlawful decision on 18 March 2003. All the subsequent detention orders had also been unlawful. He requested the Prosecutor to lodge a request for supervisory review with the Supreme Court and apply for quashing of the extension orders.", "54. On 21 September 2005 the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office replied that the ambiguity of Article 255 allowed the courts to detain the defendants during six months without taking any decision in this respect. Therefore, when extending the applicant\u2019s detention and dismissing his applications for release, the courts of first and second instances had not found any violation of law. Furthermore, the applicant had been released on 5 May 2004. Therefore, his right to liberty had been reinstated long before the adoption of the ruling of 22 March 2005 by the Constitutional Court. For these reasons, there had been no grounds to apply for a supervisory review of detention orders."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-3", "5-4", "6-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
