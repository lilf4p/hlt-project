In 1843 the local community of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in the villages of Korshiv (Ivano-Frankivsk Region) built a church to the Holy Virgin Mary\u2019s Assumption. In 1946, after the relevant territory had been joined to the USSR, the community of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church formally became a part of the Russian Orthodox Church. The church of the Assumption was nationalised and transferred to the Russian Orthodox Church for religious purposes.", "5. In 1991 part of the former Russian Orthodox Church community members decided to create a community of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (the applicant) and another part decided to join the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. The church of the Assumption remained municipal property, managed by the Regional State Administration. On 5 March 1991 the newly created Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church community entered into an agreement on the use of church premises with the Korshiv District Municipal Council.", "6. On 15 October 1991 the Ivano-Frankivsk Regional Council decided that the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church communities in Korshiv could use the church jointly. They had to agree on the details of the agreement. The applicant stated that the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church did not agree to use the church jointly and prevented the applicant from having its religious ceremonies in the church.", "7. On 20 June and 2 August 2000 and on 16 May 2001 the applicant applied to the IvanoFrankivsk Regional State Administration, seeking to be declared owner of the church of the Assumption.

On 12 February 2002 the Kyiv City Commercial Court (the \u201cKyiv Court\u201d) allowed the applicant\u2019s claim and declared it owner of the church. The Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church appealed.", "9. On 13 August 2002 the Higher Commercial Court quashed the judgment on the ground that the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church had not been informed about the proceedings. The case was remitted for examination to the Kyiv Court.", "10. In the course of the new examination, the applicant brought additional claims seeking to annul the agreement of 5 March 1991 concluded by the Council and the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (see paragraph 5 above). The court refused to entertain this action, indicating that the applicant was free to institute separate new proceedings concerning the agreement of 5 March 1991.", "11. On 22 January 2003 the Kyiv Court found against the applicant, stating that transfer of the church to the applicant would lead to an infringement of the rights of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church community. On 6 May 2003 the Kyiv Commercial Court of Appeal upheld this judgment. On 15 July 2003 the Higher Commercial Court rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal in cassation. On 13 November 2003 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant\u2019s request for leave to appeal in cassation.", "12.

According to paragraph 7 of the Practice Recommendation, the religious premises and property that belonged to State property were to be transferred into unpaid use or ownership of the religious organisations on the basis of the decisions taken by the regional, Kyiv and Sevastopol city state administrations and the Government of Crimea. The above-mentioned authorities were under an obligation to return such property, not used for religious purposes, within a period from 1992-1993. The return of property included transfer into unpaid use or ownership. The property could be returned to religious associations, which proved that they had owned the property before nationalisation. Thus, the Recommendation, with reference to Presidential Decree of 22 June 1996, mentioned that the transfer of ownership of the religious premises was one of the measures envisaged by law. Moreover, religious premises or property could be transferred to another religious association if there was no \u201clegal successor\u201d (\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043d\u0438\u043a) religious association found in the vicinity where the religious premises or property were situated.", "22.

Information or written evidence as to the previous ownership of religious premises was to be sought from the parties, State archives, or State Religions Committee (paragraph 9.4 of the Recommendation). Claims for the return of religious premises to their original ownership could be lodged under the provisions of the Property Act with the commercial courts, and the lodging of complaints with the courts of general jurisdiction did not impede the examination of such claims (paragraphs 9.4\u20139.6 of the Recommendation).", "23. Paragraph 9.8 of the Practice Recommendation stated that all property belonging to religious organisations before the entry into force of the Act was deemed to belong to the State and the State was to be regarded as the proper owner of such property. In particular, this ensued from the provisions of Article 366 of the Administrative Code of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic of 1927. Therefore, in accordance with section 4 of the Property Act, State bodies, which are mentioned in Section 17 of the law, could perform any lawful acts with respect to such property and the courts were to reject any claims against such lawful acts, unless these acts contravened the law."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
