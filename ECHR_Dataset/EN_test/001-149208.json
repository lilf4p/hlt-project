The applicant was born in 1976 and is currently detained in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Remand Centre.", "6. On 25 September 2006 the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) gave a decision, ordering the applicant\u2019s detention on remand for a period of three months. He was charged with a number of offences committed in an armed organised criminal group. At that time the applicant was serving a prison sentence imposed in another criminal proceedings against him. The end of that prison sentence fell on 18 November 2007.", "In its decision, the District Court relied on a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question. The court further emphasised the gravity of the offences and the likelihood of a heavy prison sentence being imposed on the applicant after conviction. According to the domestic court, the fact that the applicant was at the relevant time serving a prison sentence did not minimise the risk of him obstructing the proceedings. Additionally, the ongoing questioning of other members of the criminal group as well as the necessity to obtain other evidence justified remanding the applicant in custody.", "7. On 19 December 2006 and 26 June 2007 the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) extended the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention.

The courts considered that keeping the applicant in detention on remand was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings. They emphasised the complex character of the case and the considerable number of co-accused involved who, if released, would had obstructed the proceedings. The courts noted that due to the nature of the organised criminal group, its methods of influencing and bringing pressure to bear on the other members of the group as well as witnesses, the authorities had had difficulties in collecting evidence and taking statements.", "8. On 18 March 2009 the State Prosecutor (Prokurator Krajowy) lodged a bill of indictment against the applicant with the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Court.

The applicant lodged a number of motions to be released as well as appeals against the decisions extending his pre-trial detention, all in vain.", "In their decisions the courts repeated the grounds previously given for the applicant\u2019s detention.", "10.

The trial was eventually opened on 18 January 2010. Subsequent scheduled hearings were adjourned due to absences of some of the coaccused and problems with sound system in the court room.", "12.

The bill of indictment was only finally read out to the defendants at the hearing held on 27 May 2010.", "14. At the hearing of 28 May 2010 the Regional Court started taking evidence from the accused. It subsequently held fourteen hearings until the end of 2010, during which some of the accused gave evidence. Five of the scheduled hearings were adjourned due to sick-leaves of the accused. One hearing was adjourned because of the motion for disqualification of the presiding judge lodged by one of the co-accused.", "15. In 2011 the Regional Court continued taking evidence from the defendants. Of the twenty nine hearings scheduled for this year, eleven took place. The trial court adjourned fifteen hearings due to justified absences of the parties, three hearings were cancelled due to sick-leaves of the presiding judge and the lay judges.", "16.

At the hearing of 16 April 2012 the trial court started taking evidence from witnesses.", "Of the fourteen hearings cancelled this year, two were adjourned because of a sick-leave of a judge, three because of absences of witnesses, and the remaining nine hearings \u2013 because of absences of the parties.", "18. Until 30 July 2013 the Regional Court scheduled nine hearings for 2013, of which seven were adjourned due to justified absences of the defendants.", "19.

He sought a finding that the length of the criminal proceedings against him had been excessive and PLN 20,000 in compensation.", "21. On 27 July 2011 the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint. The court found that, considering the complexity of the case and the number of co-accused who had actively tried to obstruct the proceedings, the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Court had conducted the proceedings in a correct and timely manner. Consequently, the appellate court refused to award the applicant compensation."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
