During one of the hearings the trial court questioned the victim, P., who stated, without indicating the exact dates, that the applicant had raped him several times between September 2004 and April 2005. P. provided very detailed information about the circumstances of the rapes and about the events which had taken place before and after them. P. said that the applicant had raped him in his bedroom while the applicant\u2019s mother and sister were in the adjacent room. He said that he had been raped only by the applicant and not by other persons.", "20.

It sentenced him to ten years\u2019 imprisonment under paragraph 3 of Article 153 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 45 below). The applicant was absent from that hearing. The court based his conviction mainly on the victim\u2019s statements but also on the statements of P.\u2019s friends, mother, teacher, and witness A. and on a report drawn up by a psychiatrist who had examined P. and concluded that he could not have made up his account of the rapes.", "28. In February 2006 the applicant and his lawyer, B. appealed, arguing that the conviction was not based on sufficient evidence. In particular, the P., trial court had failed to establish on which dates P. had been raped, and the medical examination of the victim had revealed no injuries on the child\u2019s body. The applicant also argued, without providing further details, that the police had beaten him on 21 April 2005. He stated that he could not rape P. on 10 April 2005 because on that day he had sawn wood with M. He also stated that A. had given false statements during the trial because he himself had raped P. The statements of P.\u2019s mother were also false, the applicant had refused to give her money and she had wanted to take revenge. P. had made false statements during the trial because his mother had taught him to do so. The applicant submitted that A.\u2019s statements concerning the date of the alleged rape near the pond contradicted the statements of P.\u2019s mother (see paragraphs 21 and 23 above). He added that the trial court\u2019s judgment had been unlawful because it contained excessive descriptions of the rape scenes.", "29. Between May 2006 and March 2007 the applicant and his mother, acting on the applicant\u2019s behalf, lodged ten complaints with the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office which forwarded them to the Odessa Prosecutor\u2019 Office.

On 9 October 2006 the applicant sent his first letter to the Court.", "31. In November 2006 the Odessa Regional Court of Appeal (\u201cCourt of Appeal\u201d) informed the applicant that it would hold a hearing in his case on 12 December 2006.", "32.

It remains unknown why he was not brought to the court-room for the hearing.", "34. In the meantime, on the same date the Court of Appeal, in the presence of the applicant\u2019s lawyer, upheld the judgment of the first-instance court. On the basis of the findings made by the trial court, the Court of Appeal held that the arguments raised in the appeal by the applicant and his lawyer\u2019s arguments were ill-founded because they had been refuted by evidential material in the applicant\u2019s criminal case file. The trial court had fully and objectively assessed that material. The conclusions reached by the first-instance court had been supported by sufficient evidence, in particular the statements of P. and other persons questioned during the trial. The Court of Appeal did not question any witnesses; nor did it administer or assess any new evidence.", "35. On 16 January 2007 the applicant and his lawyer, B., lodged two separate appeals in cassation with the Supreme Court, raising the same arguments as those raised before the Court of Appeal. They also complained that the applicant had not been taken to the appeal court hearing, despite his request. However, they did not specify how the applicant\u2019s absence from the Court of Appeal had prejudiced his defence or the overall fairness of the proceedings.", "36. According to the applicant, on the same date, after the cassation appeals had been sent to the Supreme Court, lawyer B. stopped representing him. The reason was not notified to the Court. The applicant did not seek the assistance of any other lawyer.", "37. On 19 February 2007 the applicant lodged his application with the Court. He stated, in particular, that he had appealed in cassation, however did not provide a copy of his and his lawyer\u2019s appeals in cassation.", "38. On 2 April 2007 the Court requested the applicant to provide: (i) documentary evidence supporting his allegations of ill-treatment; (ii) copies of the complaints of ill-treatment lodged with the domestic authorities; (iii) copies of the applicant\u2019s and his lawyer\u2019s appeals in cassation, stamped by the Supreme Court to prove their receipt; and (iv) a copy of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision as soon as it would be available.", "39. On 25 June 2007 the applicant sent to the Supreme Court a supplement to his appeal in cassation together with a request for the said copies of documents without, however, indicating why he needed them. The Supreme Court received the request but did not reply to it for unknown reasons. The applicant did not follow up on the request.", "40. On 6 September 2007 the applicant informed the Court that the Supreme Court had left his request for copies of documents unanswered.", "41. On 15 November 2007 the Supreme Court dismissed the cassation appeals lodged by the applicant and his lawyer. Without referring separately to each argument raised in those appeals, the Supreme Court noted that the criminal proceedings against the applicant were not plagued by procedural violations which would justify quashing of the lower courts\u2019 decisions. The conclusion concerning the applicant\u2019s guilt had been sufficiently supported by evidence to which the trial court had referred in its judgment. The Supreme Court noted, in particular, that the applicant\u2019s request to take part in the appeal hearing had been made after that hearing had been held. The applicant did not attend the hearing before the Supreme Court and had not asked for permission to do so.", "42. On 27 November 2007 the Court asked the applicant to send to the Supreme Court a repeated request for copies of the same documents (see paragraphs 38 and 40 above), indicating that he needed them to support his application before the Court. The Court also asked the applicant to provide a copy of such request and a copy of the Supreme Court\u2019s reply to it. The applicant did not follow the Court\u2019s instructions and did not make any further attempts to obtain the copies.", "43. In December 2007 the applicant received a copy of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision and submitted it to the Court on 27 April 2008."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["34", "6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-c", "6-3-d"]}
