The prosecutor, having regard to the statements of the witnesses, the crime scene report, the post-mortem reports and the Diyarbak\u0131r Criminal Police Laboratory\u2019s reports, held that C\u00fcneyt Cesur had committed suicide by using his own gun.", "11. On 31 January 2011 the applicants lodged a criminal complaint with the Ak\u00e7akale prosecutor, claiming that the death of their son was suspicious and that the investigation which had already been concluded could not be considered to be an effective investigation. The applicants requested that another autopsy be conducted, claiming that the existing autopsy report was not sufficient. According to the applicants, the scars which they had noted on the head of their son at the time of his burial, did not match the findings recorded in the autopsy report. The applicant Adem Cesur, who is a retired police officer, claimed that his son had been shot on the left side of his head. The applicants further alleged that the place where the gun had been found raised suspicions, and complained of the fact that the mobile phones that their son had used were not examined. Lastly, the applicants also alleged that, when they went to Ak\u00e7akale eleven months after the incident, they had received more information from some of the witnesses, raising even more suspicions on the circumstances of their son\u2019s death", "12. On 10 March 2011 the Ak\u00e7akale prosecutor issued another decision of non-prosecution, on the grounds that the post-mortem report of 15 April 2009, the statements of the witnesses and the other evidence gathered by the investigators did not leave any room for doubt that the applicants\u2019 son had committed suicide. The public prosecutor also stated that a decision not to prosecute had already been taken in relation to the same incident and unless new evidence was discovered it was not possible to initiate a new criminal investigation under Article 172 \u00a7 2 of the Turkish Code of Criminal Procedure.", "13. The applicants filed an objection against the decision of non-prosecution, claiming that their son might have been shot by somebody else. The Siverek Assize Court examined the merits of both the prosecutor\u2019s decision and the applicants\u2019 objection in its decision of on 25 June 2011 and dismissed the objection. According to the court, the criminal investigation was conducted meticulously and that there was no reason to question any additional witnesses proposed by the applicants."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
