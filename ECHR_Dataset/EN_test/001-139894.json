On 3 May 2006 the applicant received a disciplinary punishment of 14 days of solitary confinement. He was also subject to certain restrictions concerning accessibility of the prison canteen, religious service, outdoor activities, etc. Furthermore, he was limited in receiving packages until the end of that quarter.", "9. The applicant submitted that throughout his detention in Mys\u0142owice Remand Centre he had been held in overcrowded cells which did not meet the basic standards of hygiene. According to the official statistics published by the Prison Service (S\u0142u\u017cba Wi\u0119zienna) at the relevant time the overcrowding in the facility ranged from 23 to 67%.", "10.

On 15 May 2006 the Mys\u0142owice District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) acknowledged that, at times, the applicant had indeed been held in overcrowded conditions. It dismissed his claim, finding that this practice had not been unlawful, as the penitentiary judge had been duly informed about the situation. The District Court also held that the applicant had failed to demonstrate that he had suffered any harm as a result of the overcrowding. It further considered that the overall sanitary conditions and the quality of food in the defendant remand centre had been adequate.", "13. On 2 June 2006 the applicant appealed against the above first instance judgment.", "14. On 8 June 2006 the Mys\u0142owice District Court decided to exempt the applicant from the court fee for appeal. The applicant was called to rectify the appeal by providing the court with a copy of the appeal, by informing the court about the scope of his appeal, by informing the court about the content of his appeal request and by paying the basic fee of 30 Polish zlotys [PLN] (approx. 7 euros [EUR] within 30 days. The court also informed the applicant that lack of rectification would result in rejection of the appeal.", "15. On 22 June 2006 the same court rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal for failure to pay the basic court fee.", "16.

On 17 July 2006 the Katowice Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) refused to grant the release.

The applicant, who attended the sitting, was also advised that he had a right to lodge, within seven days, an interlocutory appeal against that decision.", "21. On 19 July 2006 the applicant requested to be served with a copy of the decision, which was served on him on 1 August 2006.", "22.

Following an appeal by the prosecutor, on 7 February 2007 the Katowice Court of Appeal amended the Regional Court\u2019s decision and refused to release the applicant on probation. The Court of Appeal did not share the Regional Court\u2019s findings and considered that the applicant\u2019s sociocriminological forecast was a negative one. It stressed that the applicant had been an unrepentant, habitual offender who had often been subjected to disciplinary penalties while in detention. Lastly, the court observed that the applicant had not shown any interest in following an individualised resocialisation programme and that he had no specified plans for the future.", "27. On the applicant\u2019s request, filed on 20 March 2006, on 26 June 2006 the Katowice District Court issued an aggregate sentence composed of the applicant\u2019s previous convictions (wyrok \u0142\u0105czny).", "28.

Furthermore, the applicant was instructed that he could appoint a lawyer of his choice and that the time-limit of thirty days for lodging a cassation appeal by that lawyer would start to run on the date of service of that letter. The court\u2019s letter was served on the applicant on 11 January 2007. The applicant did not appoint a lawyer of his choice.", "31.
