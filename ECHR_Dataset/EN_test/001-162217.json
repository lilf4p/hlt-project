The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Tetovo.", "6.

On 1 February 2010 the Struga Court of First Instance (\u201cthe first-instance court\u201d) acquitted Sh.A. of charges of forgery of a document (\u201c\u0444\u0430\u043b\u0441\u0438\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430\u201c) concerning the vehicle\u2019s chassis number and rejected an indictment brought by a public prosecutor against a certain I.S. The court found that during the trial it had not been established that Sh.A. had altered the vehicle\u2019s chassis. In accordance with section 102(3) of the Criminal Proceedings Act (see paragraph 18 below), the court further advised the applicant, who had claimed compensation in the criminal proceedings, to pursue the claim by means of a separate civil action before the civil courts. On 21 July 2010 the judgment became final.", "9. On 16 November 2010 the applicant requested that the first-instance court return the vehicle in his possession.", "10. On 3 December 2010 the first-instance court heard evidence from the applicant, who stated that he had bought the vehicle from Sh.A. for EUR 25,000. He further stated that he could not have been aware at the time that the chassis number of the vehicle had been forged.", "11. On 6 December 2010 the first-instance court, relying on Article 100a (3) of the Criminal Code (\u201cthe Code\u201d, see paragraph 17 below), found that there were no grounds for confiscation of the applicant\u2019s vehicle. The applicant had not known nor could he have known that the vehicle had been used to commit a crime. The court also ordered that the registration certificate be returned to the applicant.", "12. Upon the public prosecutor\u2019s appeal, on 24 January 2011 the Bitola Court of Appeal (\u201cthe appellate court\u201d) quashed that decision. Relying on Article 100-a (2) of the Code, the appellate court found that the vehicle\u2019s chassis had been forged and that the vehicle, in the interest of public safety, could not be declared roadworthy. It further referred to section 100-a (3) of the Code and instructed the first-instance court to assess whether the continued use of the vehicle would constitute a \u201cuse of a forged document\u201d offence under the Code (\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0444\u0430\u043b\u0441\u0438\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0458\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430, see paragraph 17 below).", "13. On 22 February 2011 the first-instance court dismissed the applicant\u2019s application and ordered the confiscation (\u0441\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0437\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0430\u0442) of the vehicle and its registration certificate. It referred to Article 100-a (2) and (3) of the Code and found that the vehicle\u2019s chassis number had been forged and that the vehicle could be used for committing an offence. For that reason and for the reasons of road safety, it was necessary to confiscate the vehicle and the registration certificate. It also referred to section 532(1) of the Criminal Proceedings Act (see paragraph 18 below) and found that, irrespective of the fact that there had been no proceedings against the applicant and that he was not an offender, it was necessary to confiscate the vehicle for general safety reasons.", "14. On 11 March 2011 the applicant appealed arguing that the first-instance court had wrongly applied Article 100-a (2) and (3) of the Code and that he had not known that the vehicle had been used to commit a crime.", "15. On 19 May 2011 the appellate court dismissed the appeal and upheld the first-instance court\u2019s decision. The relevant part of the decision states as follows:", "\u201c[The arguments] raised in the appeals, [namely] that the first-instance court had not established the decisive facts concerning [the certitude] that the [applicant] had not known that the vehicle\u2019s chassis had been forged, which was decisive, are groundless. Specifically, it is true that [the applicant] did not know that the vehicle\u2019s chassis had been forged, as a result of which [he] registered the vehicle as its last buyer, [he was] issued a driving licence and [he] paid a large amount. However, [what is] primary under Article 100-a (2) of the [Criminal Code] is that the objects which were intended to [commit] an offence or were used to commit an offence shall be confiscated notwithstanding that they are not in the ownership of the offender or that they are in the ownership of a third person, if general safety, public health or ethics require so ...", "The fact that [the applicant] did not know that the vehicle\u2019s chassis had been forged does not signify that the conditions of Article 100-a(3) are met, but the first-instance court correctly found that the use of the vehicle with thus forged identification numbers would affect the safety of the road users in the State [\u0431\u0435\u0437\u0431\u0435\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0458\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u045c\u0430\u0458], and therefore also the general safety [\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0437\u0431\u0435\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442].\u201d", "16.
