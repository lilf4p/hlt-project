The applicant was arrested in the evening of 7 April 2009 and on the next day was sentenced by a court to ten days\u2019 administrative detention. According to the applicant, he was punched in the eye by a plain-clothes police officer during his arrest and then subjected to ill-treatment in the Buiucani police station and subsequently at the General Police Directorate (\u201cthe GPD\u201d). He was hit by groups of five to twelve persons, both in uniform and plain clothes, taken through a \u201cdeath corridor\u201d in which officers lined up and kicked or hit each victim as he or she passed through the corridor while being taken to or from the police station or, especially, the GPD.", "9. He was also hit on both ears simultaneously (a form of torture known as \u201cthe telephone\u201d), and struck on the head with fists and rubber sticks, all while his hands were handcuffed behind his back.

He was subjected to interrogation by several persons simultaneously and was forced to sign blank papers.", "13. On 11 April 2009 the applicant was seen by a doctor, who found a haematoma on his left eye.", "14.

On 19 April 2010 the investigating judge at the Buiucani District Court annulled the two decisions and ordered that a supplementary investigation be carried out. The court found that the prosecutors\u2019 decisions had been based only on the statements of the police officers accused of ill-treating the applicant. Moreover, while one of the prosecutors had found that force had been used to apprehend the applicant, which could explain any injuries on his body, the arresting officers had denied the use of any force.", "18. On an unknown date prior to 10 May 2010 a formal criminal investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations was initiated.", "19.
