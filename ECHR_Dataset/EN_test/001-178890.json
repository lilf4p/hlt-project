The Ohrid Archdiocese (\u041e\u0445\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0410\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0458\u0430), in its original form, existed until 1767, when it was abolished by the Turkish Sultan. As stated by the applicant association, after its abolition the territory over which the Ohrid Archdiocese had jurisdiction, which had included what is now the territory of the respondent State, fell under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, which in 1918 issued a canonical release of those territories to the benefit of the Serbian Orthodox Church (SOC). As stated by the Government, in 1943 it was decided that the Ohrid Archdiocese would be restored and continued by an autonomous Macedonian Orthodox Church (MOC). In 1959 the MOC seceded from the SOC, and in 1967 it declared autocephaly. The Head of the Holy Synod of MOC is designated as \u201cArchbishop of Ohrid and Macedonia\u201d (\u0410\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f \u041e\u0445\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438).", "6. In negotiations which have been continuing since then, on 17 May 2002 the two churches signed a draft agreement (known as \u201cthe Ni\u0161 agreement\u201d) which provided for ecclesiastical union between them. It further specified that the MOC would renounce its autocephaly and obtain widest autonomy within the SOC under the name \u201cOhrid Archdiocese\u201d.", "7. According to the Government, during the negotiations and the signing of the Ni\u0161 agreement, there had been strong reaction by the public, which regarded the draft agreement as \u201ca scandalous and indecent act of treason\u201d and, owing to strong pressure by the public, on 25 May 2002 the Holy Synod of the MOC ultimately rejected this agreement. The applicant association disagreed that the rejection of the agreement had resulted solely from the reaction by the public and submitted that \u201cthe main pressure came directly from the Macedonian authorities who stood behind the protests\u201d.", "8. Mr J. Vrani\u0161kovski, a bishop and a member of the Holy Synod of the MOC at the time, was supportive of the Ni\u0161 agreement. After the Holy Synod of the MOC had rejected that agreement, Mr Vrani\u0161kovski accepted a call by the SOC for reunification dated 20 June 2002; on 21 June 2002 he publicly announced that he was prepared for canonical union with the SOC. The Government submitted that that had provoked a public reaction and that there had been street protests in several cities in the respondent State.", "9. On 5 July 2002 the Holy Synod of the MOC dismissed Mr Vrani\u0161kovski on the ground that, by his unilateral accession to the SOC, he had violated the oath by which he had bound himself to safeguard the Church\u2019s unity and Constitution (see Vrani\u0161koski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.) 39168/03, 22 June 2010). On 23 September 2002 the SOC declared the dismissal of Mr Vrani\u0161kovski null and void and appointed him \u201cexarch of the Pe\u0107 Archbishop and the Patriarch of Serbia for all eparchies of the Ohrid Archdiocese\u201d.", "10. On 25 December 2003 the applicant association constituted its own Holy Synod and appointed Mr Vrani\u0161kovski as its President. By a letter of 16 January 2004, received by the Commission for religious communities and groups (\u201cthe Commission\u201d, \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438 \u0441\u043e \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0438 \u0438 \u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u0438) on 27 January 2004, Mr Vrani\u0161kovski requested an opinion as to whether the applicant association should be registered, given that \u201cin all civilised States a church, which is older than the State is accepted without needing to be registered.\u201d The letter, which remained unanswered, further stated:", "\u201c... the true Macedonian Orthodox Church is the Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese. It is a legitimate church, recognised by all churches in the world, so all who want to be Orthodox are welcome, the doors are open. Those who are schismatic should join the schismatic Synod (MOC). The Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese has nothing against the State registering schisms ... but it is against the State preventing its spiritual and leading operation in the Republic of Macedonia ...\u201d", "11. On 6 September 2004 Mr Vrani\u0161kovski submitted an application (\u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435) seeking that the applicant association be registered as a religious group (\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u0430). In support of the application, the applicant association submitted the following documents: (a) a founding decision of 1 September 2004 rendered by its Holy Synod. Under section 1 of that decision, the applicant association was defined \u201cas a voluntary, non-profit association of Christians that were not associated with any other religious community or group\u201d. Its aim was to acquire legal-entity status and to manage its property. The decision specified the temporary place of registration of the applicant association and authorised Mr Vrani\u0161kovski to submit an application for registration on behalf of the applicant association; (b) a list of its adherents; and (c) a Charter on the organisation and operation of the applicant (\u201cthe Charter\u201d). The latter provided that the applicant \u201cwould be autonomous within the canonical jurisdiction of the Pe\u0107 Patriarchy (the SOC)\u201d; it specified that its temporary place of registration would be in Bitola, in the respondent State, \u201cuntil it was possible to designate a permanent seat\u201d; and that the applicant association and its structural units were legal entities and could obtain and manage property. It further provided that all legal persons that the applicant association might set up could have bank accounts.", "12. On 30 September 2004 the Commission found the application to be incomplete, and requested that the applicant association submit the following further documents: a) a copy of a decision appointing the authorised person to seek registration of the applicant association and b) a copy of the minutes of the constituent assembly. On 18 October 2004 the applicant association submitted the requested documents.", "13. On 3 November 2004 the Commission dismissed the application (\u0441\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435\u0442\u043e \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430\u0432\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435) for the following reasons:", "(a) the application was not submitted by an authorised person. The Commission held that it had been submitted by a certain J.N. (Bishop D.) and not by Mr Vrani\u0161kovski, who had been authorised to seek registration of the applicant association;", "(b) the application for registration had been submitted outside the thirtyday time-limit specified in section 11 (1) of the Act on Religious Communities and Religious Groups (\u201cthe 1997 Act\u201d, see paragraph 47 below), which had started to run on 25 December 2003, the date on which the applicant association\u2019s Holy Synod had been set up (see paragraph 10 above);", "(c) relying on the applicant association\u2019s Charter, the Commission established that it would act as an autonomous religious group in canonical union with the Pe\u0107 Patriarchy (SOC). That the applicant association would operate as part of a foreign orthodox church was, in the Commission\u2019s view, in violation of section 12 of the 1997 Act. The Commission further stated that a religious community could be established only by nationals of the respondent State, and not by a foreign church or State;", "(d) the applicant association had emerged from an already existing and registered religious community, notably the MOC, whose position and role had been specified in the Constitution. The fact that the applicant association had sought registration under the name \u201cOrthodox Ohrid Archdiocese\u201d had implied that its real intention was to create a parallel orthodox religious group to the MOC, which had been using that name (Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese) \u201cconstitutionally, historically, actually and continuously\u201d (\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e, \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438, \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0435\u043b\u043d\u043e \u0438 \u0432\u043e \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442) for over eight centuries. That was not in compliance with section 8 (2) of the 1997 Act, under which only one religious community could be registered for one faith group. The Commission referred to a decision of the Constitutional Court which had found that provision compliant with the Constitution. It had ruled that the provision had protected people from being manipulated and same-faith believers from being divided into several religious groups (U.br.223/97 of 28 October 1998, see paragraph 54 below). The Commission also argued that the Preamble to the Constitution of the MOC specified that it was the canonical successor to the Ohrid Archdiocese. This was confirmed on 17 July 1967 when the Ohrid Archdiocese declared autocephaly, which was continued by the MOC. The Commission further held that on 6 August 2004 the MOC had asked the Industrial Property Bureau (\u201cthe Bureau\u201d, \u0417\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434 \u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0448\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u043d\u0434\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u043f\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442) to register the name \u201cMacedonian Orthodox Church-Ohrid Archdiocese\u201d in its trademark register (TM 2004/574).", "Moreover, on 13 August 2004 the MOC had asked the Commission to prevent registration of several names, including the name \u201cOhrid Archdiocese\u201d, to which it was entitled for historical, religious and moral reasons; and", "(e) the Commission held that property-related provisions of the applicant\u2019s Charter were contrary to section 9 of the 1997 Act, according to which a religious group was a voluntary, non-profit association of believers.", "14. In its decision of 3 November 2004, the Commission further referred to several international documents and a Declaration that the Parliament of the respondent State adopted in 2004 regarding the MOC (see paragraph 51 below).", "15. The applicant association complained against this decision, arguing that:", "(a) the application for registration had been submitted by Mr Vrani\u0161kovski. J.N. had only handed it over to the Commission\u2019s archives;", "(b) the applicant association had been founded formally on 1 September 2004. On 25 December 2003, the date to which the Commission referred in its decision, the applicant association had only appointed the members of its Holy Synod;", "(c) the applicant association was a new religious community that had no connection with, let alone stemmed from, the MOC, which, in any event, had not been recognised by any Orthodox Church;", "(d) the fact that the MOC had sought to have the Bureau add \u201cOhrid Archdiocese\u201d to its name was irrelevant, since no such name existed in the Commission\u2019s records;", "(e) the applicant association had denied that it had been set up by a foreign church or a foreign State. That it would operate in canonical union with another church of same religion did not imply that it had been founded contrary to section 9 (2) of the 1997 Act;", "16. On 11 January 2005 the Government Appeal Commission (\u041a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0430\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0432\u043e \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043f\u043a\u0430 \u0432\u043e \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u043d \u043e\u0434 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0448\u043d\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438, \u0441\u0443\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043e, \u0434\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430, \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0434 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440) dismissed the appeal, finding no grounds to depart from the established facts and the reasons given by the Commission.", "17. The applicant association challenged these decisions before the Supreme Court. In addition to the arguments already raised, it submitted that its name was neither identical with nor similar to the name of any other religious community or group registered by the Commission.", "18. On 9 November 2005 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim. It held that the applicant association\u2019s name had implied creation of a parallel religious community, rather than a religious group as claimed, given that its name was substantially the same as the name of the MOC. The court referred to the applicant association\u2019s Charter and found that its determination to operate as an autonomous church in canonical union with the Pe\u0107 Patriarchy was contrary to the fact that the MOC had canonical jurisdiction in the territory of the respondent State. It also held that property-related rules were in violation of section 16 of the 1997 Act. The court accepted the remaining reasoning given by the administrative bodies. That decision was served on the applicant on 15 July 2006.", "19. On 15 July 2007 Bishop D. applied to the Constitutional Court, claiming that the refusal of the authorities to register the applicant association violated the freedom of belief and religion specified in Article 110 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution. While relying on the decisions of the authorities refusing the applicant association\u2019s registration as \u201cOrthodox Ohrid Archdiocese\u201d, he also notified the court that a fresh application for registration had been submitted under the name \u201cGreek-Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese of the Pe\u0107 Patriarchy\u201d (see paragraphs 23-34 below). He stated, inter alia:", "\u201c... it is obvious that followers of our religious organisation have been deprived of the rights specified in Articles 16 and 19 of the Constitution for seven years ... the Greek-Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese of the Pe\u0107 Patriarchy is a religious organisation which should protect the religious needs of, among others, Serbs and Greeks in the Republic of Macedonia. It is an autonomous church under jurisdiction of the Pe\u0107 Patriarchy, notably the Serbian Orthodox Church ...\u201d", "20. On 9 September 2009 (U.br.184/09) the Constitutional Court rejected the appeal, which, as specified in the decision, concerned \u201cfreedom of belief and prohibition of discrimination on religious grounds\u201d. Relying on, inter alia, Articles 9, 16 and 19 of the Constitution (see paragraphs 4244 below), the court found:", "\u201cThe complainant did not claim personal protection from discrimination ... but, he acts as a representative of a group of people with which he is associated ...\u201d", "21. It further stated:", "\u201cThe Constitutional Court has no jurisdiction to decide on the rights and interests of citizens in specific cases before administrative and judicial bodies. Neither has it jurisdiction to decide as a hierarchically superior court and examine the lawfulness and constitutionality of decisions adopted by competent administrative bodies ... the complainant refers to the non-registration as an action, but such an action ... stems from an individual decision which this court is not competent to examine ... the registration of ... a religious community or a group does not determine the religious beliefs and internal religious belief of a person, since expression of beliefs is an individual act, the registration procedure does not affect personal religious belief and rituals, and the court has not been presented with any evidence that they have been violated at any point.\u201d", "22. The court also held that the appeal had been submitted outside the two-month time-limit specified in the Rules of the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 52 below), calculated since 9 November 2005, the date of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision (see paragraph 18 above).", "23. On 20 September 2007 a new Act on the legal status of churches, religious communities and religious groups (\u201cthe 2007 Act\u201d) was adopted. It entered into force on 1 May 2008.", "24. On 3 and 6 April 2009 the applicant association inspected the register of churches, religious groups and communities (\u201cthe court register\u201d) of the Skopje Court of First Instance, which became, by virtue of the 2007 Act, the registration court. From 11 November 2008 onwards the MOC was recorded in the court register as \u201cMacedonian Orthodox Church-Ohrid Archdiocese\u201d. The registration decision stated that in communication with third parties it would use the name \u201cMacedonian Orthodox Church\u201d.", "25. According to \u201cthe minutes of the constituent assembly\u201d (\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043e\u0434 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0447\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435) \u201c... at the proposal of His Beatitude (\u041d\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0411\u043b\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e), the Archbishop of Ohrid and Metropolitan of Skopje Mr Jovan (Vrani\u0161kovski), the Holy Synod of the Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese composed of (Bishops J., M., and D., all Macedonian nationals) convened a meeting on 27 April 2009 in order to adopt decisions for setting up and registration of \u201cthe Greek-Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese of the Pe\u0107 Patriarchy\u201d. The minutes of the constituent assembly were signed by all three bishops (their personal identity numbers and addresses were provided therein).", "26. On the same date a decision setting up the applicant association was adopted. As stated in its introductory part, \u201cat a meeting dated 27 April 2009 the Holy Synod decided to submit a request to the Skopje Court of First Instance for registration of \u2018the Greek-Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese of the Pe\u0107 Patriarchy\u2019\u201d. It was set up \u201cas a voluntary, non-profit organisation of Christians who are not associated with any other registered religious community, and, in particular, has no connection with (the MOC)\u201d. It further stated:", "\u201cIt is an Orthodox church in full canonical and liturgical union with all recognised Orthodox churches in the world. For this reason, we consider that we should be registered as a church, but if the court considers otherwise, we would accept registration as a religious community or religious group.\u201d", "27. The decision further indicated that the applicant association\u2019s temporary place of registration would be in Bitola, in the respondent State. Bishop D. was authorised to submit the application for registration. He was also nominated to act on behalf of the applicant association (\u0437\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0432\u0430) in relations with other legal entities until \u201c... Mr Jovan (Vrani\u0161kovski) returned from exile\u201d.", "28. The applicant association\u2019s Charter on the status, organisation and operation of the association (\u201cthe Charter\u201d) provided that it was \u201can autonomous church under the canonical jurisdiction of the Pe\u0107 Patriarchy\u201d (section 2). The Holy Synod was \u201cthe highest managerial body\u201d of the applicant (section 6). It was composed of the Archbishop and two eparchy bishops (section 9). The assembly of archbishops (\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0441\u043a\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435) was \u201cthe supreme regulatory, administrative, supervisory and executive body concerning internal, financial and religious self-management\u201d (section 12).", "29. On 28 April 2009 Bishop D. submitted an application for registration of the \u201cGreek-Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese of the Pe\u0107 Patriarchy\u201d as \u201cone of the churches\u201d in the respondent State. The application expressly stated that the applicant association would agree to be registered as a religious community or group if the registration court found this more appropriate. The applicant association further expressed willingness to submit any documents, if need be, in order to avoid its application being refused. It was also stated that a refusal to register a religious group would be unjustified in a democratic society unless it was proven that the teaching of the group was destructive. That had not been the case with the \u2018\u201cGreek-Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese of Pe\u0107 Patriarchy\u2019 which is two thousand years old\u201d. It further stated that:", "\u201c... any refusal to register \u2018the Greek-Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese of the Pe\u0107 Patriarchy\u2019 is an obstacle to the Republic of Macedonia\u2019s future membership of the European Union ... It will not be pleasant, at the present time and place in history, if a judge appears as a persecutor of a church. Any person who does not respect human rights and freedoms regarding association of people on religious grounds, especially if he or she is a judge ... does not differ much from famous persecutors of the Holy Church ... we wrote the above in order to warn that it will be unpleasant if the court does not register \u2018the Greek-Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese of the Pe\u0107 Patriarchy\u2019 ...\u201d", "30. On 10 July 2009, without reference to the applicant, the registration court sought an explanation from the MOC as to the meaning of the notion of \u201cPe\u0107 Patriarchy\u201d. On 21 July 2009 the MOC replied (the reply was reproduced in the decision of the registration court of 28 July 2009, see paragraph 31 below) as follows:", "\u2018\u201cPe\u0107 Patriarchy\u2019 forms part of the name of the Serbian Orthodox Church and expresses the historical continuity of the Serbian Orthodox Church as canonical heir of the Pe\u0107 Patriarchy: in the same way the name \u2018Ohrid Archdiocese\u2019 is part of the name of the Macedonian Orthodox Church. The name \u2018Ohrid Archdiocese\u2019 is protected by the Macedonian Orthodox Church in the Industrial Property Bureau. The Serbian Orthodox Church, specifically the Pe\u0107 Patriarchy, has no canonical or any other jurisdiction over the Macedonian Orthodox Church or in the territory of the Republic of Macedonia.\u201d", "31. On 28 July 2009 the registration court dismissed the applicant association\u2019s request for registration in the court register (\u0441\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435\u0442\u043e \u0437\u0430 \u0443\u043f\u0438\u0441) for the following reasons:", "(a) it was founded by the so-called Holy Synod, as a body, which was contrary to section 2 of the 2007 Act (see paragraph 49 below) according to which a decision to establish a religious entity was to be taken by the founding members at a constituent assembly. No such assembly had been held in the applicant\u2019s case;", "(b) the application for registration concerned an organisation which had not been provided for under the 2007 Act. Its name did not specify whether it was a church, religious community or religious group. On the contrary, it implied that it was a divine organisation, which would operate as an autonomous Archdiocese under the canonical jurisdiction of the Pe\u0107 Patriarchy. \u201cIt did not state that it was a voluntary organisation of physical persons\u201d as required under section 2 of the 2007 Act;", "(c) the intended name of the applicant association included names or terms that were part of or indicated a relationship with the official names of States or religious communities or canonical territories already registered and under foreign jurisdiction. In this connection it held that the term \u201cGreek\u201d (\u0413\u0440\u043a\u043e) was an English translation of \u201cOrthodox Church\u201d. Its use was not in conformity with the 2007 Act (section 10 (3)). The \u201cOrthodox Ohrid Archdiocese\u201d partly covered the generic and historical name of the MOC; it did not differ from the latter\u2019s registered name. That name (Ohrid Archdiocese) has been used by the MOC \u201cconstitutionally, historically, actually and continuously\u201d for over 800 years, and only the MOC had the \u201chistorical, religious, moral and substantive right\u201d to use it. In this connection the court held that the legal status, name and official insignia of the MOC were safeguarded by the 2007 Act and the Constitution. That the applicant\u2019s intended name implied that it was under the territorial jurisdiction of a foreign church was in contravention of the 2007 Act and other laws. It was so because the MOC had canonical jurisdiction in the territory of the respondent State. It was only formally indicated that the applicant association would operate as an autonomous church. If registration was granted \u201cit would operate in the territory of the respondent State as part of a foreign orthodox church ... it would operate and be managed autonomously within the canonical jurisdiction of the Pe\u0107 Patriarchy, notably (the SOC) ... which had no canonical or any other jurisdiction over (the MOC) or in the territory of (the respondent State).\u201d That was in violation of Article 1 of the UN Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, Article 18 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 9 of the Convention;", "(d) the founding decision had specified only the temporary place of registration of the applicant association, without specifying \u201ca specific seat and address\u201d (\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043e \u0441\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435 \u0438 \u0430\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0430), as required under section 13 \u00a7 1 (2) of the 2007 Act; and", "(e) Bishop D. was nominated to act on behalf (\u0437\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0432\u0430) of the applicant association, but not to represent (\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0443\u0432\u0430) it, as required under section 12 \u00a7 2 (5) of the 2007 Act.", "32. The registration court concluded that the applicant association\u2019s registration would run counter to the 2007 Act. It further stated that:", "\u201c(such a registration would violate) the freedom of religion ... of all physical persons, which they manifest through already registered religious communities. It would also violate the legitimate legal status of other voluntary associations of persons recorded in the court register ... their management bodies, hierarchy, competencies, titles, religious activities ...\u201d", "33. The applicant appealed, arguing (i) that the court had erred when seeking \u201can expert opinion\u201d about the meaning of \u201cPe\u0107 Patriarchy\u201d from the MOC, which was not neutral; (ii) that the registration of the MOC in November 2008 under the name \u201cMacedonian Orthodox Church-Ohrid Archdiocese\u201d had been unlawful. In this connection, the applicant submitted extracts from several media reports published at the time, according to which the competent body of the MOC, at its meeting held on 4 and 5 October 2008, had refused to change the name in its Constitution; (iii) that the MOC had applied to the Bureau for registration of the name \u201cMacedonian Orthodox Church-Ohrid Archdiocese\u201d as a trademark was irrelevant, since the Industrial Property Act concerned goods and services and not religious organisations. In this connection, the applicant argued that, in any event, the Bureau had confirmed that on 6 August 2004 the MOC had requested registration of seventeen trademarks, including the trademark \u201cMacedonian Orthodox Church-Ohrid Archdiocese\u201d. However, the MOC had never paid the registration fee for any of the trademarks for which registration had been sought. Consequently, those names were never registered as trademarks, nor were trademark certificates ever issued; (iv) the applicant association was set up by three founding members who had signed the minutes of the constituent assembly held on 27 April 2009. Consequently, the court had been wrong to hold that the founding decision had been rendered by the applicant association\u2019s Holy Synod, as that body had no legal capacity to act before the applicant association was registered; (v) no reasonable explanation had been given as to why the applicant association\u2019s intended name did not imply that it concerned a religious organisation; (vi) the court\u2019s interpretation that the expression \u201cGreek\u201d was an English translation of \u201cOrthodox Church\u201d was wrong; (vii) the intended name of the applicant association was different from the name of any registered religious organisation, including the name of the MOC to which \u201cOhrid Archdiocese\u201d had been unlawfully added. In this connection the applicant stated \u201c(it) differs from the MOC, with which we refuse to be associated.\u201d It further submitted that the court had allowed registration of two churches despite the fact that their names were substantially the same, namely \u201cChristian Adventist Church (church of the Adventists of the Seventh Day) in the Republic of Macedonia\u201d and \u201cChristian Adventist Church in Macedonia\u201d. It concluded the discussion under this head by saying that \u201chad the court had difficulty with the intended name, it could have raised that issue in written correspondence and we would have replied. This clearly suggests that the court would refuse to register [the applicant association] under any name\u201d; (viii) the registration court had given unsubstantiated explanations of a theological and historical nature favourable to the MOC; (ix) the applicable legislation did not preclude a religious community from being in canonical union with other churches in the world; (x) the refusal to register the applicant association violated the freedom of religion of the orthodox Greeks and Serbs in the respondent State, as the intended name suggested that it represented those communities; and (xii) lastly, the applicant association reiterated that it was ready to rectify any error the registration court might ask it to.", "34. On 4 February 2010 the Skopje Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant association\u2019s appeal, reiterating the reasoning given by the registration court.", "35. On an unspecified date thereafter, D.N. (Bishop D.) submitted a constitutional appeal to the Constitutional Court, claiming that the authorities\u2019 refusal to register the applicant as \u201cthe Greek-Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese of the Pe\u0107 Patriarchy\u201d had affected his religious rights specified in Articles 16 and 19 of the Constitution and Article 9 of the Convention. In this connection, he claimed that the religious organisation with which he was affiliated had not been allowed registration for many years, and thus had been denied the opportunity to obtain legal-entity status. He stated \u201cI\u2019m prevented from exercising my freedom of religious observance in association with other people on a voluntary basis.\u201d He further argued that without legal-entity status the applicant association was prevented from enjoying certain statutory rights: it could not construct religious temples; its members could not conduct religious ceremonies; it could not instruct religion or create religious schools; and it could not manage its property, nor could it hold bank accounts. Bishop D. invited the court to consider his appeal as submitted on behalf of all members of his religious organisation. Since the Constitutional Court had already rejected a similar appeal lodged on behalf of several people (U.br.182/09, see paragraph 55 below), he consented that his appeal be regarded as being submitted only in his name. He further stated:", "\u201cI agree, and after having consulted the other members of my religious community, I know that they also agree, that the Constitutional Court orders registration of the Greek Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese of the Pe\u0107 Patriarchy under conditions specified by law and we would adjust to any requirements set by the court. If a change in the name is needed, that should be indicated as a condition for our registration and once it is satisfied, (we) should be registered. If another condition should be fulfilled, that should be specified and we will try to accommodate it.\u201d", "36. On 15 December 2010 the Constitutional Court rejected the constitutional appeal of D.N. concerning \u201cthe freedom of belief and prohibition of discrimination on religious grounds\u201d (U.br.118/10). Referring to the courts\u2019 decisions rejecting the applicant association\u2019s request for registration as \u201cGreek-Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese of the Pe\u0107 Patriarchy\u201d and relying on Articles 9, 16 and 19 of the Constitution and Article 9 of the Convention, the court stated:", "\u201cThe court cannot examine the appeal on the merits since the complainant did not comply with the formal statutory requirements before a competent court (for registration of the applicant). The complainant is willing to comply with the statutory requirements for registration, but he has failed to do so in practice and (he) does not prove that the competent court was wrong in its judgment that those requirements had not been complied with ... in such circumstances, this court cannot rule on the request for the protection of human rights and freedoms in relation to specific final decisions of competent bodies. It is so since the person concerned (\u0441\u0443\u0431\u0458\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0442) did not take any action in the court proceedings to comply with the statutory requirements, which apply similarly to all citizens. This derives from his request that this court suggest to him what needs to be done for (the applicant association) to be registered, which implies knowledge that there were (certain) flaws which led to non-registration. The complainant was not a priori refused registration of his religious community by a final judicial decision. The refusal he received was for non-compliance with the statutory requirements.\u201d", "37. An article published in the daily newspaper Dnevnik on 26 September 2002 quoted the then Chairman of the Commission (see paragraph 10 above), who stated that:", "\u201cnot at any price will Bishop Jovan (Vraniskoski) be allowed to perform religious rituals or to have a seat in an exarchate.\u201d", "38. An article published in the daily newspaper Vest on 8 April 2004 quoted the following part of a joint statement by the then President of the respondent State and the Archbishop of the MOC:", "\u201cThe MOC and the Macedonian State are and will remain together. Schismatics and renegades should be marginalised, isolated and rejected. The media attention they receive, irrespective of motives and intentions, affects both the MOC and Macedonian national and State interests.\u201d", "39. An article published in the daily newspaper Ve\u010der on 23 November 2006 reported on discussions held between the Prime Minister of the respondent State and the Archbishop of the MOC regarding certain provisions of the 2007 Act. Following that discussion, the majority of bishops in the MOC, as stated in the article, had requested that the MOC should not accept any compromise which would prevent it from protecting itself against a parallel church, led by Mr Vrani\u0161kovski, being created.", "40. An article published in the daily newspaper Ve\u010der on 2 June 2009 reported on the alleged discontent of the applicant\u2019s followers about its name as submitted in the second registration proceedings. In this connection the article quoted a letter by Mr Vrani\u0161kovski in which he allegedly stated:", "\u201cThe (Holy) Synod was governed by the idea that the name of the religious community in respect of which we seek registration does not betray the essence of our Church. You know well that Greek-Orthodox does not mean Greek (by nationality) of Orthodox faith, but that name refers to all known Christian Orthodox Churches.\u201d", "41. The article continued, stating that Mr Vrani\u0161kovski had further asserted that the second part of the name was reasonable because the \u201cOhrid Orthodox Archdiocese\u201d was a part of the Pe\u0107 Patriarchy."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["11"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["11-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
