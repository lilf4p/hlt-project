De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["5. The applicant was born in 1968 and is currently serving a prison sentence in Sokal Prison no. 47 in the Lviv region.", "6. In February 2000 the applicant was detained on suspicion of several counts of robbery and a murder. He claimed that he had been beaten by the police.", "7. On 13 September 2000 the Zaporizhzhya Regional Court (\u201cthe Zaporizhzhya Court\u201d), sitting as a court of first instance, found the applicant guilty as charged. It sentenced him to life imprisonment for murder and considered that the prison terms for the other crimes were absorbed by the life sentence. The court dismissed the applicant\u2019s allegation of ill-treatment as unsubstantiated.", "8. On 21 December 2000 the Supreme Court of Ukraine upheld the judgment.", "9. On 30 October 2009 the Supreme Court reviewed the applicant\u2019s case under an extraordinary procedure and commuted his sentence to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment. It reasoned that life imprisonment had not been listed as a possible penalty in the Criminal Code on the date when the murder for which the applicant had been sentenced had been committed.", "10. On 6 December 2001 the applicant was transferred to Vinnytsya Prison no. 1, which had a section for life prisoners, to serve his sentence. That prison is located some 700 kilometres from Zaporizhzhya, where the applicant had been living before his detention and where his mother lived. The train journey from Zaporizhzhya to Vinnytsya takes from twelve to sixteen hours.", "11. On numerous occasions the applicant and his mother, Mrs Kapiton, who acted on his behalf as his representative under a power of attorney, asked the State Department of Ukraine for the Enforcement of Sentences (\u201cthe Prison Department\u201d) to transfer the applicant to a prison closer to his home to make it easier for her to visit him. They drew attention, in particular, to the long travel time from Zaporizhzhya to Vinnytsya by public transport, which was very burdensome for Mrs Kapiton given her advanced age (born in 1938) and poor health (she had been officially certified \u201csecond-degree\u201d (medium) disabled).", "12. On 10 June and 15 September 2004 the Prison Department replied to the applicant\u2019s mother that her request had been rejected, since \u201cin accordance with the legislation in force, convicted prisoners must serve their entire sentence in the same prison\u201d.", "13. On 29 October 2004 Mrs Kapiton arrived at Vinnytsya Prison to visit the applicant. During the visit she fainted and was provided with medical assistance for low blood pressure. Her meeting with the applicant was not resumed once she had recovered, on the recommendation of a medical professional.", "14. On many subsequent occasions Mrs Kapiton continued to contact various authorities on her own and the applicant\u2019s behalf, requesting his transfer to a prison closer to his home to enable her to visit him. She always enclosed with her requests the medical certificate confirming her disability and her doctor\u2019s advice not to travel outside the Zaporizhzhya region.", "15. All Mrs Kapiton\u2019s requests were rejected. On numerous occasions (on 2, 12 and 18 November 2004, and on 12 February, 21 and 24 March 2005) the Prison Department repeated its previous reasoning, referring to the legal requirement that prisoners must serve their entire prison term in the same establishment.", "16. On 17 March 2006 the Prison Department informed the applicant\u2019s mother that her request could not be granted because no places were available for life prisoners in establishments closer to Zaporizhzhya.", "17. On 3 May 2006 the Prison Department wrote to the applicant\u2019s mother again, informing her that the applicant was supposed to serve his entire sentence in the same prison and that, in any event, there were no places available in prisons closer to his home.", "18. On 7 August 2006 the Prison Department further notified the applicant that, in accordance with unspecified regulations, persons convicted of aggravated murder were usually detained in prisons located outside the region in which the crime had been committed.", "19. On 16 November 2006, 8 August 2007 and 24 March 2009 the Prison Department reiterated, in reply to the repeated requests of the applicant\u2019s mother for his transfer, that \u201cunder the legislation in force, convicted prisoners must serve their entire sentence in the same prison\u201d.", "20. On 1 December 2009, following a review of the applicant\u2019s sentence (see paragraph 9 above), the Prison Department\u2019s regional commission on prisoner distribution, allocation and transfers examined his case. It decided that he would be held in a maximum-security prison, in ordinary accommodation. Pursuant to that decision, on 10 December 2009 he was transferred to Sokal Prison no. 47 (a maximum-security prison) located in the Lviv region, around 1,000 kilometres from Zaporizhzhya. The train journey from Zaporizhzhya to Lviv takes from nineteen to twenty-three hours.", "21. On an unspecified date Mrs Kapiton complained to the Prison Department that that transfer was unfair, as Sokal Prison was even further away from the applicant\u2019s home address.", "22. On 17 February 2010 the administrative commission of Sokal Prison examined the applicant\u2019s request that the level of security of his prison regime be reduced from high to medium security. It was noted that, under the Code on the Enforcement of Sentences, a prisoner could be transferred from a high to a medium-security prison if he had already served more than half of his sentence and if he had been manifesting good behaviour as an indication of his willingness to improve. However, the applicant had been disciplined eleven times and was not therefore eligible for such a transfer. Accordingly, his request was rejected. It remained open for him to challenge that decision before the regional commission of the Prison Department.", "23. On 17 April 2010 the Prison Department\u2019s regional commission on prisoner distribution, allocation and transfers rejected the applicant\u2019s request for transfer to a prison in the Zaporizhzhya region. As noted in the minutes of its meeting, the applicant had been disciplined twelve times.", "24. On 26 April 2010 the Prison Department further informed Mrs Kapiton that its appeal board had rejected the applicant\u2019s request for transfer to a medium-security prison in the Zaporizhzhya region, and that decision would be reviewed only if his conduct improved.", "25. The applicant\u2019s mother then requested the applicant\u2019s transfer to a prison in the Donetsk or Lugansk region (neighbouring the Zaporizhzhya region).", "26. On 17 November 2010 the Prison Department appeal board rejected her request. As noted in its meeting report, the applicant had been disciplined fifteen times and had received no incentives.", "27. The applicant suffers from ingrowing eyelashes of the left eye, which have to be removed periodically. His mother made a general allegation, without providing any factual details, that he had been hit in his left eye following his arrival at Vinnytsya Prison. No further information is available as to the duration and origin of the above-mentioned condition.", "28. As regards the medical treatment for the ingrowing eyelashes, the applicant\u2019s submissions to the Court were limited to his mother\u2019s general statement, which she had made on two occasions, in November 2005 and April 2010, that the responsibility for the condition lay with the authorities and that, although the ingrowing eyelashes were regularly removed, the applicant felt pain and discomfort in his left eye.", "29. On an unspecified date in 2005 the applicant\u2019s mother complained to the prosecutor\u2019s office that the applicant\u2019s eye problem was connected to his alleged beating by prison guards following his arrival at the prison in 2001.", "30. On 5 and 25 April 2005 the Vinnytsya Prosecutor\u2019s Office responded that there was no basis for launching a criminal inquiry into that complaint. In particular, the applicant had not requested a medical examination or assistance on account of any injuries inflicted on him. Furthermore, according to the testimony of other prisoners who had arrived at the prison together with the applicant, they had not experienced or witnessed any beatings. The prosecutor also noted that the applicant\u2019s condition was under constant medical supervision. In particular, he had his ingrowing eyelashes removed by a qualified ophthalmologist on a regular basis. No other health-related complaints had been recorded.", "31. According to extracts from the applicant\u2019s medical file provided by the Government, the applicant had had his ingrowing eyelashes removed on 21 January, 26 March, 9 July and 13 December 2004, as well as on 1 August 2005 and 4 January 2008. Furthermore, on 30 June 2010 and 6 April 2012 he had refused medical examinations and treatment.", "32. The applicant and his mother, acting on his behalf, complained to the prosecution authorities and the Prison Department about the routine monitoring of his correspondence by the prison administration.", "33. The prosecutor\u2019s response was that the applicant\u2019s correspondence was subject to monitoring under the legislation in force; however, there had been no instances of withholding letters or seizing objects which the prisoners were allowed to keep.", "34. On 7 July 2003 the Vinnytsya Regional Prison Department wrote to the applicant\u2019s mother, in reply to her complaint regarding, in particular, the interference with his correspondence, that on 11, 16 and 23 April 2003 the prison administration had \u201cwithheld some letters written by [the applicant], because their content did not comply with the requirements of the Instruction on Review of Prisoners\u2019 Correspondence\u201d.", "35. On 3 October 2006 the Prison Department informed the applicant\u2019s mother that no correspondence had been withheld from the applicant and that since the beginning of the year he had sent fifty-one letters and had received twenty-four recommended letters and thirty-eight standard letters. There had been no complaints from the applicant himself regarding his correspondence.", "36. On 14 November 2006 the applicant made a written statement that he had no complaints against the prison administration.", "37. On 21 November 2006 the Vinnytsya Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office wrote to the applicant\u2019s mother informing her that the applicant had sent fifty-six letters, had received seventy-two letters, and that he had had fifteen paid telephone conversations.", "38. On 12 May 2008 the applicant made a written statement that he had no complaints concerning the work of the prison official in charge of the monitoring of prisoners\u2019 correspondence.", "39. On 19 June 2008 the applicant asked the prison administration to allow him to make a telephone call on 24 June 2008 instead of a short-term private meeting to which he was entitled. According to a hand-written note on the request, apparently added by a prison official, the applicant\u2019s last private meeting had been on 26 December 2007.", "40. On 27 July 2009 the applicant asked the prison administration to allow him to make a telephone call on 3 August 2009. As noted on the request, he had last made a telephone call on 3 May 2009.", "41. According to the official records, during the period from 16 August 2002 to 30 September 2009 the Vinnytsya prison administration dispatched sixty-nine letters from the applicant."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
