De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["1. The applicant, Mr A.\u010c., is a Lithuanian national, who was born in 1949 and is detained in Kybartai (in the Marijampol\u0117 Region).", "2. The application was initially allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). The Court decided of its own motion to grant the applicant anonymity (Rule 47 \u00a7 4 of the Rules of Court). On 1 November 2015 the Court\u2019s Sections were reorganised. The application was thus reallocated to the Fourth Section (Rule 25 \u00a7 1 and Rule 52 \u00a7 1).", "3. The applicant was granted leave to represent himself in the proceedings before the Court. The Lithuanian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms K. Bubnyt\u0117.", "4. Since 1971 the applicant has been convicted more than ten times of various crimes, including sexual assault of minors, possession of child pornography, unlawful possession of narcotic substances, and falsification of official documents. At the time of the lodging of his application with the Court he was serving a prison sentence for sexual crimes against minors, and at the time of the present judgment he was serving another prison sentence for similar crimes.", "5. The applicant claimed to be a board member of several non-governmental organisations, an author of various publications, a member of the anti-Soviet resistance and a political prisoner of the Soviet regime. Meanwhile, the Government submitted that he had falsified documents purportedly proving his participation in the anti-Soviet resistance, and that he was widely known to the Lithuanian public solely because of his long history of sexual crimes against minors.", "6. On 23 December 2000 the newspaper Laikinoji sostin\u0117 published a two-page article entitled \u201cPerverts are getting more impudent\u201d (I\u0161kryp\u0117liai \u012f\u017e\u016bl\u0117ja) (hereinafter \u201cthe first article\u201d). The article had twelve sections, the first eight of which discussed various instances of sexual crimes against minors committed in the city of Kaunas. The last four sections of the article were dedicated to the applicant. The first of those four, entitled \u201cConvicted for paedophilia\u201d, discussed his conviction for sexually assaulting a minor in 1995. The second section, entitled \u201cSuspicion regarding an armed assault\u201d, stated that in 1988 the applicant had established a political party, and that in 1998 he had complained to the police that he had been the victim of an armed assault. The third section, entitled \u201cPretended to be a doctor\u201d, stated that the applicant had had his first encounter with the police in 1971, after he had pretended to be a doctor and had performed \u201cmedical check-ups\u201d on underage girls. The final section of the article (the fourth one dedicated to the applicant) was entitled \u201cHad [sexual] intercourse with his mother\u201d (Santykiavo su savo motina) and consisted of four paragraphs. The first three paragraphs described several instances in the 1980s and 1990s when the applicant, pretending to be a doctor, had examined people in an educational institution and a public bath, and had drugged and sexually assaulted a male university student. The last paragraph of that section read:", "\u201cAround 1985, law enforcement officers had a suspicion that [A.\u010c.] may have had sexual relations with his mother, with whom he lived ... During a search [of the applicant\u2019s apartment], officers found photographs in which the well-known pederast of Kaunas was depicted with his mother in specific positions. It was decided not to open a case.\u201d", "The article did not include any photographs of the applicant or his mother.", "7. On 7 June 2004 the magazine Ekstra published a six-page article entitled \u201cPornography \u2013 a flourishing illegal business\u201d (Pornografija \u2013 klestintis nelegalus verslas) (hereinafter \u201cthe second article\u201d). The article had seventeen sections. The first five sections discussed clandestine photo studios in Kaunas which had pornographic photoshoots. The sixth section of the article, entitled \u201cThe \u2018classic\u2019 pornographer\u201d (Pornografijos \u201eklasikas\u201c), was dedicated to the applicant. Its relevant parts read:", "\u201cIn 1985 [law enforcement officers] had many concerns about sexual relations between the well-known paedophile of Kaunas, [A.\u010c.], and his mother, with whom he lived.", "That year, during a search of his home, officers found photographs in which the paedophile, who enjoyed presenting himself as \u201cDoctor Andrey\u201d, was depicted not only with minors, but also with his mother, while having sexual intercourse in non-traditional positions. However, it was decided not to open a case. In November 2003 [A.\u010c.], who until then had avoided longer prison sentences for sexual crimes, was sentenced to about eight years of imprisonment.\u201d", "The article printed a photograph of the applicant with the following caption:", "\u201cThe \u2018classic\u2019 pornographer, [A.\u010c.], who for a long time used to lure teenagers to his apartment, sexually assault them and take their photographs, was convicted of sexual crimes in November 2003 and sentenced to about eight years of imprisonment.\u201d", "The remaining eleven sections of the article contained interviews with photographers involved in erotic photography, and discussed the business of intermediaries taking young Lithuanian women to foreign countries to work as escorts.", "8. On 21 June 2004 the applicant contacted Ekstra and asked it to publish a retraction of the part of the article concerning sexual relations between him and his mother (who had died in 1989). The applicant submitted a draft retraction, but the magazine refused to publish it on the grounds that the text contained insulting language.", "9. Subsequently, the applicant submitted a complaint regarding the second article to the Inspector of Journalistic Ethics. On 20 January 2005 the Inspector concluded that the statements about sexual relations between the applicant and his mother were \u201cof a clearly degrading character\u201d (akivaizd\u017eiai \u017eeminan\u010dio pob\u016bd\u017eio), and \u201cundoubtedly caused negative public opinion\u201d (neabejotinai sukelia neigiam\u0105 nuomon\u0119 visuomen\u0117je).", "10. On an unspecified date in 2005 or 2006 the applicant lodged a civil claim for damages against the journalist who had written the second article, D.D., and the magazine Ekstra. He argued that the claims concerning sexual relations between him and his mother had been erroneous, and that the publication had humiliated him, damaged his reputation and caused him emotional distress.", "11. In their reply to the claim, D.D. and Ekstra submitted that the disputed statements in the second article had been based on the information published in the first article. They therefore argued that, in line with domestic law (see paragraphs 29-32 below), the publishers of the second article could not be held liable for republishing erroneous information which had not been publicly retracted. They further submitted that, in any event, the disputed claims were true and testimony to that effect could be provided by law enforcement officers who had searched the applicant\u2019s apartment in 1985. Lastly, they argued that because of the applicant\u2019s long history of sexual crimes, there was a general interest in making such information public, and that \u201cas far as someone with such a reputation was concerned, it was impossible to cause any more dishonour\u201d (tokios reputacijos asmeniui dar labiau sumenkinti jo garb\u0119 nebe\u012fmanoma).", "12. Subsequently, the applicant amended his claim to also include the author of the first article, S.P., and the company which owned the Laikinoji sostin\u0117 newspaper. He also alleged that that publication had included erroneous claims about him and his mother, which had damaged his reputation and caused him emotional distress.", "13. In their reply to the amended claim, S.P. and the newspaper company submitted that the first article had not stated that the applicant had had sexual relations with his mother, but only that law enforcement officers had had such suspicions. They also submitted that, in line with domestic law (see paragraph 31 below), the applicant could not bring court proceedings against them, because he had not asked the newspaper to publish a retraction within two months of the disputed publication. They asserted that in December 2000 the applicant had been interviewed by S.P. and some television journalists; subsequently he had sued the television broadcasting company, but not Laikinoji sostin\u0117. Accordingly, S.P. and the newspaper company submitted that the applicant had known about the first article and its contents, but had failed to ask for a retraction within the time-limits provided for in law.", "14. The Vilnius Regional Court held a hearing on 1 February 2007. During that hearing the applicant denied having given an interview to S.P. in 2000, and claimed that he had not been aware of the first article until the current court proceedings had started. However, when asked by the judge how that article could have caused him any emotional distress if he had not known about it, the applicant replied that he had heard rumours about the publication but had not seen it himself. The court also heard the testimony of a witness requested by the applicant, who stated that in 2004 he had been imprisoned together with the applicant and had seen other prisoners insult and humiliate him because of the statements published in the second article. The hearing was adjourned at the applicant\u2019s request, and the court ordered the defendants to provide the disputed photographs of the applicant and his mother.", "15. The next hearing was held on 12 July 2007. The Vilnius Regional Court heard another witness requested by the applicant, who also stated that the second article had led to insults and humiliation of the applicant by other prisoners. The hearing was adjourned at the applicant\u2019s request in order to allow his new lawyer to acquaint himself with the case file.", "16. On 22 November 2007 the Vilnius Regional Court suspended the civil proceedings pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings instituted by the applicant (see paragraphs 17-21 below).", "17. On 7 November 2007 the applicant brought a private prosecution against D.D. and the editor of Ekstra, V.V., accusing them of defamation, insult, and contempt of the memory of a deceased person, under Article 154 \u00a7 2, Article 155 \u00a7 1 and Article 313 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code. He also submitted a civil claim for damages.", "18. On 14 April 2008 the Vilnius City Third District Court held a hearing in the criminal case. During the hearing the applicant submitted that the defendants were former supporters of the Soviet regime, and the purpose of the publication had been revenge for his political and public activities. Meanwhile, D.D. stated that his purpose had been to warn the public about the applicant\u2019s dangerous sexual activities and that, when preparing the article, he had spoken to S.P. and a prosecutor, M.R, who had confirmed the existence of the disputed photographs. That prosecutor was called as a witness and testified that he had personally seen such photographs. However, the photographs were not submitted to the court, because the prosecution archives of 1985 had already been destroyed.", "The applicant made an application for the court to call additional witnesses who could testify about the damaging effects of the second article, and to obtain documents proving that S.P. and M.R. had participated in anti-independence repression during the Soviet occupation. The court rejected his applications as unfounded and unnecessarily time-consuming with regard to the proceedings.", "19. The next hearing was held on 21 April 2008. The applicant made an application for the Vilnius City Third District Court to call witnesses who could testify about the circumstances of his mother\u2019s death, but the court rejected that application as unrelated to the case. In his final address to the court the applicant insisted that the statements about his sexual relations with his mother were false and unproven, and that D.D. and V.V. had published them to insult and humiliate him. Meanwhile, D.D. and V.V. argued that they had made a sufficient effort to verify the disputed statements \u2013 they had relied on the first article, which had not been publicly retracted, and had interviewed law enforcement officers who had had the relevant knowledge. They also submitted that the purpose of the article had not been to insult or humiliate the applicant, but to inform the public about a dangerous person known for his sexual crimes. They emphasised that the article had examined a certain aspect of life in the city of Kaunas, and statements about the applicant had constituted only a small part of it.", "20. On 10 May 2008 the Vilnius City Third District Court acquitted D.D. and V.V. of all charges. The court held that the criminal offence of defamation consisted of the intentional distribution of erroneous information about another person, but D.D. and V.V. had had reasonable grounds to believe that the disputed statements about the applicant and his mother were true, because they had been previously published in another newspaper and not retracted. The court also held that the criminal offence of insult consisted of the public humiliation of another person in an intentionally obscene or offensive manner, whereas a mere negative opinion about another person, presented in a civil manner, would not qualify as criminal insult. The court considered that the disputed statements of the second article, albeit amounting to negative characterisation of the applicant, had been presented in a neutral manner which was not offensive, and that D.D. and V.V. had not intended to insult the applicant. Lastly, the court dismissed the charge of contempt of the memory of a deceased person as time-barred. The applicant\u2019s civil claim for damages was left unexamined.", "21. The applicant appealed against that judgment, but on 16 July 2008 the Vilnius Regional Court upheld the acquittal. It emphasised that, in criminal proceedings, the burden was on the prosecuting party to prove that statements published by defendants had been erroneous, or that defendants had intended to insult a victim. The court considered that the applicant had not discharged that burden. It also held that the first-instance court had been justified in not hearing the additional witnesses requested by the applicant, (see paragraphs 18-19 above), because those witnesses could not have provided any information relating to D.D. and V.V.\u2019s alleged intention to defame or insult the applicant.", "22. Subsequently, the Vilnius Regional Court resumed the examination of the applicant\u2019s claim for damages against the publishers of both articles (see paragraphs 10-16 above). In a hearing held on 5 February 2009 the court heard another witness called by the applicant, who stated that the publication of the second article had led to insults against the applicant among his fellow prisoners. The hearing was adjourned at the applicant\u2019s request.", "23. The next hearing was held on 30 June 2009. At the applicant\u2019s request, the court ordered a linguistic examination of the disputed statements in the first article, in order to determine whether they could be understood as unequivocally stating that the applicant had had sexual relations with his mother. The examination was carried out by the Institute of the Lithuanian Language, which delivered its conclusion on 20 October 2009. It found that the article did not unequivocally state that the applicant and his mother had had such relations, but that it could raise suspicions that such relations may have existed.", "24. On 23 September 2010 the Vilnius Regional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim. It held that domestic law provided for a mandatory out-of-court settlement procedure in cases concerning the publication of allegedly erroneous statements in the media, in accordance with which the applicant should have asked the publisher of the first article to retract it within two months of its publication (see paragraphs 29-32 below). The court noted that the applicant had missed that time-limit and had not asked for its renewal. As a result, he could not claim any damages from the publishers of the first article. The court further held that the disputed statements in the two articles were essentially identical, and thus the publishers of the second article could not be held liable for republishing the contents of the first article, as long as they had not been publicly retracted.", "25. The applicant submitted an appeal in which he insisted that he had not known about the first article until he began the civil proceedings against the publishers of the second article. On 28 December 2011 the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal and upheld the first-instance judgment. The court underlined that the two-month time-limit to request a retraction was necessary in order to protect journalists from the unreasonable burden of having to prove the truthfulness of information which had been published a long time ago, especially in cases such as the one in question, where the applicant had complained more than four years after the publication of the first article. The court also referred to the submission of S.P. and the newspaper company that the applicant had been interviewed in December 2000 as part of the preparation of the first article (see paragraph 13 above), and concluded that the applicant ought to have known that the impending publication would concern him. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal found that the journalists could not be held responsible for the applicant\u2019s own failure to take timely action in respect of the first article.", "26. On 30 March 2012 the Supreme Court refused to examine a cassation appeal submitted by the applicant on the grounds that it raised no important legal questions.", "27. Relevant provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania read:", "Article 22", "\u201cPrivate life shall be inviolable ...", "The law and courts shall protect everyone from arbitrary or unlawful interference with his private and family life, as well as from encroachment upon his honour and dignity.", "...\u201d", "Article 25", "\u201c...", "No one must be hindered from seeking, receiving, or imparting information and ideas.", "The freedom to express convictions, as well as to receive and impart information, may not be limited otherwise than by law when this is necessary to protect human health, honour or dignity, private life, or morals, or to defend the constitutional order.", "The freedom to express convictions and to impart information shall be incompatible with criminal actions \u2013 incitement to national, racial, religious, or social hatred, incitement to violence or to discrimination, as well as defamation and disinformation ...\u201d", "28. In its ruling of 15 May 1998 the Senate of the Supreme Court of Lithuania held the following:", "\u201c3. A person\u2019s honour and dignity ... shall be protected when all of the following facts are established: a) information has been disseminated; b) that information concerns the claimant; c) it is humiliating to the claimant\u2019s honour and dignity; d) it is erroneous.", "The right to a private life ... shall be protected when all of the following facts are established: a) information has been disseminated; b) that information concerns the claimant; c) it concerns the claimant\u2019s private life; d) it has been disseminated without the claimant\u2019s consent; e) there is no legitimate public interest in receiving that information ...", "...", "12. ... A civil claim for the protection of honour and dignity ... must specify ... what disseminated information is humiliating or erroneous ...

Acquittal of a person accused of libel on the grounds that no criminal offence has been committed, as well as the refusal to open a criminal case or the decision to terminate it due to the expiry of statutory limitations ... does not preclude a victim from submitting a civil claim for the protection of his or her honour and dignity ...", "18. It must be underlined that Article 71 of the Civil Code and Article 21 of the Law on the Provision of Information to the Public seek to protect two distinct values: a person\u2019s honour and dignity, and a person\u2019s right to private life. They can be violated by different facts and thus must be distinguished ... Information about a person\u2019s private life can be made public without his or her consent only when its publication does not cause any harm to that person, when that information may help to disclose criminal offences and breaches of law, or protect human rights and fundamental freedoms, and when that information is disseminated in a public court hearing ... The right to a private life is protected ... irrespective of whether the disseminated private information is humiliating to the person\u2019s honour and dignity or not ...\u201d", "29. At the material time, Article 7 of the 1964 Civil Code, which remained in force until 1 July 2001, provided in its relevant parts:", "\u201cIndividuals or organisations have the right to ask a court to retract information which is erroneous and damages their honour and dignity.", "If such information was published by the mass media, the court shall examine requests for retraction only after the individual or organisation in question has provided the publisher with a written retraction ... and the publisher has failed to retract the erroneous information ...", "If the publisher does not substantiate that the disputed information corresponds to reality, the court shall oblige it to retract the information in question ...\u201d", "30. Article 2.24 of the 2000 Civil Code, in force from 1 July 2001 onwards, provides in its relevant parts:", "\u201c1. A person shall have the right to demand the retraction, in judicial proceedings, of information which has been made public and which denigrates his honour and dignity and is erroneous; in addition to the right to compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage incurred by the placing in the public domain of the aforementioned information ... Information which has been made public shall be presumed to be erroneous, unless the publisher proves the opposite to be true.", "2. Where erroneous information has been made public by the mass media (including the press, television and radio), the person who is the subject of the publication shall have the right to provide a proposed retraction, and to demand that the media source concerned publish the aforementioned retraction free of charge or make it public in some other way. The media source shall publish the retraction or make it public in some other way within two weeks of receipt. The media source shall have the right to refuse to publish the retraction or make it public, only in such cases where the content of the retraction contradicts good morals ...", "...", "5.

At the material time, Article 45 \u00a7 2 of the Law on Provision of Information to the Public provided that a written request to retract information had to be submitted to a producer or disseminator of public information within two months of the information being published.", "32. At the material time, Article 55 \u00a7 1 (3) of the Law on Provision of Information to the Public provided that a producer of public information could not be held liable for the publication of erroneous information if that information had been previously published in other mass media sources, and had not been retracted by the media source which published it.", "33. Article 2.23 of the 2000 Civil Code, in force from 1 July 2001 onwards, provides that information about a person\u2019s private life may be made public only with his or her consent.", "34. At the time of the publication of the first article, Article 21 \u00a7 1 of the Law on Provision of Information to the Public provided for civil liability of the producer or disseminator of information who published information about a person\u2019s private life without his or her consent, where that information was degrading to the person\u2019s honour and dignity. At the time of the publication of the second article, Article 54 \u00a7 1 of the amended version of that Law provided for civil liability of the producer or disseminator of information who published any kind of information about a person\u2019s private life without his or her consent.", "35. In its ruling of 13 January 2003 in civil case no. 3K-3-41/2003, the Supreme Court held:", "\u201c[T]he defendant disseminated ... in newspaper publications ... information about the birth of the claimant\u2019s son, his last name, alimony granted by courts, and so forth, and thereby breached the claimant\u2019s and her son\u2019s right to a private life.
