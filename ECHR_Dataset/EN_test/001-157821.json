Although the present case primarily relates to the anti-riot operation of 26 September 1999, that operation in fact constituted the climax of a series of long-standing conflicts between the Ulucanlar prison staff and some of the 170 male and female prisoners convicted of belonging to illegal extreme left-wing organisations (\u201cthe leftist prisoners\u201d).", "It transpires from old classified documents exchanged among the office of the prosecutor attached to Ulucanlar Prison (\u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s office\u201d), the Governor of Ankara (\u201cthe Governor\u201d) and the various regional gendarmerie commands, including the Ankara Gendarmerie Command (\u201cthe CDGA\u201d), that the hostilities between the prison authorities and the prisoners dated back to 1996 (see paragraph 8 below). Since that time the authorities had been aware of the problems, particularly relating to overcrowding and the age and inadequate facilities of the Ulucanlar complex, which, moreover, had been intended as a short-term prison and should never have housed convicted prisoners. It transpires from the various information sources that the exiguity of the living area in the \u201cdormitories\u201d was central to the leftist prisoners\u2019 complaints and actions, which they conducted together despite their political differences and personal conflicts of interest.", "A clearer picture might be gained of the present dispute by recapitulating the factors mentioned in the above-mentioned exchange of documents and the facts noted by the five-MP sub-commission set up under the Commission of Inquiry into Human Rights in the Turkish National Assembly (\u201cthe Sub-Commission\u201d) in order to investigate and ascertain the circumstances under which the impugned incidents had occurred.", "8. On 5 January 1996, under the Governor\u2019s supervision, the prosecutor\u2019s office, the CDGA, the gendarmerie unit on duty at Ulucanlar (\u201cCGP\u201d) and the other gendarmerie commands drew up their so-called \u201cAnti-Prison Riot Action Plan No. 1\u201d. The authorities in question were convinced that the leftist prisoners were planning a mass break-out, that they would therefore probably engineer an internal clash among the various extreme left-wing fractions in the prison and would dig tunnels, knock down walls, occupy the roofs, start fires and, finally, trigger an insurrection against the prison authorities. The authorities considered that as the CGP lacked the operational capacities to deal with such eventualities, they had to work together in order to identify the ringleaders and ensure durable security in the prison.", "On 16 January 1996 the Governor ratified the plan, under which the CGP would be backed up by auxiliary forces, that is to say two senior officers and twenty gendarmes, to be seconded from other commands, accompanied by the local police.", "9. However, that plan was not implemented as foreseen.", "Accordingly, on 31 July 1996 the authorities met to reassess the situation and draw up a new Action Plan in accordance with the Prime-Ministerial Directive of 12 November 1993 concerning the suppression of rioting in prisons.", "On 2 August 1996 the Secretary General of the National Security Council urged the relevant ministries and several decision-making bodies, as well as the Governors\u2019 Offices, to implement that new plan promptly, drawing on some more specific coercive measures. In substance, the parts of the plan relevant to the assessment of the present case were based on short- and medium-term actions, as follows:", "\u2013 refusing any compromise with the \u201cterrorist\u201d organisations, as this would encourage them to make impossible demands;", "\u2013 reaffirming the State\u2019s determination to combat such propaganda-based movements;", "\u2013 endeavouring to restore the State\u2019s authority in prisons and to reform the legislation on internal prison surveillance;", "\u2013 transferring the leaders of the \u201cterrorist\u201d organisations to other appropriate prisons;", "\u2013 preparing television programmes involving specialists capable of analysing and assessing the mental state of insurgent prisoners and the difficulties encountered by the security forces in combating terrorism;", "\u2013 conducting counter-propaganda vis-\u00e0-vis sections of the media being used by the \u201cterrorist organisations\u201d in relation to conditions of detention;", "\u2013 making public declarations conducive to reducing the impact of propaganda sullying the reputation of and demoralising members of the security forces, and emphasising the determination of the ministries, political parties and senior officials to combat any form of insurrection in prisons.", "10. Nevertheless, no practical action was taken until two years later, because of an escalation in criminal activities in Ulucanlar between 1 January and 1 August 1998, including one murder involving the use of a firearm, one murder by stabbing, one case of arson, one attempted escape, one case of hostage-taking of prison officers and four cases of infliction of serious bodily harm.", "On 7 August 1998 the CDGA alerted the authorities (by letter, HRK no.: 0621-3094-98/ ASY\u015e [7476]) to the risks arising from the aforementioned situation, which, it said, had robbed the prison staff of all their authority. According to the CDGA, although security outside the prison premises was duly guaranteed by the gendarmerie, \u201cit was only a matter of time before the volcano inside the building erupted\u201d.", "Having received that information, the Governor drew the attention of the Justice and Interior Ministers and the prosecutor\u2019s office to the following findings, which he considered called for urgent action:", "\u2013 Ulucanlar is an old prison which no longer meets current standards, and its structure encourages prison breaks via tunnels, given that the prison premises, and in particular the living areas, contain vegetation and trees blocking the prison guards\u2019 view, which facilitates the digging of such tunnels and concealment of the earth extracted;", "\u2013 the passages between dormitories run through the living areas, thus hampering any necessary intervention by the guards; the fact that the dormitories are adjacent to each other promotes the hierarchisation of the prisoners, ideological indoctrination, racketeering and all modes of communication with the outside;", "\u2013 under pressure exerted by leftist prisoners, the prison doctors use dietary pretexts to bring all kinds of foodstuffs and medicines into the prison; the prison staff are also unscrupulous; some of them act as messengers and smugglers; and the prison guards can only inspect the dormitories if the prisoners authorise it;", "\u2013 the leftist prisoners post up ideological placards around the living areas; the doors to the dormitories and living areas are left open between presence checks, the prisoners are free to move around the premises as they wish, including the female dormitory, and they even stand guard over various parts of the prison;", "\u2013 it is common knowledge that the prisoners in Ulucanlar have weapons, mobile telephones, shovels, picks, iron bars, cudgels and stones, ready to be used during riots; during the most recent searches, three handguns, two mobile phones and five SIM cards were discovered on the premises.", "11. From September 1998 onwards the leftist prisoners gradually took over Ulucanlar Sector 3. That sector comprised male dormitories nos. 4 and 5 and the female dormitory, where virtually no routine inspections had been carried out since 1996.", "According to the authorities, no concessions were to be made to those individuals, whose complaints concerning, in particular, inadequate living space in the dormitories, were pure fabrication.", "The main developments during that period can be summarised as follows.", "12. On 4 September 1998, at the request of the Ankara public prosecutor\u2019s office (see letter no. 119083), the gendarmerie issued an order (HRK no.: 3590-553-98/ASY\u015e [8221]) to carry out the hitherto impeded searches and transfers of the leftist prisoners.", "13. At about 5 am on 6 September 1998 a search operation was instigated in Ulucanlar Prison. However, under explicit instructions from the Directorate General of Prisons attached to the Ministry of Justice (\u201cDGPM\u201d) and the prosecutor\u2019s office, dormitories nos. 4 and 5 and the female dormitory, as well as the dormitory exclusively housing former MPs, were excluded from the searches. The reasons behind those instructions are still unknown.", "Following that operation, 104 prisoners were transferred, and the authorities discovered, in particular, 19 skewers and stilettos, 5 large nails, 24 fruit knives, 7 Stanley knives, 1 packet of Stanley knife blades, 2 daggers, 2 penknives, 5 cudgels, 5 grams of cannabis and 2 mobile phones, complete with accessories.", "14. On 9 September 1998 the Governor sent the Ministers of Justice and the Interior a confidential letter from the CDGA (HRK no.: 0621-3356-98/ ASY\u015e 8373) listing the dysfunctions observed at Ulucanlar during the 6 September operation and the results of the latter, which can be summarised as follows:", "\u2013 at the end of the operation, the prisoners convicted of terrorist offences forced the windows and doors of their dormitories open and began to move freely around the building, with a view to protesting against the search and the transfer of their cellmates;", "\u2013 on 7 September the same individuals installed barricades in the corridors with banners proclaiming \u201cthe revolutionary prisoners shall never be slaves\u201d; some prisoners smashed through the dormitory ceilings and climbed on to the roofs, while others began to prowl around in small groups, armed with cudgels;", "\u2013 on 8 September the prisoners demanded to talk to the authorities, which was not authorised as they refused to submit to body searches and twice intentionally set off the prison alarm bell;", "\u2013 continuing overnight until the next morning, the prisoners set up further barricades with beds and pieces of wood from doors and windows; they also plundered the kitchens, the dispensary and the canteen, purloining all the food items and also all the sharp instruments and storing them in dormitories nos. 4 and 5.", "15. The talks mentioned in that letter finally took place at around 10 a.m. on 9 September. A delegation made up of a CDGA lieutenant-colonel, the public prosecutor, the Prison Director and the CGP commander heard the spokesmen for dormitories nos. 4 and 5 and the spokeswoman for the female dormitory, namely the applicants Sad\u0131k T\u00fcrk, Halil T\u00fcrker and Fatime Akal\u0131n, respectively. Complaining that they had been given no advance notice of the search operation, those persons, in particular:", "\u2013 demanded the return of their leader, K.\u00c7., who had been transferred to the Eski\u015fehir E-type prison;", "\u2013 requested that the prison staff involved be spared any disciplinary sanctions in respect of the incidents which had occurred;", "\u2013 requested leave to talk to their lawyers, Z.R. and K.B., and the families to be designated by the latter;", "\u2013 denounced the ill-treatment inflicted and the visiting restrictions imposed by the gendarmes on their comrades in hospital, as well as the body searches, which they claimed had gone far beyond external inspection of clothing.", "The case-file contains no mention of the authorities\u2019 reaction to those demands.", "16. A second series of searches was scheduled for 2 p.m. on 10 September 1998.", "At the request of the Prison Director and the prosecutor\u2019s office, dormitories nos. 4 and 5 and the female dormitory were once again excluded from the search on the grounds that the prison guards would take charge of that part of the operation. However, none of those dormitories was in fact inspected.", "At the end of that second operation, the gendarmes confiscated the following items discovered in other parts of the premises:", "\u2013 1 7.65-mm semi-automatic Browning pistol (series no. 999666), 1 7.65-mm semi-automatic Browning pistol (no series number) complete with magazine and seven bullets and 1 7.65-mm pistol marked \u201cFovmar Harsformp Polcon Faoil Sotm\u201d (series no. 4443) with twenty-five 7.65-mm bullets;", "\u2013 1 large dagger, 6 knives, 1 flick knife, 6 home-made blades and 10 skewers;", "\u2013 3 cudgels, 2 metres of cabling and serum bottles containing mixtures for Molotov cocktails and pieces of iron;", "\u2013 5 SIM cards and 2 mobile phones, complete with accessories.", "Moreover, the record of the search which was drawn up by the gendarmes mentioned the following facts:", "\u2013 the skylights leading to the roofs had been dismantled,", "\u2013 cudgels and stones had been strewn along the corridors,", "\u2013 preparations had been made for manufacturing Molotov cocktails in the attic,", "\u2013 barricades had been erected close to the entrances, using stovepipes and old cupboards, and", "\u2013 the empty tanks on the roofs had been disconnected and moved to block access.", "On 28 October 1998 the CDGA alerted, in vain, the Ministries of Justice and the Interior to the absolute necessity of acting to counter the situation whereby Ulucanlar had become a \u201cterrorist training centre\u201d.", "17. In January 1999 the local gendarmerie unit began receiving complaints to the effect that the prisoners were still in possession of firearms and had started digging a tunnel in the female dormitory. The complaints continued until July 1999, when a number of prison guards were taken hostage for a few hours.", "The gendarmerie had offered to intervene on several previous occasions, but the administrative authorities had consistently turned them down as regards dormitories nos. 4 and 5 and the female dormitory.", "The main information on that episode are summarised below.", "18. On 19 February 1999 the CDGA wrote to the authorities concerned to inform them of the following:", "\u2013 in the absence of effective surveillance at Ulucanlar, the prisoners convicted of terrorism were free to do as they wish;", "\u2013 during the inspection of the drains in the female dormitory, heaps of gravel had been discovered, and the authorities were duly informed; on 21 January 1999 an 18m-long tunnel was discovered and blocked;", "\u2013 there was reason to suspect that similar works had also been conducted in dormitories nos. 4 and 5;", "\u2013 it was well-known that \u201cterrorists\u201d housed in different prisons communicate via mobile phones which had been smuggled in, and that this was how they planned their joint actions;", "\u2013 moreover, messages faxed from official machines showed that those persons also had access to standard office applications in order to devise their strategies.", "19. There were no further incidents until 4.45 pm on 19 July 1999, when the prisoners from dormitories nos. 1 to 3, having declared that they had ended their protest actions, allowed the Deputy Governor of Ulucanlar and the Head Warden in, and then held them as hostages until 5.15 p.m. There were no injuries.", "20. On 20 July 1999 the CGP informed the CDGA and the regional commands (via message HRK no.: 0621-2533-99) of that incident, following which the rebels had allegedly attempted to occupy the roofs, having climbed up through the ventilation shafts and forced the duty guards to back off; they had also reportedly stolen a gas cylinder and concealed iron bars and cudgels in their dormitories, probably, according to the CGP, in order to riposte to any possible intervention by the security forces.", "Still on 20 July 1999, the CDGA reported (message HRK no.: 0621-2540-99) that Sector 3 for leftist prisoners housed 32 individuals in dormitory no. 4, 81 in dormitory no. 5 and 43 in the female dormitory, that is to say a total of 156 convicted prisoners, including 47 PKK members. According to the CGP, the latter had not supported the actions of the other prisoners and had disassociated themselves from them vis-\u00e0-vis the security forces, nor did the prisoners in dormitories nos. 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10 and 14 and the \u201cofficials\u2019 dormitory\u201d pose any kind of threat. On the other hand, according to the CGP, the leftist prisoners were potentially dangerous, because it was well-known that on a number of occasions they had obtained solvents, glue, fuel oil and bottles of serum in order to manufacture Molotov cocktails for use should the gendarmes raid their dormitories.", "21. On the following day the CGP once again wrote to the CDGA (message HRK no.: 0621-752-99) to inform it that when the prison guards had recently been taken hostage, the attackers had stolen their victims\u2019 uniforms and that they could therefore be expected to attempt to escape wearing the uniforms. That message was forwarded (HRK no.: 0621-2548-99) to all the officials and concerned.", "22. Between 1 August and 1 September 1999 the CGP kept the CDGA informed every day (via telegrams HRK nos.: 0621 et seq.) of the continued refusal by the prisoners in dormitories nos. 4 and 5 and the female dormitory to answer the presence checks and to respect the curfew and the compulsory closing of doors. Each message was immediately forwarded to all the other bodies concerned.", "23. On 2 September 1999, according to the faxes distributed by the CDGA (messages HRK nos.: 0621-3128-99 et seq.) and the CGP (messages HRK nos.: 0621-879-99 and 880-99), the leftist prisoners demolished the wall of dormitory no. 7 adjacent to their own dormitory, expelled its occupants and took over the premises. Following this takeover, they refused even more vehemently to comply with the presence checks, disrupted the prison rounds and impeded the prison guards in the exercise of their duties. That situation continued for about twenty days.", "24. Still on 2 September 1999 the Director of Ulucanlar, backed up by the DGPM, once again complained of the criminal activities of the leftist prisoners in dormitories nos. 4 and 5 and requested the intervention of the gendarmerie to restore order (letter no. M-1999/2-12).", "Nevertheless, immediately after that request, the Minister for Justice ordered that no such operation should be instigated.", "The CGP then informed the CDGA (telegram no. 1999/2-12) that the operation had been cancelled, even though the leftist prisoners were still occupying dormitory no. 7 and continuing to refuse to comply with the evening presence checks. The prison guards and gendarmerie patrols at Ulucanlar were reinforced as a precaution.", "On 3 September 1999 the CDGA informed all the authorities concerned of that cancellation (message HRK no.: 0621-3138-99).", "On 4 September 1999 the gendarmerie intelligence department informed the CDGA (message ISTH no.: 3590-747-99) and the regional commands that prisoners convicted of terrorism in all the Turkish prisons were planning to initiate various insurrectional actions should the State attempt to intervene in any of the prisons housing such prisoners.", "25. Up until 20 September 1999 the CGP continued to keep the CDGA abreast of the situation in Ulucanlar with daily updates, and the telegrams in question were consistently transmitted to all the authorities concerned. It transpires from those messages that throughout the whole period in question the prisoners in dormitories nos. 4 and 5 and the female dormitory had continued to occupy dormitory no. 7 and to refuse to submit to presence checks, and that the entrance doors to the dormitories, the exercise yards and the living areas had remained open and unguarded.", "26. On 20 September 1999 the Prison Director submitted to the Ankara public prosecutor\u2019s office a request for a search of dormitories nos. 4 and 5 and the female dormitory, which had so far been exempted from such inspection. On the same day the Deputy Director, \u015e.D., was attacked with a makeshift flame-thrower while removing cardboard boxed placed by the prisoners in the ventilation zones on the roof.", "Five days later the authorities reached the conclusion that the situation in Ulucanlar was no isolated case: the ringleaders in the different prisons were freely communicating via mobile phone and planning a series of riots and simultaneous break-outs. The facts relating to that episode are set out, in particular, in the internal reports of 7, 13 (report, HRK no.: 0627-926-99/877) and 21 September 1999 as drawn up by the CGP and CDGA and then forwarded, inter alia, to the Ministry of Justice and the Ankara public prosecutor\u2019s office.", "27. According to those reports, in the leftist prisoners\u2019 dormitories, which had long remained unsupervised, there were two pistols of an unknown model and in dormitory no. 2, a 9-mm Astra-type pistol; all the other relevant parts of the prison contained large quantities of cannabis, brought in by prison guards D.S., F.D., H.U., A.D., D.A., P.G., S.K. and G.\u00c7., who had allegedly hidden them in their undergarments; lastly, the SIM cards had been provided by the prison guard G.S. The CGP and CDGA recommended that those members of the prison staff be immediately removed from their current duties and transferred to other prisons.", "28. Still according to those reports, surveillance of dormitory no. 7 \u2013 which had been under the control of the insurgents since 2 September 1999 \u2013 was no longer possible and the persons occupying it were now in a position to instigate all kinds of actions. Furthermore, since Sector 3 was a no-go area for the authorities (see paragraph 11 above), according to the reports the prisoners would probably resume their tunnelling work with a view to a mass break-out.", "In this connection, the reports pointed out that of the prisoners in the \u201cterrorist dormitories\u201d, 73 were prisoners who had been transferred to Ankara for medical treatment. Obeying instructions from the illegal organisations, of which they were still members, those individuals had managed to avoid returning and had congregated in Sector 3. The reports stated that it was absolutely vital and urgent that those 73 prisoners be transferred back to the prisons where they were supposed to be, otherwise insurrection and confrontation could be expected at any time.", "29. On 25 September 1999, in view of the foregoing considerations, the Director of Ulucanlar Prison requested the CDGA\u2019s assistance to protect the prison staff members who had been tasked with inspecting the three dormitories housing the leftist prisoners.", "In that regard, Action Plan no. 15541, classified secret, was drawn up and forwarded to the regional commands, the Governor, the prosecutor\u2019s office, the Ankara Security Directorate and the National Directorate of Secret Services. Under the plan, at 4 a.m. on 26 September 1999 Ulucanlar Prison would be raided and subjected to a general search, and, if so requested by the public prosecutor, the transfers of leftist prisoners to other prisons, which had so far been blocked, would also be carried out.", "30. The relevant parts of the plan might be summarised as follows:", "\u2013 the task force would comprise ten CGP gendarmes, five commando squads, one riot squad, one special operations squad and sixteen officers, twenty-two junior officers and twenty-one sergeants on contract, and 201 gendarmes from the regional gendarmerie commands;", "\u2013 within each command providing manpower, the gendarmes would be trained in frisking procedure and identification of prohibited items;", "\u2013 the prison guards detailed to take part in the operation would be under the orders of the gendarme commanders;", "\u2013 in order to guarantee the safety of the search teams and to act in the event of armed resistance, gendarme officers would operate with their official weapons and would take the requisite precautions to ensure that they could not be disarmed;", "\u2013 during the searches, the passages between dormitories would be blocked, all outside access to the prison and all means of communication would be supervised, and no one would be allowed in or out, apart from the prosecutors and commanders;", "\u2013 the searches would concerntrate on dormitories nos. 4, 5 and 7 and the female dormitory;", "\u2013 no one would speak with the prisoners or let the latter persuade them to take any type of action, and a firm, strict attitude would be maintained in order to keep up the psychological pressure;", "\u2013 in the dormitories, the prisoners known as \u201cgroup leaders\u201d would be kept under particular surveillance and prevented from inciting the others;", "\u2013 all the prohibited items discovered on the premises would be inventoried and placed in safekeeping;", "\u2013 any prisoners sustaining injuries during the operation would receive initial treatment in the prison dispensary and then transferred to hospital if necessary.", "31. The plan also provided for an auxiliary force comprising one officer, four junior officers, four sergeants on contract and fifty gendarmes, as well as one gendarmerie commando squad, accompanied by an adequate number of police officers, specifying that all those forces would assemble at CGP HQ ready to spring into action.", "Moreover, the plan also provided for the presence of two teams from the gendarmerie intelligence service equipped with one camera and two video cameras; one of the cameramen would work on tower no. 3, and the other cameraman and the photographer would operate inside the building. The personnel in situ was also to include four squadrons from the Special Forces Department, one bomb disposal team and the entire staff of the forensic and anti-drugs departments.", "32. The instructions for the operation were as follows:", "\u2013 personnel involved in the operation should be fully equipped and have all the necessary service weapons, ammunition and other requisite equipment, such as truncheons, shields and glass-fibre helmets;", "\u2013 each unit should also have as many torches available as possible and at least one sledgehammer, one pick and one chisel;", "\u2013 the commands in question were required to provide equipment such as handcuffs (at least ten pairs per command), shields and gas-masks, as well as fire extinguishers (at least two per command) in case of fire;", "\u2013 since the operation was likely to be protracted, an adequate quantity of food rations was to be provided;", "\u2013 one hour before the operation, an ambulance with a doctor and medical assistants was to be placed at the disposal of the provincial command.", "33. At around 4 a.m. \u2013 or, according to some of the prisoners, at around 3.30 a.m. \u2013 on 26 September 1999 the gendarmerie units, under the orders of Lieutenant-Colonel A.\u00d6z., entered Ulucanlar prison. The police officers remained outside in order to secure the outside of the building.", "Despite the warnings \u2013 although there is still disagreement among the parties on whether and how those warnings were in fact given \u2013 informing the prisoners about the searches scheduled for dormitories nos. 4 and 5 and the female dormitory, the violence escalated, quickly turning into a riot.", "Ulucanlar was the scene of confrontations between the gendarmerie units and the leftist prisoners, particularly those who were cornered in dormitory no. 4. The account given below is a summary of the information provided, albeit with a number of uncertainties, in the five reports drawn up after the operation, between 5 and 6 p.m.", "34. Once inside the building, at around 2.15 p.m., the gendarmes took up position in the watch towers located between the roofs of dormitories nos. 4, 5 and 6; they spotted two \u201cterrorists\u201d on the lookout at the end of each corridor; on seeing the gendarmes the latter shouted \u201ctraitor!\u201d at the prison guard who had opened the door to the gendarmes and then ran off towards their dormitories.", "The \u201cterrorists\u201d locked behind them the entrance gates to the central corridor, the female \u201cterrorist\u201d dormitory and the inside areas of dormitories nos. 4, 5 and 7. The gendarmes tried in vain to explain to the rioters that they would not be harmed if they allowed them to carry out the searches. The latter responded by chanting \u201cthe revolutionary prisoners will never give in! \u2013 Come on if you have the guts! \u2013 Long live our independence struggle!\u201d", "Arriving at the second gate, the gendarmes tasked with protecting the search units were attacked with Molotov cocktails and lumps of concrete. Junior officer M.E.\u2019s uniform caught fire (although no such name is included in the list of injured persons in Appendix II).", "In view of the deteriorating situation, the whole prison staff took shelter behind the gendarmerie units.", "The \u201cterrorists\u201d, ignoring Commander A.\u00d6z.\u2019s warnings, continued to chant: \u201cThe prisoners will never give in \u2013 we will resist or die.\u201d Half-an-hour later they attacked the gendarmes with flame-throwers made out of gas cylinders. The gendarmes responded to the attack with force.", "35. Under a hail of stones, logs and pieces of coal, the gendarmes first of all dismantled the barricades in the central corridor and then broke down the entrance door to the female dormitory with sledgehammers.", "While the gendarmes were preparing to go into the dormitory living area, four or five rioters lunged at them with iron bars and then aimed a home-made flame-thrower at them, which started a fire. The security forces used tear gas to drive the rioters back into their dormitory. Once they had taken control of the area, the gendarmes heard female prisoners shouting slogans from the upper floor. Those prisoners refused to comply with orders, and riposted with Molotov cocktails.", "The gendarmes dismantled all the barricades in that zone and inspected the premises before heading towards the stairs to the upper floor. The rioting female prisoners, who had barricaded the staircase with cupboards, threw stones at them. Using their shields to ward off the stones, the gendarmes managed to clear the staircase. When they attempted to enter the dormitories, they were doused with bleach and pelted with stones, broken glass and porcelain and food jars.", "The female prisoners, who had blocked the entrance with chairs, tables and bedsteads, continued throwing stones and Molotov cocktails. They set fire to the mattresses piled up outside the dormitory, which led to a massive blaze, completely filling the area with smoke. The gendarmes brought in the firemen stationed on the roofs to deal with the fire.", "At that moment an official told the gendarmes that there were four PKK members inside who had to be evacuated, but that the female rioters were refusing to release them. The warnings issued were once again ignored and the female \u201cterrorists\u201d became more aggressive; they began to take direct aim at the gendarmes\u2019 faces with the flame-throwers, skewers and broken glass through the door opposite the staircase. During that episode, junior officer S.D., who was responsible for video-recording the events, was injured on the hand by a glass fragment. The gendarmes broke down the door of the adjacent room in order to reach the room in a corner of which the female rioters were grouped, having been driven back by the tear gas and the fire hoses; when the gendarmes entered the room the rioters launched a final assault with iron bars, stones and skewers, still ignoring the calls to surrender.", "The gendarmes resorted to force to neutralise the attack. Some of the women were slightly injured, as was gendarme conscript K.U\u00e7a., who was wounded in the hip by a skewer, and conscripts A.G\u00f6k. and M.Ayd., who were injured in the abdomen and the right hand, respectively.", "At about 7.15 a.m. the female prisoners were forced to exit one by one. Several knives were discovered in their dormitory and filmed. According to the documents on file, during this episode neither the prisoners nor the gendarmes used firearms.", "36. The other operational units met with extremely violent resistance when they attempted to remove the barricades behind the doors to dormitories nos. 4, 5 and 7. While the gendarmes made their way towards the area of dormitory no. 7, \u201cterrorists\u201d behind the barricades opened fire, threw Molotov cocktails and stones and then retreated into dormitory no. 4. This withdrawal enabled the gendarmes to evacuate 29 prisoners who were PKK members from dormitory no. 5; those prisoners had previously informed the prison authorities that they dissociated themselves from the rioters.", "The rioters, thus cornered in dormitory no. 4, tried to climb on to the roofs, but were prevented from doing so by truncheon blows from the gendarmes. They nevertheless managed to start a fire in the dormitory by burning mattresses. Some of the gendarmes almost died of asphyxiation, and reinforcements were called in to take control of the area; several tear-gas canisters were thrown in, forcing a group of \u201cterrorists\u201d to take refuge in the aforementioned dormitory. Despite the calls to surrender, the surrounded \u201cterrorists\u201d opened fire, chanting: \u201cFascists, we\u2019ll kill you! \u2013 bring on the flame-throwers, torch them!\u201d Specialist sergeant M.\u0130. was hit in the abdomen.", "The gendarmes stationed on the roofs of dormitories nos. 6 and 7 and in watch tower no. 3 riposted with tear gas and their official weapons, while the firemen used high-power hoses and carbon dioxide foam. Subsequently, the gendarmes saw \u201cterrorists\u201d going back and forth between the living area and the dormitory to fetch their comrades\u2019 bodies; the prisoners who were severely affected by the gas and the foam and were squatting in various parts of the area were easily apprehended.", "Despite low visibility due to the tear gas, the gendarmes saw some of the \u201cterrorists\u201d approaching the exit in order to surrender; at the same time shouts of \u201cTraitors! Shoot the cowards!\u201d were followed by \u201cbursts of gunfire\u201d inside the dormitory. Only two or three \u201cterrorists\u201d managed to get out; six or seven others were gunned down by their own comrades.", "The remaining rioters, who were once again barricaded behind the door to dormitory no. 4, attempted to reach the gendarmes with stones, iron bars, cudgels and flame-throwers, and they picked up and threw back tear-gas canisters. During the confrontations junior officers E.A. and N.K. were injured on the arm and the nose, respectively, by stones; sergeant C.D. was hit on the right eyebrow, and conscripts A.\u00d6. and M.A. sustained a fracture of the right auricular and a traumatic injury to the right eyebrow, respectively.", "Positioned in front of the aforementioned door, the gendarmes saw a rioter pointing a gun at them at one of the upstairs windows. When the gendarmes went up to the first floor and approached the door, the \u201cterrorists\u201d, including the person later identified as Mu.G\u00f6k., opened fire indiscriminately from the windows. During that attack one bullet seriously injured junior officer \u00dc.S. and another went through sergeant A.E.\u2019s helmet, leaving him in a state of shock; the \u201cterrorists\u201d also shot and injured captain Z.E. and sergeant H.S.", "At around 10 a.m. the gendarmes took control of dormitory no. 4, just as the rioters were trying to flee the area; prisoner A.D. died at around 11.30 a.m., following \u2013 according to the prisoners \u2013 a burst of gunfire.", "The operation ended with that incident.", "37. During the first ten minutes of the raid on dormitory no. 4, prisoners Halil T\u00fcrker and Abuzer \u00c7at (relatives of the applicants Selame T\u00fcrker and Hasan and H\u00fcseyin \u00c7at) were killed; their bodies were found in the dormitory no. 4 living area. \u00dcmit Alt\u0131nta\u015f (a relative of the applicant Melek Alt\u0131nta\u015f) died about half-an-hour later inside the same dormitory.", "According to the statements by the applicants and the prisoners, Under Gen\u00e7aslan (the son of applicant Ali Gen\u00e7aslan), Mahir Emsalsiz (the son of applicant Mehiyet Emsalsiz) and Zafer K\u0131rb\u0131y\u0131k (the brother of applicant Firdevs K\u0131rb\u0131y\u0131k) later died of their wounds, during the ensuing mayhem.", "38. According to the official version, Nevzat \u00c7ift\u00e7i (the husband of applicant Han\u0131m \u00c7ift\u00e7i), who was shot in the leg, died later in hospital. According to the applicant and witness statements, Mr \u00c7ift\u00e7i and \u0130smet Kavakl\u0131o\u011flu (the son of the applicant \u0218aban Kavakl\u0131o\u011flu) were beaten up and executed in an isolated room after the operation; several prisoners claimed to have heard \u0130smet Kavakl\u0131o\u011flu\u2019s screaming in the shower room. A certain A.S., who displayed no bullet wounds, had allegedly suffered the same fate, having also been dragged into the showers.", "The Government contested those allegations, adhering to the aforementioned official version of events.", "39. The result was as follows: ten prisoners dead and about seventy injured, four of whom had sustained life-threatening injuries; and fifteen gendarmes injured, one seriously.", "According to the official version, once the situation was completely under control, the unharmed prisoners were placed in cells. The gendarmes took eighteen injured \u201cterrorists\u201d (no names are given) to the prison dispensary. The others, including several applicants (List B), were retained for six hours in the shower room, where they were given first aid before being transferred to various hospitals.", "According to the injured applicants, however, it was in that shower room and the 200-m long corridor leading to it that they were dragged, stamped on and beaten up by the gendarmes and prison guards lined up on either side of them. In the said room they had been forced to strip and lie on the floor, under a rain of blows, particularly concentrating on their injuries, and making comments such as \u201cwhy is this guy not dead yet? \u2013 we shot three of your mates, it\u2019s your turn now! \u2013 no hospital for him, we\u2019ll finish him off here!\u201d The gendarmes allegedly pushed injured prisoners down the stairs or laid them out on stretchers only to immediately drop them. The torturers included officers from the Ankara police department\u2019s anti-DHKP-C office with whom the convicts, as members of the DHKP-C, were well acquainted.", "At the end of the operation, the transfers of the other prisoners to other prisons were also carried out.", "40. The medical information on the officers injured during the operation is summarised in Appendix II.", "It transpires from the case file that in the instant case the gendarmes, instead of being taken to the Ankara Forensic Medicine Institute \u2013 which was the usual practice \u2013 were examined at the GATA military hospital, which issued their medical reports.", "According to those reports, the condition of gendarmes M.\u0130\u015fl., H.Sar. and \u00dc.Soy., who had bullet wounds, necessitated convalescence leave for ten, ten and twenty-five days respectively, on the understanding that \u00dc.Soy.\u2019s life was in danger.", "Contradicting the findings of the medical report concerning the conscript Z.Eng., indictment no. 1999/79635 of 1 December 1999 (see paragraph 136 below), identifies this person as one of the officers suffering from a gunshot wound.", "According to the same reports, the condition of conscripts A.Er., A.G\u00f6k. and K.U\u00e7a. did not necessitate sick leave. The number of days\u2019 unfitness for work prescribed for the other gendarmes was three for C.Do\u011f., M.Abd. and M.Ayd., five for N.Kar., S.Da\u011f. and \u015e.S\u00fcm., and seven for E.Ayd. and M.\u00d6zk.", "41. All the relevant medical data on the applicants\u2019 eight deceased relatives (List A) are summarised in Appendix III.", "Those data show that the eight persons in question all died of wounds caused by bullets from various types of firearms. In view of that fact, the Sub-Commission (see paragraph 7 in fine below) tasked a committee of five forensic scientists to assess the appropriateness of the autopsy and pathological exploration procedures followed in the present case. That committee found that there had been no major shortcomings attributable to the medical staff involved in the said examinations, having regard, in particular, to the shortage of personnel and the poor working conditions. However, it noted that, in breach of the principles set out in the \u201cMinnesota Autopsy Protocol\u201d, the forensic experts had omitted to dissect the corpses\u2019 skin and sub-cutaneous tissue and to take samples from the traumatic and burn injuries in order to conduct histopathological research on them. Expressing doubts as to the origin of those burns, which had, on the face of it, been caused by chemicals, the committee regretted that more specific necropsies had not been considered, especially since some of the injuries observed on the corpses corresponded to acts generally classified as lethal acts or acts of torture.", "42. As regards the applicants who were injured (List B), and whose clinical pictures are provided in Appendix IV, it should be noted that there is no medical evidence relating to Ms Fatime Akal\u0131n, Ms Sibel Aktan (Akso\u011fan), Ms \u015eerife Ar\u0131\u00f6z, Ms G\u00f6n\u00fcl Aslan, Ms Esmahan Ekinci, Ms Zeynep G\u00fcng\u00f6rmez, Ms Ba\u015fak Otlu, Ms Fadime \u00d6zkan, Ms Derya \u015eim\u015fek, Ms Edibe Tozlu, Mr Ayd\u0131n \u00c7\u0131nar, Mr Murat Ekinci, Mr Murat G\u00fcne\u015f, Mr G\u00fcrhan H\u0131zmay, Mr Ertu\u011frul Kaya and Mr Cemaat Ocak. Furthermore, the medical report on Mr \u0130nan \u00d6zg\u00fcr Bahar, which was obtained further to a complaint lodged on 9 June 2000, some eleven months after the events (see paragraph 110 below).", "The Forensic Medicine Institute\u2019s findings concerning those applicants also prompted a number of comments from the aforementioned committee (see paragraph 41 above):", "\u201c... 1. Some of the traumatic injuries displayed by the injured persons resemble lesions resulting from trauma caused by a blunt instrument; having regard to their distribution and orientation on the body, as well as their shape and extent, some of those lesions might have been caused during the confrontations and captures, but it is medically inconceivable that they all appeared during the operation; some of the lesions consist of \u2018parallel lines of bruising\u2019 and, having regard to their length, they characterise injuries resulting from direct blows struck with one or more long, blunt, convex or round instrument(s);", "2. As the healing process for injuries depends on their nature and their position on the body, as well as the individual\u2019s physical peculiarities, no medical opinion can be provided on which came first, the firearm injuries or the traumatic damage ...\u201d", "43. Appendix IV also sets out seven categories of applicant (List B) broken down by the number of days sick leave prescribed, as follows:", "\u2013 one day for Halil Do\u011fan and Veysel Ero\u011flu;", "\u2013 five days for Mustafa Sel\u00e7uk, \u00d6zg\u00fcr Soylu, Cem \u015eahin, Sad\u0131k T\u00fcrk, Kemal Yarar and Yahya Y\u0131ld\u0131z;", "\u2013 seven days for Cenker Aslan, Resul Ayaz, Song\u00fcl Garip, Aynur S\u0131z, Cemile S\u00f6nmez, Sevin\u00e7 \u015eahing\u00f6z, Bar\u0131\u015f G\u00f6n\u00fcl\u015fen (annotated \u201cgetting better within ten day\u201d) and Devrim Turan;", "\u2013 ten days for G\u00fcrc\u00fc \u00c7akmak, B\u00fclent \u00c7\u00fct\u00e7\u00fc, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m Do\u011fan (fifteen days according to the indictment of 25 December 2000 \u2013 see paragraph 113 below), Filiz G\u00fclkokuer, Hayriye Kesgin, Mehmet Kansu Keskinkan, \u00d6nder Mercan (three days according to the aforementioned indictment), Duygu Mutlu and Filiz Uzal (Soylu);", "\u2013 fifteen days for Ercan Akp\u0131nar, Serdar Atak, K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Hasan \u00c7oban, \u0130lhan Emrah, Erdal G\u00f6ko\u011flu, Sava\u015f K\u00f6r, Behsat \u00d6rs and Ertan \u00d6zkan; and", "\u2013 twenty-five days for Haydar Baran and Enver Yan\u0131k, in a condition described as life-threatening, and for Nihat Konak and \u00d6zg\u00fcr Salt\u0131k.", "44. It transpires from the first two search resorts that, in view of the large haul, it had been decided to film the prohibited items found in the dormitories with a view to subsequently inventorying them, and that the officers had reprimanded the prison guards, accusing them of having brought the weapons into the Ulucanlar Prison. The inventory in question listed the following items:", "\u2013 1 AMD-65 assault rifle (series no. EO 3841) with a magazine containing four bullets, 1 16-mm short-barrelled shotgun with eight cartridges (three of them empty), 1 \u201c Saddam Baretta\u201d pistol (series no. 31302622) with two magazines, 1 \u201c14-shot Baretta pistol\u201d (series no. 245PY74657) with 1 magazine, 1 semi-automatic Mab pistol (series no. D 561777) with 3 magazines, 2 home-made pen guns, 2 \u201csilencers\u201d, 76 Kalashnikov cartridges, 113 bullets for 9-mm pistol, 56 of them spent, 90 G-3 gun cartridges, 25 7.65-mm bullets, 10 of them spent, 3 8-mm blank bullets, 35 projectiles and 2 magazine cases;", "\u2013 29 knives, 24 Stanley knives, 73 stilettos, 2 machetes, 1 wooden dagger, 97 miscellaneous blunt instruments, 1 iron bar, 1 wooden sledgehammer, 2 cudgels and 15 catapults;", "\u2013 3 unused Molotov cocktails, 7 gas cylinders, 18 home-made gas masks, 15 packets of explosive powder, 1 home-made tear-gas canister, and miscellaneous solvents and combustible liquids;", "\u2013 1 welding machine, 1 drill, 10 wood chisels, 30 nails, 6 chisels, 39 different-sized saws, 1 screwdriver and one, 1 trowel;", "\u2013 15 firearms (Kalashnikov, M-16 and revolvers) and 17 bombes, 1 telescope, 2 truncheons and 3 fake training batons;", "\u2013 3 mobile portables with accessories, 1 hollowed-out book and 7 master-keys.", "45. The third and fourth reports, which were drawn up later the same day specified that the aforementioned \u201cTar\u0131q\u201d semi-automatic pistol (series no. 31302622) had been used by prisoner Mu.G\u00f6k., who, having fired seven or eight shots, had retreated to dormitory no. 4 (see paragraph 36 in fine above). Two more reports drawn up the next day mentioned the discovery of a 9-mm Star semi-automatic pistol with one bullet in the magazine.", "46. Four further searches were conducted between 2 and 6 October 1999, revealing:", "\u2013 1 hunting knife with a 21-cm blade, complete with sheath (2 October);", "\u2013 20 500 to 1,000 g bags of cement, 8 packets of floor tiles, 2 packets of plaster, and 4 blades and iron casts;", "\u2013 20 m of telephone cable (4 October); and", "\u2013 4 54-cm iron tubes soldered to 19-cm blades, to be used as picks or axes (5 October).", "47. In the light of the foregoing considerations, it is important to reiterate the following statements made to the Sub-Commission by Colonel K.B., the commanding officer of the CDGA:", "\u201c... We drew up our plan and arrived at Ulucanlar on the morning of 26 September; the prisoners riposted with firearms and flame throwers, and we were attacked with knives; so we also used our arms in accordance with the powers conferred by Act No. 2803 [on the organisation of the National Gendarmerie]. My men were injured, and unfortunately on the other side prisoners were also injured or lost their lives. Their deaths have greatly saddened me. I am sad because there should not have been any weapons there. If there had been no weapons there would have been no confrontation and these people would not have died, and my men would not have been injured ... After those events the Ministry of Justice issued the directive of 5 October 1999. Prior to that date, we (gendarmes) were not empowered to search prison guards entering the prison; the prison guards were searched by other prison guards. Imagine two prison guards who have links with the ... prisoners. What sort of links might these be? They might be material, pecuniary or ideological, or be based on fear. Therefore, if the \u2018terrorist\u2019 organisation told those two guards that someone would be bringing a gun from outside and that they had to hand it over to [a given prisoner], they would be certain to obey. The prison guard goes into the prison and [one of his colleagues] searches him, not a gendarme. A lawyer arrives and no one searches him. He has a private conversation with the detainee or prisoner and leaves, after which the detainee or prisoner is taken back to his cell, still without any body searches. Normally no such items should have been brought into the prison ... The prison in question has one more special feature: it is next to the open prison section, where individuals come and go, stroll around and do whatever they want, and they could easily throw whatever objects they wish over the wall. There have been lots of incidents of this kind. We drew up a report and informed the prison authorities that a package had been thrown inside; [the guards] searched the premises but found nothing. After all, we could never have interfered in the running of the prison! ...\u201d", "48. Lieutenant-Colonel A.\u00d6z., the commanding officer of the task force, had stated the following:", "\u201cNo search had been carried out in the section housing prisoners convicted of terrorist offences for six or seven years ... No request to that effect was ever submitted, and we did not act because the public prosecutor had never called on our services. As you know ... we can only act inside the prison if the prosecutor or Prison Director so requests ...\u201d", "49. The statement by Captain D.Y., commander of the CGP, on that matter can be summarised as follows:", "\u201cThis affair did not begin on 2 September [1999]; its origins go back into the distant past. In Ulucanlar, but also in all the other prisons housing \u2018terrorists\u2019, the prison authorities had no control over the sections reserved for such prisoners; this is a well-known fact. In those sections ... the \u2018terrorists\u2019 ruled the roost ...; TV and the other media covered this: the State Prosecutor sitting down with the prisoners and negotiating with them, and the latter then taking hostages and obtaining everything they had been demanding. Despite all the denials, whole pages of such agreements have been published in the newspapers ...; it was obvious that a lot of weapons and mobile phones were circulating in the prison; during ordinary body searches, even where prison guards felt a weapon, they were all too scared to confiscate it ... An incident was sure to occur if gendarmes raided the \u2018terrorists\u2019\u2019 dormitories ... because no gendarme had ever entered those premises to conduct a search for six or seven years ... Many staff have been caught red-handed smuggling weapons and drugs into the prison ...\u201d", "50. On 2 October 1999 the gendarmes discovered a 50 cm\u00b2, 10-15-cm deep hole in the middle of the concrete floor of dormitory no. 5, at a distance of 135 cm from the wall, which the gendarmes identified as the entrance to a future tunnel. The hole was filled with pieces of wood and blankets.", "On 4 October 1999 the gendarmes inspected the floor of dormitory no. 7. In the kitchenette, underneath the worktop, they noted that an 85 x 35-cm area had been bricked up and replastered to merge in with the colour of the walls. The gendarmes broke through the bricks and found that the floor had been dug up to a depth of 20 cm. They deduced that what they had found was the beginnings of a tunnel.", "On 6 October 1999 the floor of the dormitory no. 5 living area was inspected. The gendarmes dug into the ground around two poplar trees, and discovered a 45 x 75 cm plywood trapdoor covering a 50 cm x 100 cm tunnel entrance. The entrance led to an approximately 7-m long tunnel running towards the aforementioned hole inside dormitory no. 5. The tunnel was found to contain four home-made iron picks, a bag containing 15-20 kg of dug-out rubble and a bag with 15-20 kg of gravel.", "51. Before the Sub-Commission, the ministerial authorities submitted that the occupation of dormitory no. 7 had been solely aimed at facilitating the preparation of a mass break-out; that had also been the aim pursued by the rioters in hitherto blocking the access of prison guards to the dormitories and preventing presence checks, as allegedly proved by the incipient tunnel discovered after the operation. According to those authorities, between 2 and 26 September 1999 the prison authorities had unsuccessfully attempted to put an end to the said occupation of the dormitory. In view of the failure of these attempts and the increasing number of leaks concerning an imminent prison break-out, an anti-riot operation had become inevitable.", "Although the Sub-Commission accepted that the leaks concerning the tunnelling activities had played a major role in the decision to raid the premises in question, it considered that there was some doubt as to the real nature of the sites identified in the area of dormitories nos. 5 and 7 as incipient tunnels. The Sub-Commission pointed out that the first alleged tunnel, which was 7 m long, began in the living area of dormitory no. 5 and ended inside that dormitory. It took the view that it was implausible that the prisoners had ventured to dig a tunnel in an open yard which was overlooked by watch towers. Furthermore, the Sub-Commission considered that the second digging site found behind the worktop in the dormitory no. 7 kitchen did not really match the profile of an attempted escape tunnel.", "52. Between 14 October and 2 November 1999 the Sub-Commission was sent to Ulucanlar, where it held talks with a number of prisoners \u2013 including some of the applicants \u2013 prison staff, officers and other governmental and non-governmental officials. The Sub-Commission\u2019s report covered 120 pages, 79 of which concerned the impugned operation, and comprised a plethora of damning observations.", "53. The Sub-Commission began by enumerating the obstacles encountered during the investigations. The Ankara Public Prosecutor responsible for investigating the case had failed to attend the scheduled meeting, and, furthermore, the forensic medical team and the prison authorities had refused to hand over specific items of physical evidence such as the video recordings made during the operation and the photographs taken during the autopsies. It noted that although the gendarmerie authorities \u2013 which merely presented a few photographs taken long after the events \u2013 had denied the existence of such audiovisual material, several of the individuals questioned had affirmed that the operation had indeed been filmed and that, in fact, \u201cthe junior officer responsible for the video recording had sustained an injury to his hand\u201d.", "According to the Sub-Commission, this situation had reinforced the suspicions of concealment of evidence, particularly since the authorities had refused to grant the victims\u2019 lawyers leave to attend the autopsies, which refusal they alleged was in breach of the requirement to reassure the general public in such a sensitive case.", "54. The report included several specific chapters, converging on an overall assessment of the impugned situation based on witness statements and other relevant evidence.", "55. According to prisoners who did not actively participate in the riot, the occupation of dormitory no. 7 was intended, in particular, as a protest against overcrowding in the dormitories after the failed attempts to negotiate that issue with the prison authorities.", "56. The Sub-Commission held that the prisoners in dormitories nos. 4 and 5 had certainly violated the law, infringed the rights of their cellmates in dormitory no. 7 and contributed to the escalating tensions by refusing to terminate their actions. However, the Sub-Commission pointed out that of the nineteen dormitories available in Ulucanlar, only five were exclusively earmarked for leftist prisoners, and that there was a real overcrowding problem liable to goad those concerned into action.", "The Sub-Commission considered that if dormitory no. 7 had been raided on 2 September 1999, it was inexplicable why the authorities had waited for twenty-four hours before instigating an operation on that scale, with attempting beforehand to act in one way or another. It added that there was also no explanation for the fact that, at the height of the tension, the prison prosecutor had gone on leave or that the operation had been launched on the day of the Prime Minister\u2019s departure on an official visit to the United States.", "57. According to the official version, before entering the dormitories the gendarmes had duly ordered the rioters to surrender, but the latter had riposted with guns, home-made bombs, gas cylinders transformed into flame-throwers and various sharp tools. The non-rioting prisoners explained that there had indeed been shouted orders such as \u201csurrender! If you surrender you will be well treated!\u201d, but that those orders had been drowned out by the noise of the gunfire. The security forces said that they had attempted to contain the attacks with tear-gas canisters and high-pressure foam sprays, but that that had not stopped the prisoners, who were wearing home-made gas masks.", "58. According to the Sub-Commission, and contrary to the official version, the incidents of 26 September could not just be put down to the resistance of prisoners occupying a dormitory to prison officers assisted by the security forces. Similarly, the ten deaths which had occurred could not have been the result of an improvised reaction by the gendarmes.", "The Sub-Commission explained that a plan had been drawn up twenty days beforehand, that the premises had been inspected on a number of occasions and that the situation had been discussed in detail with the prison guards and the administrative staff. The Sub-Commission held that the operation had even been prepared in such a way as to include special strike forces. In the light of the number of dead and injured, it should have been obvious that, owing to the absence of prior measures to protect the lives of the prisoners, who were incarcerated under the State\u2019s responsibility, that operation had been a serious failure.", "59. The Sub-Commission took the view that the real reasons for the operation lay elsewhere; there had been a serious longstanding problem of mutual confidence between the prisoners and those responsible for Ulucanlar Prison at all levels, including with the gendarmes on duty at the prison. Accordingly, all the officials questioned had begun by acknowledging that \u201cthe State was no longer in control of the prisons\u201d.", "Nevertheless, the Sub-Commission noted that the meaning of the word \u201ccontrol\u201d was unclear. \u201cControl\u201d could not mean preventing escapes \u2013 such cases being extremely rare \u2013 or carrying out regular searches and presence checks; nor could control be aimed at preventing freedom of movement by the prisoners between dormitories, monitoring the prison activities of members of the \u201cterrorist\u201d organisations, undermining the authority of their leaders or preventing large quantities of foodstuffs from being smuggled into the prison.", "All such aims could have highlighted only the structural inadequacy of the prisons, the shortage of public funds and a deficient prison regime, and not any legitimate need for control of prison life.", "60. On that subject, the Sub-Commission reported that the prisoners interviewed had complained of the denial of their rights under a \u201cprotocol of understanding\u201d which they claimed to have signed with the officials of the prison and the Ministry of Justice.", "It pointed out that, whereas that Ministry had officially denied the existence of any such document, many of the prisoners and the prison administrators had confirmed its existence, explaining that before the operation the said protocol, which comprised 22 articles, had been deposited with the public prosecutor\u2019s office, but that the document had been missing since the operation.", "According to the Sub-Commission, in view of the difficulties encountered in effectively applying the prison rules, which situation would in fact have been difficult to reconcile with current human rights requirements, it was clear that the officials, who had already been under media pressure, had concluded agreements with the leaders of the leftist prisoners in order to define the terms and conditions of prison life. The Sub-Commission took the view that even though such agreements could be seen as useful for protecting prisoners\u2019 rights, in the instant case it was precisely the issue of implementing the agreement in question which triggered the events at Ulucanlar. The Sub-Commission explained that when there had been changes in the management of a given prison or when government policy had changed, the rights afforded to prisoners under such agreements had been denied, with the successive authorities proclaiming the unlawfulness of such privileges and the prisoners refusing to give up rights which they now took for granted.", "61. It added that one illustration of the feeling of powerlessness experienced by the prison staff (many of whom had a rather low standard of education) on this matter was their interpretation, for example, of the signs and tags which had been observed in the dormitories inspected following the operation as showing the prisoners\u2019 belonging to an illegal organisation. The prisoners interviewed had firmly denied that the premises had ever been used as \u201cterrorist\u201d cells; they had said that in the dormitories they had considered themselves entitled to conduct activities of a strictly cultural and intellectual nature. The Sub-Commission considered that the reaction of the authority\u2019s vis-\u00e0-vis the nature of those activities and the fact that they had sought to ban them as illegal had only exacerbated the situation.", "Furthermore, the Sub-Commission highlighted the statement by Lieutenant-Colonel A.\u00d6z., who had directed the operation, to the effect that the men had acted to \u201crestore the State\u2019s authority\u201d, and emphasised that the CDGA had on several occasions invited the Ministers of Justice and of the Interior to take action to \u201crestore the State\u2019s authority and prevent Ulucanlar Prison from becoming a \u2018terrorist\u2019 training centre ...\u201d.", "62. In the Sub-Commission\u2019s view, however, those facts alone were insufficient to explain the above-mentioned feeling of powerlessness; behind the \u201cdesire to control persons\u201d above and beyond their physical confinement there also lurked a wish to stigmatise prisoners convicted of political or terrorist acts vis-\u00e0-vis the other inmates.", "63. The Sub-Commission took the view that although it was incontrovertible that in cases of absolute necessity the security forces could resort to firearms within the limits of the law, inflicting death out of frustration at a loss of authority was clearly inadmissible. The deaths and injuries in Ulucanlar Prison had revealed an intention to kill, rather than an intention to put an end to the occupation of dormitories or to break down resistance. It analysed the existence of mutual resentment powerful enough to induce individuals to take the risk of killing or being killed as a sign that the prisoners and gendarmes had viewed each other as enemies.", "In that regard, it emphasised that the military-style training given to members of the gendarmerie had been inappropriate for such an operation because, to a \u201csoldier\u201d, any \u201cadversary\u201d would have become an \u201cenemy\u201d whom he had a mission to destroy. That was why, according to the Sub-Commission, no ordinary gendarmes should have been involved in situations such as that pertaining in the present case, unless the personnel to be sent in had received appropriate training for such missions, in the knowledge that their duty was not solely to prevent the prisoners from escaping, but also to protect their lives and ensure respect for human rights.", "The Sub-Commission observed, however, that, in the present case the gendarmes had behaved as if they were facing a group of terrorists who had taken to the mountains, \u201cwhereas there were sixty or so prisoners suffering from the effects of gas and foam and confined to an area of some one hundred square metres, who could neither escape nor remain barricaded in for ever\u201d.", "64. It explained that it had asked a number of officers whether any methods other than firearms could have been used and why the forces involved had not concentrated more on the use of tear gas and carbon dioxide foam in order to bring the situation under control.", "The officers had allegedly replied that they had begun by using all possible non-lethal methods, in particular tear gas, until the gendarmes wearing military gas masks had themselves been affected by the gas, as had all the persons inspecting the dormitories several days after the incident. Moreover, according to one colonel, it would have been pointless to wait or to fire off more tear-gas canisters because the rioters had protected themselves with masks.", "According to the Sub-Commission, the only possible conclusion was that the tear-gas canisters in question had proved their efficacy in terms of their quantity and power. But since they had been insufficient to contain the rioters, should it not have been accepted that the prisoners, with their home-made masks, had been better protected from the gas than the gendarmes with their professional masks?", "65. The Sub-Commission further recounted the explanations given by another captain, to the effect that \u201csince we already had four wounded gendarmes and were facing violent resistance, we could no longer decide to retreat, to halt the combat; we had no say in the matter\u201d. The Sub-Commission pointed out that Lieutenant-Colonel A.\u00d6z. (see paragraph 48 above) had also acknowledged that he could not have called off an operation without undermining the morale of the troops and allowing the \u201cadversary\u201d to regain confidence. It quoted that officer\u2019s words as follows:", "\u201c... In my view, it was impossible to restrain [the rioters] by any other means because they had larges stores of food in the dormitories. Furthermore, we had no \u2018paralysing\u2019 gas, and to my knowledge there is no such gas. We have tear-gas canisters ... We could not opt to \u2018wait and see\u2019 because that would have raised the problem that a long period of waiting would have enabled the other side to prepare better and step up their resistance ... Once the armed confrontation has begun it can no longer be stopped. I am glad that my next-in-command and my lieutenant survived, thanks be to God, but if one of them had been martyred, how could we have explained that to people? ... In the past, when we came here on an operation, we only searched the ordinary convicts\u2019 dormitories, not those of the prisoners convicted of terrorism. When the operation was instigated the latter prisoners resisted to the death. Firearms were the last resort, and we held back until our personnel began to sustain injuries ... That is when you have to react; the longer you hold off the worse the eventual losses [in your own ranks] will be ...; if you wait too long before riposting you will allow the \u2018terrorists\u2019 to adjust their aim and erect barricades ... They even began killing each other; there were burst of gunfire inside the dormitory ... I shouted down from the first floor \u2018but that\u2019s automatic gunfire!\u2019 and the reply came \u2018we know, sir ... we have no hunting rifles, we don\u2019t use them ...\u201d", "Finally, the Sub-Commission quoted Captain D.Y. on that specific issue (cf. paragraph 49 above), who had considered it unfair to ask them how they could have avoided \u201ckilling ten individuals\u201d:", "\u201c... We didn\u2019t kill them ... Honestly, if I had wanted to kill someone, why would I have chosen ordinary guys like A.S. or Mahir Emsalsiz, instead of shooting the group leaders? Those two were about to be released ... and pulled no weight in the organisation. Those were the kind of people who were killed. Didn\u2019t you notice that [the first persons who died] did not include any of the leaders? It was because to begin with the other guys had wanted to surrender that many of them were executed by those [leaders] ... We do not deny that we used firearms, but it wasn\u2019t us who killed those ten individuals; it should be realised that if we had intended to shoot to kill we would have targeted the group leaders, or else we would already have eliminated them in the past, during quieter times ...\u201d", "66. The Sub-Commission considered that those arguments were strictly military in nature and had, moreover, highlighted a lack of authority on the officers\u2019 part over the actions of the men under their command.", "67. The Sub-Commission considered that more information was required on the nature of the \u201cviolent resistance\u201d which had to be \u201cbroken\u201d by the security forces.", "According to the official version, a Kalashnikov, seven pistols and a hunting rifle had been found in the dormitories. Of the ten fatalities, three had been the result of shots from that hunting rifle: in short, according to the gendarmes previous quarrels had induced the \u201cterrorists\u201d to kill each other.", "The Sub-Commission observed that the prisoners questioned had admitted having seen some of their comrades using guns, but that none of them had seen any Kalashnikov-type automatic weapon or a hunting rifle. No such Kalashnikov (see paragraph 44 in limine above) had ever been mentioned before or discovered during the initial search, but it had been found later on, after a prisoner had told the prosecutor that \u201cthe first shot had been fired from an automatic weapon\u201d. And the hunting rifle, which had also never been previously mentioned, had also only emerged after the operation.", "Given that the only injuries noted by the gendarmes had been caused by gunshots, the Sub-Commission wondered why, if the rioters had indeed been in possession of such a powerful weapon as a Kalashnikov, they had not used it against the gendarmes, and also why, if they had actually used a hunting rifle to kill three of their comrades, they had not also turned it against the gendarmes.", "68. Nevertheless, the Sub-Commission held that the main question was how so many firearms had been smuggled into Ulucanlar. They considered the official line that they had been hidden in food packages or thrown over the prison wall unconvincing in view of the existence of electronic alarm systems and the guards keeping watch on the towers.", "Nor did the Sub-Commission consider it conceivable that the firearms could have been supplied with the assistance of a number of corrupt officers; only a major organisation could have managed such a feat by infiltrating the prison, which would have involved huge sums of money.", "69. Furthermore, the Sub-Commission noted that since only 41 cartridges had been found in the dormitories, the shooting attributed to the rioters could not have been as intense as had been claimed; it therefore considered that the account of a violent exchange of fire in the dormitories could not be taken at face value and that consequently there was no proof that the force used by the gendarmes in response had been strictly proportionate to the danger, especially since the bullet impacts on the inside walls of the dormitories suggested that the shots fired by the gendarmes had been directly aimed at individuals.", "70. The Sub-Commission also stated that the other argument, to the effect that the rioters had used gas cylinders as flame-throwers to prevent the gendarmes from entering the dormitories, could not be described as very convincing: the doors to the premises in question had not displayed any scorch marks and none of the gendarmes had sustained any serious burns.", "71. The Sub-Commission further pointed out that according to the officers involved, the gendarmes had also been attacked with sharp instruments; still according to the officers, it was only to be expected that the deceased prisoners had displayed traces of blows and injuries because there had been \u201cclashes and confrontations with the prisoners, who had attacked the gendarmes with iron bars and stilettos, and the latter had had to riposte with truncheons\u201d.", "Nevertheless, the Sub-Commission observed that it was unclear whether any knife wounds had been found on the gendarmes, nor was there any evidence that any such hand-to-hand fighting had ever taken place, never mind a confrontation lasting for five or six hours.", "On the other hand, the Sub-Commission noted that many of the prisoners had claimed to have been beaten up, dragged along the floor and stamped on for no reason. It added that those allegations had been confirmed by forensic reports and that the forensic experts had established that some of the traces of violence observed on the injured prisoners and the corpses had indeed only been explicable by blows from blunt instruments and bodies being dragged across a hard floor (see paragraph 42 in fine above).", "Moreover, the doctors responsible for providing first aid in the shower room prior to the transfer of the injured to hospital had also reported that the prisoners had begged them not to leave them alone, explaining that as soon as there were no witnesses, the gendarmes tortured them by exerting pressure on their wounds.", "72. The Sub-Commission considered that the traces of blows and the injuries noted on the bodies of the prisoners and the corpses did not appear to have resulted from clashes and confrontations, and that the most likely scenario was that during and after the operation the security forces had resorted to excessive force and beaten the rioters. Furthermore, as regards the burns found on the bodies of the injured and dead prisoners, it pointed out that according to the forensic experts which it had appointed, they might have been caused by nitric or sulfuric acid, the presence of which chemicals it deemed unexplained.", "73. Having regard to all the foregoing observations, the Sub-Commission issued the following opinion.", "In the absence of a constructive attitude on the part of the Ulucanlar and Justice Ministry officials, the impugned operation had ultimately been characterised by a level of violence surpassing its original aim, the commanding officers concerned having discharged the mission without preventing deaths and widespread injuries.", "Clearly, sole responsibility for all those incidents could not be attributed to the gendarmes, the prison staff or the Ministry in question. However, the Ministry\u2019s differentiated policy depending on prison type and the prison staff\u2019s excessive zeal in \u201ccontrolling\u201d the prisoners convicted of political offences by inflicting penalties in addition to the sentences which they were already serving had certainly been the main factor in the escalating tension and the lack of trust between both sides.", "Beyond the arguments put forward by the authorities, the real reason for such violence had boiled down to a longstanding dispute between the prison administration, which had been determined to impose its authority, and the prisoners, who had been demanding rights which they considered wholly legitimate.", "The officials involved in that dispute had ended up calling in the gendarmerie, who had proved unsuited to managing that kind of situation and who, in the absence of appropriate instructions, had inflicted ill-treatment on the prisoners and used disproportionate force.", "74. On 27 September 1999, at the request of the Justice Ministry\u2019s Disciplinary Board, inspectors initiated an administrative investigation against R.Cin., the Director of Ulucanlar Prison, and his four deputies, M. \u00c7el., U.Sal., A.G\u00fcr. and T.Y\u0131l., on the grounds, inter alia, of the discovery of weapons and various prohibited objects and substances on the prison premises (see paragraphs 10 and 27 above).", "The five officials were charged with failing in their obligation to control and supervise the prisoners under their responsibility.", "75. They argued in their defence that it was impossible to identify the prison guards involved in smuggling weapons and ammunition into the prison. They added that even though visitors passed through metal detectors, the prison regulations prohibited body searches, and that the old and dilapidated state of Ulucanlar Prison made it easy to hide prohibited items, which were sometimes even thrown over the prison wall from the outside.", "The officials further submitted that in practice it was impossible to impose disciplinary sanctions on prisoners for such offences since the deputy directors were not on the Disciplinary Board and, moreover, the impugned occupation of dormitory no. 7 had in fact been brought to the attention of the Ministry of Justice and the public prosecutor\u2019s office, but no action had been taken before the date on which the risk of a break-out had become imminent.", "76. After the investigations, the inspectors had agreed on the need for sanctions. They stated that the officers in question should be declared responsible for:", "\u2013 bringing prohibited items into the prison through the intermediary of certain officials who had acted unsupervised and with complete impunity;", "\u2013 the failure to conduct body searches of detainees and convicted prisoners being transferred between Ulucanlar Prison and hospital;", "\u2013 the absence of X-ray checks on lawyers and their personal effects;", "\u2013 the absence of targeted or general searches throughout the prison premises in order to seize prohibited items;", "\u2013 the failure to impose deterrent disciplinary sanctions on prisoners;", "\u2013 the de facto tolerance, between August 1999 and 2 September 1999, of the prisoners\u2019 unlawful actions, including their occupation of certain premises;", "\u2013 the absence of presence checks in dormitories nos. 4 and 5 and the female dormitory; and", "\u2013 the inability to block the access between those dormitories opened up by the prisoners.", "77. On 7 December 1999, departing from the aforementioned opinion, the Director General of Prisons decided that no sanctions were required, giving the following reasons:", "\u201c... for years the prisons housing persons detained and convicted for acts of terrorism have been one of the main problems facing our country, and the incidents which have occurred in them has attracted a high level of public interest. We cannot overlook the fact that in prisons of this category searches are never properly carried out, presence checks raise problems and there are periods when no presence checks are carried out for days on end; the detainees and convicted prisoners control the opening and closing of the doors to the dormitories, and when groups of them take over the corridors it is impossible to intervene; even visits by and interviews with lawyers are arranged and controlled by the organisation leaders; the net result is that the prison staff are overwhelmed and struggling, or even failing, to discharge their duties.", "Consequently, as regards such incidents, which stem from a number of issues which have been building up for years into a problem facing all the \u2018anti-terrorist\u2019 prisons in our country, not just [Ulucanlar], it would be unfair to say that the [Ulucanlar] staff, who are under pressure ... from the detainees and prisoners convicted of terrorism and are in a way being forced to work in breach of the regulations and instructions, were at fault or acted intentionally; in other words, it is unfair to attribute sole responsibility for these incidents to the [Ulucanlar] prison staff on the grounds that they acted negligently.", "Moreover, even the investigation report of 25 September 1999 [sic \u2013 see paragraph 74 above] accepted that the staff had not been guilty of negligence, wrongdoing or intentional mischief, because, despite all their efforts, it would have been impossible to prevent the situation from reaching such a pitch ...\u201d", "78. Finally, the Disciplinary Council concluded that no professional negligence was imputable to the Ulucanlar administrative staff.", "79. At an unspecified date, a mandatory criminal investigation was instigated against head prison officers H.A. and S.B. and prison officers \u015e.A., \u00c7.Y., L.A., A.Ka., U.Y., N.\u015ea. and G.\u015e., who were stationed at the Ulucanlar security checkpoint, for negligence in the exercise of their duties. In view of the number and type of weapons and ammunition discovered after the operation, those officers had been suspected of having internationally or accidently failed to carry out the requisite checks and searches on persons passing through the checkpoint, on 15 March 1999, in particular.", "The suspects contested the accusations on the grounds that the gendarmes had received the same orders as the prison officers in terms of checking individuals entering the building, including ensuring security at the checkpoint. They submitted that although, occasionally, no checks had been carried out, that fact alone did not warrant any presumption of guilt.", "80. By order of 2 December 1999 the prosecution discontinued the proceedings for lack of evidence. In support of that decision, the prosecution pointed out that it had been impossible to determine the dates or periods of time when the prohibited items in question had been smuggled into Ulucanlar Prison. They added that in the light of the architecture and organisation of the building, \u201clight weapons\u201d could quite easily have been thrown over the outside walls or else from the open area of the prison, or that they might have been brought in by other means or with the assistance of officers other than those who had been charged.", "81. On 26 September 1999, immediately after the operation, the lawyers representing applicants Mehmet Kansu Keskinkan, Veysel Ero\u011flu, Behsat \u00d6rs, Erdal G\u00f6ko\u011flu, Sad\u0131k T\u00fcrk, Enver Yan\u0131k, Aynur S\u0131z, Devrim Turan, Haydar Baran, Resul Ayaz, Song\u00fcl Garip, Filiz Uzal (Soylu) and \u0130smet Kavakl\u0131o\u011flu applied to the Ankara State Prosecutor (\u201cthe Prosecutor\u201d) for authorisation to be present during the autopsies should one of their clients die in the meantime, which was in fact the case of Mr \u0130smet Kavakl\u0131o\u011flu.", "The Prosecutor rejected that request.", "Concurrently, Mr Bayraktar and seven fellow lawyers lodged a formal complaint on behalf of applicants K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Hasan \u00c7oban, Sava\u015f K\u00f6r, Nihat Konak, Fadime \u00d6zkan, Behsat \u00d6rs, Cenker Aslan, Veysel Ero\u011flu, Cemile S\u00f6nmez, Ba\u015fak Otlu, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m Do\u011fan and Hayriye Kesgin (List B), as well as on behalf of the deceased prisoners Zafer K\u0131rb\u0131y\u0131k, Nevzat \u00c7ift\u00e7i, \u00d6nder Gen\u00e7aslan and Mahir Emsalsiz (List A). Mt Bayraktar requested, also unsuccessfully, leave to be present during Mr Nevzat \u00c7ift\u00e7i\u2019s autopsy.", "On the same date Mr Ayhan and \u00c7\u0131tak, defence counsel, lodged a first collective complaint on behalf of all the \u201cprisoners who had been attacked\u201d.", "82. Both those complaints were added to mandatory investigation file no. 1999/101539. A preliminary investigation had already been instigated against 150 members of the gendarmerie for unjustified used of lethal force against Mahir Emsalsiz, Halil T\u00fcrker, Abuzer \u00c7at and \u00dcmit Alt\u0131nta\u015f (List A) and for bodily injury against 47 prisoners, including some of the applicants (List B) and excluding those set out below, who did not appear on the list of complainants: Fatime Akal\u0131n, Sibel Aktan (Akso\u011fan), \u015eerife Ar\u0131\u00f6z, G\u00f6n\u00fcl Aslan, \u0130nan \u00d6zg\u00fcr Bahar, Ayd\u0131n \u00c7\u0131nar, Esmahan Ekinci, Murat Ekinci, Murat G\u00fcne\u015f, Zeynep G\u00fcng\u00f6rmez, G\u00fcrhan H\u0131zmay, Ertu\u011frul Kaya, Cemaat Ocak, Ba\u015fak Otlu, Fadime \u00d6zkan, Derya \u015eim\u015fek and Edibe Tozlu.", "83. On 29 September 1999 the applicants Mustafa Sel\u00e7uk, Cem \u015eahin, Bar\u0131\u015f G\u00f6n\u00fcl\u015fen, Erdal G\u00f6ko\u011flu and Sad\u0131k T\u00fcrk \u2013 who had meanwhile been transferred to Burdur Prison \u2013 joined the complainants. They complained about the members of the security forces and the prison authorities, who they submitted had been responsible for the tragic events of 26 September. Those complaints were also added to the aforementioned file no. 1999/101539.", "The applicant Murat Ekinci was questioned by the Prosecutor on 15 October 1999 (see paragraph 99 above), when he accused the gendarmes of having beaten and injured him.", "Still on 29 September 1999, two of the lawyers for the applicants acknowledged receipt of the autopsy reports. They requested communication of the other necropsy reports, the documentation in support of the post-mortem examinations conducted in the present case and histopathological analyses of the tissue samples taken.", "On the same date the morgue personnel replied that tissue samples had been taken and sent for analysis.", "84. On 1 December the lawyers lodged a second collective complaint which did not include the names of Ms K\u0131rb\u0131y\u0131k (List A) or Mr Murat Ekinci (List B).", "On the basis of a detailed statement of the facts, the lawyers accused the prison staff and members of the gendarmerie of premeditated murder, serious bodily injury and acts of torture. That complaint was recorded in a second file (no. 1999/107587).", "85. On 13 March 2000 counsel for Ms K\u0131rb\u0131y\u0131k lodged a formal complaint against 47 gendarmes and officers who had taken part in the operation. That complaint, recorded in a third file (no. 2001/16237), was followed by further complaints lodged separately on 9 June 2000 by Veysel Ero\u011flu and \u0130nan \u00d6zg\u00fcr Bahar.", "86. According to a report drawn up at the end of the operation, one of the first investigative measures implemented by the Prosecutor had been to visit Ulucanlar at around 11.15 a.m., as soon as he had been alerted, in order to attempt to determine which clothes recovered during the searches had belonged to deceased persons and which to injured persons, before ordering ballistic reports. The report stated:", "\u201c[at the site of the incident] it was impossible to detect, on the dead persons\u2019 clothing, any traces of stabbings or projectile entry holes, because the corpses had been laid out side by side on the wet, blood-soaked floor; furthermore, the clothing removed from the injured prisoners had been mixed with the clothes from the dead prisoners ...\u201d", "With the help of the photographs taken of the corpses before they had been stripped and thanks to the memory of prison officer N.Yar., the Prosecutor managed to identify the clothing of \u00d6nder Gen\u00e7aslan, \u00dcmit Alt\u0131nta\u015f, Halil T\u00fcrker, Mahir Emsalsiz, Nevzat \u00c7ift\u00e7i and Abuzer \u00c7at. The clothing of the first five dead persons displayed one, five, one, eight and two holes respectively, some of them resembling bullet holes. There were no holes in Abuzer \u00c7at\u2019s clothes. The clothing belonging to \u0130smet Kavakl\u0131o\u011flu (see paragraph 38 above) and Zafer K\u0131rb\u0131y\u0131k was not to be found.", "Still on 26 September 1999, the authorities checked the deceased prisoners\u2019 criminal records. Mahir Emsalsiz and \u00d6nder Gen\u00e7aslan had been former members of the illegal organisation TKP (ML) T\u0130KKO, Abuzer \u00c7at of MLKP, \u00dcmit Alt\u0131nta\u015f of T\u0130K\u0130P and Zafer K\u0131rb\u0131y\u0131k of Turkish \u0130HT.KOM.B\u0130RL., all three being extreme left-wing fractions.", "All the ensuing investigative measures, including the numerous expert appraisals carried out, are summarised below, accompanied by references to the annexes, as appropriate.", "87. Between 26 and 28 September 1999 the Prosecutor took statements from several (non-applicant) complainant prisoners, that is to say from Mu.\u00d6., E.G., M.M., V.\u00c7., Z.A.D., A.\u00c7., R.K., Me.\u00d6., A.Kan., H.E., M.E., R.T., A.K., B.\u00d6., Z.A.K., C.S., T.S., \u015e.B., \u0130.B., F.K., M.B., F.A., \u0130.G., B.H.Y., A.Y., U.K., \u0130.E., S.S., N.U., H.G., Y.Z., H.K., Z.M. and K.B.", "The latter confirmed the substance of the applicant party\u2019s version.", "88. On the other hand, two other (non-complainant) escaped prisoners, namely \u0130.D. and E.D. (from dormitories nos. 5 and 4 respectively) levelled accusations at some of the current and former applicants.", "\u0130.D. explained that he had been kidnapped and interrogated under threat of death by the applicants Nihat Konak (whom he described as the boss of his dormitory), Halil T\u00fcrker, Sava\u015f K\u00f6r and Ayd\u0131n \u00c7\u0131nar. On the day of the operation, Sava\u015f K\u00f6r had been instructed to prevent him from leaving dormitory no. 5. At one point Sava\u015f had dragged him by the scruff of the neck towards dormitory no. 4, threatening him with a stiletto; when the gendarmes began spraying the premises with foam, Sava\u015f had tried to throw a home-made bomb at them, but it had exploded in his hands. Taking advantage of the panic, \u0130.D. had run and taken refuge with the gendarmes. \u0130.D. added that he had heard that one of the guns had been used by Habib G\u00fcl and that some of the prison officers had been on friendly terms with the extreme leftist prisoners. Finally, \u0130.D. had requested police protection.", "89. For his part, E.D. stated that on 26 September 1999, in Ulucanlar Prison, the prisoners occupying dormitories nos. 4 and 5 had joined forces; the dormitory no. 4 \u201cboss\u201d had been Sad\u0131k T\u00fcrk, while dormitory no. 5 had been led by someone known as Nevzat \u00c7ift\u00e7i (alias Habib G\u00fcl). Habib G\u00fcl, C.\u00c7., Sad\u0131k T\u00fcrk and Erdal G\u00f6ko\u011flu had had real handguns, and during the operation they had opened fire on the gendarmes. The first shot had been fired from a handgun, and Habib G\u00fcl had, a priori, been holding that handgun. Subsequently, Habib G\u00fcl, C.\u00c7., Sad\u0131k T\u00fcrk and Erdal G\u00f6ko\u011flu had moved towards the dormitory no. 4 exercise area; they had been unable to climb over the barricades, but Habib G\u00fcl had nevertheless fired at the gendarmes on the watch tower.", "E.D. asserted that he had heard C.\u00c7. shout \u201cfire at will at the towers!\u201d. He continued:", "\u201cThe prisoners who triggered this incident were therefore Habib G\u00fcl, under the identity of Nevzat \u00c7ift\u00e7i, C.\u00c7., Sad\u0131k T\u00fcrk and Erdal G\u00f6ko\u011flu, who all had handguns ... Subsequently, Habib G\u00fcl and Erdal G\u00f6ko\u011flu brought along something which looked like a gun roiled up in a blanket; Habib G\u00fcl was carrying it, but I didn\u2019t see him using it. It could have been a hunting rifle.\u201d", "90. On 30 September 1999 E.D. had sent the Prison Director a second statement which he had written the day before, submitting that the first statement might have been incomplete because it had been written while he was still \u201cin shock\u201d. His second submissions had diverged somewhat, particularly as regards the afore-mentioned hunting rifle. Having pointed out that during the operation some of his fellow prisoners had wanted to surrender, E.D. continued as follows:", "\u201cbut the bosses shot at them to stop them surrendering. There were several firearms and knives in the dormitory; there was even a hunting rifle. Apart from that there was some bomb-making equipment.

One month before the operation we had been forced into training in the use of explosives and how to react to an \u2018enemy attack\u2019 ... Everyone except \u0130smet wanted to be transferred, but Enver Yan\u0131k opposed the move.

Between 25 July and 13 December 2000 the Prosecutor again interrogated many of the officers who had already been heard by the investigation committee (see paragraph 104 above), that is to say D.Y\u0131l., A.\u00d6z, \u0130.Ede, M.Kar., K.\u00d6zm., \u015e.Alt., H.Sar., M.Olu., \u00dc.Soy., M.Hak., H.Ayd., \u0130.Kar., A.G\u00fc\u00e7., A.Ali., N.Kes., C.Ayg., T.G\u00fcz., A.\u0130na., F.Apa., S.Y\u0131l., \u0130.Ofl., M.Cih., A.K\u00f6y., T.Akb., M.Cey., B.Tan., Y.\u00c7av., K.\u0130bi., G.\u00d6zt., Y.Akt., G.\u00d6za., \u00d6.\u00c7iv., Y.Yed., S.\u00dcnl., N.Atm., H.G\u00fcm., M.\u00c7a\u011f., A.Yan., M.Yap., A.Gem., B.Cey., \u015e.\u00c7ak., H.Ok, B.\u00c7i\u00e7., B.\u00d6na., N.K\u0131l., A.Can, M.Bib., M.Ar\u0131., B.Bal., H.Kul., C.Boz., S.Ya\u011f., B.Say., M.\u00d6ze., \u00d6.Y\u0131l., C.\u00dcna., A.Eme., S.Ata, \u015e.Cab., M.Y\u00fcc., M.Y\u00fcn.

Unlike the prison staff, who had benefited from a final discontinuance decision (see paragraph 106 above), the members of the gendarmerie were placed under formal investigation after the close of the administrative proceedings before the Governor of Ankara (see paragraph 108 above).", "On 25 December 2000 the consequent additional criminal investigation led to the commencement of proceedings under indictment no. 2000/5455.", "The Prosecutor accordingly referred 161 gendarmes to the 6th Division of the Ankara Assize Court (\u201cthe AAC\u201d) on charges of the murder of Mr \u00dcmit Alt\u0131nta\u015f, Mr Halil T\u00fcrker, Mr Abuzer \u00c7at and Mr Mahir Emsalsiz (List A), and bodily injury against 69 prisoners, including all the injured applicants (List B).", "That being the case, in his indictment the Prosecutor requested that no penalty be imposed on the gendarmes in question on the grounds that they had acted quite legitimately for the sole purpose of executing their superior officers\u2019 orders, and that in any case the perpetrators of the impugned acts were unidentifiable.", "113. Several applicants, who had meanwhile been heard pursuant to letters rogatory, joined those proceedings as intervening parties, which gave rise to the opening of case no. 2001/13.", "On 4 April 2001 the Prosecutor decided to take no action on the complaint lodged on 13 March 2000 by Ms K\u0131rb\u0131y\u0131k and registered under the third case no. 2001/16237 (see paragraph 85 above). Referring to the two sets of proceedings which were pending before the AAC and the 5th Division concerning the same facts (cases nos. 2001/13 and 2000/175 respectively), he considered it sufficient to include that complaint in the case files currently under examination.", "Ms K\u0131rb\u0131y\u0131k appealed against the decision to drop her complaint, arguing that the case pending under file no. 2001/13 only concerned members of the gendarmerie, whereas her complaint had also targeted the prison staff.", "That appeal was dismissed by the President of K\u0131r\u0131kkale Assize Court.", "114. The most important facts in relation to that judicial episode before the AAC are set out below.", "The remainder of the information largely concerned procedural questions relating to amendments to the court records necessitated by changes to the composition of the bench, complementary witness and defence statements, determination of the addresses of certain appellants and defendants and the enforcement of warrants of escort or arrest warrants against defendants who were untraceable or had absconded.", "Those subsidiary elements are summarised in Appendix VII.", "115. At the 14 May 2001 hearing the applicant H\u00fcseyin \u00c7at lodged a fresh complaint on behalf of his late son Abuzer \u00c7at, accompanied by a request to join the proceedings as an intervening party. A similar application was lodged on behalf of the applicant Sad\u0131k T\u00fcrk and \u015eaban Kavakl\u0131o\u011flu, the father of the late Mr \u0130smet Kavakl\u0131o\u011flu.", "The trial judges accepted Sad\u0131k T\u00fcrk as an intervening party, but on the other hand, they pointed out that Kavakl\u0131o\u011flu was not one of the complainants in the proceedings.", "Counsel for Sad\u0131k T\u00fcrk, joined by counsel for Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m Do\u011fan, sent several questions to be put to the defendants, asking, inter alia, which gendarmes had had firearms during the operation and which of them had actually used those firearms. Some of the defendants requested more time before answering, whereas A.\u00d6z. immediately admitted having used an injured gendarme\u2019s assault rifle; Z.Eng. pointed out that he had been in the midst of the operation and had used both his official handgun and a gendarmerie assault rifle; for his part, \u00d6.Y\u0131l. said that he had used two weapons in addition to his official assault rifle.", "The intervening parties also questioned M.Y\u00fcc. about the video recording which had been made from the watch tower where he had been stationed. The defendant denied the existence of any such recording.", "116. On 6 June 2001 the prisoner/complainant H.E. was once again questioned pursuant to letters rogatory at Afyon Prison. He confirmed, in particular, that he had seen guns in the hands of \u0130smet Kavakl\u0131o\u011flu and Nevzat \u00c7ift\u00e7i.", "117. On 9 July 2001 the complainants/applicants Melek Alt\u0131nta\u015f and Filiz Uzal appeared in court. The latter identified C.\u00dcna. as one of his torturers. Questioned by the complainant party, the defendants stated that they had only been informed about the operation the day before it was launched and that they did not know whether it had been planned earlier. They explained that they had all been carrying weapons in order to ward off any armed attacks, but that they had not used them, adding that they had seen prisoners killing two of their comrades who had wanted to surrender. Finally, they stated that they knew nothing about the circumstances under which the deceased prisoners had been stripped of their clothing.", "118. During the proceedings on 17 October the complainants/applicants present set out their allegations in detail, complaining of the violent acts committed during and after the operation, and their lawyers requested a face-to-face meeting between their clients and their assailants, considering that they were capable of describing the latter.", "The AAC adjourned the question of the expediency of such face-to-face meetings.", "119. On 24 April 2002 some of the complainants\u2019 lawyers appeared, as did, for the first time, the applicants Cemaat and Ocak, Esmehan Ekinci, and the defendant A.Eme., who contested all the accusations.", "The applicants described their allegations in detail and provided a description of some of the presumed torturers.", "The judges also heard H.M., an eye-witness from dormitory no. 7. He confirmed the substance of the applicants\u2019 submissions, specifying that he had seen Abuzer \u00c7at, Halil T\u00fcrker and \u00dcmit Alt\u0131nta\u015f being killed while they were attempting to evade the bullets, but that he had not seen \u0130smet Kavakl\u0131o\u011flu, who had allegedly been executed in the shower room after having been tortured.", "120. At the hearing on 27 June 2002 the applicants stated that they had been unable to identify those responsible from the photographs on file, firstly because of the poor quality of the images and secondly because some of the gendarmes had been wearing masks during the operation.", "121. On 25 December 2002 the applicants Melek Alt\u0131nta\u015f and Hayriye Kesgin appeared, as did counsel for the defendants. In order to assist with the identifications, some twenty additional photographs had been put on file; having examined the latter, Ms Kesgin was unable to affirm that she recognised any faces, explaining that most of the members of the security forces in question had been wearing balaclavas and had raised their shields.", "The AAC concluded that it would be unrealistic to try to use childhood portraits or pictures taken in a civilian context to identify fully equipped gendarmes operating in a gas- and smoke-filled environment. The judges therefore decided to exclude such evidence.", "122. On 4 March 2003 the applicant Cem \u015eahin was heard. He reiterated his complaint, explaining that the persons who had beaten had included a head prison officer, one \u201cYusuf\u201d, and a prison officer, one \u201cMehmet\u201d.", "123. On 9 June 2004 the applicant \u015eerife Ar\u0131\u00f6z was heard pursuant to letters rogatory in Isparta. Complementing her previous statements, she explained that the manner of quelling the prison riot in question had been unacceptable because the operation had been launched on an impromptu basis, without prior warning; she pointed out that previously it had been the prisoners in the female dormitory themselves who had called on the prison officers to carry out the presence check, which they had generally refused to do because they feared for their safety, even though, unlike the male dormitories, the female ones posed no problems. She added that she had fainted during the operation and could therefore not have committed the offences with which she had been charged.", "124. On 1 February 2006 the judges took note of a letter in which the Gendarmerie Command stated that no video recordings had been made or photographs taken during the operation. The judges ordered that that matter should be clarified in consultation with the prison authorities.", "125. Two more years passed before the case was ready for trial. The AAC delivered judgment on 24 September 2008. It found that, pursuant to Article 49 of the former Criminal Code, the defendants should be acquitted given that they had acted strictly within the framework of their duties, in accordance with the orders issued by their senior officers.", "The applicants appealed to the Court of Cassation on points of law.", "126. On 14 March 2012 the State Prosecutor with the Court of Cassation issued the following opinion:", "\u2013 the appeals on points of law lodged by certain of the applicants (applicants nos. 13, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 23, 28, 35, 37, 38, 43, 44, 45, 50, 53, 54, 57, 58, 60, 63 and 64 on List B) through the intermediary of their lawyers were inadmissible, since the latter had no power of attorney;", "\u2013 nevertheless, all the provisions of the impugned judgment should be invalidated on the grounds that the present case no. 2001/13 should have been examined in conjunction with case no. 2002/76 before the 5th Division of the AAC (\u201cthe 5th Division\u201d), that is to say after assessment of all the evidence included in both case files.", "127. The case is still pending before the Court of Cassation.", "128. Concurrently with their criminal appeals, all the applicants (List A and List B) filed claims for damages with the Ministries of Justice and the Interior, seeking compensation for the damage which they had sustained during and after the impugned operation.", "In the absence of a reply from the authorities, amounting to a tacit refusal, some of the applicants brought proceedings against the State before various chambers of the Ankara Administrative Court.", "129. It transpires from the case file that despite the dismissal of their prior claims, the following applicants (List B) failed to apply to the administrative courts: Ms Song\u00fcl Garip, Ms Hayriye Kesgin, Ms Fadime \u00d6zkan, Mr Serdar Atak, Mr Ayd\u0131n \u00c7\u0131nar, Mr K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Hasan \u00c7oban, Mr B\u00fclent \u00c7\u00fct\u00e7\u00fc, Mr \u0130lhan Emrah, Mr Ertu\u011frul Kaya, Mr Ertan \u00d6zkan and Mr \u00d6zg\u00fcr Salt\u0131k.", "130. Moreover, some of the claims were discontinued as not having been lodged:", "\u2013 on the grounds of non-payment of court fees despite reminders (applicants \u015eerife Ar\u0131\u00f6z, Filiz Uzal (Soylu), Zeynep G\u00fcng\u00f6rmez, Ercan Akp\u0131nar, Fatime Akal\u0131n, Aynur S\u0131z, Edibe Tozlu, Sibel Aktan (Akso\u011fan), Derya \u015eim\u015fek, Filiz G\u00fclkokuer, Sevin\u00e7 \u015eahing\u00f6z, Esmahan Ekinci, G\u00fcrc\u00fc \u00c7akmak, \u0130nan \u00d6zg\u00fcr Bahar, G\u00fcrhan H\u0131zmay, Cem \u015eahin, Behsat \u00d6rs, Veysel Ero\u011flu, Cemaat Ocak, \u00d6zg\u00fcr Soylu, Erdal G\u00f6ko\u011flu, Duygu Mutlu, Murat G\u00fcne\u015f et Yahya Y\u0131ld\u0131z);", "\u2013 on the grounds that the applicants were not accompanied by copies of the previous claims for compensation and/or because the full court fees had not been paid (applicants G\u00f6n\u00fcl Aslan, Devrim Turan, Sad\u0131k T\u00fcrk, Mehmet Kansu Keskinkan, \u00d6nder Mercan and Halil Do\u011fan);", "\u2013 in the absence of locus standi, the persons concerned having acted without the prior leave of their legal guardians (applicants Haydar Baran, Mustafa Sel\u00e7uk and Enver Yan\u0131k);", "\u2013 on unidentifiable grounds (applicants Kemal Yarar and Cemile S\u00f6nmez).", "Information on the decisions given to that end, which had meanwhile become final, is provided in Appendix VIII-A.", "131. On the other hand, applicants \u015eaban Kavakl\u0131o\u011flu, Mehiyet Emsalsiz, Selame T\u00fcrker, Ali Gen\u00e7aslan, Han\u0131m \u00c7ift\u00e7i, Hasan et H\u00fcseyin \u00c7at, Firdevs K\u0131rb\u0131y\u0131k et Melek Alt\u0131nta\u015f (List A), as well as applicants Resul Ayaz, Nihat Konak, Sava\u015f K\u00f6r, Bar\u0131\u015f G\u00f6n\u00fcl\u015fen, Murat Ekinci, Ba\u015fak Otlu and Cenker Aslan (List B) applied successfully and were awarded pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages.", "In all those cases, the relevant Chambers of the Ankara Administrative Court based their decisions on the following reasons:", "\u201cThe right to life is the most fundamental individual right. Accordingly, pursuant to Article 19 of the Constitution, which provides that \u2018[e]veryone has the right to personal liberty and security\u2019, that right is guaranteed by the Constitution, exceptions to which right are listed in the subsequent provisions of the same article. It transpires from those exceptions that custodial sentences passed by the courts are indeed cases in which a restriction of individual rights may be justified. However, where an individual must serve a custodial sentence ... it is always incumbent on the State to protect that individual\u2019s fundamental right to life while in prison and, throughout his prison term, to take all the necessary action and precautions to that end. In the present case, it is clear that the authorities must account for official shortcomings as regards the events in question and the consequent loss of life; because the reason why prisoners were able to obtain the stones, iron bars, cudgels and firearms with which they attacked the security forces and were able so easily to organise a riot was that inadequate measures had been taken [to prevent such eventualities].\u201d", "132. The respondent party challenged all those judgments before the State Council, whose 10th Chamber subsequently set them aside on the following grounds:", "\u2013 failure to answer the question whether, and to what extent, the authorities had been involved in the occurrence of the events giving rise to the alleged damage (applicants Resul Ayaz, Cenker Aslan and Bar\u0131\u015f G\u00f6n\u00fcl\u015fen [List B]);", "\u2013 lack of a causal link between the injuries complained of and any act attributable to the State agents (applicant Ba\u015fak Otlu [List B]);", "\u2013 the first-instance court had not had jurisdiction ratione personae, since the person concerned had not obtained prior authorisation from his guardian to seek locus standi (applicant Murat Ekinci [List B]);", "\u2013 the break of the causal link between the damage and the act which the authorities had allegedly committed, as the persons concerned had played an active role in the incidents at issue and had only themselves to blame for their injuries (applicants Nihat Konak and Sava\u015f K\u00f6r [List B] and the nine applicants on List A).", "133. As regards the applicant Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m Do\u011fan (List B), his case was dismissed at first instance by the 8th Chamber of the Ankara Administrative Court on the grounds of his presumed involvement in the impugned incidents. Nevertheless, the State Council also quashed that judgment, on the grounds that the mere fact that a military operation had had to be launched in order to impose discipline and order in a prison demonstrated that gross official negligence attributable to the State had been the root cause. The respondent authority\u2019s application for rectification of the judgment was dismissed.", "The 8th Chamber insisted that its initial judgment should be upheld, being convinced that \u201cthe injuries complained of in the instant case had been attributable to Mr Do\u011fan himself, which broke the causal link between the alleged damage and the act allegedly committed by the authority\u201d.", "The case was therefore sent back to the plenary State Council. The Court has not been informed of the outcome of those proceedings.", "134. The known developments in the above-mentioned proceedings are summarised in Appendix VIII-B. They are still pending before the relevant courts, and the applicants still concerned by them are Melek Alt\u0131nta\u015f, H\u00fcseyin and Hasan \u00c7at, Han\u0131m \u00c7ift\u00e7i, Mehiyet Emsalsiz, Ali Gen\u00e7aslan, \u015eaban Kaval\u0131o\u011flu, Selame T\u00fcrker and Firdevs K\u0131rb\u0131y\u0131k (List A), and Resul Ayaz, Ba\u015fak Otlu, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m Do\u011fan, Cenker Aslan, Bar\u0131\u015f G\u00f6n\u00fcl\u015fen, Murat Ekinci and Sava\u015f K\u00f6r (List B).", "135. It should be recalled that before the State Council adjudicated, the authority found against at first instance had apparently made payments to the successful applicants (see paragraph 131 above). Once those judgments had been set aside, the authority instigated enforcement procedures in order to recover those sums, which were no longer payable.", "It transpires from the case file that since 2011, some of the applicants have reimbursed the sums in question in part or in full.", "136. Initially, the criminal case against 86 prisoners, including all the applicants on List B, had been registered under file no. 2000/47 before the 5th Chamber pursuant to indictment no. 1999/79635 of 1 December 1999.", "The victims/complainants in that case were, on the one hand, the 15 gendarmes injured during the operation (Appendix II), and on the other, the late prisoners A.D., Nevzat \u00c7ift\u00e7i (alias Habib G\u00fcl), Zafer K\u0131rb\u0131y\u0131k, \u0130smet Kavakl\u0131o\u011flu and \u00d6nder Gen\u00e7aslan (relatives of the applicants on List A).", "137. On 1 December 1999, however, the Prosecutor \u2013 who had issued indictment no. 1999/79635 \u2013 concurrently gave a discontinuance decision. That decision concerned the deceased Mr \u00c7ift\u00e7i (alias Habib G\u00fcl), Mr K\u0131rb\u0131y\u0131k, Mr Kavakl\u0131o\u011flu, Mr Gen\u00e7aslan, Mr Alt\u0131nta\u015f, Mr \u00c7at, Mr Emsalsiz and Mr T\u00fcrker (relatives of the applicants on List A) in their capacity as \u201cvictims/defendants\u201d, as well as 27 non-applicant prisoners, in their capacity as \u201cdefendants\u201d. The latter included \u0130.D. and E.D., whose submissions (see paragraphs 88 to 90 above) had played a major role in establishing indictment no. 1999/79635. In short, the Prosecutor decided to cancel the prosecution of the deceased persons on grounds of death, and he discharged the 27 prisoners in question on grounds of lack of evidence as regards the charges linked to the impugned riot.", "138. Initially, by decision of 22 February 2000, the 5th Chamber declined jurisdiction in favour of the 2nd Chamber of the Ankara State Security Court, considering that the impugned acts had amounted to terrorist offences. On 3 April 2000, however, the latter court also declined jurisdiction ratione materiae and sent the case file back to the 5th Chamber.", "After that clash of jurisdiction was settled by the Court of Cassation, the case was finally reassigned to the 5th Chamber, under a new file number (no. 2000/175).", "The main stages in those proceedings may be summarised as follows. The other relevant information is to be found in Appendix IX, bearing in mind that the information goes no further than 5 July 2007.", "139. The indictment included in the new case file closely followed that of 1 December 1999 (see paragraph 136 above), and its content is therefore mainly based on the statements of prisoners E.D. and \u0130.D. (see paragraph 137 above).", "140. According to the Prosecutor, applicants Enver Yan\u0131k, Sad\u0131k T\u00fcrk and Erdal G\u00f6ko\u011flu and former applicants Cemal \u00c7akmak and Cafer Tayyar Bekta\u015f had used firearms; during a quarrel between the rioters and the prisoners wishing to surrender, Enver Yan\u0131k and Cemal \u00c7akmak had allegedly shot at the other three, considering them as traitors; Cemal \u00c7akmak had brought a hunting rifle rolled up in a blanket, and fired it at A.D., Zafer K\u0131rb\u0131y\u0131k, \u0130smet Kavakl\u0131o\u011flu, K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Hasan \u00c7oban and Nevzat \u00c7ift\u00e7i.", "Consequently, in addition to the charges of serious bodily injury of the fifteen gendarmes against all the applicants, the Prosecutor accused Cemal \u00c7akmak of having killed A.D., Zafer K\u0131rb\u0131y\u0131k and \u0130smet Kavakl\u0131o\u011flu and injured K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Hasan \u00c7oban with a hunting rifle. Still according to the Prosecutor, \u00d6nder Gen\u00e7aslan had been killed by a bullet from handgun no. 245PY74657 (see paragraph 44 above), which had been subsequently found in dormitory no. 4; the person responsible for that crime was allegedly one of the five rioters Enver Yan\u0131k, Cemal \u00c7akmak, Sad\u0131k T\u00fcrk, Erdal G\u00f6ko\u011flu and Cafer Tayyar Bekta\u015f; Nevzat \u00c7ift\u00e7i had allegedly been killed later on by a bullet in the back following indiscriminate shots fired by the five aforementioned rioters.", "141. On 5 December 2000 the 86 defendants challenged and lodged complaints against the judges of the 5th Chamber; they withdrew from the case pending the decision of the 6th Chamber of the same court, which had been called upon to adjudicate.", "On 25 December 2000 the 6th Chamber dismissed the grounds for challenging the judges but recorded its agreement to their withdrawal from the case in order to protect the court\u2019s impartiality. A new bench of judges took over the case.", "142. Following the failure of the attempt to join that case no. 2000/175 with case no. 2001/13 (see paragraph 126 above) \u2013 which had led to a temporary adjournment of proceedings \u2013 the present case had to be re-registered with the 5th Chamber under the new file number 2002/76.", "The parties to proceedings remained the same, and the records of the hearing in 2000 of some of the defendants/applicants pursuant to letters rogatory had meanwhile been added to the case file. All the latter had demanded leave to appear before the trial judges in order to defend themselves. Indeed, it transpires from the case file that initially, most of the applicants had acted in concert and submitted similar requests.", "143. On 13 March 2002 the proceedings were reopened before the 5th Chamber, which ordered some twenty procedural measures geared to summoning and hearing the defendants/applicants and the complainants.", "Prior to 25 January 2006 the hearings had mainly served to relaunch those same measures and to add the few new statements obtained to the case file.", "On 25 January 2006 the judges took note of the reply from the CDGA, explaining that it had been unable to accede to the request for urgent transmission of the video recordings made and the photographs taken during the impugned operation on the grounds that it was not in possession of the material in question.", "144. According to the latest information, the 5th Chamber had scheduled a hearing for 4 October 2007. The Court has no documentation on the progress of the proceedings in question, which is being conducted under file no. 2002/76 and has not yet been concluded because not all the defence statements of the persons involved have been collected, nor have all the measures ordered by the judges been enforced.", "..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2", "3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"]}
