After several days, K.S. allowed the applicant to see the baby and informed him that he could see her again, provided that he agreed to let his daughter stay in Hungary with K.S. and pay 500 euros (EUR) per month in child support. The applicant rejected this proposal and on 9 January 2012 returned to Italy.", "11.

On 28 February 2013 two members of the Mez\u0151t\u00far guardianship office\u2019s staff attempted to serve the order on K.S.; they were unsuccessful as they were unable to enter her home. As K.S.\u2019s post box was in a locked part of the building, they were not able to leave behind any notification either.
