AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Expulsion) (Conditional) (Hungary)", "JUDGES": "Dmitry Dedov;Elisabeth Steiner;Erik M\u00f8se;Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Khanlar Hajiyev;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Ksenija Turkovi\u0107", "TEXT": ["6. The applicant was born in 1995 and currently lives in Rein.", "7. He entered Austria on 20 October 2011 and lodged an asylum application. It remained undisputed by the Austrian authorities that at that time he was still a minor, even though his exact date of birth is unknown. He was not accompanied by any family members, nor were any of his relatives present in another member State of the European Union.", "8. The applicant stated that he had left his village in Afghanistan three months earlier, crossed the border to Iran and then the border to Turkey by foot. With the aid of a trafficker he reached Istanbul, where he stayed for three days. Together with a group of other refugees, he crossed into Greece by boat, where he was arrested and processed. He was released shortly after with an order to leave the country. He travelled to Athens, where he stayed for a month. He then left Greece together with two other refugees via the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia, from where he crossed the border to Hungary by foot.", "9. In Hungary, the applicant was arrested and processed. He claimed that he was forced to lodge an asylum request and placed in an open camp. Allegedly, the Hungarian authorities did not give any consideration to the fact that he was a minor. Because he had never planned to stay in Hungary, but wanted to lodge an asylum application in Austria, he left the camp two or three days later and took a train to Vienna.", "10. When the applicant was interviewed by the Austrian authorities on 21 October 2011, he stated that he did not want to return to Hungary. He claimed not to know the status of his asylum proceedings there because he was illiterate. In a second interview on 18 November 2011, he stated that he was arrested and detained for three days in Hungary. He was not given enough to eat and suffered from hunger in detention. He claimed that the conduct of the police towards him was rough. Officers were armed at all times, and he was woken up during the night for interviews. He further stated that he was afraid of being sent back to Serbia.", "11. When the applicant was asked why he had left Afghanistan, he stated that his family had sent him away so he could live a safer life. His father had died in Afghanistan six years earlier. His mother lived with the applicant and his three young siblings in the Jaghori district in Ghazni province. The precarious security situation and the lack of access to subsistence and education in the region prompted him to leave the country.", "12. On 15 December 2011 the Traiskirchen Federal Asylum Office (Bundesasylamt \u2013 hereinafter \"the Asylum Office\") rejected the applicant\u2019s asylum request and established Hungary\u2019s jurisdiction in this regard in accordance with Article 16 \u00a7 1 (c) of Council Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003 (\"the Dublin II Regulation\"). On 11 January 2012 the Asylum Court (Asylgerichtshof) quashed that decision pursuant to Article 66 \u00a7 2 of the Code of General Administrative Procedure (Allgemeines Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz) on the grounds that the facts had not been established exhaustively. It stated that the Asylum Office had failed to update its country information regarding the risk of refoulement of asylumseekers from Hungary to Serbia. Furthermore, the decision had not established the legal framework under which minors could be detained in Hungary and what the conditions of detention were.", "13. On 28 February 2012 the Asylum Office again rejected the applicant\u2019s asylum request and ordered his expulsion to Hungary under the Dublin II Regulation. In addition to general information on the situation of asylum-seekers in Hungary, the Asylum Office referred to information obtained from the Austrian Embassy in Hungary dated 25 January and 2 February 2012. According to that information, the detention of minors could not be ordered in Hungary. If a detained refugee claimed to be a minor, an age assessment was ordered and the minor was released if his or her age was confirmed. As regards the evaluation of Serbia by Hungary as a safe third country, the Hungarian authorities stated that they did not have a list of safe third countries and evaluated each case individually. However, in most cases Serbia was considered to be a safe third country. Hungary expelled asylum-seekers to Serbia, if their first asylum proceedings were terminated and there was no obstacle under the non-refoulement rule. A person lodging a subsequent asylum request was not allowed to remain in Hungary. The same applied for Dublin returnees if their first asylum proceedings were terminated. If asylum proceedings were discontinued after an asylum-seeker left Hungary, an asylum request after his or her return under the Dublin regulation was considered a subsequent asylum request. It was further established that appeals against asylum decisions at first instance and during the first proceedings had automatic suspensive effect. However, appeals against decisions in subsequent asylum proceedings did not. It was in any event possible to lodge an appeal against the expulsion order itself. It was then up to the judge\u2019s discretion to award the proceedings suspensive effect.", "14. When it came to the personal credibility of the applicant, the Asylum Office stated that it found his allegations of having been detained in Hungary for three days unconvincing, as the country information had shown that the detention of minors could not be ordered in Hungary. It further held that the information had shown that Hungary did not practise refoulement to Serbia. Finally, the Hungarian authorities had assumed jurisdiction over the applicant\u2019s asylum request under Article 16 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Dublin II Regulation, which proved that the applicant still had access to asylum proceedings on the merits in Hungary. The Asylum Office concluded that it hence did not consider itself legally obliged to make use of the sovereignty clause and rejected the asylum request.", "15. On 20 March 2012 the Asylum Court awarded suspensive effect to the applicant\u2019s appeal against that decision, but on 24 September 2012 dismissed it as unfounded. It pointed out that the Hungarian authorities had informed the Asylum Office that they had planned an age assessment, but could not carry it out because the applicant had left the country. Thereupon, on 24 October 2011 the Hungarian authorities had discontinued his proceedings. However, the Asylum Court assumed that because of Hungary\u2019s acceptance of jurisdiction under Article 16 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Dublin II Regulation the applicant would have access to asylum proceedings on the merits in Hungary. In its reasoning the Asylum Court took note of a letter from the UNHCR Office in Vienna dated 3 February 2012, seemingly citing problems with the techniques of age assessment in Hungary, detention and the detention conditions for asylum-seekers, refoulement to Serbia and the fact that a Dublin-returner\u2019s asylum request was considered a subsequent asylum request if the proceedings had been discontinued in Hungary. However, the Asylum Court noted a lack of sources in the UNHCR\u2019s letter and referred to the recently updated country information obtained by the Austrian asylum authorities, which did not indicate systematic deficiencies in the Hungarian asylum proceedings and reception conditions that would have warranted an extensive use of the sovereignty clause of Article 3 \u00a7 2 of the Dublin II Regulation.", "16. On 10 October 2012 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court, which was rejected on 22 November 2012. This decision was served on the applicant\u2019s counsel on 30 November 2012. An arrest order stated that a transfer of the applicant to the Hungarian authorities was planned for 22 November 2012. At that time, the applicant was still a minor.", "17. On 20 November 2012 the Court applied an interim measure under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court and requested the Austrian Government to stay the applicant\u2019s transfer to Hungary until further notice. The Austrian Government complied with this request.", "18. On 3 December 2012 the Hungarian Government informed the Court that the applicant\u2019s asylum proceedings in Hungary had been discontinued on 24 October 2011. The decision had become final on 4 November 2011. The first asylum proceedings would not be reopened upon his return to Hungary. If he was returned to Hungary, an asylum request would be considered a subsequent request which would not have automatic suspensive effect if there were no new circumstances supporting his application but there was a safe third country which he could be returned to. Regarding the issue of appointing a guardian for the minor applicant, the Hungarian authorities stated that unaccompanied minor asylum-seekers were usually immediately assigned a guardian, except when the applicant would reach the age of majority before the decision on the merits was taken. Unaccompanied minors were placed in a children\u2019s home in F\u00f3t, where care and education were provided to them according to their age. Having regard to the fact that the applicant would turn 18 on 1 January 2013, it was very unlikely that a guardian would be appointed for him upon his return."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
