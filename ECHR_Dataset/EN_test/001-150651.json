The expert explained that his first assessment had been concerned with the documentation of visible injuries and he had not been asked a specific question about scars.

The court also referred to the other oral, documentary, material and expert evidence.", "35. The court rejected the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment as unsubstantiated.

On 6 June 2008 the Donetsk Region Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal and upheld the judgment of the first-instance court. It noted that the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment had been far-fetched and, in any event, they had been properly examined by the prosecutor\u2019s office and the trial court.
