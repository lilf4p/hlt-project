At around noon on 21 June 2012, when the applicant was on his way home, six or seven plain-clothes police officers assaulted him near the Neftchilar metro station in Baku. Without showing their official identification, they restrained the applicant\u2019s arms and began to hit him below the knees. They kicked him in the lower part of his right ribcage and then slipped narcotic substances into his right trouser pocket.

The court justified the applicant\u2019s detention pending trial by the gravity of the charge, the fact that the applicant was charged with a criminal offence punishable by more than five years\u2019 imprisonment, and the likelihood that if released he might abscond from the investigation.", "16. On 14 August 2012 the Baku Court of Appeal upheld the detention order of 22 June 2012.", "17.

The surface of the abrasions is covered with a red scab and is situated below the level of healthy skin tissue. There is an analogical abrasion, measuring 1.0x0.1 cm, on the middle of the outer side of the right thigh (bud). No other injuries were noticed on the body.", "Conclusion", "Relying on the forensic examination of H. Mammadov, born in 1959 and the initial information, and in reply to the questions addressed in the decision, I conclude as follows:", "1. The following injuries were noticed on the body of citizen H. Mammadov: abrasions on the left calf and on the right thigh.", "2. The above-mentioned injuries were caused by a hard blunt object(s). They could have been inflicted in the circumstances and at the time indicated in the descriptive part of the decision, namely on 21 June 2012. The degree of the injuries has not been determined because they are not injuries causing harm to health.\u201d", "28. The applicant was not provided with a copy of the forensic report.", "29. It appears from the case file that on 22 June 2012 the applicant\u2019s complaint of ill-treatment was transferred to the Nizami District Prosecutor\u2019s Office.", "30. On 29 June 2012 an investigator at the Nizami District Prosecutor\u2019s Office questioned the applicant about his ill-treatment by the police. The applicant reiterated his previous statement, pointing out that at around noon on 21 June 2012 he had been beaten up during his arrest by six or seven plain-clothes police officers. He further stated that these police officers had also participated in the search at the NDMIA on 21 June 2012 and that the name of one of them was Q.", "31. It appears from the documents submitted by the Government that on 31 July 2012 the Head of the Serious Crimes Department of the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office asked the Deputy Prosecutor General to order the examination of the applicant\u2019s complaint of ill-treatment received by the Nizami District Prosecutor\u2019s Office.", "32. On 6 and 9 August 2012 an investigator at the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office separately questioned four police officers, including Q., who had participated in the arrest and search. The wording of their statements was identical. They each claimed that they had not used physical force against the applicant during his arrest.", "33. On 13 and 14 August 2012 the investigator separately questioned three police officers who had been on guard duty at the temporary detention centre when the applicant had been taken there following his arrest. Their statements were also identical, each claiming that, when the applicant had been taken to the temporary detention centre, he had not complained of illtreatment.", "34. On 15 August 2012 the applicant was questioned by the investigator and reiterated that he had been beaten up during his arrest. In reply to the investigator\u2019s question concerning the fact that the police officers who had participated in his arrest had denied the allegation of ill-treatment, the applicant stated that they had lied in their statements.", "35. On the same day the investigator examined the clothes that the applicant had been wearing on the day of his arrest. The investigator found that the clothes were not damaged.", "36. On 17 August 2012 the investigator ordered an additional examination of the applicant by a forensic commission. In particular, he asked the experts to establish whether the injuries found on the applicant\u2019s body could have resulted from his body coming into contact with \u201csharp parts of the vehicle\u201d (avtomobilin \u00e7\u0131x\u0131nt\u0131 hiss\u0259l\u0259ri) during his arrest.", "37. On 23 August 2012 the applicant was examined by two experts who issued forensic report no. 213 on 24 August 2012. According to the forensic report, the applicant complained of having been beaten up during his arrest on 21 June 2012. The experts confirmed the existence of injuries on the applicant\u2019s body, but concluded that they had resulted from the applicant\u2019s body coming into contact with \u201cangular protruding parts of the vehicle\u201d (avtomobilin qabar\u0131q tinli hiss\u0259l\u0259ri) during his arrest. The relevant part of the forensic report reads as follows:", "\u201cInformation about the case:", "...", "1. The person examined is a man of medium height, normal build and well fed.", "2. There is brown-grey pigmentation in the shape of a strip, measuring 1.4x0.3 cm, on the middle of his outer left calf. No injury or trace of injury was noticed on other parts of his body.", "Conclusion", "Relying on the forensic examination of H. Mammadov, born in 1959, the facts indicated in the descriptive part of the decision, the observations indicated in forensic report no. 554 in respect of him and in reply to the questions addressed in the decision, the commission of experts concludes as follows:", "1. There are two abrasions on the middle of the outer side of his left calf and one abrasion on the middle outer side of his right thigh.", "2. The above-mentioned injuries were caused by a hard blunt object(s). They could have been inflicted at the time indicated in the descriptive part of the decision, namely on 21 June 2012. The degree of the injuries has not been determined because they are not injuries causing harm to health.", "3. Taking into consideration the characteristics (morphological particularities) and location of the injuries found on the outer sides of the left calf and of the right thigh of H. Mammadov, and the fact that such injuries could not have been inflicted by another person or other persons in the passenger compartment of a car, it is refuted that these injuries could have been inflicted in the circumstances described in the statement of H. Mammadov.", "3.1. It therefore results from the above-mentioned observations that the injuries found on the outer sides of the left calf and of the right thigh of H. Mammadov were caused by contact of the examined lower parts of his body with angular protruding parts of the vehicle when he was put in the car.", "4. No injury or trace of injury corresponding to the circumstances described in H. Mammadov\u2019s explanation and statements that he was beaten in the head, neck and chest in the passenger compartment of the vehicle was noticed either during the initial forensic examination dated 22 June 2012 or during the additional commission forensic examination of 23 August 2012.\u201d", "38. The applicant was not provided with a copy of forensic report no. 213.", "39. On 27 August 2012 the Deputy Prosecutor General refused to institute criminal proceedings in connection with the applicant\u2019s complaint of ill-treatment. The prosecutor concluded that it had not been established that the applicant had been beaten up during his arrest. In this connection, he relied on the conclusions of the forensic report of 24 August 2012, the statements from four police officers who had participated in the applicant\u2019s arrest and from three police officers who had been on guard duty at the temporary detention centre on 21 June 2012. The relevant part of the decision reads as follows:", "\u201cQ. also stated that when they arrested H. Mammadov on the territory of the Nizami District they had shown their official identification and had not used any violence against him.", "The police officers of the NDMIA (A.X., C.M. and Q.H.) who had been questioned during the inquiry made statements similar to that of Q., pointing out that H. Mammadov had not been subjected to violence during his arrest and search.", "...", "It appears from forensic report no. 554 dated 23 June 2012 issued by ... that H. Mammadov sustained abrasions on his left calf and right thigh. Their degree of gravity has not been determined because they are not injuries causing harm to health.", "On 17 August 2012 a decision ordering an additional commission forensic examination was adopted. It appears from forensic report no. 213 dated 24 August 2012 in respect of H. Mammadov issued by ... that the injuries found on the outer sides of the left calf and of the right thigh of H. Mammadov were caused by contact of the examined lower parts of his body with angular protruding parts of the vehicle when he was put in the car. No injury or trace of injury corresponding to the circumstances described in H. Mammadov\u2019s statement that he had been beaten in the head, neck and chest in the passenger compartment of the vehicle was noticed either during the initial forensic examination dated 22 June 2012 or during the additional commission forensic examination of 23 August 2012.", "...", "After having comparatively analysed the facts of the case with the material collected during the inquiry, I therefore conclude that the allegations of H. Mammadov ... that the injuries found on his body were caused on 21 June 2012 when he was beaten up and was subjected to physical force during his arrest by police officers are not proven.", "Accordingly, as the allegations that H. Mammadov was beaten up and subjected to physical force during his arrest by police officers of the NDMIA are not proven, no criminal act was committed. In accordance with Article 39.1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, institution of criminal proceedings should be refused.\u201d", "40. It appears from the document submitted by the Government that the investigator in charge of the case sent a copy of the prosecutor\u2019s decision of 27 August 2012 to the detention centre where the applicant was detained at that time. Although the document was signed by the investigator, it was not dated. Moreover, the date on which it was sent was not indicated on the document.", "41. In the meantime, on 6 July 2012, having received no response from the investigating authorities concerning his complaint of ill-treatment, the applicant lodged a complaint with the Nasimi District Court concerning the investigating authorities\u2019 failure to investigate his complaint of ill-treatment. The applicant asked the court to find a violation of his right protected under Article 3 of the Convention.", "42. In support of his complaint, he submitted that on 21 June 2012, without showing their official identification, six or seven plain-clothes police officers had assaulted him near the Neftchilar metro station in Baku. They restrained his arms and began to strike him in below the knees. They kicked him in the lower part of his right ribcage and then slipped narcotic substances into his right trouser pocket. They then dragged him into their car where they continued to beat him. In the car they started to insult him, making comments about his ethnic origin, and threatened him on account of a video recording he had uploaded to the YouTube online video platform.", "43. On 29 August 2012 the Nasimi District Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint. The court held that a criminal inquiry had already been carried out in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaint of ill-treatment and by a decision of 27 August 2012 the Deputy Prosecutor General had refused to institute criminal proceedings. The court further held that as the prosecutor\u2019s decision was still in force, it could not deliver a new decision in this connection. The applicant could, however, lodge a complaint against the prosecutor\u2019s decision of 27 August 2012.", "44. Following the delivery of the Nasimi District Court\u2019s decision of 29 August 2012, the applicant learned about the existence of the Deputy Prosecutor General\u2019s decision of 27 August 2012 refusing to institute criminal proceedings in respect of his complaint of ill-treatment. The court also provided him for the first time with copies of the forensic reports of 23 June 2012 and of 24 August 2012.", "45. On 14 September 2012 the Baku Court of Appeal upheld the Nasimi District Court\u2019s decision of 29 August 2012.", "46. On an unspecified date in October 2012 the applicant lodged a complaint with the court against the Deputy Prosecutor General\u2019s decision of 27 August 2012 refusing to institute criminal proceedings. He reiterated his previous complaints concerning his ill-treatment by the police during his arrest and complained about the ineffectiveness of the criminal inquiry. In this connection, he disputed the conclusions of the additional forensic report of 24 August 2012. He asked the court to quash the prosecutor\u2019s decision and declare it unlawful. He also asked the court to hear the experts who had conducted his forensic examinations and the police officers who had participated in his arrest.", "47. On 8 November 2012 the Sabail District Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint, finding the prosecutor\u2019s decision justified. The court, however, made no mention of the applicant\u2019s particular requests that it hear the experts and the police officers. The relevant part of the decision reads as follows:", "\u201cHaving examined the allegations that the complainant H. Mammadov was subjected to ill-treatment by police officers during his arrest and that he was beaten up and subjected to degrading treatment when he was taken to the NDMIA, the court considers that a thorough investigation in this respect was conducted by the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office of the Republic of Azerbaijan in accordance with the current legislation and the requirements of the international treaties. All possible measures were taken during this investigation; the persons who had been involved in the complainant\u2019s arrest and had been in contact with him immediately after his arrest were questioned; a forensic examination and an additional commission forensic examination were carried out; however, the collected material did not prove the allegations indicated in the complaint.", "In these circumstances, the court considers that it was not possible to collect sufficient evidence which could constitute the basis for instituting criminal proceedings in connection with the injuries sustained by H. Mammadov on 21 June 2012.", "Therefore, taking into consideration the collected material and the evidence examined at the court hearing, the court considers that the decision of 27 August 2012 refusing to institute criminal proceedings adopted within his competence by the Deputy Prosecutor General of the Republic of Azerbaijan ... was justified and H. Mamadov\u2019s application for its quashing should be dismissed.\u201d", "48. On an unspecified date the applicant appealed against that decision, reiterating his previous complaints.", "49. On 19 November 2012 the Baku Court of Appeal upheld the firstinstance court\u2019s decision. The appellate court\u2019s decision was identical in its wording to the Sabail District Court\u2019s decision of 8 November 2012.", "50. It appears from the applicant\u2019s observations submitted to the Court in reply to the Government\u2019s observations that the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention of the Human Rights Council of the United Nations (\u201cthe Working Group on Arbitrary Detention\u201d) delivered its opinion no. 59/2013 concerning the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention on 22 November 2013. The relevant part of the opinion reads as follows:", "\u201c2. The Working Group regards deprivation of liberty as arbitrary in the following cases:", "(a) When it is clearly impossible to invoke any legal basis justifying the deprivation of liberty (as when a person is kept in detention after the completion of his or her sentence or despite an amnesty law applicable to the detainee) (category I);", "(b) When the deprivation of liberty results from the exercise of the rights or freedoms guaranteed by articles 7, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20 and 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and, insofar as States parties are concerned, by articles 12, 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26 and 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (category II);", "(c) When the total or partial non-observance of the international norms relating to the right to a fair trial, established in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned, is of such gravity as to give the deprivation of liberty an arbitrary character (category III);", "(d) When asylum seekers, immigrants or refugees are subjected to prolonged administrative custody without the possibility of administrative or judicial review or remedy (category IV);", "(e) When the deprivation of liberty constitutes a violation of international law for reasons of discrimination based on birth; national, ethnic or social origin; language; religion; economic condition; political or other opinion; gender; sexual orientation; or disability or other status, and which aims towards or can result in ignoring the equality of human rights (category V).", "Submissions", "Communication from the source", "3. The case summarized below was reported to the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.", "4. Hilal Mammadov, born in XXXX in Astara Rayon, Azerbaijan, is an Azerbaijani journalist and a defender of minority rights. Since 9 June 2012, he has been the editorin-chief of the Baku-based newspaper Tolishi Sado (The Voice of Talysh), the only newspaper printed in the minority Talysh language.", "5. The source informs the Working Group that the Talysh people are an ethnic minority residing in southern Azerbaijan.", "6. On 21 June 2012, Mr. Mammadov was arrested by the Nasimi District Police pursuant to article 234.4.3 of the Criminal Code of Azerbaijan in relation to illegal manufacture, purchase, storage, transfer, transport or sale of drugs in a large quantity. According to the source, the authorities alleged that they had seized five grams of heroin from his person, and approximately 30 grams from his place of residence.", "7. On 22 June 2012, the Nasimi District Court (Baku City) sentenced Mr. Mammadov to three months\u2019 detention. Mr. Mammadov appealed the sentence and requested to be permitted to serve the term under house arrest. On 10 September 2012, the Baku Appeal Court upheld the original decision, denying him provisional release. Mr. Mammadov remains in detention to this day.", "...", "17. On 28 November 2012, Mr. Mammadov\u2019s lawyers reported that, following the completion of the investigation into the criminal charges against him, Mr. Mammadov was charged under article 274 (high treason), article 283.2.2 (incitement to national, racial or religious hostility) and articles 234.4.3 (illegal manufacturing, purchase, storage, transportation, transfer or selling of narcotics and psychotropic substances) of the Criminal Code.", "18. On 21 December 2012, the hearing of Mr. Mammadov\u2019s criminal charges was reportedly transferred to the Baku Grave Crimes Court. A preparatory session defining the procedural issues of the case took place on 9 January 2013. On that date, Mr. Mammadov\u2019s lawyer reportedly submitted two motions: one requesting an audiovisual recording of the hearing; and another requesting that his client be allowed to sit beside his lawyer rather than behind secure bars. The source informs the Working Group that both motions were rejected.", "19. The source was informed by the Human Rights Centre of Azerbaijan that Mr. Mammadov had been beaten and injured by his cellmate in a Kurdakhani prison on 26, 28 and 29 November 2012. The source reports that Mr. Mammadov was placed in the cell two weeks prior to the attacks. Mr. Mammadov\u2019s lawyers had requested on several occasions that he be removed from the cell as his cellmate\u2019s behaviour was aggressive to the point of preventing him from sleeping at night. Those requests were all ignored. On 29 November 2012, his cellmate was transferred to the medical unit of the prison hospital for treatment of his reportedly severe mental illness.", "20. The source considers the ongoing harassment of Mr. Mammadov as an attempt to silence his efforts to report on human rights violations. The source points out that Mr. Mammadov\u2019s arrest came shortly before the first edition of the Tolishi Sado newspaper under his authority as editor-in-chief was due to be published (at the end of June 2012). He was arrested after posting music and a video clip on the Internet which attracted attention to the Talysh culture.", "21. The source submits that Mr. Mammadov faces imprisonment sentences ranging up to life for trumped-up charges brought against him successively in June and July 2012, and most recently in November 2012.", "22. The source signals its concern with regard to Mr. Mammadov\u2019s conditions of detention in the light of the fate that befell Novruzali Mammadov, the former editorin-chief of the Tolishi Sado newspaper, who was allegedly subjected to similar acts of harassment and arbitrary detention in 2007, and who died in custody on 17 August 2009.", "23. The source concludes that the detention of Hilal Mammadov is arbitrary and considers it an obvious attempt to silence his efforts to report on human rights violations. Furthermore, his rights to legal protection have been violated.", "24. The source further expresses its fears for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Mammadov.", "Response from the Government", "...", "Discussion", "61. The Working Group was informed that Mr. Mammadov has been sentenced to five years in prison for criminal offences relating to \u201cillegal selling of drugs\u201d, \u201chigh treason\u201d and \u201cincitement to national, racial, social and religious hatred and hostility\u201d under articles 234.4.3, 274 and 283 respectively of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan.", "62. The source alleged that the authorities fabricated the case against Mr. Mammadov due to his human rights work and support for the minority Talysh population.", "63. The source informed the Working Group that Mr. Mammadov was a consultant with the Institute for Democracy and Peace and editor-in-chief of Tolishi Sado, the only newspaper in the minority Talysh language in Azerbaijan. Mr. Mammadov was also head of the Committee for the Defence of Novruzali Mammadov, a prominent Talysh scientist and human rights activist and former editor-in-chief of Tolishi Sado, who was charged in June 2008 with espionage, subsequently sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment, and who died in prison in 2009.", "64. Hilal Mammadov was arrested on 21 June 2012 for alleged possession of heroin. On 3 July 2012 and 23 November 2012, he was also charged with treason and incitement of national, racial, social and religious hatred and hostility. His hearing in the Baku Grave Crimes Court began on 29 January 2013; he was convicted of the charges brought against him and sentenced on 27 September 2013.", "65. In its response, the Government set out the case for the prosecution and the court\u2019s judgment. However, the Working Group is of the view that the Government did not provide a satisfactory explanation as to the allegations put forward by the source concerning the arbitrary character of the charges against Mr. Mammadov and his subsequent conviction.", "66. The information provided by the source and the Government to the Working Group indicates that the charges of treason and incitement of national, racial, social and religious hatred and hostility are based on Mr. Mammadov\u2019s legitimate exercise of the right of freedom of expression under article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. As such, the Working Group considers that the deprivation of liberty of Hilal Mammadov falls within category II of the arbitrary detention categories referred to by the Working Group when considering cases submitted to it.", "67. Furthermore, the Working Group is of the view that the response from the Government does not adequately address the source\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment to which Mr. Mammadov has been subjected in detention, its concerns for his health, nor the groundless rejection of his application for an audio-visual recording of the hearing.", "68. The Working Group finds that these violations of international law relating to the right of a fair trial are of such gravity as to give the deprivation of liberty of Hilal Mammadov an arbitrary character. As such, the Working Group considers that Mr. Mammadov\u2019s detention falls within category III of the arbitrary detention categories referred to by the Working Group when considering cases submitted to it.", "Disposition", "69. In the light of the foregoing, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention renders the following opinion:", "The detention of Hilal Mammadov is arbitrary, being in contravention of articles 9, 11 and 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 9, 12 and 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It falls within categories II and III of the arbitrary detention categories referred to by the Working Group when considering cases submitted to it.", "70. Consequent upon the opinion rendered, the Working Group requests the Government of Azerbaijan to remedy the situation of Mr. Mammadov and bring it into conformity with the standards and principles set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.", "71.", "51. The applicant\u2019s representative, Mr Bagirov, was an advocate and a member of the Azerbaijani Bar Association (\u201cthe ABA\u201d). He was affiliated to Law Office no. 6 in Baku.", "52. In November 2014 disciplinary proceedings were instituted against Mr Bagirov by the ABA on the basis of a letter dated 25 September 2014 from a judge of the Shaki Court of Appeal. In his letter the judge informed the ABA that Mr Bagirov had breached the ethical rules of conduct for advocates at the court hearings held in September 2014 before the Shaki Court of Appeal within the criminal proceedings against I.M.", "53. On 10 December 2014 the Collegium of the ABA held a meeting at which it examined the complaint against Mr Bagirov. Following the meeting, the Collegium of the ABA held that Mr Bagirov had breached the ethical rules of conduct for advocates because at the court hearing he had made the following remark about the judicial system: \u201cLike State, like court ... If there were justice in Azerbaijan, Judge R.H. would not deliver unfair and partial judgments, nor would an individual like him be a judge\u201d (\u201cBel\u0259 d\u00f6vl\u0259tin bel\u0259 d\u0259 m\u0259hk\u0259m\u0259si olacaq ...

On the same day the Collegium of the ABA decided to refer Mr Bagirov\u2019s case to a court with a view to his disbarment. It also decided to suspend his activity as an advocate (v\u0259killik f\u0259aliyy\u0259ti) pending a decision by the court.", "54. It appears from documents submitted to the Court that, following the suspension of Mr Bagirov\u2019s activity as an advocate, the domestic authorities no longer allowed him to meet the applicant in the prison.", "55. On 29 March 2015 Mr Bagirov sent a letter to the Head of the Prison Service of the Ministry of Justice asking for a meeting with his six clients held in detention, including the applicant. He specified in his letter that he was the representative of those individuals before the Court and requested a meeting with them in connection with their pending cases before the Court. The relevant part of the letter reads as follows:", "\u201cI am writing to inform you that I represent before the European Court of Human Rights the following persons who are detained in the penal facilities and temporary detention centres under your authority.", "I ask you to allow a meeting with these persons in connection with the progress of their cases based on their applications (the numbers of the applications are mentioned below) lodged with the European Court.", "1.

By a letter of 14 April 2015, the Deputy Head of the Prison Service refused to allow Mr Bagirov to meet the applicant in the prison. The relevant part of the letter reads as follows:", "\u201cYour request for the organisation of a meeting in the penal facilities and detention centres with the persons detained in the penal facilities and the convicted inmates in order to provide them with advocacy services has been examined.", "It is explained that, as your advocacy activity at Law Office no. 6 has been suspended by decision no. 29 of 10 December 2014 of the Bar Association of the Republic of Azerbaijan and you have been disbarred, and that you can no longer practise as an advocate in court and investigation proceedings from that date, it is impossible to grant you access to the penal establishments as counsel.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "34"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
