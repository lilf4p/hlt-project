Moments later, the applicants were hit by the heat wave from the aircraft\u2019s turbines, which burnt their clothes and skin. The soles of Mr Yegorov\u2019s shoes were also completely burned.

When the applicants got up, they saw numerous mutilated bodies of dead, burnt and wounded people around them. Whilst attempting to provide first aid to accident survivors, Mr Anatoliy Shevchuk lost view of his son, who wandered off in the midst of the mutilated bodies and screaming people. After having looked for his son for about an hour, Mr Anatoliy Shevchuk found him uninjured physically, but in a state of deep mental shock, unable to speak or make productive contact with others.
