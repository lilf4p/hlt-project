On 5 February 2009 the applicants and their company, M.N., entered into an agreement with M.G. and his company, E. By virtue of that agreement the applicants acknowledged their debt of 580,000 Croatian kunas (HRK) to M.G. and their company\u2019s debt of HRK 180,000 to company E. In order to secure the overall loan, the applicants used their house as collateral, allowing M.G. to register a charge on it. It was stipulated that unless the applicants and their company paid their outstanding debts by 1 May 2009, the creditors were entitled to institute enforcement proceedings for payment of the debt through the sale of the applicants\u2019 house.", "8. On 20 October 2009 M.G. and his company E. instituted enforcement proceedings against the applicants before the Pore\u010d Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Pore\u010du), seeking the judicial sale of the house. They argued that the applicants had failed to pay their debt to M.G., while the company M.N. had managed to pay only part of its debt to the company E. The applicants\u2019 outstanding debt amounted to HRK 703,643.05.", "9. On 17 November 2009 the Pore\u010d Municipal Court granted that request and issued an enforcement order against the applicants. The applicants did not appeal and the enforcement order became final on 17 December 2009.", "10. On 11 December 2009 the Pore\u010d Municipal Court registered the enforcement order on the applicants\u2019 house in the land register.", "11. A hearing to assess the value of the property was held before the Pore\u010d Municipal Court on 4 May 2010. Both applicants were properly summoned, but only the first applicant appeared. He undertook to submit an expert valuation of the house within two days. The creditor asked the Municipal Court to commission an expert for that purpose. The first applicant did not comply with his undertaking.", "12. On 16 June 2010 the valuation of the house was carried out on site by a civil engineer and a surveyor, in the presence of the first applicant.", "13.

The applicants made no objections to the valuation.", "14. On 7 October 2010 another set of enforcement proceedings against the applicants was joined to the proceedings at issue. In the former proceedings an enforcement order had been issued against the applicants at the request of the Pore\u010d Municipality on 12 May 2010, in respect of a claim of HRK 24,352.94 (approximately 3,200 euros). Since the applicants had not lodged an appeal, the enforcement order had become final on 12 June 2010.", "15. On 25 October 2010 the Municipal Court set the value of the applicants\u2019 house at HRK 2,463,092.48.", "16. On 25 January 2011 a first public auction was held. However, there were no interested buyers. The applicants, though properly summoned, did not appear.", "17.

On 23 April 2012 the applicants lodged an appeal against that decision, arguing that the judicial sale had been disproportionate since the true value of their house had been about 700,000 euros (EUR). They also argued that the Municipal Court had failed to comply with the provisions of the Enforcement Act, which stated that courts should respect the dignity of debtors subject to enforcement and should make the enforcement process as humane as possible.", "22.

On 20 February 2013 the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law against the decision of the Pula County Court, relying on section 382(2) of the Civil Procedure Act. They argued that the actual value of their house was around EUR 700,000, and that their house should have been exempted from enforcement as it was \u201cmeeting their basic human needs\u201d.", "26. On the same day, the applicants applied to the Pore\u010d Municipal Court for a stay of enforcement.", "27. On 22 February 2013 the Pore\u010d Municipal Court declared the applicants\u2019 appeal on points of law inadmissible on the grounds that such an appeal was allowed in enforcement proceedings only if based on section 382(2) of the Civil Procedure Act, which was not the case. The applicants lodged an appeal.", "28.

The applicants immediately applied to the Pore\u010d Municipal Court for an interim measure prohibiting M.G. from having the electricity and water cut off and from making alterations to the house, ordering HEP to reconnect the electricity, and authorising them to keep the house until the enforcement proceedings were complete. On the same day the Pore\u010d Municipal Court issued the interim measure, prohibited M.G. from having the electricity and water cut off and ordered HEP to reconnect the electricity.

The applicants, though properly summoned, did not appear.", "32. On 17 September 2013 the Pore\u010d Municipal Court ordered the eviction of the applicants. The applicants lodged an appeal, arguing that enforcement should not have been carried out by the sale of their house, which served to \u201csatisfy their basic needs\u201d: they lived there with their family and it also served as their business premises.", "33.
