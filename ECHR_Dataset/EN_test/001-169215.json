The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Kor\u00e7a.", "5. On 14 July 1995 and 14 June 1996 the Kor\u00e7a Commission on Restitution and Compensation of Properties (Komisioni i Kthimit dhe Kompensimit t\u00eb Pronave) (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) decided to recognise the applicant\u2019s inherited property title to two plots of land measuring 118 sq. m and restore them to the applicant.", "6. On an unspecified date the Kor\u00e7a Regional Company for the Distribution of Electricity (Nd\u00ebrmarja zonale e shp\u00ebrndarjes s\u00eb energjis\u00eb elektrike) (\u201cthe defendant\u201d) started the construction of a high-voltage line on the applicant\u2019s plots of lands.", "7. On an unspecified date the applicant sought an injunction to suspend the construction works.", "8. On 13 January 2006 the Kor\u00e7a District Court (\u201cthe District Court\u201d) issued an injunction and ordered the construction to be suspended. On 8 March 2006 and 4 May 2007 the Kor\u00e7a Court of Appeal (\u201cthe Court of Appeal\u201d) and the Supreme Court respectively upheld that decision.", "9.

The District Court reasoned that the defendant had unlawfully constructed that line on the applicant\u2019s property.", "On 27 June 2006 the Court of Appeal upheld that judgment. On an unspecified date the defendant lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court against the lower courts\u2019 judgments.", "12. On 10 August 2006 the applicant requested that the bailiff enforce the judgment of 7 April 2006, as upheld by the Court of Appeal on 27 June 2006. However, as the proceedings on the merits of the case were pending before the Supreme Court (see paragraph 11 above), on 8 September 2006 the Supreme Court provisionally decided to stay the enforcement proceedings.", "13. Subsequently, the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal against the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 8 September 2006.", "14.

On 6 December 2012 the Court of Appeal amended that decision and decided that the proceedings could continue. It appears that the case is still pending before the domestic courts.", "24. On 6 February 2007 AEC brought a civil action against the applicant to annul the administrative decisions of 14 July 1995 and 14 June 1996 on the grounds that the plots of land had belonged to and had been used by AEC since 1960.", "25. On 24 January 2008 the District Court ordered the freezing of the title to the applicant\u2019s plots of land (vendim p\u00ebr marrjen e mas\u00ebs s\u00eb sigurimit t\u00eb padis\u00eb duke bllokuar pron\u00ebn n\u00eb Zyr\u00ebn e Regjistrimit t\u00eb Pasurive t\u00eb Paluajtshme). On 12 December 2008 and 26 January 2012 the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court lifted the freezing order.", "26. On 31 July 2008 the District Court decided, at the applicant\u2019s request, to stay the proceedings and await the conclusion of other civil and criminal proceedings instituted by the applicant. On 6 January 2009 and 17 October 2013 the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court respectively upheld that decision.", "27. On 5 March 2014 the District Court discontinued its examination of the case on the grounds that AEC had failed to attend a hearing without good reason. It would appear that AEC did not appeal against that judgment and it became final on an unspecified date.", "28. On two other occasions AEC and DEC brought civil actions against the applicant to annul the administrative decisions of 14 July 1995 and 14 June 1996. On 17 April 2012 and 22 December 2014, respectively, the District Court discontinued its examination of the actions on the grounds that AEC and DEC had failed to attend hearings for no good reason. It appears that they did not appeal against either judgment and they became final on an unspecified date."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
