BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "George Nicolaou;Guido Raimondi;Ledi Bianku;Nona Tsotsoria;Paul Mahoney;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["1. The applicant, Ms Jasna Raljevi\u0107, is a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who was born in 1943 and lives in Mostar. She was represented before the Court by Ms M. \u0160koro, a lawyer practising in Mostar.", "2. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Deputy Agent, Ms Z. Ibrahimovi\u0107.", "3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "4. In 1949 the applicant and her parents moved in a flat in Mostar owned by E.R.\u2019s father. In 1963 the applicant\u2019s parents were given the occupancy right on that flat.", "5. In 1998, following her mother\u2019s death, the occupancy right was transferred to the applicant in accordance with the Housing Act 1974 (see paragraph 24 below).", "6. On 12 November 2003 E.R., who inherited the flat after his father\u2019s death, initiated proceedings before the Ministry of Spatial Planning and Construction of the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton (Ministarstvo gra\u0111enja i prostornog ure\u0111enja Hercegova\u010dko-Neretvanskog Kantona; \u201cthe Cantonal Ministry\u201d) for the applicant\u2019s eviction and offered her a replacement flat in the same building (\u201cthe replacement flat\u201d). The claim was based on section 56 of the Housing Act 1974 which authorised owners of privately owned flats allocated to occupancy right holders to seek their eviction under the condition that they provide them with a suitable replacement flat (see paragraph 24 below).", "7. On 4 April 2005 the Cantonal Ministry ordered the applicant to vacate the flat in question. It further ordered E.R. to let her into the replacement flat.", "8. On 9 September 2005 the Federal Ministry of Spatial Planning and Environment (Federalno ministarstvo prostornog ure\u0111enja i okoli\u0161a; \u201cthe Federal Ministry\u201d), quashed the decision of 4 April 2005 and remitted the case for a re-hearing.", "9. On 4 January 2006 the Cantonal Ministry rejected E.R.\u2019s request. It held that in case of eviction, the applicant would lose her occupancy right on the flat in question, whereas she would not be able to acquire the same right on the replacement flat since from 6 December 2000 it was no longer possible to acquire occupancy rights (see paragraph 25 below).", "10. On 19 September 2006 and 17 December 2007, respectively, the Federal Ministry and the Mostar Cantonal Court (\u201cthe Cantonal Court\u201d) upheld the decision of 4 January 2006.", "11. On 27 January 2010 the Supreme Court of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (\u201cthe Supreme Court\u201d) rejected E.R.\u2019s request for extraordinary judicial review.", "12. On 25 February 2008 E.R. lodged a constitutional appeal.", "13. The applicant had been invited to submit her third-party comments in the proceedings before the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (\u201cthe Constitutional Court\u201d). However, that court explicitly stated that its examination was limited to E.R.\u2019s appeal.", "14. On 25 September 2010 the Constitutional Court held that E.R.\u2019s request for eviction was based on relevant domestic law (section 56 of the Housing Act 1974; see paragraph 24 below) and that in rejecting it the administrative bodies and the Cantonal Court violated his right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. It quashed the Cantonal Court\u2019s judgment of 17 December 2007 (see paragraph 10 above) and remitted the case for a re-hearing (having been given upon an extraordinary remedy, the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 27 January 2010 was not examined in these proceedings).", "15. On 20 December 2010, in the re-hearing proceedings, the Cantonal Court quashed the administrative decisions of 4 January 2006 and 19 September 2006 (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above) in line with the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision.", "16. On 16 May 2011 the Cantonal Ministry accepted E.R.\u2019s request and ordered the applicant to vacate the flat in question within fifteen days from the date of notification of that decision. Furthermore, it ordered E.R. to enable the applicant to use the replacement flat.", "17. On 11 July 2011 and 9 March 2012, respectively, the Federal Ministry and the Cantonal Court upheld the decision of 16 May 2011.", "18. On 14 March 2013 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant\u2019s request for extraordinary judicial review of the Cantonal Court\u2019s judgment of 9 March 2012.", "19. On 11 September 2012 an eviction order was issued. The eviction was scheduled for 17 October 2012 at 12 p.m. and was to be carried out with police assistance in view of the fact that the applicant had not left the flat on her own motion within the prescribed time-limit.", "20. On 21 November 2012 and 4 October 2013 the eviction order was upheld by the Federal Ministry and the Cantonal Court, respectively.", "21. After one rescheduling at the applicant\u2019s request, the eviction took place on 19 November 2012 when the Cantonal Ministry\u2019s commission, in the presence of police officers, E.R.\u2019s representative, the applicant\u2019s representative and the representative of the competent social work centre, made a list of the applicant\u2019s personal belongings, transferred them to the replacement flat and sealed it. The keys to the flat were given to E.R.", "22. On 22 November 2012, 17 January, 11 February, 28 February and 1 April 2013 the Cantonal Ministry invited the applicant\u2019s representative to collect the keys to the replacement flat. It would appear that until now she has failed to do so.", "23. The applicant is currently staying with her relatives in Sarajevo.", "24. In the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia nearly all flats were under the regime of \u201csocial ownership\u201d. They were generally built by socially-owned enterprises or other public bodies for allocation to their employees, who became \u201coccupancy right holders\u201d. The matter has been regulated by the Housing Act 1974 (Zakon o stambenim odnosima, Official Gazette of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina nos. 13/74, 23/76, 34/83, 14/84, 12/87 and 36/89; Official Gazette of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina no. 2/93, Official Gazette of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina nos. 11/98, 38/98, 12/99 and 19/99; Official Gazette of the Republika Srpska nos. 19/93, 22/93, 12/99 and 31/99) which is still in force in Bosnia and Herzegovina. An occupancy right, once allocated, entitled the occupancy right holder to permanent, lifelong use of the flat against the payment of a nominal fee. When occupancy right holders died, their rights were transferred, as a matter of right, to their surviving spouses or registered members of their family households who were also using the flat (sections 19 and 21 of the Housing Act 1974).", "Until the entry into force of the Housing Act 1974, occupancy right could also be awarded in respect of privately owned flats. Those flats were also allocated by public bodies. With the Housing Act 1974 it was no longer possible to award occupancy right in respect of flats in private ownership. However, the pre-existing occupancy rights in respect of such flats were preserved (section 2(2) of this Act). Section 56 of this Act, on the other hand, authorised owners of such flats to seek eviction of the occupancy right holders under the condition that they provide them with another suitable flat.", "25. On 6 December 2000 all occupancy rights ceased to exist (section 46(1) of the Privatisation of Flats Act 1997; Zakon o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo, Official Gazette of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina nos. 27/97, 11/98, 22/99, 27/99, 7/00, 32/01, 61/01, 15/02, 54/04, 36/06, 51/07, 72/08 and 23/09). The occupancy right holders on socially-owned flats were entitled to purchase their flats under that Act. If they did not purchase the flats, they became tenants. However, the occupancy right holders on privately owned flats could not purchase their flats (section 47(1) of this Act). It would appear that their situation continued to be regulated by the relevant provisions of the Housing Act 1974 and that they became \u201cprotected tenants\u201d (za\u0161ti\u0107eni stanari).", "26. According to Rule 23 (2) and (3) of the Rules of the Constitutional Court, the court shall transmit the appeal to the other party to the impugned proceedings for comments. Failure to submit such comments shall not affect the course of the proceedings before the Constitutional Court."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
