At the time of the expropriation of the applicants\u2019 land, the cadastral value of real estate within the perimeter of a town or city was determined in accordance with regulation no. 94 of 12 April 1994 concerning the valuation of urban land (Noteikumi \u201cPar pils\u0113tu zemes v\u0113rt\u0113\u0161anu\u201d), which was in force until 12 June 1998. To the extent that it is pertinent in the present case, the preamble to the text contained the following definitions:", "\u201c... Cadastral value of a plot of land \u2013 the urban-planning and economic value of a plot of land, formulated in pecuniary terms.", "...", "Model value of a plot of land [zemes paraugv\u0113rt\u012bba] \u2013 maximum value of a square metre of urban land situated in a value zone [v\u0113rt\u012bbu zona] for the purposes of its exploitation for a specific aim.", "De facto model value of a plot of land [zemes faktisk\u0101 paraugv\u0113rt\u012bba] \u2013 maximum value of a square metre of urban land situated in a specific territory of a value zone [v\u0113rt\u012bbu zona] for the purposes of its exploitation for a specific aim.", "...", "Value zone \u2013 a portion of urban territory corresponding to a constant set of data characterising the value of real estate.", "...\u201d", "7. Article 5 stipulated that the regulation was inapplicable to the determination of the market value of urban land. For the purposes of valuation, urban territory was to be divided into value zones based on the general land-use plan. The capital, Riga, was to be divided into seven or more zones (Article 7). Under Article 8, the main zoning criteria were as follows:", "\u201c...", "1. position [of land] in relation to the city centre;", "2. level of development of public-works infrastructure and social services;", "3. attractiveness of territory;", "4. ecological conditions and consequences of negative factors;", "5. local geological conditions;", "...\u201d", "8. Article 24 of the regulation laid down the methodology for the calculation of the model value (paraugv\u0113rt\u012bba) of a plot of land. For cities such as Riga, the model value did not have to be specially calculated because it corresponded to a scale in annex no. 2 to the regulation. In order to establish the de facto model value (faktisk\u0101 paraugv\u0113rt\u012bba), it was necessary to calculate the difference between the model value of the zone in question and the adjacent zone, multiply it by the distance from the next zone, then divide the result by the width of the zone in question, and, lastly, add the corresponding model value from the fixed scale (Article 25). The de facto model value then had to be adjusted to take account of any buildings erected on the land (Article 26).", "9. The de facto model value had to be multiplied by the surface area of the plot of land for its cadastral value to be obtained. It was then subject to adjustment within a limit of 20% to take account of certain positive or negative factors (Articles 30-34). The calculation of the cadastral value of land was the responsibility of the State Land Authority (Valsts Zemes dienests).", "10. The relevant provisions of the Civil Code (Civillikums) read as follows:", "\u201cWhere the contract provides for the payment of interest, its percentage shall be fixed, failing which it shall be presumed that the statutory rate (see Article 1765) has been tacitly agreed.\u201d", "\u201cThe interest rate shall be clearly established in the deed or contract. Failing that, as in cases where the payment of statutory interest is required by law, the rate shall be six per cent per annum. Interest may be calculated only on the capital itself. However, should the interest not be paid within the allotted time in respect of one year or more, from that time onwards, at the creditor\u2019s request, statutory interest shall be calculated on the interest then accruing\u201d.", "\u201cThe interest rate shall be clearly established in the deed or contract. Failing that, as in cases where statutory interest is required by law, the rate shall be six per cent per annum.", "The interest rate for late payment of a pecuniary debt provided for under a contract as consideration for the delivery or purchase of a good or service, shall be eight per cent [\u201cseven per cent\u201d before 26 June 2013] above the base rate (Article 1765, third paragraph) per annum; as to contractual relations to which a consumer is party, [the base rate shall be] six per cent per annum.", "The interest base rate shall be four per cent. The said rate shall be modified on 1 January and 1 July every year by the percentage corresponding to the increase or decrease in the most recent rate fixed for refinancing operations by the Bank of Latvia before the first day of the half-year in question. After 1 January and 1 July every year, the Bank of Latvia shall immediately publish in the [Official Gazette] information on the applicable interest rate for the coming half-year.", "Interest may be calculated only on the capital itself.
