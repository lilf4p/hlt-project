At 6.20 p.m. the police investigator ordered the applicant\u2019s arrest on suspicion of the fraudulent theft of the mobile phone. Further to the applicant\u2019s request, the investigator allowed lawyer G. to act as the applicant\u2019s defence counsel in that set of criminal proceedings. The lawyer signed the arrest report.

According to the applicant, that confession resulted from the psychological pressure and physical ill-treatment that had been applied to him since his arrival at the police station.", "18.

On 27 July 2004 the applicant\u2019s lawyer, having examined the file, requested that D. be charged as the perpetrator, arguing that the evidence in the file pointed at him. He asserted that the applicant\u2019s confession was the result of pressure by police officers and a clandestine agreement he had made with D. The investigator refused the request as unsubstantiated.", "37.

On 7 November 2005 the Court of Appeal found the applicant guilty of murder and fraudulent theft of a mobile phone and sentenced him to fourteen years\u2019 imprisonment. The court also found D. guilty of concealment of murder and imposed a conditional sentence.", "42. The prosecutor and the victim\u2019s relatives appealed against the judgment, claiming, inter alia, that the sentences were unduly mild. The applicant also appealed, claiming that his confession had been obtained by way of ill-treatment and in the absence of a lawyer. He argued that on the night of 19 March 2004, when he had been in the police station, police officers had beaten him to the extent that he had lost consciousness and that when he had come to, they had continued to beat him. As he had earlier been threatened by D., the applicant had eventually given up and agreed to incriminate himself.", "43. On 8 November 2005, in reply to the applicant\u2019s complaint of ill-treatment and violation of his procedural rights during the investigation, the Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office informed him that those issues had been examined during the pre-trial investigation and the trial, and had been rejected as unfounded.

According to that list, on 21 March 2004 (see paragraph 22 above) the applicant was not escorted anywhere from the ITT and he did not take part in any procedural measures on that day.", "46. On 14 February 2006 the Chrekasy Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office ordered the District Prosecutor\u2019s Office to carry out pre-investigation enquiries in respect of the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment.", "47. On 5 March 2006 the assistant prosecutor of the District Prosecutor\u2019s Office refused to open an investigation in connection with the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment, noting that there was no indication that the police officers had committed an offence. The decision referred to the statements of the police officers and the medical report of 21 March 2004. The applicant challenged the decision before the Prydniprovskyy District Court of Cherkasy (\u201cthe District Court\u201d).", "48. On 16 May 2006 the Supreme Court quashed the judgment of 7 November 2005 as regards the applicant\u2019s conviction for murder and D.\u2019s conviction for concealment of murder, and remitted the case to the Court of Appeal for fresh consideration in that part. It noted that the case had not been properly examined by the Court of Appeal as regards D.\u2019s role in the incident. It further ordered careful scrutiny of the applicant\u2019s allegations that his rights had been violated. The Supreme Court then upheld the applicant\u2019s conviction for the fraudulent theft of the mobile phone.", "49. On 2 August 2006 the District Court quashed the assistant prosecutor\u2019s decision of 5 March 2006 and ordered further pre-investigation enquiries. It noted that the medical report of 21 March 2004 was not reliable since the other evidence suggested that the applicant had not been escorted to the SIZO for a medical examination on that day. Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s office had not properly examined whether the applicant had really sustained rib fractures as noted by the nephrologist in his certificate of 26 August 2005.", "50. On 13 August and 25 December 2006, and 28 February and 25 June 2007 the assistant prosecutors refused to open an investigation in connection with the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment for the reason that the additional enquiries had not disclosed any element of crime on the part of the police officers. All those decisions were quashed by the supervising authorities as unfounded and further enquiries were ordered.", "51. During the trial the applicant requested a medical examination in order to determine his state of health and whether he was suffering from any illnesses. On 18 October 2006 panel of forensic medical experts found that the applicant was suffering from chronic pyelonephritis, chronic duodenal ulcer, chronic cholecystitis and benign hyperbilirubinemia.", "52. On 10 August 2007 the assistant prosecutor of the District Prosecutor\u2019s Office again refused to open an investigation in connection with the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment, considering that there had been no elements of crime in the actions of the police officers.", "53. On 19 November 2007 the District Court quashed the assistant prosecutor\u2019s decision of 10 August 2007 as unfounded and ordered further pre-investigation enquiries. The court noted that the District Prosecutor\u2019s Office had not removed the contradictions between the medical report of 21 March 2004 and the medical certificate of 26 August 2005, even though the supervising authorities, in quashing the earlier similar decisions, had highlighted that issue. The District Prosecutor\u2019s Office appealed against that decision.", "54. On 28 November 2007 the Court of Appeal found the applicant guilty of murder and sentenced him to fourteen years\u2019 imprisonment. The court further found that D. had been an accomplice to the murder and sentenced him to six years\u2019 imprisonment. The court noted that while the applicant had accused D. of the murder, the evidence in the file was sufficient to establish that it was the applicant who had killed R. The court relied on the statements of T. and other oral, documentary and material evidence. It also cited the applicant\u2019s self-incriminating statements made during the pre-trial investigation in the presence of lawyers.", "55. The Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment, noting that during the trial the police officers had denied the alleged facts; moreover, the medical reports of 21 March and 8 June 2004 refuted those allegations.", "56. The applicant appealed against the judgment claiming, inter alia, that his defence rights had not been respected at the initial stage of the investigation, he had not been given access to a lawyer immediately after the arrest and his self-incriminating statements had been obtained as a result of ill-treatment.", "57. On 18 December 2007 the Court of Appeal partly allowed the prosecutor\u2019s appeal against the District Court\u2019s decision of 19 November 2007. It noted that the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment concerned the admissibility and veracity of evidence in his criminal case. Therefore those issues had to be examined by the Court of Appeal in the course of the applicant\u2019s trial and not by way of separate proceedings. The court further found that the judgment adopted in the applicant\u2019s criminal case had addressed the relevant issues. Accordingly, the proceedings on that matter had to be terminated. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law.", "58. On 6 May 2008 the Supreme Court upheld the judgment of 28 November 2007, noting that the applicant\u2019s guilt had been well established by various pieces of evidence in the case file, including the self-incriminating statements that he had made during the pre-trial investigation. It dismissed as groundless the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment and of violations of his procedural rights.", "59. On 10 June 2008 the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision of 18 December 2007, noting that the relevant issues could not be examined concurrently with the trial in the applicant\u2019s criminal case."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
