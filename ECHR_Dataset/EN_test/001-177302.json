The applicants are four Russian nationals, Mr Vaid Isayevich Gisayev (\u201cthe first applicant\u201d), Ms Birlant Pashayeva Gisayeva (\u201cthe second applicant\u201d), Ms Zarema Vaidovna Gisayeva (\u201cthe third applicant\u201d) and Ms Zareta Vaidovna Gisayeva (\u201cthe fourth applicant\u201d).", "2. The applicants were represented by Mr Z.Z. Dzagashtov, a lawyer practising in Moscow. The Russian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyuskin, the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.", "3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "4. The applicants were born in 1938, 1948, 1973 and 1978 respectively and live in Nalchik, Kabardino-Balkariya. They are the father, mother and the sisters, respectively, of Imran Gisayev. At the material time the applicants lived in Grozny.", "5. In 1990 Imran Gisayev took part in a brawl in which a certain S. was fatally wounded, his death occurring shortly afterwards. While nobody was prosecuted for the death, it appears that S.\u2019s relatives considered that Imran Gisayev was responsible for it.", "6. Imran Gisayev was shot several times in 1992 but survived. According to the applicants, one of S.\u2019s brothers carried out the attack in an attempt to avenge S.\u2019s death. Nobody was prosecuted for it.", "7. On 11 December 1998 Imran Gisayev was shot dead by an unknown person. The attack happened in the street around noon while the victim was taking his three-year-old nephew to a playground.", "8. On 14 December 1998 the Grozny town prosecutor\u2019s office opened an investigation into the shooting. The crime scene was inspected on the same day and three cartridges were found and sent to a ballistics expert. Several people, including the first and fourth applicant, were questioned. They alleged that the murder had been committed by somebody from S.\u2019s family in revenge for his killing.", "9. On 29 December 1998 the prosecutor acting in the case questioned U.S., S.\u2019s father, who stated that his second son had unsuccessfully tried to kill Imran Gisayev in 1992 to avenge S.\u2019s death. However, it had been his nephew, K.S., who had killed Imran Gisayev because his second son had died in 1995. In his view, the killing had been just as it had been part of a blood feud. He added that the gun which had been used in the killing was at his home.", "10. On 7 February 1999 U.S. was questioned again. This time he stated that he was not sure who had killed Imran Gisayev but confirmed that it must have been one of his relatives as revenge for the killing of his son. On 9 February 1999 he testified in similar vein that he did not know who exactly had killed Imran Gisayev but that it must have been one of his relatives as part of a blood feud by applying the principle of \u201ca death for a death\u201d.", "11. On 11 February 1999 the investigator at the Grozny prosecutor\u2019s office who was in charge of the preliminary investigation was questioned by a senior prosecutor after the first applicant alleged that he had promised S.\u2019s family that he would not arrest the murderer. The investigator admitted that it was true that he had spoken to S.\u2019s family and had asked them to tell him who had killed Imran Gisayev. In exchange, he had promised not to arrest the murderer. However, in his view, that did not mean that he absolutely would not have arrested the murderer and, moreover, he had always intended to act in accordance with the law.", "12. On 20 February 1999 a new investigator put in charge of the case issued an arrest warrant for K.S. because he had not responded to several previous requests to appear for questioning.", "13. On 4 May 1999 the first applicant was granted victim status in the criminal case.", "14. On 23 May 1999 U.S. was charged with inducing K.S. and another unidentified person to murder Imran Gisayev to avenge the death of his son.", "15. On 24 May 1999 U.S. was questioned as a person charged with a crime. He stated that he had asked K.S. to kill Imran Gisayev to avenge his son. He had bought a gun for that purpose that he had given to K.S. He had visited K.S. after the killing and he had informed him that he had fulfilled the terms of the blood feud. U.S., however, denied that he had incited any other person to carry out the killing.", "16. On 26 May 1999 the investigator separated the case against U.S. from the rest of the investigation. The decision noted that the other suspect, K.S., was in hiding.", "17. On 1 June 1999 the Grozny prosecutor\u2019s office sent the case against U.S. to the Supreme Sharia Court of the Chechen Republic.", "18. Following the launch of a military operation in the territory of the Chechen Republic in early October 1999, the first applicant took the criminal case file from the prosecutor\u2019s office in order to save it from destruction. According to the first applicant all the physical evidence in the file had been lost during its transfer to court.", "19. Shortly thereafter the applicants left Chechnya and went to Kabardino-Balkariya Region.", "20. U.S. died on 29 September 2006.", "21. On 29 November 2006 the first applicant resubmitted his criminal complaint about his son\u2019s killing to the Grozny town prosecutor\u2019s office.", "22. On 30 November 2006 the Grozny town prosecutor\u2019s office again opened criminal proceedings concerning the death of Imran Gisayev. The criminal file from 1999 was joined to the new case as material evidence. On the same date the first applicant was again granted the status of the victim of a crime.", "23. On 1 December 2006 K.S. was arrested. He was placed in detention the next day.", "24. On 11 December 2006 K.S. was charged with the murder of Imran Gisayev under Article 105 \u00a7 1 of the Russian Criminal Code. During his questioning, K.S. denied any participation in the crime. He said that he had been approached by U.S. and another person to help avenge S.\u2019s death, which he had refused. As far as he knew, U.S. had killed Imran Gisayev.", "25. Over the following days several of K.S.\u2019s relatives were questioned as witnesses. They all stated that U.S. had killed Imran Gisayev. In particular, K.K., one of U.S.\u2019s daughters, testified that her father had accepted the blame for killing Imran Gisayev and that K.S. had had nothing to do with it.", "26. On an unspecified date thereafter the prosecutor questioned A.V., a friend of Imran Gisayev and the only direct witness of the crime. He stated that two young men had carried out the killing, however, he was unable to describe them owing to the passage of time. When shown a photo of K.S. he did not recognise him.", "27. On 20 December 2006 M.B., a local imam and a relative of the Gisayev family, testified that Imran Gisayev had been killed by members of S.\u2019s family in a blood feud over the death of S. That act of vengeance had been in accordance with traditional practices and local customs so their family had decided not to make any claims against S.\u2019s family. U.S. had taken responsibility for the killing upon himself. There was therefore no reason to suspect K.S. was the killer.", "28. Similar testimony was given the following day by V.G., the first applicant\u2019s brother, who was head of the family in 1998, and A.D., another relative of the applicants. A.D. added that he had tried to discourage the first applicant from pursuing the case as it was not in accordance with their customs because the killing of Imran Gisayev had been justified as part of a blood feud.", "29. On an unspecified date in 2007 Grozny City Hospital informed the Grozny Town Prosecutor\u2019s Office in reply to an enquiry that all the medical files from 1999 and 2000 had been destroyed during the military operation.", "30. A forensic expert\u2019s opinion produced on 5 March 2007 concluded that it was not possible to give a definite answer as to the cause of Imran Gisayev\u2019s death as his body had never been examined. However, based on the findings of the investigators and doctors from 1999 it was possible to say with a high degree of probability bordering on certainty that he had had at least four bullet wounds in the chest. Such wounds could be characterised as lethal and could consequently have caused his death.", "31. On 19 March 2007 the first applicant stated that he opposed the exhumation of his son\u2019s body for religious reasons.", "32. On 18 May 2007 the prosecutor for the case at Grozny town prosecutor\u2019s office terminated K.S.\u2019s prosecution and released him from pre-trial detention. He held that the evidence that had been collected proved that K.S. had not participated in Imran Gisayev\u2019s killing.", "33. On 29 May 2007 the prosecutor informed the first applicant that the investigation had been suspended for failure to establish the identity of the alleged perpetrator.", "34. On 7 August 2007 the deputy prosecutor dismissed a complaint by the first applicant that the investigation up to that date had been biased in favour of the suspects.", "35. In the following months the first applicant sent several complaints to various authorities, in particular the Grozny town prosecutor\u2019s office and its investigations department, alleging that the investigation had been ineffective.", "36. On 23 June 2008 the investigations department of the Grozny prosecutor\u2019s office informed the first applicant that the investigation into the killing of his son had been resumed.", "37. The first applicant received the same information on 9 September 2008.", "38. On 9 October 2008 the investigation was suspended again. Following a complaint by the first applicant, it resumed again, only to be suspended on 29 January 2009.", "39. On 20 February 2009 the Republic Prosecutor informed the first applicant that the decision of 29 January 2009 to suspend the investigation had been set aside as unfounded because of a failure to take all the necessary investigative steps and to establish all the circumstances of the crime. The prosecutor acting on the case for the Grozny town prosecutor\u2019s office was ordered to carry out an additional investigation.", "40. On 3 March 2009 the investigation resumed.", "41. On 14 March 2009 the first applicant lodged an appeal with the Grozny District Court (\u201cthe District Court\u201d) under Article 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure complaining of inactivity on the part of the investigative authorities.", "42. On 26 March 2009 the District Court dismissed the appeal, noting that the investigation had reopened in the meantime and that measures were being taken with the aim of establishing the circumstances and the perpetrators of the crime. The first applicant appealed against that decision to the Supreme Court of the Chechen Republic (\u201cthe Supreme Court\u201d).", "43. In the meantime, on 2 April 2009 the investigator in the case once again suspended the investigation as it had been impossible to establish the identity of the perpetrator.", "44. On 17 June 2009 the Supreme Court quashed the decision of 26 March 2009 and remitted the case to the District Court. It noted that copies of the relevant documents concerning the resumption of the investigation were not in the file. The court was thus unable to endorse the District Court\u2019s decision.", "45. On 30 June 2009 the District Court decided anew to dismiss the first applicant\u2019s appeal. The prosecutor and investigator submitted copies of the relevant documents from the investigation file. On 2 April 2009 the investigation was suspended under Article 208 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for failure to establish the identity of the perpetrator. The court considered that by obtaining the copies of the relevant documents it had eliminated the shortcoming indicated in the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 17 June 2009.", "46. On 12 August 2009 the Supreme Court quashed that decision. It held that the District Court had not substantiated its ruling and had failed to take all the material in the case file into account.", "47. On 5 October 2009 the District Court granted the first applicant\u2019s appeal, considering the investigators\u2019 inactivity to be illegal. It held that the prosecutor had closed the investigation on 2 April 2009 without taking testimony from several witnesses and had failed to conduct the other investigative steps ordered by the Republic Prosecutor (see paragraph 39 above).", "48. On 27 July 2013 the Deputy District Prosecutor quashed another decision (of unspecified date) to suspend the investigation.", "49. According to the information available to the Court the investigation is still ongoing.", "50. Until 1 July 2002 criminal-law matters were governed by the 1960 Code of Criminal Procedure of the RSFSR. On 1 July 2002 the old Code was replaced by the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation.", "51. Article 125 of the new Code provides that a decision by an investigator or prosecutor to dispense with or terminate criminal proceedings, and other decisions, acts or omissions which are liable to infringe the constitutional rights and freedoms of parties to such proceedings or to impede citizens\u2019 access to justice are subject to appeal to a district court, which is empowered to review the lawfulness and grounds of the impugned decisions."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
