The applicants in the present cases are Russian nationals. Four of the applicants in Pitsayeva and Others v. Russia (no. 53036/08) reside in Belgium, the applicant in Ibragimova v. Russia (no. 30592/10) resides in Norway, and the remaining applicants live in various districts of the Chechen Republic, as specified in the attached table (Appendix I).", "7. The applicants are close relatives of persons who disappeared in the Chechen Republic between 2000 and 2006 allegedly after being abducted from their homes by groups of unidentified men. The applicants believed that the abductors were Russian federal servicemen since they were wearing camouflage uniforms, had Slavic features and spoke unaccented Russian. Armed with machine guns, the culprits broke into the applicants\u2019 homes, searched the premises, checked the identity documents of the applicants\u2019 relatives and took the latter away in military vehicles, such as armoured personnel carriers (APCs), UAZ minivans or Ural lorries. Only a few of the vehicles had official registration plates. In a number of cases the registration numbers were obscured with mud. None of the applicants have had news of their missing relatives since.", "8. The abductions took place in various districts of Chechnya and were primarily carried out during curfew hours late at night and early in the morning. In some cases the applicants reported that a special operation had been conducted by Russian troops in the area. Indeed, in Saraliyeva and Others v. Russia (no. 63608/09), Ibragimova v. Russia (no. 30592/10) and Abdulvakhidova v. Russia (no. 52446/10), the investigative authorities officially acknowledged that a special operation had been carried out in the area at the time of the events.", "9. The applicants reported the incidents to the law-enforcement authorities, and official investigations were opened. The proceedings were repeatedly suspended and resumed. From the documents submitted it appears that the relevant State authorities were unable to identify the State servicemen allegedly involved in the arrests or abductions.", "10. In their observations the Government did not challenge the allegations as presented by the applicants. However, they stated that there was no evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that State agents had been involved in the abductions.", "11. The facts relevant to each individual case are summarised below. The personal data of the applicants and their disappeared relatives are summarised in the attached table (Appendix I).", "12. At the material time the first, second, third and fourth applicants and Mr Mulat Barshigov lived in Samashki, Achkhoy-Martan District, Chechnya. Mulat Barshigov was working as deputy head of the Samashki village administration.", "13. On 14 November 2002 a special operation was carried out in Samashki. The village was placed under curfew and at least three roadblocks were set up in the vicinity. A military commander\u2019s office was located in the village.", "14. According to the applicants, at 2 a.m. on 14 November 2002 five or six men armed with sub-machine guns broke into their house. The intruders, who were wearing camouflage uniforms and masks, arrived in APCs (armoured personnel carriers) and UAZ vehicles. One of them, who was unmasked, was of Slavic appearance. The men, who spoke unaccented Russian, bound and gagged the first, second, third and fourth applicants, then beat Mulat Barshigov unconscious and took him away in one of their vehicles.", "15. There has been no news of Mulat Barshigov since that day.", "16. The Government submitted copies of the contents of criminal case file no. 63091 (comprising three volumes) on the abduction of Mulat Barshigov. They noted that in accordance with Article 161 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the documents containing personal information on the servicemen who had taken part in counterterrorist operations were not furnished to the Court. The information submitted can be summarised as follows.", "17. On 14 November 2002 the first applicant reported her husband\u2019s abduction to the Achkhoy-Martan district prosecutor\u2019s office, stating that at about 2 a.m. on 14 November 2002 unidentified masked men in camouflage uniforms had broken into their house, gagged and bound the family members with duct tape, then had beaten her husband up and taken him away.", "18. On 16 November 2002 the Achkhoy-Martan district prosecutor\u2019s office opened criminal case no. 63091 under Article 126 of the Criminal Code (abduction).", "19.

On the same day Mr N. Sh., the applicants\u2019 neighbour, made a statement to the investigation. He said that at about 5 a.m. on 14 November 2002, one of Mulat Barshigov\u2019s sons had come over and told him that armed men in camouflage uniforms had broken into their house, tied them up and taken his father away.", "21. On 14 November 2002 an investigator examined the crime scene. Samples of duct tape with fingerprints were collected as evidence.", "22.

On 10 January 2003 the investigator ordered an expert examination of the fingerprints on the duct tape collected from the crime scene.", "24. On 16 January 2003 the investigation was suspended for failure to identify the perpetrators.", "25. According to the expert\u2019s report submitted on 24 January 2003, the fingerprints found on the duct tape were not of good quality and could not, therefore, be used for identification purposes.", "26. On 25 April 2003, in response to an inquiry by the first applicant, the investigator informed her that the investigation had been suspended but the search for her husband was in progress.", "27. On 18 March 2005 the deputy prosecutor of the Achkhoy-Martan district issued a progress report on the investigation. Having summarised the main steps taken by the investigators, the deputy prosecutor noted, inter alia, that there had been a \u201clack of cooperation between the authorities responsible for the operative search measures\u201d.", "28. On 31 May 2006 the investigation was resumed and the applicants were informed thereof.", "29. On 1 July 2006 the investigation was suspended.", "30. On 16 June 2007 the Achkhoy-Martan district prosecutor overruled the decision to suspend the investigation as premature, and ordered the investigators to carry out additional investigative measures.", "31. In August 2007 an investigator again questioned the applicants and other witnesses.", "32. On 10 June 2008 the investigation was resumed and the investigators were ordered to take basic steps. The investigation is still pending.", "33. It appears from the case file that throughout the relevant period the applicants wrote to various State authorities complaining about the abduction, asking for assistance in the search, inquiring about the progress of the investigation and complaining of the delays. Their complaints included the following: a letter of 17 April 2003 to the Achkhoy-Martan district prosecutor\u2019s office; a letter of 21 April 2003 to the Chechnya Prosecutor\u2019s Office; a letter of 7 July 2003 to the Russian Prosecutor General; and a letter of 21 May 2008 to the Achkhoy-Martan district investigations department.", "34. At the material time the first seven applicants were living with Mr Isa Eskiyev and Mr Usman Eskiyev (the Eskiyev brothers) in Koshkeldy village, Gudermes District, Chechnya. Their family house consisted of two separate dwellings sharing a common courtyard. One of the dwellings was occupied by the first applicant, while the other, which had two different entrances, was occupied by the other applicants.", "35. At 2 a.m. on 6 June 2003 about thirty men of Slavic appearance driving four military UAZ vehicles broke into the applicants\u2019 courtyard. They were armed, using portable radios and wearing green camouflage uniforms. They spoke unaccented Russian. Ten masked men entered into the house. They bound the hands of the first, second and eighth applicants and ordered them to lie down on the floor. After searching the house, the intruders beat up Isa and Usman Eskiyev, seized their passports and those of their spouses and took the two brothers away. Their vehicles passed freely through a checkpoint on the outskirts of the village.", "36. Later that night, the same group of men broke into the house of Mr Kaim Eskhiyev, a neighbour. They were looking for his son, Mr Dalambek Eskiyev, who allegedly belonged to an illegal armed group and who had left the village two years prior to the events. The applicants heard the men asking someone over the radio \u201cWe did not find the guilty one, only two innocent men. What should we do?\u201d and the reply, \u201cNever mind, take them.\u201d", "37. Isa and Usman Eskiyev have been missing ever since.", "38. The Government submitted copies of part of the contents of criminal case file no. 35006 concerning the abduction of Isa and Usman Eskiyev (comprising two volumes). They noted that in accordance with Article 161 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the documents containing personal information on the servicemen who had taken part in counterterrorist operations were not furnished to the Court. The information submitted can be summarised as follows.", "39. According to the Government, the first applicant reported the abduction of her sons by State servicemen to the Gudermes ROVD on 23 January 2004. According to the documents submitted by the applicants, they reported the abduction to the Gudermes ROVD on 15 October 2003. The applicants pointed out that the brothers had been abducted from their home at night by law-enforcement officers wearing camouflage uniforms and driving four UAZ vehicles. The applicants stressed that the abductors had threatened to kill them and had passed unhindered through the checkpoint.", "40. On 3 February 2004 the Gudermes district prosecutor\u2019s office opened criminal case no. 35006 under Article 126 of the Criminal Code (kidnapping).", "41. On 23 January 2004 investigators questioned the first applicant, who stated that at 2 a.m. on 6 June 2003 armed men in camouflage uniforms had burst into the courtyard of their family house. She had thought that they had come, as they had previously done, to search for a certain Mr Dalambek Eskiyev, a member of illegal armed groups, and the applicants\u2019 neighbour and relative. However, the armed men had taken away Isa and Usman Eskiyev.", "42. On 9 February 2004 the second applicant informed the investigators that at 3 a.m. on 6 June 2003 she had heard some noise and thought that State servicemen were again searching for Dalambek Eskiyev. He was wanted for his involvement in illegal armed groups; therefore, servicemen had often checked his house. This time, however, they broke into the second applicant\u2019s house. They bound her hands, ordered her to lie down on the floor and then took her husband away. She managed to unbind her hands and went outside where she learnt that the servicemen had also taken away Usman Eskiyev. The second applicant told the investigators that Isa and Usman Eskiyev might have been abducted because of their kinship with Dalambek Eskiyev.", "43. On 30 June 2004 a local police officer, Mr A.N., was questioned. He stated that he had learnt about the Eskiyev brothers\u2019 abduction the following day. He had asked their relatives to immediately lodge an official complaint, but they had refused to do so out of fear that an official inquiry would only worsen the situation. They had believed that an official complaint would make the brothers\u2019 return impossible and had hoped that both brothers would be released once questioned and checked. He also stated that he had gone to the checkpoint and asked for information concerning the passage of the abductors\u2019 vehicles. The police officers from the Amur Region who had been manning the checkpoint at the time had explained to him that the abductors had not gone through the checkpoint but refused to confirm that in writing.", "44.

She asked the court to order the investigation department to resume the investigation and rectify its shortcomings.", "339. On 25 January 2010 the Shali Town Court left the complaint unexamined as the investigation had been resumed on 20 January 2010. On 3 March 2010 the Chechnya Supreme Court upheld the decision.", "340. In February 2004 Mr Suliman (also referred to as Suleyman) Yunusov was staying in the house of his friend, Mr A. Mutsayev, in Grozny. At the time, Grozny was surrounded by a number of Russian military checkpoints. The nearest checkpoint was located 300 metres from the house, at the crossroads of Pervomayskaya and Mayakovskaya Streets.", "341. At around 7 a.m. on 25 February 2004 a group of twelve to fifteen armed men in camouflage uniforms arrived at the Mutsayevs\u2019 house in an APC, two white Niva cars and a white Volga car. Another two APCs were waiting at the crossroads. The servicemen, who were of Slavic and Asian appearance, broke into the houses of the Mutsayevs and their neighbours and searched them.", "342. In a neighbouring house the servicemen beat up male family members and questioned them about illegal armed groups. One of them, Musa, showed his service identity card stating that he worked at the Emergencies Ministry (Emercom). The neighbours heard the servicemen saying over their portable radios: \u201cWe have found him. We are leaving.\u201d Meanwhile, the other group of men led Suliman Yunosov out of the Mutsayevs\u2019 house, put him in one of their Niva cars and drove him away in the direction of Pervomayskaya Street.", "343. The applicant submitted that on 25 February 2004, following the murder of a fellow military officer, the servicemen had conducted a largescale sweeping operation in Grozny during which they had detained Suliman Yunusov.", "344.

The Government did not furnish any documents from the criminal case file concerning the abduction of the applicant\u2019s relative. Based on the documents submitted by the applicant and the Government\u2019s submissions, the investigation may be summarised as follows.", "346. On 15 March 2004 the Leninskiy district prosecutor\u2019s office in Grozny opened criminal case no. 30021 under Article 126 of the Criminal Code (abduction) and granted victim status to the applicant.", "347. On 15 May 2004 the investigation was suspended.", "348. In June 2004 the military prosecutor\u2019s office of military unit no. 20116 informed the investigators that the involvement of servicemen in the abduction had not been confirmed and that no special operations had been carried out in the area at the relevant time.", "349. The investigation is still pending.", "350. On 16 December 2011 the applicant stated that her son had fought against the Russian federal forces during the first Chechen war and had left Chechnya at the end of the war. In January 2004 he had returned and on 24 February 2004 he had gone to Grozny to visit his friend, A. Mutsayev. On 25 February 2005 she had learnt that servicemen had abducted her son and she had gone to Grozny. The Mutsayevs and their neighbours had confirmed that Suliman Yunusov had been abducted by armed men in camouflage uniforms. She had been told that the servicemen had been looking for someone and when they had arrested her son, they had left the house saying over the radio that they had found him. The first applicant also noted that after that incident, her son\u2019s friend, A. Mutsayev had moved to Europe.", "351. On 2 January 2012 the Mutsayevs and their neighbours were questioned. Ms Z. Mutsayeva stated that Suliman Yunusov had been their neighbour and had participated in the first Chechen war against the Russian federal forces. Since 23 February 2004 he had been staying in their house. In the morning of 25 February 2004, after her husband and brotherinlaw had gone out, armed masked men wearing camouflage uniforms had broken into their house. They had taken Suliman outside, put him in a Niva car and driven away. The men had spoken Russian without an accent and had a list of the names of persons they were searching for.", "352. Several of the Mutsayevs\u2019 neighbours made similar submissions about the events to the effect that on 25 February 2004 a group of armed men in camouflage uniforms had broken into their houses and had beaten up the male family members. The servicemen had questioned them about members of illegal armed groups and about their neighbours. Shortly afterwards, one of the intruders had informed the others that they had found the man they had been looking for and, therefore, they could leave. Afterwards, they had learnt that the servicemen had abducted Suliman Yunusov from their neighbours\u2019 house.", "353.

The prosecutor\u2019s office also noted that on 13 March 2010 the special investigation unit of the Chechnya Prosecutor\u2019s Office had taken over the criminal case.", "356. The Basnukayevs and the Alisultanovs were neighbours. Mr Mausyr Basnukayev lived with his family, including the first to fifth applicants. Mr Vakha Alisultanov lived with his family, including the sixth to eighth applicants, and his son, Rustam. His brother, Mr Shamsudi Alisultanov, was staying at his house in April 2000. The Basnukayevs\u2019 house was situated about 300 metres from the Alisultanovs\u2019 house in the settlement of Chechen-Aul.", "357. In April 2000 Chechen-Aul was under curfew and surrounded by Russian military checkpoints.", "358. At about 3 a.m. on 16 April 2000 approximately thirty men in camouflage uniforms armed with short-barrelled machine guns cordoned off the applicants\u2019 houses. They divided into two groups and broke in. They had parked their APC, Ural lorry and two UAZ cars in the vicinity. Those of the intruders who were unmasked were of Slavic appearance.", "359. The servicemen searched the dwellings, beat up the male members of the families and checked their identity documents. They took Rustam and Mausyr Basnukayev, and Vakha and Shamsudi Alisultanov outside. The servicemen then ordered Rustam to run back to the house without looking back. They placed Mausyr Basnukayev and Vakha Alisultanov in the Ural lorry and Shamsudi Alisultanov in one of the UAZ vehicles, and drove away towards the outskirts.", "360. The applicants have not seen their three relatives since 16 April 2000.", "361. The Government submitted copies of the documents from criminal case file no. 19077 concerning the abduction of Mausyr Basnukayev, and Vakha and Shamsudi Alisultanov. The documents cover only the period between 2001 and 2004. The relevant information may be summarised as follows.", "362. Following the abduction of their relatives, the applicants complained to various authorities. Their complaints were forwarded from one authority to another.", "363. On 6 June 2001 the Grozny district prosecutor\u2019s office opened criminal case no. 19077 in connection with the abduction of the three men.", "364. In June 2001 the investigators questioned the first and the sixth applicants, who provided a detailed description of the circumstances surrounding the abduction.", "365. In November 2003 the ninth applicant stated that an Ingush friend of Shamsudi Alisultanov had told her that in the summer of 2000, lawenforcement officers from Voronezh had visited him and asked questions about Shamsudi.", "366. On 27 June 2001 the first applicant was granted victim status.", "367. The investigation was suspended on 6 August 2001 and resumed on 29 July 2003. It was suspended and resumed several more times in 2003 and 2004.", "368. In July 2003 the investigator examined the crime scene. No evidence was collected.", "369. On 15 August 2003 the sixth and ninth applicants were granted victim status.", "370. On 2 December 2004 the investigators suspended the investigation and informed the applicants thereof.

On a number of occasions between April 2000 and December 2004 the applicants wrote to various authorities asking for assistance in the search for their missing relatives; no meaningful information was given to them.", "372. On 5 October 2009 the first and sixth applicants requested access to the investigation file; the Grozny District Court granted access to the file on 13 November 2009.", "373. Following the applicants\u2019 complaint of 5 July 2010 that the investigators had failed to take adequate investigative steps, the Grozny investigations department informed them on 9 July 2010 that operational search measures were under way and that they would be kept abreast of the results of the investigative steps.", "397. The Government did not contest the essential facts of each case as presented by the applicants. At the same time, they claimed that none of the investigations had obtained information proving that the applicants\u2019 relatives had been apprehended and detained by State agents. According to them, there was no evidence proving beyond reasonable doubt that State agents had been involved in the abductions and deaths. Referring, in particular, to Debizova (no. 24708/09) and Ibragimova (no. 30592/10), the Government stated that the mere fact that the abductors had been armed and/or had driven a certain type of vehicle or had worn a particular type of uniform was not enough to presume the contrary. They pointed out that between 1996 and 2003 mercenaries of Slavic origin, including those from Ukraine, and other criminals had impersonated military servicemen and police officers to commit crimes. At the same time, the Government submitted, referring to the same two applications, that \u201cthe applicants furnished the proof that their relatives could have been detained by State representatives\u201d. Lastly, in respect of all the cases the Government submitted that the bodies of the abducted men had never been found and there was no proof that they were dead.", "398. The applicants asserted that it had been established \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d that the men who had taken away their relatives had been State agents. In support of that assertion they referred to the ample evidence contained in their submissions and the criminal investigation files, in so far as they had been disclosed by the Government. They also submitted that they had each made a prima facie case that their relatives had been abducted by State agents and that the essential facts underlying their complaints had not been challenged by the Government. In view of the absence of any news of their relatives for a long time and the life-threatening nature of unacknowledged detention in Chechnya at the relevant time, they asked the Court to consider their relatives dead.", "399. The Court will examine each of the applications in the light of the general principles applicable in cases where the factual circumstances are in dispute between the parties (see El Masri v. \u201cthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d [GC], no. 39630/09, \u00a7\u00a7 151-53, ECHR 2012).", "400. The Court has addressed a whole series of cases concerning allegations of disappearances in the Chechen Republic. Applying the abovementioned principles, it has concluded that it would be sufficient for the applicants to make a prima facie case of abduction by servicemen, thus falling within the control of the authorities, and it would then be for the Government to discharge their burden of proof either by disclosing the documents in their exclusive possession or by providing a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred (see, among many examples, Kosumova and Others v. Russia, no. 27441/07, \u00a7 67, 7 June 2011, and Aslakhanova and Others, cited above, \u00a7 99). If the Government failed to rebut that presumption, this would entail a violation of Article 2 in its substantive part. Conversely, where the applicants failed to make a prima facie case, the burden of proof could not be reversed (see, for example, Tovsultanova v. Russia, no. 26974/06, \u00a7\u00a7 77-81, 17 June 2010, and Movsayevy v. Russia, no. 20303/07, \u00a7 76, 14 June 2011).", "401. The Court has also found in many cases concerning disappearances in Chechnya that a missing person could be presumed dead. Having regard to the numerous cases of disappearances in the region which have come before it, the Court has found that in the particular context of the conflict, when a person was detained by unidentified State agents without any subsequent acknowledgment of the detention, this could be regarded as lifethreatening (see, among many others, Bazorkina v. Russia, no. 69481/01, 27 July 2006; Imakayeva v. Russia, no. 7615/02, ECHR 2006XIII (extracts); Luluyev and Others v. Russia, no. 69480/01, ECHR 2006VIII (extracts); Baysayeva v. Russia, no. 74237/01, 5 April 2007; Akhmadova and Sadulayeva v. Russia, no. 40464/02, 10 May 2007; Alikhadzhiyeva v. Russia, no. 68007/01, 5 July 2007; and Dubayev and Bersnukayeva v. Russia, nos. 30613/05 and 30615/05, 11 February 2010).", "402. The Court has made findings of presumptions of death in the absence of any reliable news about the disappeared persons for periods ranging from four years (see Askhabova v. Russia, no. 54765/09, \u00a7 137, 18 April 2013) to more than ten years.", "403. Several witness statements collected by the applicants, along with the documents from the investigation file furnished by the Government (see, for example, paragraphs 17 and 19 above) demonstrate that the applicants\u2019 relative, Mulat Barshigov, was abducted on 14 November 2002 by a group of armed servicemen in Samashki. In view of all the materials in its possession, the Court finds that the applicants have presented a prima facie case that their relative was abducted by State agents in the circumstances as set out by them.", "404. The Government did not provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation for the events in question. Therefore, they failed to discharge their burden of proof.", "405. Bearing in mind the general principles enumerated above, the Court finds that Mulat Barshigov was taken into custody by State agents on 14 November 2002. In view of the absence of any news of him since that date and the life-threatening nature of such detention (see paragraph 401 above), the Court also finds that Mulat Barshigov may be presumed dead following his unacknowledged detention.", "406. Several witness statements collected by the applicants, along with the documents from the investigation file furnished by the Government (see, for example, paragraphs 39 and 42 above) demonstrate that the applicants\u2019 relatives, Isa and Usman Eskiyev, were abducted on 6 June 2003 by a group of armed servicemen in Koshkeldy. In view of all the materials in its possession, the Court finds that the applicants have presented a prima facie case that their relatives were abducted by State agents in the circumstances as set out by them.", "407.

In view of all the materials in its possession, the Court finds that the applicant has presented a prima facie case that her husband was abducted by State agents in the circumstances as set out by her.", "410. The Government did not provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation for the events in question. Therefore, they failed to discharge their burden of proof.", "411.

Several witness statements collected by the applicants, along with the documents from the investigation file furnished by the Government (see, for example, paragraphs 364 and 365 above) demonstrate that the applicants\u2019 three relatives, Mausyr Basnukayev, and Vakha and Shamsudi Alisultanov, were abducted on 16 April 2000 by a group of armed servicemen in Chechen-Aul.

The Court finds that in all the cases the applicants\u2019 relatives were abducted by armed men in uniforms, displaying behaviour characteristic of security operations. Their behaviour and appearance, their ability to pass through roadblocks and to cordon off areas, along with their use of vehicles, lead the Court to conclude that in all probability, they were none other than State servicemen. The applicants\u2019 allegations are supported by the witness statements collected by them and by the investigations. In their submissions to the authorities the applicants consistently maintained that their relatives had been abducted by State agents. The domestic investigations accepted as fact the version of events as presented by the applicants and took steps to check whether State servicemen had been involved in the abductions. As it appears from the documents submitted to the Court, the investigations regarded the possibility of abduction by servicemen as the only, or at least the main, plausible explanation of the events.", "464. In summary, the facts of each case contain sufficient elements to enable the Court to make findings about the carrying out of security operations and thus about the State\u2019s exclusive control over the detainees (see, among many others, Aslakhanova and Others, cited above, \u00a7 114). The Government\u2019s arguments are limited to references to the unfinished criminal investigations, or are of a speculative nature and stand in contradiction to the evidence reviewed by the Court. In any case, they are insufficient to discharge them of the burden of proof which has been shifted to them in such cases.", "465.
