Around the time the applicant\u2019s daughter died, the applicant\u2019s seventy-year-old husband was ill. Concerned for her husband\u2019s health, the applicant hesitated about telling him about their daughter\u2019s death.", "13. The applicant\u2019s husband found out about their daughter\u2019s death on 1 July 2003. He could not cope with her loss and died two days later, on 3 July 2003.", "14. On 7 June 2003 the District Prosecutor\u2019s Office instituted criminal proceedings into the death of the applicant\u2019s daughter under Article 109 \u00a7 1 of the Russian Criminal Code (negligent homicide).

P., head of the artillery armament service of military unit no. 6780 based in Vedeno, who stated as follows:", "\u201cThe following procedure is in place for deploying mortar batteries. Once the command has been received, the mortar battery\u2019s officer-on-duty is given an order which includes [such information as]: the number of shells, target coordinates, the time of firing, and the time of ceasefire. The battery\u2019s officer-on-duty transmits the command to the officer-on-duty, who alerts the crew-on-duty and issues an order in accordance with the command received. As soon as the firing has been ceased, the battery\u2019s officer-on-duty reports to the initiator of the firing, then the latter reports to the Command of the United Group Alignment (\u201cUGA\u201d) ... Within twenty-four hours the battery commander files a report in order to write off the ammunitions used, indicating the initiator of the firing, the time, target coordinates, and the number of shells used. The report is then approved by the military unit commander ... and agreed with the local department of the FSB. I then receive the report, and prepare an ammunitions expenditure account. Next, the account and the report are attached to a secret file that I keep. The file is kept for five years and is then destroyed ...

M., who stated that on 7 June 2003 the operational investigative group had arrived in Kharachoy to investigate an attack by members of an illegal armed group on civilians (murder and arson). After the investigative group had left, he, I. D. and A. T. went to the cemetery to bury the victims. From the cemetery they heard an explosion and then saw that a district police vehicle had been blown up. As they approached, they saw that several police officers had been wounded and killed. They started helping by providing first aid and evacuating the wounded. On their way from the gorge to the road leading to Dyshne-Vedeno, he heard detonations. A GAZ-66 truck driving on its way to Kharachoy passed them by. He knew that the driver of the truck was a woman from Kharachoy. Later he knew from the officers who had remained at the scene of the explosion that the detonations he had heard had been mortars. He did not know whether the scene of the explosion had been subjected to shelling by members of an illegal armed group or the federal forces.", "32. On 16 January 2007 the criminal proceedings were suspended for failure to identify those responsible for committing the crime. On 16 February 2007 the investigation was subsequently resumed, but suspended again on 16 April 2007.", "33.

His statements were consistent with the statement by S.-Kh. M. (see paragraph 31 above).", "35. On 30 January 2007 the acting prosecutor of the District Prosecutor\u2019s Office approached the military prosecutor of military unit no. 20102 for assistance in obtaining information from the UGA as to whether the mortar batteries used on 7 June 2003 had belonged to the military units and divisions deployed in the Vedenskiy District, with an indication of the time of firing, target coordinates and the number of shots.", "36. On 6 February 2007 the central archives of the Ministry of Defence provided a document stating as follows:", "\u201c[On] 7 June 2003 [at] 17.10 on the ROVD officers\u2019 return trip in the UAZ-452 truck from the village of Kharachoy a landmine exploded on the 4.5 metre-high slope near the road, one kilometre south-east of the village of Dyshne-Vedeno. Losses: \u201c200\u201d \u2013 2, \u201c300\u201d \u2013 10 pers.\u201d", "37. On 13 February 2007 witness V. N., a former officer of the Vedenskiy District ROVD, was questioned. He stated as follows:", "\u201cFrom 17 January 2003 to 8 January 2006 I served under contract as chief of police at the Vedenskiy District ROVD. [I] participated in counterterrorism operations in accordance with the assignments of [the ROVD].", "Indeed, on 7 June 2003 at about 8 a.m. the Vedenskiy District ROVD received information that a group of [approximately] eighty rebel fighters had entered the village of Kharachoy and murdered two women, ... set four houses on fire and committed other crimes.", "At about 2 p.m. as part of a militarised convoy of the operational investigative group, I went to the village to carry out urgent investigative measures. The convoy consisted of six vehicles. After completing the investigative measures, as the convoy was returning back to Vedeno near the gorge three kilometres from Kharachoy, a UAZ vehicle was blown up by an explosive device hidden by the road and fell down the abyss from a height of 20 metres ...", "The incident was reported to the ROVD and Military Commandant\u2019s Office, and a call for reinforcements was made.", "The officers of the operational investigative group participated in the evacuation of those killed and wounded [by the explosion].", "After the reconnaissance unit arrived, the road was blocked by an armoured personnel carrier (APC). At the same time, at about 5.30 p.m. mortar shelling of the nearby area began. I don\u2019t know who opened fire. The explosions hit the forested area on the mountain slopes; there were about fifteen explosions altogether. Judging by the sound characteristic of a flying shell, I concluded that the firing was from mortars. I don\u2019t know which direction the firing came from, [since] it is impossible to establish the direction of mortar fire. It is difficult to say whether the shelling was carried out by officers of the federal forces or members of the illegal armed group. After the road was blocked by the APC, a civilian GAZ-66 truck stopped not far from the APC. A woman was at the wheel. During the shelling she remained in the truck. The shelling lasted about fifteen minutes. Approximately halfway through one of the shells exploded between the APC and the GAZ-66 truck. After the shelling stopped it was discovered that the woman driver of the GAZ-66 truck had received a shell wound to the head and died on the spot. Two FSB officers were also wounded; I don\u2019t know their names or the nature of their injuries ...\u201d", "38. On 14 February and 15 February 2007 respectively witnesses A.

At about 13.30 the operational investigative group comprising about fifty officers of the police, prosecutor\u2019s office and FSB [in four vehicles] headed to Kharachoy.", "At about 14.00 the operational investigative group arrived in Kharachoy. Having split up into several groups, [we] inspected the scene of the incident and gathered the required material.", "At about 18.00 we decided to head in the direction of Vedeno. The head of the Vedenskiy District ROVD decided to proceed in groups, with two to three minute intervals, since it was suspected that the rebel fighters might be nearby and could attack the convoy ...", "Having driven about 800 metres from Kharachoy, an unarmoured UAZ truck carrying the head of the ROVD and eleven other individuals was blown up behind us. We stopped, as I understood that one of our vehicles had been blown up. Everybody left the truck and dispersed onto the road ... At that moment we were subjected to shelling from automatic firearms coming from the forested area on the other side of the abyss. The abyss was about 100 metres wide. I think that at least two people were firing at us. FSB officers called for reinforcements and artillery support.", "Several of our officers started going down the abyss [to provide help to those who were in the UAZ vehicle]. Me and other officers were covering them, firing at the forested area with automatic firearms. The firefight lasted for about twenty minutes and ended after FSB officers launched two grenades in the direction of the forested area with an RPG-7 handheld grenade launcher.", "The officers of the prosecutor\u2019s office inspected the scene of the attack; the police officers were helping to take the wounded onto the road. We put the wounded into a GAZEL van, and took them to Vedeno. From the direction of Dyshne-Vedeno a GAZ-66 truck was driving towards us ... At that moment a mortar attack began. About three shells hit the forested area and two landed on the road where we were. We immediately hid from the shells under a URAL truck. The interval between strikes was about a minute. The GAZ-66 truck was already approximately 50 metres from us, when a shell exploded next to it. The truck stopped. At that moment the FSB officers got in touch with the military and asked them to cease fire. We got out from under the [URAL] truck and saw that the woman driver of GAZ-66 truck was dead ... Two of our officers were also wounded; I don\u2019t remember who exactly.", "The firing was from mortars, as a characteristic roar was clearly heard before each explosion. I cannot say where the firing was conducted from, since we were in a gorge, and the echo could be heard from everywhere ...\u201d", "40. On 21 March 2007 witness D. G., a former officer of the Vedenskiy District ROVD, was questioned. He stated as follows:", "\u201cFrom 19 June 2002 to 19 June 2003 I served under contract at the Vedenskiy District ROVD ... On 7 June 2003 [as part of the operational investigative group] I went to the village of Kharachoy, where during the night of 7 June 2003 about eighty unidentified [members of an illegal armed group] had killed several women and burned down several houses and cars. On the return trip from the scene of the incident, [on the road running through forested mountain slopes] between the villages of Kharachoy and Dyshne-Vedeno, a landmine exploded, as a result of which a UAZ truck carrying officers of the Vedenskiy District ROVD was thrown down the abyss. Thereupon, [the convoy] was subjected to shelling. The shelling was carried out with automatic firearms coming from the forested mountain area by members of the illegal armed group. Later, there was an artillery attack. [This was clear judging by] the characteristic sound and the presence of characteristic \u201cfunnels\u201d on the ground. It is difficult to say which direction the artillery attack was conducted from as the events date back to more than three years ago ...\u201d", "41. On 25 April 2007 the military prosecutor of military unit no. 20102 informed the acting prosecutor of the Vedenskiy District that pursuant to their request of 30 January 2007, an enquiry had been sent to the commander of the UGA and upon receipt of the reply the requested information would be sent separately.", "42. On 16 May 2007 witness V. K., a former officer of Vedenskiy District ROVD, was questioned. With regard to the circumstances of the mortar fire, he claimed to have been unable to say whether the firing was from mortars or artillery equipment, or to say who had conducted it. However, he stated that he had seen shell bursts and estimated that there had been about twenty of them. It was difficult in the circumstances to determine which direction the firing was conducted from.", "43.
