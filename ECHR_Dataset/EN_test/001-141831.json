THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "George Nicolaou;Ineta Ziemele;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Nona Tsotsoria;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Paul Mahoney", "TEXT": ["1. The applicant, S.S., is a British national, who was born in 1981 and lives in Nottingham. He was represented before the Court by Ms K. Mark of Chivers Solicitors, a lawyer practising in Bingley.", "2. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms J. Neenan of the Foreign & Commonwealth Office.", "3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "4. The applicant pleaded guilty to committing a sexual offence against a minor and on 12 May 2008 he was sentenced to three and a half years\u2019 imprisonment. In addition, a Sex Offender Prevention Order (\u201cSOPO\u201d) was made against the applicant. The SOPO, which was to last for five years beginning on 12 May 2008, prohibited him from having contact with female minors under the age of 16.", "5. The applicant and his partner have a son, D, who was born on 12 February 2006. In or around October 2008 the prison service informed the applicant that he could have no contact whatsoever with his son while he was in prison. The applicant appealed against this decision and on 8 November 2008 he was advised that the decision had been taken in the mistaken belief that the SOPO prohibited contact with both male and female minors. The matter was therefore referred to the Safeguarding Children Panel for review.", "6. On 9 January 2009 the Panel informed the applicant that he had been placed on level 3 of the contact arrangements, which meant that he was only permitted contact with his son via written correspondence and telephone calls, both of which were to be monitored subject to a risk assessment being carried out and regularly reviewed. The applicant requested full reasons for this decision and on 3 February 2009 he was advised that the decision was made in consultation with his probation officer and Children\u2019s Services. A further letter received by the applicant\u2019s solicitor in January 2009 indicated that \u201cvisiting a prison environment would not be in the child\u2019s best interests or have any positive impact on the child at this time\u201d. The letter also indicated that the applicant\u2019s partner shared this view. However, the applicant\u2019s partner later denied that this was the case and on 11 February 2009 she gave a statement in support of the applicant\u2019s application for his son to visit him in prison. In that statement she indicated that she was only concerned that the contact would be irregular and cause her son further disappointment.", "7. The applicant renewed his application on 9 June 2009, but the Panel again concluded that \u201cvisiting the prison environment would not be in the child\u2019s best interests at this time\u201d.", "8. The applicant issued judicial review proceedings on 24 August 2009 to challenge this decision on the grounds, inter alia, that it violated his rights under Article 8 of the Convention as it was disproportionate and/or had been made in compliance with an unpublished blanket policy that any person convicted of a sexual offence against minors would not be allowed to receive visits from any minors. On 7 October 2009 the applicant was refused permission to apply for judicial review on the grounds that the decision was not irrational in light of the authorities\u2019 unanimous assessments and the child\u2019s best interests had to take priority over the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his family life.", "9. The applicant renewed his application for permission but the application was refused on 11 November 2009.", "10. The applicant submits that on the advice of his counsel he did not seek leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal because he was due to be automatically released on 12 February 2010, at the halfway point of his sentence, and the domestic courts would not entertain an academic application unless there was a strong public interest element.", "11. Section 6(1) of the Human Right Act makes it unlawful for any public authority to act incompatibly with a Convention right. Section 8 enables any court which finds that a public authority has breached section 6(1) to grant such remedy, within its powers, as it considers appropriate.", "12.
