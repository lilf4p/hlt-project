On 2 November 2007 the applicant\u2019s lawyer filed a petition with the Bolu public prosecutor\u2019s office, requesting that a criminal investigation be initiated and that Mr I.E. be punished for incitement to commit a crime and incitement to disrespect the law, and for insulting his client. The lawyer also noted that Mr I.E. had committed these offences through the press. In his petition, the applicant\u2019s lawyer stressed that two recent murders (those of Andrea Santoro, a Catholic priest, and Hrant Dink, the editor-in-chief of AGOS, a bilingual Turkish-Armenian newspaper published in Istanbul) had been committed subsequent to publication of articles on the Internet. He stated that the content of the article openly incited society to kill the persons listed in it, including the applicant, and that by using the expression \u201cmurderer\u201d in respect of the applicant, the author had insulted him.", "12. On an unspecified date Mr I.E. sent a petition to the Bolu public prosecutor containing his defence submissions. He maintained at the outset that he had defended the Turkish Republic and the Turkish military forces throughout his life. He further contended that, had he committed an offence in his article as alleged by the complainant, then he had committed it under severe provocation. He submitted that the complainant had never condemned the PKK\u2019s activities and that he had referred to PKK members as \u201cbrothers and sisters\u201d. Mr I.E. noted that he had been demonstrating solidarity with the families of the martyrs killed by the terrorists and that, were his solidarity to be regarded as an offence, then as a Turkish nationalist he was proud of committing the offence in question. He also claimed that he had criticised the DTP\u2019s ideology and activities in his article and had intended to inform society. He contended that a case had been brought before the Constitutional Court for the DTP\u2019s dissolution, and that the content of his article had been similar to the indictment brought by the Chief Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation in that case. He had not used the word \u201cKurdish\u201d in his article, since he accepted all citizens of Turkey as Turkish. Until the complainant stated \u201cHow happy is he who says \u2018I am a Turk\u2019\u201d, he would struggle against him. He also maintained that in view of the hundreds of cases brought against DTP members on charges of separatism, aiding and abetting the PKK and hostility towards the State, the complainant had been shameless in daring to file a complaint against him. He further noted that he had targeted those who were terrorists, that is, PKK members, and if the complainant considered himself the subject of the article, then he (Mr I.E.) had been right to identify him as a target. Mr I.E. maintained that nobody had been hurt as a result of his article, but that many people had died as a result of terrorism. At the end of his submissions, he again noted that the applicant had been unable to say \u201cHow happy is he who says \u2018I am a Turk\u2019\u201d and that, therefore, the applicant\u2019s Turkishness was open to doubt.", "13. On 7 December 2007 the Bolu public prosecutor decided not to bring criminal proceedings against Mr I.E. In his decision, the public prosecutor stated that the article had been drafted as a reaction to the PKK, an organisation recognised internationally as a terrorist organisation, which had carried out acts of terrorism and killed both civilians and soldiers. According to the public prosecutor, after listing the killings committed by the PKK, the author had stated his opinion as to why society and the State should act together against the killings committed by the PKK and had articulated public reaction and anger in the face of those killings. The author had even criticised the State\u2019s activities in relation to acts of terrorism. The Bolu public prosecutor held that Mr I.E. had severely criticised the DTP, which had not condemned the PKK\u2019s illegal activities and which was considered to have failed to act side by side with society and the State. The public prosecutor considered that the article expressed the author\u2019s opinions and offered a number of proposals with a view to eradicating the terrorist organisation in issue.", "14. The Bolu public prosecutor further noted that the PKK\u2019s supporters had described the organisation\u2019s so-called political aims in the press and elsewhere, although its activities had created great anger and hatred in society. The public prosecutor maintained that articles had also appeared in the press expressing society\u2019s anger and hatred. In spite of all these publications, there had been no armed conflict between different ethnic groups in Turkey, due to the culture of tolerance, respect and understanding which existed in the country. The Bolu public prosecutor stated that in the light of the aforementioned sociological and political background in Turkey, the article should be considered as using freedom to disseminate information, to criticise and to comment within the context of freedom of the media, given that it contained somewhat exaggerated criticism of a political party, its members and activities.", "15. In his decision, the public prosecutor considered that the case was comparable to another case. According to the judgment in that case, which contained a reference to the Court\u2019s judgment in Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria (26 April 1995, Series A no. 313), in cases concerning defamation, if a factual basis existed, then certain expressions could not be regarded as extreme. Considering that freedom of the media included the expression of social reactions and opinions using strong language, and referring to the above-mentioned domestic judgment, the public prosecutor concluded that there was no reason to bring a case against Mr I.E.", "16. On 30 July 2008 the applicant\u2019s lawyer objected to the decision of 7 December 2007. In his pleadings, the lawyer reiterated the arguments contained in the submissions of 2 November 2007. He further maintained that the content of Mr I.E.\u2019s article had been alarming and that the DTP members who were named in the article had been marked as targets on account of their adherence to a political opinion. He also noted that the applicant had not been alone in being affected by the article\u2019s content; it posed a further threat to society as a whole. Lastly, the applicant\u2019s lawyer contended that the public prosecutor\u2019s finding that there had been a factual basis for the author\u2019s expressions in the article demonstrated that he had taken the applicant\u2019s political identity into account in issuing his decision.", "17. On 21 August 2008 the D\u00fczce Assize Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s objection, holding that the decision of 7 December 2007 had been correct. On 18 September 2008 this decision was served on the applicant\u2019s lawyer.", "18. In October 2008 a number of news reports were published in the national press and on the Internet, according to which Mr Mehmet Ali \u015eahin, Minister of Justice at the relevant time, had set out his position with regard to the investigation into Mr I.E. Mr \u015eahin stated that, in his view, the content of the article in issue should not have been protected within the scope of the right to freedom of thought and expression. The Ministry of Justice would therefore apply to the Court of Cassation and request that the decision of 21 August 2008 be quashed.", "19. On 15 October 2008, through the public prosecutor\u2019s office at the Court of Cassation, the Ministry of Justice applied to the Court of Cassation.", "20. On 30 September 2009 the Court of Cassation issued its decision on the Ministry\u2019s request. It noted that the applicant had lodged his objection to the decision of 7 December 2007 outside the relevant time-limit and that the D\u00fczce Assize Court had incorrectly examined the decision on the merits. Considering that the D\u00fczce Assize Court\u2019s decision had nevertheless brought about the correct result, namely dismissal of the objection, the Court of Cassation dismissed the Ministry\u2019s request."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
