Information about the demonstrations was disseminated through Facebook or the press.", "7. According to the applicants, the demonstrations were intended to be peaceful and were conducted in a peaceful manner. The demonstrations of 12 January and 10 March 2013 were aimed at protesting about the deaths of soldiers in the army. The demonstration of 26 January 2013 condemned the use of force by the police against the participants of previous demonstrations, while those taking part in the demonstration of 29 December 2013 were protesting against bureaucratic injustices which had allegedly caused a disabled war veteran to set himself on fire on 25 December 2013.", "8. Each applicant attended one of the demonstrations (see Appendix), but shortly after they had begun the police started to disperse those who had gathered. All the applicants were arrested during the dispersal operations and were taken to various police stations.", "9. The applicants were questioned at the police stations they were taken to.", "10. On the day of each applicant\u2019s arrest administrative offence reports (inzibati x\u0259ta haqq\u0131nda protokol) were issued, which stated that the applicants had committed an administrative offence under Article 298.2 of the Code of Administrative Offences (\u201cthe CAO\u201d) (participation in a public assembly that had not been organised in accordance with the law).", "11. Some of the applicants refused to sign the administrative offence reports (applications nos. 52270/13, 26424/14 and 26994/14).", "12.

Members of the public were not allowed in the courtroom, even though the court had not taken a formal decision to close the hearing to the public.", "17.

Similarly, the State-funded lawyer for the applicant in application no. 26424/14 stated in general terms that the applicant was not guilty and asked the court to discontinue the case. In addition, none of the material submitted to the Court contains any record of showing that the State-funded lawyer, Mr V.M., made any oral or written submissions on behalf of the applicant in application no. 52270/13.", "19.

They asked the Baku Court of Appeal to quash the first-instance courts\u2019 decisions in their cases.", "22.
