The applicant was born in 1978 and lives in Chisinau.", "6. On 11 November 2009 at approximately 11.30 p.m. the applicant was arrested on the street by several police officers wearing plain clothes, on suspicion of possession of drugs.", "7. According to the applicant, she was ill-treated by the police officers before being taken to the police station. At the police station she was held until the next morning.", "8. In a medical report issued on 13 November 2009 a forensic doctor found that the applicant presented numerous bruises to her face, arms and hips. An x-ray examination of the applicant\u2019s head, which according to the medical report was conducted on the same date, showed that the applicant also had a broken nose.", "9. On 15 November 2009 the applicant was examined by a neurologist who determined that she had also suffered concussion.", "10. On 14 January 2010 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint with the Prosecutor\u2019s Office concerning her ill-treatment by the police on 11 November 2009.", "11. On 1 April 2010 the Rascani Prosecutor\u2019s Office refused to initiate criminal proceedings on the ground that the applicant\u2019s complaint was illfounded. The decision was based on the statements of the accused police officers who had denied having ill-treated the applicant and on the fact that there was a possibility that the applicant\u2019s injuries were the result of her falling over.", "12. On 15 October 2010 a superior prosecutor from the same Prosecutor\u2019s Office rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal.", "13. On 29 November 2010 an investigating judge from the Rascani District Court upheld the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law and ordered a re-examination of the applicant\u2019s case. The judge found that the investigation conducted by the Prosecutor\u2019s Office had been superficial and incomplete.", "14. After the reopening of the investigation, the Prosecutor\u2019s Office ordered the conduct of a new forensic medical examination. In a report dated 30 December 2010 a forensic doctor found that on 13 November 2009 the applicant had presented numerous bruises on her face and limbs and a broken nose. The applicant\u2019s injuries had been produced by at least six different blows with a hard blunt object and since they were located on different parts of her body, they could not have been a result of a fall from the height of her body.", "15. On 20 May 2010 the Rascani Prosecutor\u2019s Office refused again to initiate criminal proceedings. This time the prosecutor argued that according to his verifications in the documents of the hospital where the applicant had undergone an x-ray of her nose, the procedure had been carried out not on 13 but on 10 November 2009. Moreover, the prosecutor found a discrepancy between the records in the forensic medical report of 13 November 2009 where the time of the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment was indicated as 1 a.m. on 12 November and her subsequent statements indicated it as 11.30 p.m. on 11 November 2009. This decision was upheld by a superior prosecutor on 26 September 2011 and by an investigating judge from the Rascani District Court on 1 November 2011."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
