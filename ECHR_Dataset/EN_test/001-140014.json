The applicants were born in 1933 and 1949 respectively. The first applicant lives in the village of Shalushka in the Republic of KabardinoBalkariya, whilst the second applicant is resident in the village of Pervomayskoe, Stavropol Region.", "6. Early in the morning of 13 October 2005 law-enforcement agencies in the town of Nalchik, the Republic of Kabardino-Balkariya, were attacked by a number of heavily armed people, who appear to have been local insurgents. The agencies included the Republican Department of the Ministry of the Interior, Centre T of the Main Department of the Ministry of the Interior, various district departments of the Ministry of the Interior, the Special Purpose Police Unit of the Republican Ministry of the Interior, various checkpoints of the Traffic Police, the Republican Department of the Federal Security Service, the Republican Department of the Federal Service for the Execution of Penalties and the office of the Border Guard Service of the Federal Security Service. Also, a few privately owned weapon shops were attacked. According to the Government, there were over two hundred and fifty participants in the attack.", "7. The ensuing fight between the governmental forces and the insurgents lasted until at least 14 October 2005.", "8. The applicants submitted that they were relatives of the persons who participated in the attack and died on 13 and 14 October 2005 or shortly afterwards.", "9. The first applicant refers to the death of his son Zamir Mikhaylovich Zalov, born on 13 November 1978, whilst the second applicant refers to the death of her son Murat Abubovich Khakulov, born on 26 March 1978.", "10. The Government stated that the authorities had killed a total of ninety-five insurgents in the anti-terrorist operations mounted in response to the attack of 13 October 2005. In essence, they acknowledged that the deceased referred to by the applicants were among those killed by the authorities.", "11. It appears that on 13 October 2005 the authorities instituted criminal proceedings no. 25/78-05 in connection with the attack in Nalchik.", "12. In the course of the investigation it was established that between 1999 and February 2005 a group of individuals, including A. Maskhadov, Sh. Basayev, I. Gorchkhanov, A. Astemirov, Abu-Valid Khattab and AbuDzeit, had formed a terrorist group. It was this group that organised the attack. Thirty-five law-enforcement officers and fifteen civilians were killed, whilst one hundred and thirty-one law-enforcement officers and ninety-two civilians were injured. Massive damage was done to property.", "13. The applicants did not have any procedural status in the criminal proceedings in case no. 25/78-05.", "14. It appears that on several occasions the applicants requested various officials, including the prosecutors, to return the bodies of their sons for burial.", "15. The requests either remained unanswered or were refused.", "16. The applicants were furnished with death certificates in respect of their sons, indicating 13 October 2005 as the date of death in respect of both individuals and 23 January 2007 (in respect of Zamir Zalov) and 7 April 2008 (Murat Khakulov) as the dates of issue.", "17. On 13 April 2006 the investigation authority terminated the criminal proceedings in respect of the ninety-five deceased on account of their deaths, having taken an individual decision in respect of each deceased person. Each decision described the degree and character of their individual involvement and concluded that these persons had taken part in the attack and died in the course of the ensuing gunfight. It appears that the deceased referred to by the applicants were among those concerned by this decision.", "18. The decision of 13 April 2006 in respect of Zamir Mikhaylovich Zalov stated that his body was located on 13 October 2005 at 127 Malbakhov Street, Nalchik. The investigators found a Makarov pistol containing four cartridges near the corpse and a Makarov pistol containing seven cartridges in his trousers. The deceased held an armed hand grenade in his left hand. The subsequent expert report identified the cause of death as a gunshot wound to the chest, which damaged his heart and caused a massive loss of blood and traumatic shock.", "19. In view of the collected evidence, the investigation concluded that at around 9 a.m. on 13 October 2005 the deceased, acting in concert with other participants, carried out a pre-planned and armed attack on an arms shop with a view to capturing arms and ammunition. The attack resulted in the deaths of at least three persons and the wounding of two more. The deceased personally killed one of the victims and ordered the killing of another.", "20. The decision of 13 April 2006 in respect of Murat Abubovich Khakulov stated that his body was located on 13 October 2005 in the vicinity of the local premises of the Special Purpose Police Unit of the Republican Ministry of the Interior. The investigators found eighty used bullet cartridges nearby. The subsequent expert report identified the cause of his death as multiple gunshot wounds to the legs, leading to massive loss of blood and traumatic shock.", "21. Based on the collected evidence, the investigation concluded that the deceased, along with four other persons, organised and carried out an armed attack on the building of the Special Purpose Police Unit. The deceased took part in the attack for two hours, by shooting at police and passer-bys from an automatic rifle and throwing hand grenades at them. He was later killed when the police returned fire. The attack resulted in the death of one civilian, the wounding of two more and injuries to four police agents.", "22. The Prosecutor General\u2019s Office notified the applicants of the above decisions on 14 April 2006, but no copies of the decisions in question were attached to the notifications.", "23. According to the Government, ninety-five corpses of the presumed terrorists were cremated on 22 June 2006. From the applicants\u2019 submissions, it appears that they first learned of the cremations from the Government\u2019s observations in the present case.", "24. According to the Government, the cremations took place pursuant to a decision not to return the bodies of the deceased to their families, dated 15 May 2006. In contrast to the individual decisions of 13 April 2006, the decision of 15 May 2006 referred to the deceased persons collectively. The decision stated, in particular:", "\u201c... the head of investigation group ... [official S.], having examined the materials in case file no. 25/78-05, established: ... [that] in the course of the counter-terrorist special operation aimed at tackling the attack, 95 terrorists were eliminated, namely:", "[the decision names among the deceased the persons referred to by the applicants]", "At present all forensic expert examinations, including molecular genetic examinations, involving ... the corpses of the deceased terrorists, have been finalised and their identities have been established by way of proper procedure.", "By decisions of 13-14 April 2006 the criminal proceedings in respect of these 95 persons, who had committed ... the attack on various sites and law-enforcement agents of the town of Nalchik ... was discontinued on account of their deaths, under Article 27 part 1 subpart 2 and Article 24 part 1 subpart 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.", "Pursuant to section 14.1 of the Federal Interment and Burial Act (Law no. 8-FZ): \u2018the interment of persons against whom a criminal investigation in connection with their terrorist activities has been closed because of their death following interception of the said terrorist act shall take place in accordance with the procedure established by the Government of the Russian Federation. Their bodies shall not be handed over for burial and the place of their burial shall not be revealed.\u2019", "Pursuant to part 3 of Decree no. 164, \u2018On interment of persons whose death was caused by the interception of terrorist acts carried out by them\u2019, approved by the Government of the Russian Federation on 20 March 2003, \u2018the interment of [these] persons shall take place in the locality where death occurred and shall be carried out by agencies specialising in funeral arrangements, set up by organs of the executive branch of the subjects of the Russian Federation or by organs of local government ...\u2019.", "[In view of the above, official S. decided to:]", "bury the bodies of the 95 terrorists...", "forward the decision to the President of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkariya for execution;", "inform [his superiors] of this decision\u201d.", "25. The Government alleged that the authorities had notified the applicants of the decision of 15 May 2006, but acknowledged that no copy of that decision had been provided to them.", "26. It appears that on several occasions the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office informed the applicants, in substance, of the refusal to return the bodies. It does not appear that the applicants were furnished with a copy of the decision of 15 May 2006.", "27. The applicants\u2019 initial attempts to obtain judicial review of the decisions of 13 April and 15 May 2006 were unsuccessful, as the courts refused to examine their arguments.", "28. The relatives of other deceased participants in the attack contested the legislation governing the interment of terrorists before the Constitutional Court. Their initial complaints were rejected as premature. Eventually, some complaints were accepted for examination.", "29. On 28 June 2007 the Constitutional Court delivered a judgment (no. 8-P) in which, in essence, it rejected their complaints alleging that section 14(1) of the Interment and Burial Act and Decree no. 164 of the Government of the Russian Federation of 20 March 2003 were unconstitutional. The ruling stated, in particular, that the impugned legal provisions were, in the circumstances, necessary and justified. The court reached the following conclusions regarding the legitimate aims and necessity of the legislation in question:", "\u201c... At the same time, the interest in fighting terrorism, in preventing terrorism in general and specific terms and in providing redress for the effects of terrorist acts, coupled with the risk of mass disorder, clashes between different ethnic groups and aggression by the next of kin of those involved in terrorist activity against the population at large and law-enforcement officials, and lastly the threat to human life and limb, may, in a given historical context, justify the establishment of a particular legal regime, such as that provided for by section 14(1) of the Federal Act, governing the burial of persons who escape prosecution in connection with terrorist activity on account of their death following the interception of a terrorist act ... Those provisions are logically connected to the provisions of paragraph 4 of Recommendation 1687 (2004) of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on combating terrorism through culture, dated 23 November 2005, in which it was stressed that extremist interpretations of elements of a particular culture or religion, such as heroic martyrdom, self-sacrifice, apocalypse or holy war, as well as secular ideologies (nationalist or revolutionary) could also be used for the justification of terrorist acts.", "3.2. Action to minimise the informational and psychological impact of the terrorist act on the population, including the weakening of its propaganda effect, is one of the means necessary to protect public security and the morals, health, rights and legal interests of citizens. It therefore pursues exactly those aims for which the Constitution of the Russian Federation and international legal instruments permit restrictions on the relevant rights and freedoms.", "The burial of those who have taken part in a terrorist act, in close proximity to the graves of the victims of their acts, and the observance of rites of burial and remembrance with the paying of respects, as a symbolic act of worship, serve as a means of propaganda for terrorist ideas and also cause offence to relatives of the victims of the acts in question, creating the preconditions for increasing inter-ethnic and religious tension.", "In the conditions which have arisen in the Russian Federation as a result of the commission of a series of terrorist acts which produced numerous human victims, resulted in widespread negative social reaction and had a major impact on the collective consciousness, the return of the body to the relatives ... may create a threat to social order and peace and to the rights and legal interests of other persons and their security, including incitement to hatred and incitement to engage in acts of vandalism, violence, mass disorder and clashes which may produce further victims. Meanwhile, the burial places of participants in terrorist acts may become a shrine for certain extremist individuals and be used by them as a means of propaganda for the ideology of terrorism and involvement in terrorist activity.", "In such circumstances, the federal legislature may introduce special arrangements governing the burial of individuals whose death occurred as a result of the interception of a terrorist act in which they were taking part. ...\u201d", "30. The ruling further noted that the application of the measures prescribed in the legislation could be regarded as justified if proper procedural safeguards, such as effective judicial review, were in place to protect individuals from arbitrariness. The court noted that Articles 123-127 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provided for such review.", "31. In sum, the Constitutional Court upheld the impugned provisions as being in conformity with the Constitution but at the same time interpreted them as requiring that the authorities refrain from burying bodies unless a court had confirmed the competent authority\u2019s decision. It reasoned as follows:", "\u201c... The constitutional and legal meaning of the existing norms presupposes the possibility of bringing court proceedings to challenge a decision to discontinue, on account of the deaths of the suspects, a criminal case against or prosecution of participants in a terrorist act. Accordingly, they also presuppose an obligation on the court\u2019s part to examine the substance of the complaint, that is, to verify the lawfulness and well-foundedness of the decision and the conclusions therein as regards the participation of the persons concerned in a terrorist act, and to establish the absence of grounds for rehabilitating [the suspects] and discontinuing the criminal case. They thus entail an examination of the lawfulness of the application of the aforementioned restrictive measures. Until the entry into force of the court judgment the deceased\u2019s remains cannot be buried; the relevant State bodies and officials must take all necessary measures to ensure that the bodies are disposed of in accordance with custom and tradition, in particular through the burial of the remains in the ground ... or by [cremation], individually, if possible, and to ensure compliance prior thereto with the requirements concerning the identification of the deceased ... and of the time, location and cause of death ...\u201d", "32. Judge G.A. Gadzhiyev issued a separate opinion in which he agreed that the impugned provisions were in conformity with the Constitution but held a different view as to how they should be interpreted. The opinion stated as follows:", "\u201c... if the relevant law-enforcement agencies find, as a result of a preliminary investigation, that a terrorist act has been committed and that a given person was involved, but the criminal proceedings against that person ... are discontinued on account of his or her death following interception of the terrorist act, and if they then conclude that the decision to return the body to the family for burial is capable of threatening public order and peace and the health, morals, rights, lawful interests and safety of others, they are entitled to take a decision refusing to hand over the body and applying special arrangements for burial.", "At the same time, in the event of a refusal to return the body of an individual whose death occurred as the result of the interception of a terrorist act committed by him, the authorities competent to take a decision concerning the burial must secure compliance with all the requirements concerning the establishment of the deceased\u2019s identity, the time and place of death, the cause of death, the place of burial and the data necessary for the proper identification of the grave (a given location and number). The burial must take place with the participation of the relatives, in accordance with custom and tradition and with humanitarian respect for the dead. The administrative authorities of a State governed by the rule of law must respect the cultural values of a multi-ethnic society, transmitted from generation to generation. ...\u201d", "33. Judge A.L. Kononov issued a dissenting opinion in which he described the legislation in question as incompatible with the Constitution. In particular, he noted:", "\u201c... The impugned norms banning the return of the deceased\u2019s bodies to their relatives and providing for their anonymous burial are, in our view, absolutely immoral and reflect the most uncivilised, barbaric and base views of previous generations ...", "The right of every person to be buried in a dignified manner in accordance with the traditions and customs of his family hardly requires special justification or even to be secured in written form in law. This right is clearly self-evident and stems from human nature as, perhaps, no other natural right. Equally natural and uncontested is the right of every person to conduct the burial of a person who is related and dear to them, to have an opportunity to perform one\u2019s moral duty and display one\u2019s human qualities, to bid farewell, to grieve, mourn and commemorate the deceased, however he may be regarded by society and the state, to have the right to a grave, which in all civilisations represents a sacred value and the symbol of memory. ...\u201d", "34. After the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment of 28 June 2007 the domestic courts apparently changed their approach and agreed to review the formal lawfulness of the decisions of 13 April and 15 May 2006. The domestic courts still could not review the need for application of the measures set out in section 14 (1) of the Interment and Burial Act and Decree no. 164 of 20 March 2003 in individual cases.", "35. The applicants contested the actions of the authorities before the courts.", "36. In April 2008, in order to prepare the cases for examination, the presiding judge made repeated requests to the officials of the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, including the Head of the Investigation Committee of the Prosecutor General, seeking copies of the materials relating to the investigation of the deaths of both applicants\u2019 sons. It appears that these requests remained unanswered.", "37. By a judgment of 29 May 2008 the Nalchik Town Court of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkariya partly granted the claims of the second applicant in respect of his son. In particular, the court quashed both the decision dated 13 April 2006 to terminate criminal proceedings in respect of the second applicant\u2019s son because of his death and the decision dated 15 May 2006 not to return the body of the second applicant\u2019s son to his family. The court noted that the decision of 13 April 2006 had failed to take account of the new law on terrorism, adopted on 6 March and 27 June 2006, and that therefore the decision of 15 May 2006 had been premature. The court ordered the prosecution authorities to examine the relevant issues afresh.", "38. A similar judgment was taken on 3 July 2008 by the Nalchik Town Court of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkariya in respect of the first applicant\u2019s son.", "39. The judgments were appealed against by both parties.", "40. The Supreme Court of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkariya upheld the judgments on 15 July and 12 August 2008 respectively.", "41. The parties have not submitted any information about the subsequent events in the applicants\u2019 domestic cases.", "42. According to those relatives of the deceased who took part in the identification of the bodies, for several days following the events of 13 and 14 October 2005 the corpses were kept in the town morgue and other locations in wholly unsatisfactory conditions. In particular, the bodies gave off an intense smell owing to the lack of proper refrigeration and were chaotically piled on top of each other.", "43. The applicants did not participate in identification of their deceased relatives in person.", "44. The Government submitted that Zamir Mikhaylovich Zalov had been identified by his cousin Z.Kh. on 19 October 2005, whilst Murat Abubovich Khakulov had been identified by his cousin A.R. on 24 October 2005.", "45. The Government submitted that the corpses in question had been initially held in the Nalchik morgue. Between 14 and 18 October 2005 the applicants examined the corpses and the clothing. Thereafter the bodies were placed in two refrigerator wagons. On 1 November 2005 the wagons were moved to the town of Rostov-on-Don for molecular genetic examinations and on 22 June 2006 all of the bodies were cremated. Between 13 and 22 October 2005 the person in charge of the identification proceedings was the head of the investigation group, investigator P. From 22 October 2005 he was replaced by investigator S. The Government also acknowledged that immediately after the attack no facilities had been available to keep the bodies.", "46. According to the Government\u2019s most recent submissions, the overall amount of human casualties as a result of the events of 13 October 2005 was twelve civilians, thirty-five police and law-enforcement officers and eightyseven participants in the attack.", "47.
