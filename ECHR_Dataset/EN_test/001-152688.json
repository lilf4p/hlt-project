The applicant, Mr Tihomir Aleksi\u0107, is a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who in born in 1946 and lives in Belgrade.", "2. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Miji\u0107.", "3. The Serbian Government, having been informed of their right to intervene in the proceedings (Article 36 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 of the Rules of Court), indicated that they did not wish to exercise that right.", "4. The applicant was an officer of the JNA, the armed forces of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (\u201cthe SFRY\u201d). The present case concerns his attempt to repossess his pre-war flat in Sarajevo.", "5. The detailed background concerning socially owned flats, military flats and the involvement of foreign armed forces in the 1992-95 war in Bosnia in Herzegovina is provided in \u0110oki\u0107 v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, no. 6518/04, \u00a7\u00a7 5-17, 27 May 2010 and Mago and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, nos. 12959/05, 19724/05, 47860/06, 8367/08, 9872/09 and 11706/09, \u00a7\u00a7 5-8, 3 May 2012.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "6. In 1984 the applicant was allocated an occupancy right to a military flat in Sarajevo.", "7. On 31 March 1992 he bought that flat under the terms of the Military Flats Act 1990 and paid the full purchase price in the amount of 710,117 Yugoslav dinars (approximately 8,354 German marks (DEM) at the time).", "8. When the JNA formally withdrew from Bosnia and Herzegovina on 19 May 1992, the applicant continued his military career in the VJ forces and left Sarajevo. His military service was terminated in 1998.", "9. On 2 February 1997 the Ministry of Defence of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina allocated the flat to H.G., a member of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.", "10. On 15 September 1998 the applicant applied for the restitution of his flat in Sarajevo. On 2 March 2000 his application was rejected pursuant to section 3a of the Restitution of Flats Act 1998. On 8 December 2000 the competent Ministry of the Sarajevo Canton upheld that decision.", "11. On 28 May 2002 the restitution commission, set up by Annex 7 to the 1995 General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina (\u201cthe Dayton Peace Agreement\u201d), before which the applicant pursued parallel proceedings, held that he was neither a refugee nor a displaced person within the meaning of Annex 7 and declined jurisdiction. On 2 September 2003 the restitution commission rejected the applicant\u2019s request for reconsideration of his claim.", "12. On 31 July 2000 the applicant complained to the Human Rights Chamber (a domestic human-rights body set up under Annex 6 to the Dayton Peace Agreement) about the inability to repossess his pre-war flat.", "13. On 6 June 2005 the Human Rights Commission (the legal successor of the Human Rights Chamber) rejected the applicant\u2019s complaint as regards the proceedings before the competent administrative bodies on non-exhaustion grounds (the applicant had failed to inform the Commission about the decisions of 2 March 2000 and 8 December 2000; see paragraph 10 above). The complaint concerning the decisions of the restitution commission was rejected as incompatible ratione personae. The Commission held that, in accordance with Annex 7, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (against which the applicant had addressed his appeal) could not be held responsible for the decisions of the restitution commission because it had not had jurisdiction to examine them.", "14. On 21 November 2005 the applicant initiated proceedings before the Sarajevo Municipal Court (\u201cthe Municipal Court\u201d) seeking to establish the validity of a purchase contract of 31 March 1992 and to register his title to the flat in the land register. On 2 April 2008 the Municipal Court concluded that the action had been withdrawn because the applicant had failed to attend a scheduled hearing without justification.", "15. On 25 March 2011 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Serbia informed the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina that the applicant had not yet been allocated a military flat in Serbia, but that his right to such allocation had been established by the competent body of the Serbian Ministry of Defence.", "16. On 22 December 1995 all purchase contracts concluded under the Military Flats Act 1990 were declared void (Zakon o preuzimanju sredstava biv\u0161e Socijalisti\u010dke Federative Republike Jugoslavije u svojinu Republike Bosne i Hercegovine, Official Gazette of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina nos. 6/92, 13/94, 50/95 and 2/96). Thereafter, the legislation regulating this matter, the Privatisation of Flats Act 1997 (Zakon o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo, Official Gazette of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina nos. 27/97, 11/98, 22/99, 27/99, 7/00, 32/01, 61/01, 15/02, 54/04, 36/06, 51/07, 72/08 and 23/09) and the Restitution of Flats Act 1998 (Zakon o prestanku primjene Zakona o napu\u0161tenim stanovima, Official Gazette of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina nos. 11/98, 38/98, 12/99, 18/99, 27/99, 43/99, 31/01, 56/01, 15/02, 24/03, 29/03 and 81/09), underwent numerous changes and all such contracts were declared legally valid.", "17. Nevertheless, two categories of buyers are not entitled to repossess their flats and to register their title to them (see section 39e of the Privatisation of Flats Act 1997 and section 3a of the Restitution of Flats Act 1998). The first category concerns those who served in foreign armed forces after the 1992-95 war. The second concerns those who acquired occupancy or equivalent rights to a military flat in a successor State of the SFRY. However, they are now entitled to compensation under section 39e of the Privatisation of Flats Act 1997. Although the compensation was initially envisaged as the refund of the amount paid for the flats in 1991/92 plus interest at the rate applicable to overnight deposits, on 30 March 2012 the Constitutional Court (decision no. U 15/11) declared that method of determining the amount of compensation unconstitutional and ordered the Parliament of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to amend it in line with \u0110oki\u0107 (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 63 and 72).", "18. For a more detailed analysis of the relevant domestic law and practice and of the relevant international documents, see \u0110oki\u0107 (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 35-45) and Mago and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 53-69).", "D. Relevant Serbian legislation", "19. It has no longer been possible to acquire occupancy rights in Serbia since 1992 (see section 30(1) of the Housing Act 1992, Zakon o stanovanju, Official Gazette of Serbia nos. 50/92, 76/92, 84/92, 33/93, 53/93, 67/93, 46/94, 47/94, 48/94, 44/95, 49/95, 16/97, 46/98, 26/01, 101/05 and 99/11). Instead, current and retired members of the armed forces and current and retired staff of the Ministry of Defence are now entitled to equivalent tenancy rights of unlimited duration on military flats or, in case of a lack of suitable flats, mortgage loans co-financed by the State on condition that they or their spouses or children do not have occupancy or equivalent rights to a flat in any of the former Republics of the SFRY (the Military Housing Ordinance 1994, Pravilnik o na\u010dinu i kriterijumima za re\u0161avanje stambenih pitanja zaposlenih u Saveznom ministarstvu za odbranu i Vojsci Jugoslavije, Official Gazette of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia nos. 30/94, 39/94 and 6/96; the Military Housing Ordinance 1995, Pravilnik o na\u010dinu i kriterijumima za davanje stanova u zakup i dodeljivanje stambenih zajmova za re\u0161avanje stambenih pitanja zaposlenih u Vojsci Jugoslavije, Official Gazette of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia nos. 5/95, 18/96, 56/96, 58/96, 42/97 and 9/00; the Military Housing Ordinance 2002, Pravilnik o na\u010dinu, kriterijumima i merilima za davanje stanova u zakup i dodeljivanje stambenih zajmova za re\u0161avanje stambenih pitanja zaposlenih u Ministarstvu odbrane i Vojsci Srbije i Crne Gore, published in an internal gazette of the Ministry of Defence nos. 20/02, 36/03, 34/04 and 29/05; the Military Housing Ordinance 2005, Pravilnik o re\u0161avanju stambenih pitanja u Ministarstvu odbrane, published in an internal gazette of the Ministry of Defence nos. 38/05, 16/08, 26/08 and 39/08; and the Military Pensioners Ordinances 1994 and 2010, Pravilnik o re\u0161avanju stambenih potreba korisnika vojnih penzija, published in an internal gazette of the Ministry of Defence nos. 31/94, 19/95, 26/96, 1/97 and 45/08 and Pravilnik o re\u0161avanju stambenih potreba korisnika vojnih penzija, published in an internal gazette of the Ministry of Defence no. 34/10). Therefore, those who occupied military flats in Bosnia and Herzegovina before the war have as a rule been required to give up their rights to those flats in order to qualify for a military flat or a loan in Serbia or Montenegro (see sections 6-7 and 87 of the Military Housing Ordinance 1994; sections 7-8 and 74 of the Military Pensioners Ordinance 1994; and sections 6-7 and 85 of the Military Housing Ordinance 1995).", "20. Section 39(2) of the Housing Act 1992 provides that the holder of a tenancy right of unlimited duration in respect of a flat may purchase that flat under the same conditions as an occupancy right holder."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
