RUSSIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Protection of property (Article 1 para. 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Deprivation of property)", "JUDGES": "Branko Lubarda;Georgios A. Serghides;Pere Pastor Vilanova", "TEXT": ["4. The applicants complained of a breach of their property rights through the actions of Russian military forces in Chechnya in 2000 and the failure of the competent domestic authorities to provide them with effective remedies in respect of those breaches.", "5. The facts of the cases, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "6. The application was lodged on 14 March 2008 by Mr Isa Magometkhozhiyev, who was born in 1950 and currently lives in Urus-Martan, Chechnya. He is represented before the Court by Mr D. Itslayev, a lawyer practising in Grozny.", "7. The applicant lived at 109 Sovetskaya Street, Urus-Martan. At about 10 a.m. on 10 March 2000 a group of military servicemen arrived at the house. The servicemen drove two armoured personnel carriers (APCs), and an Ural lorry with the registration number M 105 61. The group\u2019s commander introduced himself to the applicant as Major Iv. They seized the applicant\u2019s GAZ-330700 petrol lorry, which was stationed in the courtyard. They did not show any documents or give any explanation in respect of the seizure to the applicant, except to tell him that they had been instructed by their commanders to do so.", "8. The applicant followed the servicemen who drove his lorry away. They entered the compound of a military unit known as DON-100, in the south-western outskirts of Urus-Martan.", "9. On 11 March 2000 the applicant was allowed by a soldier to enter the compound and he saw his vehicle there. The applicant states that he saw many other vehicles stationed there; some had parts missing.", "10. Two weeks later a serviceman told the applicant that his vehicle had been transported to a military unit in Mozdok, North Ossetia.", "11. The applicant stated that he had reported the seizure of the vehicle to the authorities immediately, but submitted no documents in this respect.", "12. On 15 March 2001 the applicant informed the military prosecutor of Chechnya of the unlawful seizure of his lorry and asked him to intervene.", "13. On 19 June 2001 an investigator of the Urus-Martan district prosecutor\u2019s office (hereinafter \u201cthe district prosecutor\u2019s office\u201d) asked the Ministry of Justice to inform him of the current location of Major Iv., who was no longer stationed in Chechnya.", "14. In July and August 2001 the Ministry of Justice replied to the investigator that no Ministry serviceman by the name of Iv. had been serving in Urus-Martan at the time in question.", "15. On 20 January 2002 the district prosecutor\u2019s office opened criminal investigation file no. 61001 into the alleged robbery. The decision by which the criminal investigation file was opened stated that in March 2000 a group of unidentified armed persons had, having threatened the applicant with firearms, taken his lorry from his house.", "16. After a subsequent exchange of letters between the district prosecutor\u2019s office and the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Defence, it proved impossible to identify the military unit in question. On this basis, in April 2003 the military prosecutor\u2019s office refused to take possession of the file.", "17. Officials of the North Caucasus Military Circuit denied that the GAZ lorry with the registration and identification numbers indicated by the applicant had been registered with any of their units. This was affirmed by the Chechnya Agency of State property.", "18. Certain documents indicated that the servicemen identified by the applicant as belonging to \u201cDON-100\u201d had served in military unit no. 3660 of the internal troops of the Ministry of the Interior, which was permanently based in the Rostov Region.", "19. At some point the applicant was granted victim status and information about the vehicle was entered in the national register of missing and stolen vehicles.", "20. The applicant on numerous occasions complained to various bodies, including the civilian and military prosecutor\u2019s offices, and the military and civilian authorities both in Chechnya and at the federal level.", "21. The investigation was adjourned and reopened on several occasions but failed to identify the perpetrators, to find or question anyone from the military unit in question, or to locate the vehicle.", "22. The applicant lodged a claim for compensation against the State Treasury. On 8 August 2005 the Urus-Martan Town Court refused to consider the claim on the merits. The applicant appealed, and on 30 August 2005 the Supreme Court of Chechnya quashed that decision and remitted it to the District Court for fresh examination.", "23. In the meantime, the applicant applied to the Urus-Martan Town Court, requesting that it confirm his ownership of the vehicle in question. The applicant submitted that the vehicle and relevant documents had been taken from him by unidentified servicemen of the Ministry of Justice. The Chechnya traffic police were unable to issue any documents since their archives had burned down in 2000, but a police inspector from Urus-Martan confirmed that the applicant had had the vehicle in his possession. Two witnesses confirmed that the applicant had owned the vehicle. On the strength of the above, on 27 February 2006 the Town Court confirmed the applicant\u2019s ownership of the vehicle in question.", "24. By a decision dated 21 September 2006 the Urus-Martan Town Court transferred the applicant\u2019s claim for damages to the Basmanny District Court of Moscow, the city in which the Federal Treasury was situated. The applicant appealed, and on 4 July 2006 the Supreme Court of Chechnya quashed the decision of 21 September 2006 and remitted the case to the Urus-Martan Town Court for fresh consideration.", "25. On 21 December 2006 the Urus-Martan Town Court considered the substance of the case and concluded that the evidence submitted by the applicant and adduced during the pending criminal investigation had failed to establish conclusively the implication of State agents in the crime.", "26. The applicant appealed, and on 30 January 2007 the Supreme Court of Chechnya quashed the judgment of 21 December 2006 and again remitted the case to the Urus-Martan Town Court for fresh consideration.", "27. The applicant lodged a claim seeking compensation for the cost of the lorry (which he estimated at 170,000 Russian roubles (RUB)) and lost income, together with compensation for non-pecuniary damage. On 1 August 2007 the Urus-Martan Town Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim, referring to the absence of conclusive proof that State servicemen had seized the vehicle. On 18 September 2007 the Supreme Court of Chechnya upheld that ruling, referring to the fact that the criminal investigation remained pending.", "28. The application was lodged on 6 October 2008 by Mr Ismail Amalayev, who was born in 1960 and currently lives in Kiel, Germany.", "29. In the evening of 14 October 2000 the applicant, his wife and aunt travelled in the applicant\u2019s KAMAZ 53-20 lorry from the village of Starye Atagi to the Chiri-Yurt district of Grozny, Chechnya. At about 5 p.m. the applicant\u2019s lorry got stuck on the road, not far from a security roadblock. The applicant tried to seek help from the passing drivers, but they were either unable to tow the lorry or didn\u2019t want to stop, in view of the approaching curfew.", "30. An armoured personnel carrier (APC), with the hull number 233, belonging to military unit no. 205 was passing by, and the applicant signalled to it by flashing his headlights. The APC stopped within 200-300 metres of the applicant\u2019s lorry. Several servicemen got out but did not approach the lorry. Soon afterwards the applicant\u2019s lorry was shot at from the direction of the APC; the applicant, his wife and his aunt escaped unhurt and ran to Starye Atagi.", "31. In the morning on 15 October 2000 the applicant went to the lorry and found it burnt out and looking as though it had suffered from an explosion. The applicant immediately informed the local police, the head of the local administration of Starye Atagi and the local military commander\u2019s office.", "32. On 19 October 2000 the applicant drew up a description of the destroyed lorry, which was co-signed by two traffic police officers from Starye Atagi. The description concluded that the lorry had been \u201cblown up and burned during curfew hours not far from the roadblock manned by the [servicemen of the] 205th motorised rifle regiment\u201d. The applicant submitted a copy of this document to the Court, with some handwritten corrections.", "33. On the same day a senior inspector of the state traffic police of the Grozny district department of the interior (\u041e\u0412\u0414 \u0413\u0440\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0427\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438) concluded that the applicant\u2019s KAMAZ lorry had been destroyed by fire as a result of being fired at and could not be repaired.", "34. In a decision dated 24 October 2000, the Grozny district prosecutor\u2019s office stated that it would not open a criminal investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations. It concluded that the applicant had left his lorry on the road and that the car had been destroyed by fire as a result of an electrical short circuit. In 2001-2002 the applicant lodged a number of complaints against that decision.", "35. On 25 March 2001 the Grozny District Prosecutor\u2019s Office opened a criminal investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations that his KAMAZ lorry had been shot at and been destroyed by fire by unidentified servicemen driving APC no. 233. The investigation was adjourned on several occasions.", "36. In March 2006 the applicant, his wife and aunt were granted victim status. The value of the lorry was put by the applicant at RUB 280,000. It does not appear that the investigation progressed beyond the facts communicated by the applicant.", "37. On 8 May 2008 the Grozny District Court refused to consider the applicant\u2019s complaint concerning the ineffectiveness of the investigation, since on 1 May 2008 the latest decision to adjourn the investigation had been quashed. On 11 June 2008 the Supreme Court of Chechnya confirmed this decision.", "38. On 1 June 2008 the applicant was, once again, informed that the investigation had been adjourned.", "39. The applicant lodged a claim, seeking to recover the cost of the lorry directly from the military unit. On 15 November 2006 the Grozny District Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim. The applicant appealed, and on 19 December 2006 the Supreme Court of Chechnya quashed the District Court\u2019s decision and remitted the case to the District Court. The Supreme Court pointed out that the case-file material in respect of the pending criminal case, the applicant\u2019s submissions and the evidence produced all pointed to the Ministry of Defence as the possible tortfeasor. It considered that the District Court had failed to elucidate the circumstances of the events in question and to inform the Ministry of Defence of the hearing of 15 November 2006.", "40. The case was then transferred to Moscow, where the Ministry of Defence headquarters is located. On 2 March 2007 the Presnensky District Court dismissed the claim. It pointed out that the circumstances of the events in question were the subject of pending criminal proceedings and that \u201cmilitary unit no. 205\u201d did not exist, according to the General Staff of the Ministry of Defence. It is not clear if the applicant appealed.", "41. It appears that in March 2013 the applicant left Chechnya and, via Poland, moved to Germany."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
