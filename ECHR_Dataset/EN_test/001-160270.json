The applicant was born in 1974. He is serving a life sentence in prison.", "6. On 21 July 2005 the applicant requested from the Governor of P\u00e4rnu Prison access to (i) the online version of Riigi Teataja (the State Gazette), (ii) the decisions of the Supreme Court and administrative courts, which are available on the Internet, and (iii) the HUDOC database of the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. The Governor refused his request. The applicant\u2019s subsequent complaint was dismissed by the P\u00e4rnu Administrative Court; the Tallinn Court of Appeal dismissed his further appeal. The applicant then appealed to the Supreme Court.", "7. The Administrative Law Chamber of the Supreme Court delivered its judgment on 31 May 2007 (case no. 3-3-1-20-07). In respect of Estonian legislation and the Supreme Court\u2019s rulings, the Supreme Court noted that these were available in the paper version of Riigi Teataja; it considered access to the paper version sufficient and found that the prison\u2019s refusal to grant the applicant access to the online version of Riigi Teataja had been lawful.", "8. However, the Supreme Court noted that from 1 January 2007 the primary official version of Riigi Teataja had been its online version and that since then only five \u201ccontrol copies\u201d of each edition had been printed. Despite that fact, the prisons had a duty to ensure that detainees had a reasonable possibility of searching for and familiarising themselves with legal acts.", "9. Furthermore, the Supreme Court considered that the refusal of the prison administration to grant detainees access to the rulings of the administrative courts and of the European Court of Human Rights interfered with their right to freely obtain information disseminated for public use. Given that the legislature had not specified any restrictions in this regard in respect of prisoners, their right \u2013 enshrined in Article 44 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Estonia (Eesti Vabariigi p\u00f5hiseadus) \u2013 to obtain information had to be given an equal level of protection as that afforded to persons at liberty. Accordingly, the refusal of P\u00e4rnu Prison to grant the applicant access to the rulings of the Estonian administrative courts and the European Court of Human Rights had been unlawful.", "10. On 18 October 2007 Tartu Prison \u2013 to which the applicant had been transferred in the meantime \u2013 refused the applicant\u2019s request to be granted access to the Internet sites www.coe.ee (the Council of Europe Information Office in Tallinn), www.oiguskantsler.ee (the Chancellor of Justice, or \u00d5iguskantsler)) and www.riigikogu.ee (the Estonian Parliament, or Riigikogu). According to the applicant, he was involved in a number of legal disputes with the prison administration and needed access to those Internet sites in order to be able to defend his rights in court.", "11. On 23 November 2007 the applicant\u2019s complaint was dismissed by the Ministry of Justice.", "12. By a judgment of 17 July 2008 the Tartu Administrative Court upheld the applicant\u2019s complaint in respect of the Internet site www.coe.ee and ordered Tartu Prison to grant him supervised access to that site via a computer adapted for that purpose. The Administrative Court noted that Tartu Prison had afforded its detainees access to the online version of Riigi Teataja, the database of judicial decisions, and the Internet sites of the European Court of Human Rights and the Supreme Court. The Administrative Court further referred to the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 31 May 2007 (see paragraphs 7 and 9 above) and to section 31-1 of the Imprisonment Act (Vangistusseadus) (see paragraph 21 below), which had entered into force on 1 June 2008. It noted that the Internet site of the European Court of Human Rights \u2013 to which detainees had been granted access \u2013 contained information only in English and French, whereas translations into Estonian of the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights were available on the Internet site of the Council of Europe Information Office in Tallinn. The Administrative Court considered that the burden of having the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights translated into Estonian could not be placed on the applicant and concluded that he also had to be granted access to the Internet site www.coe.ee. It considered that this Internet site was similar to the database of judicial decisions referred to in section 31-1 of the Imprisonment Act. In respect of the Internet sites www.oiguskantsler.ee and www.riigikogu.ee, the court found that access to these sites was not foreseen by section 31-1 of the Imprisonment Act; in any case, the applicant could request information directly from the institutions concerned or from Tartu Prison.", "13. Both parties appealed. On 31 October 2008 the Tartu Court of Appeal dismissed both appeals and upheld the first-instance court\u2019s judgment.", "14. Both parties challenged the Appeal Court\u2019s judgment before the Supreme Court. The Administrative Law Chamber of the Supreme Court referred the case to the Supreme Court\u2019s plenary session on a point of constitutionality. By a judgment of 7 December 2009 the plenary session of the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal and upheld Tartu Prison\u2019s appeal. It quashed the lower courts\u2019 judgments in so far as these granted the applicant access to the Internet site www.coe.ee.", "15. The Supreme Court found that the Internet sites in question did not fall under the exceptions provided for in section 31-1 of the Imprisonment Act (see paragraph 21 below). Thus, the Supreme Court had to determine whether that provision was in conformity with the Constitution. The Supreme Court found that section 31-1 of the Imprisonment Act interfered with the right \u2013 enshrined in Article 44 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution \u2013 to freely obtain information disseminated for public use. It noted that the aims of imprisonment included the protection of the legal order and steering detainees towards law-abiding behaviour. As the possibility could not be technically excluded that detainees might misuse the right to use the Internet, access to the Internet was prohibited to them by section 31-1 of the Imprisonment Act. The exception made in respect of the official databases of legislation and the database of judicial decisions was necessary in order to ensure that detainees were afforded an effective possibility to protect their own rights. It had to be taken into account that the official texts of legal acts were only accessible to detainees via the Internet.", "16. The Supreme Court observed that the prohibition of the use of the Internet was necessary primarily in order to restrict detainees\u2019 ability to engage in communication for purposes that did not accord with those of their detention, such as obtaining information that could jeopardise the prison\u2019s security or run counter to the directing of detainees towards law-abiding behaviour. Granting detainees access to any additional Internet site increased the security risk of their obtaining information running contrary to the aims of imprisonment. Moreover, this could create an opportunity for detainees to use the Internet for purposes other than that of freely obtaining information disseminated for public use. Thus, the Supreme Court concluded that the prohibition of detainees\u2019 access to the Internet sites www.coe.ee, www.oiguskantsler.ee and www.riigikogu.ee was justified by the need to achieve the aims of imprisonment and in particular the need to secure public safety.", "17. In respect of the proportionality of the restriction the Supreme Court considered that the denial of detainees\u2019 access to the Internet sites www.coe.ee, www.oiguskantsler.ee and www.riigikogu.ee prevented them from misusing the Internet via these sites and that public safety was thereby protected. Moreover, granting detainees access to these Internet sites could increase the risk of their engaging in prohibited communication; this in turn would necessitate increased levels of control (and therefore costs). Thus, there were no alternative, equally effective means \u2013 besides the prohibition imposed by section 31-1 of the Imprisonment Act \u2013 of achieving the legitimate aim in question. Lastly, the Supreme Court noted that detainees were able to contact the Riigikogu and the Chancellor of Justice by mail and make a request for information (teaben\u00f5ue). Therefore, detainees\u2019 access to the public information contained on the Internet sites in question was not unduly restricted. Detainees\u2019 access to the Internet site of the European Court of Human Rights was guaranteed, pursuant to section 31-1 of the Imprisonment Act; those of the Council of Europe\u2019s conventions and treaties that had been ratified by Estonia were accessible on the Internet site www.riigiteataja.ee. The Supreme Court noted that it did not doubt that the printed works of the Council of Europe were accessible through prison libraries, and nor were detainees prevented from contacting the Council of Europe by post. The Supreme Court concluded that the restriction preventing detainees from accessing the Internet sites www.oiguskantsler.ee, www.riigikogu.ee and www.coe.ee was one of \u201clow intensity\u201d; the Supreme Court gave more weight to the aim sought by that restriction. It considered that permitting detainees extensive use of the Internet would increase the likelihood of prison authorities losing control over detainees\u2019 activities, as it could not be completely excluded that via the Internet sites in question detainees could use the Internet for other, unauthorised purposes. Accordingly, the impugned restriction was in conformity with the Constitution.", "18. Four judges out of eighteen delivered a dissenting opinion according to which the applicant should have been granted access to all three of the Internet sites in question. They considered that the use of the Internet sites in question did not generally pose a threat to public safety and was in conformity with the aims of imprisonment. It was unclear what additional costs the State would have to bear, since \u2013 in line with the applicable law \u2013 prisons were equipped with computers specially adapted to allow detainees access to the official databases of legislation and judicial decisions, and the prison service exercised supervision over the use of such resources. The information available on the Internet sites in question aided the exercising of the right of recourse to the courts. While it was true that detainees could also avail themselves of the right to make a request for information, this was a more time-consuming avenue and, particularly in the case of the Internet site of the Chancellor of Justice, required knowledge of which information was available on such Internet sites. No request for information under the Public Information Act (Avaliku teabe seadus) could be made to the Council of Europe Information Office in Tallinn. The rulings of the European Court of Human Rights available in the HUDOC database \u2013 which was accessible to detainees \u2013 were not in Estonian (unlike the unofficial translations published on the Internet site www.coe.ee), and it could not be presumed that detainees had sufficient command of English or French to be able to read them. The printed works of the Council of Europe that were available in prison libraries did not include all the information that was published on the Internet site of the Council of Europe Information Office in Tallinn. Thus, the four dissenting judges concluded that the restriction in question was unconstitutional."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
