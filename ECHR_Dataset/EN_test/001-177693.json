On the same day the Nasimi District Court, relying on the charges brought against the applicant and an application from the prosecutor to apply the preventive measure of remanding the applicant in custody, ordered his detention pending trial for a period of two months.

On 3 March 2011 the Nasimi District Court extended the applicant\u2019s detention pending trial by one month, until 8 April 2011.
