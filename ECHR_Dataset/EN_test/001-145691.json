The applicant was arrested and placed in detention on 12 November 2001.", "4. On 7 October 2003 the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Court of Appeal acquitted the applicant of all the charges for lack of evidence and ordered his release from custody.", "5. On 1 March 2004, in the applicant\u2019s absence, a panel of three judges of the Supreme Court of Justice examined an appeal lodged by the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office against the judgment of the Court of Appeal, quashed the judgment, convicted the applicant and sentenced him to life imprisonment.", "6. The applicant complained to the Court and, on 27 November 2007, the Court found, inter alia, that his right to a fair trial had been breached on the grounds that the Supreme Court of Justice had convicted him without making a direct assessment of evidence given by the applicant in person (see Popovici v. Moldova, nos. 289/04 and 41194/04, \u00a7 72, 27 November 2007).", "7. As a result of the Court\u2019s judgment, the applicant lodged an extraordinary appeal against the judgment of the Supreme Court of 1 March 2004 seeking its quashing and a fresh examination of the appeal against the judgment of the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Court of Appeal of 7 October 2003. The Prosecutor General\u2019s Office did not object.", "8. On 30 June 2008 the Plenary Supreme Court of Justice examined the extraordinary appeal lodged by the applicant, quashed both the judgment of 1 March 2004 and that of the Court of Appeal of 7 October 2003 and ordered a fresh examination of the case. The Supreme Court also ordered the applicant\u2019s remand in custody for an undefined period of time without there being a request by the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office.", "9. After the communication of the case to the Government, the Court became aware of the fact that on 17 November 2008 the Supreme Court of Justice had examined an extraordinary appeal lodged by the applicant against its judgment of 30 June 2008 and had upheld it. The Supreme Court considered unlawful the quashing in that judgment of the decision of the Court of Appeal of 7 October 2003 and the decision to remand the applicant in custody, and reversed those parts of the judgment."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
