The applicant was born in 1944 and lives in Tirana.", "5. On 10 December 2001 the applicant, who worked as an accountant for the Tirana City Hall, was dismissed. The dismissal took effect on 11 January 2002.", "6. On 6 February 2002, following the applicant\u2019s action against his dismissal, the Civil Service Commission (\u201cCSC\u201d) quashed the dismissal decision and ordered his employer to reinstate him. By final decision of 8 May 2003, the Supreme Court upheld the CSC decision. On 10 March 2006 the applicant was offered employment by the Tirana City Hall (see paragraph 11 below).", "7. On 15 May 2003 the Tirana District Court supplemented the CSC\u2019s decision by ordering the Tirana City Hall to pay the applicant\u2019s salary for the period between 10 December 2001 and the date of reinstatement. The employer\u2019s request for revision was dismissed on 10 October 2003.", "8. On 4 June 2003 an enforcement writ was issued in respect of both decisions.", "9. On 31 March 2006 the Constitutional Court, following a constitutional complaint by the applicant, acknowledged that there had been a breach of the applicant\u2019s right of access to court on account of the non-enforcement of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.

The court reasoned that, since the applicant had taken up employment with the Ministry on 1 March 2006, the Tirana City Hall was obliged to pay him salary arrears for the period from 11 January 2002 (see paragraph 5 above) to 28 February 2006. That obligation had ceased to exist ipso lege as of 1 March 2006. Relying on an expert\u2019s report, the court found that the applicant\u2019s salary arrears for the period from 11 January 2002 to 28 February 2006 amounted to ALL 1,720,261, of which ALL 946,185 had been paid by the Tirana City Hall.

On 30 June 2010 the Tirana District Court found in his favour and ordered the Tirana City Hall to pay accrued interest as a result of the delay in payment of the salary arrears from 9 April 2008 to 31 March 2010 and social security contributions on the basis of the applicant\u2019s indexed salary. No quantification of the amount was made.", "20. On 8 July and 23 December 2011 the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, respectively, upheld the Tirana District Court\u2019s decision.", "21.
