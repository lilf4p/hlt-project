Following the death of fourteen members of the PKK (Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, an illegal armed organisation) in an armed clash on 24 March 2006, many illegal demonstrations took place in Diyarbak\u0131r between 28 and 31 March 2006, during which a number of demonstrators were killed. According to the Government, some 2,000 individuals took part in those demonstrations, in which the police headquarters was bombarded with stones, sticks and petrol bombs, with the police and their vehicles coming under attack around the city. It was reported that, during those incidents, nine people died and over 200 members of the police force and 214 higher-ranking officers, a doctor, a nurse, two journalists and an ambulance driver were wounded.

On 29 March 2006, at around 13.30 p.m. to 2 p.m., on leaving his workplace, Tar\u0131k Ataykaya found himself in the middle of a demonstration. The Government accepted the argument that Tar\u0131k Ataykaya had not taken part in the demonstration but had just been passing by, and explained that the police had fired a large number of tear-gas grenades to disperse the demonstrators. Tar\u0131k Ataykaya was struck on the head by one of the grenades and died a few minutes later.", "8. On 30 March 2006, at 11.15 a.m., an autopsy was carried out at the public hospital of Diyarbak\u0131r. The report\u2019s conclusions read as follows:", "\u201c1.

I.D. stated in particular as follows:", "\u201c... On 29 March 2006, at around 1.30 p.m. to 2 p.m., we closed the workshop with Tar\u0131k Ataykaya, one of the workers, and returned home on foot. We saw tanks go past. People were very worried. Six or seven members of the security forces, armed and wearing the uniform of special teams (they were wearing special military uniforms with mixed colours, they were not ordinary policemen or soldiers), arrived. They started shooting at random. There was a great pandemonium. While we were running we heard gunfire ... We saw Tar\u0131k Ataykaya fall to the ground unconscious (the security force personnel were firing with one knee on the ground and taking aim. That means they were not firing in the air but towards people). ... I realised that [Tar\u0131k Ataykaya] was wounded in the head. M.S.D. also realised this. We carried Tar\u0131k Ataykaya to an empty space near a building and called an ambulance ...\u201d", "10.

It showed that the object extracted from Tar\u0131k Ataykaya\u2019s head was a plastic cartridge (muhimmat) from a tear-gas grenade of type no. 12. The report also stated that the cartridge did not bear any characteristic markings from which the firearm in question could have been identified.", "B.

He asked for information on the police units which had been equipped with tear-gas grenade launchers during the incident of 29 March 2006 and for the identification numbers of the personnel who had used them. However, it can be seen from the answers given by the Diyarbak\u0131r police headquarters, as summarised below, that it was not possible to establish with certainty the identity or number of all the members of the security forces who had been authorised to use that type of weapon.", "14. First, in June 2006, the Diyarbak\u0131r police informed the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor that during the incident in question three police officers from the special forces (\u00f6zel harekat), whose identification numbers were indicated in the letter, had used grenade launchers in order, according to them, to disperse demonstrators who had been throwing stones and petrol bombs at the security forces.", "15.

On 14 February 2007, B.A., one of the three police officers whose identification numbers had been communicated previously (see paragraph 14 above), gave evidence to the public prosecutor\u2019s office. He stated that, on the day of the incident, some 500 police officers and soldiers had used tear-gas grenade launchers and that, if Tar\u0131k Ataykaya had died as a result of a tear-gas grenade fired by the security forces, any one of those 500 police officers and soldiers could have fired it. He added that, during the incident, some 4,000 to 5,000 tear-gas grenades had been used by police officers from the special forces in order to disperse the demonstrators.", "21.

On 29 March 2006 we were working with Tar\u0131k Ataykaya in the joinery workshop on Medine boulevard in Ba\u011flar. Around noon, a large crowd had gathered on Medine boulevard because of the demonstrations ... We had to close the workshop. There were about 50-60 demonstrators and 5-6 police officers, wearing camouflage clothing and balaclavas. As we were locking up the workshop, I saw that masked policemen, with one knee on the ground (yere diz \u00e7\u00f6kerek), were firing guns unremittingly towards the demonstrators. Tar\u0131k Ataykaya was with us. He did not take part in the demonstrations. After leaving the workshop Tar\u0131k Ataykaya went back there because the demonstrators were heading towards us. [At that moment], Tar\u0131k Ataykaya, hit by a bullet fired by one of the policemen, fell to the ground, which means that he was shot by police gunfire. Supporting him, we took him to an empty space near a building and called an ambulance. Tar\u0131k Ataykaya had been struck on the head and small pieces of his brain had come out. We took Tar\u0131k Ataykaya to hospital with a pick-up truck as there was no sign of the ambulance. As the policemen were masked, I am unable to identify them.\u201d", "I.D. added that, on the day of the incident, some of his friends had said that they had seen footage of the incident, probably on the private television channel NTV.", "23. On the same day, M.S.D., an eyewitness and colleague of Tar\u0131k Ataykaya, also gave evidence to the public prosecutor\u2019s office. He confirmed I.D.\u2019s statements.", "24. Also on 15 November 2007, R.K., a resident of the district where the incident had taken place was interviewed by the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor\u2019s office. She stated in particular:", "\u201c... on 29 March 2006, at my home on Medine boulevard, I was waiting for my son to come home from school. It was about 1 p.m. The demonstrations had begun in the streets. My son was late and I went to look for him on Medine boulevard. I saw my son coming back from school. Tar\u0131k Ataykaya, with three of his colleagues, had closed the workshop and I think he was on his way home. The street was full of people. The policemen were advancing in our direction. They were firing their guns continuously towards the demonstrators. When I got home with my son, I saw that a masked policeman, with one knee on the ground, was firing towards Tar\u0131k Ataykaya, who had his back to the policeman. I saw Tar\u0131k Ataykaya fall to the ground. He was carried to the door of a building. An ambulance was called. When I checked Tar\u0131k Ataykaya\u2019s heart, I realised that he was dead. The policemen who had come towards us were masked, so I would not be able to identify them. As my attention was totally focussed on Tar\u0131k Ataykaya, I did not see what the policeman was doing.

He pointed out that in the context of that investigation it would be appropriate to take statements from the eleven police officers of the Rapid Response Force and the three police officers of the special forces.", "28. It can be seen from the file that an administrative investigation was opened by the Diyarbak\u0131r provincial governor\u2019s office in order to determine the responsibility of fourteen police officers in the incident. Following that investigation, on 30 January 2008, the police disciplinary board of the provincial governor\u2019s office made up of the governor, the head of the health department and three police superintendents, decided not to impose any sanction on the police officers who had used tear gas during the demonstration of 29 March 2006. The board made the following observations in particular:", "\u201c... It is appropriate to close the case having regard [to the following points:] it was a major incident. According to the witness statements, the face of the officer who fired the tear-gas grenade which caused the death of the deceased was not visible because he was wearing a balaclava. All officers have undergone training in which they learned that the firing [of grenades] must be carried out in such a way as not to hit the target directly.

In those circumstances, it will be for the superior to determine the degree of force to be used ...

During the incidents, demonstrators were clashing with the police and throwing sticks and stones. The police intervened against the demonstrators using tear-gas grenades and rubber bullets. The casing of a tear-gas grenade thrown against the moving demonstrators struck the head [of Tar\u0131k Ataykaya] and caused his death. This incident is not mentioned in the police documents. The witnesses to the incident stated that they could not identify the person who had fired it because his face was masked. It was not possible to determine which weapon had been used. The casing did not bear any characteristic mark of the weapon from which it was fired. Even though there is no tangible evidence to show that the person who fired was definitely a police officer, as no register suggested that other armed individuals had used tear-gas grenades [it can be concluded that] this grenade was probably used by the security forces which were operating at that time.
