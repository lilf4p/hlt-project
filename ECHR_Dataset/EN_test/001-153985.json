A list of the applicants is set out in the appendix.", "The Netherlands Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr R.A.A. B\u00f6cker, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.", "2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "A. Introduction", "3. Before the events complained of, the applicants variously held shares or subordinated bonds (the latter under diverse designations) issued by SNS Reaal N.V. (hereafter \u201cSNS Reaal\u201d), a public limited company (naamloze vennootschap, \u201cN.V.\u201d) incorporated under Netherlands law, or one or more of its subsidiaries.", "4. SNS Bank N.V. (\u201cSNS Bank\u201d) was, and is, a high-street retail bank. It was a subsidiary of the holding company SNS Reaal N.V. Another subsidiary of that holding company was Reaal N.V., an insurance company. SNS Bank N.V.\u2019s own subsidiaries included ASN Bank N.V., RegioBank N.V. and SNS Property Finance B.V., a private limited company (besloten vennootschap, \u201cB.V.\u201d).", "5. From 2008 onwards the financial position of certain companies within the SNS Reaal group deteriorated. By 2012 the Netherlands central bank (De Nederlandsche Bank N.V., \u201cDNB\u201d) was concerned about the conglomerate\u2019s financial health to the point that it decided to seize the Minister of Finance (Minister van Financi\u00ebn) of the situation.", "6. Reports relevant to the case were presented on 31 October 2012 by Ernst & Young, a firm of accountants, and on 14 December 2012 by Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate services firm (a supplement to the latter was presented on 20 December 2013). SNS Bank had full access to the report by Cushman & Wakefield. Copies of the two reports submitted by the applicants have parts blacked out. It would appear that these documents were not released to the applicants complete at any relevant time.", "B. The expropriation proceedings", "1. DNB\u2019s letter to the Minister of Finance", "7. On 24 January 2013 DNB wrote to the Minister of Finance in the following terms (footnotes omitted):", "\u201c1. Introduction", "On 18 January 2013 DNB sent the outcome of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) to SNS Bank N.V. (SNS Bank) in the form of an intended SREP decision. In this intended decision ... DNB notes a capital shortage of at least 1,9 billion euros (EUR) and states its intent to impose on SNS Bank the measure of having to supplement its core capital by at least EUR 1.9 million no later than 31 January 2013 at 6 p.m., or at least to present, no later than 31 January 2013 at 6 p.m., a final solution which, in the considered view of DNB, has sufficient prospects of success and which will, in the short term, lead to the actual supplementing of the said capital shortage. If SNS Bank should prove unable sufficiently to strengthen its capital position in time, DNB, according to its statement of intent, will consider it irresponsible for SNS to continue banking and DNB will make use of its powers under the Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financi\u00ebel toezicht). SNS Bank has until noon on 24 January 2013 to state its views; DNB will come to a final decision as soon as possible thereafter, taking these views into account. If these views should provide any new insight, then DNB will inform your ministry accordingly as soon as possible.", "In the event that DNB in its final SREP decision imposes on SNS Bank the measure referred to in its intended decision and SNS Bank does not comply with the measure thus imposed within the time-limit set, DNB considers it irresponsible for SNS Bank to continue banking. In addition, in the absence of a convincing and final solution it would appear impossible to publish by 14 February 2013 provisional annual accounts drawn up on the basis of continuity. In view of the expectations raised as regards an overall solution, postponing the publication of annual accounts without announcing an overall solution for SNS Reaal will mean further undermining confidence in SNS Reaal. DNB considers this irresponsible from the point of view of financial stability, also in the light of the increasing flow of publications in the media on the vulnerable position of SNS Reaal and the resulting outflow of funds.", "Since SNS Bank is a system-relevant institution (systeemrelevante instelling), the threat of insolvency of SNS Bank (and therefore that of the entire concern) will mean that the stability of the financial system is in serious and immediate danger. DNB therefore advises you to make preparations to enable the use of your powers under part 6 of the Financial Supervision Act immediately after the lapse of the time-limit in a final SREP-decision if and in so far as one is taken, or even sooner if the situation should so require.", "In view of the seriousness of the situation and the speed of the developments, DNB considers it important to send you this informative letter \u2013 based on section 6:5 of the Financial Supervision Act \u2013 already now. Paragraph 2 of this letter provides background information relating to the situation of the institution and the supervisory approach adopted by DNB. Paragraph 3 explores financial stability as the guiding point of departure in seeking a solution. Paragraph 4 provides an overview of the solutions examined and the reasons why, as it appears at present, these are not achievable. Paragraph 5 makes a few closing remarks.", "2. Background", "...", "After a broad survey of possible avenues for a solution by a joint working group, there have been intensive discussions with the Ministry of Finance and market parties about a plurality of (variants of) solutions. In its role as supervisor and co-responsible party for the stability of the financial system, DNB has played an initiating and active role in this process of negotiation. With the help of external advisors, a solution has been sought which comes as close as possible to meeting the following basic criteria:", "The private sector should be involved as much as possible to limit the financial consequences for the State as much as possible;", "Wherever possible, losses should be borne by SNS Reaal\u2019s current risk-bearing financiers (burden sharing). This point of departure not merely limits the financial consequences for the State, but also serves the stability of the financial system in the long term;", "The intention to forestall an emergency situation;", "It is self-evident that any solution \u2013 involving State support \u2013 should in addition be assured of the approval of the European Commission (EC), be structural in character, and be proportionate.", "3. Financial stability", "In DNB\u2019s considered view it is not only SNS Bank\u2019s continuity which is of importance for the financial system, but also that of the holding SNS Reaal.", "SNS Bank\u2019s insolvency will have serious consequences for the stability of the financial system because of (i) the costs involved in the implementation of the deposit guarantee scheme, (ii) loss of confidence in other Netherlands financial institutions and (iii) the consequences for account holders and the attending unrest. DNB has described these factors in its letter of 2 October 2012, in which it is explained that DNB considers the estimated eventual cost flowing from the implementation of the deposit guarantee scheme irresponsibly high, seen also in the light of the general scarcity of capital and the desire of the markets for the anticipated application of Basle III [a voluntary regulatory standard on bank capital requirements, now due to enter into force in 2018] (argument i). In order to supplement these arguments, communicated to your Ministry earlier, DNB points to the following factors:", "The uncertainty as to the possibility for banks to recover against the estate of SBS bank if the deposit guarantee system is implemented. Since EUR 35 billion of the deposits guaranteed by that scheme are held by SNS Bank, claims would be in the order of greatness of EUR 10 billion per major Netherlands bank. A situation in which other Netherlands banks have major claims against the estate of SNS Bank and in which it is uncertain to what extent these will be met in itself undermines the health of, and therefore confidence in, these banks.", "Further splitting up SNS Bank into separate parts is not a realistic option. This is caused, in particular, by the interrelation of subsidiaries RegioBank and ASN Bank with their parent SNS Bank as regards operations and IT; these subsidiaries use the same infrastructure with their own labels. There is also considerable financial interrelation between ASN Bank and SNS Bank: savings from ASN Bank are used to finance credit (mortgages) provided by SNS Bank. Because of these interrelations any insolvency of the parent bank will in practice include that of the subsidiaries and vice versa. Any insolvency of SNS Bank will in addition probably lead to loss of confidence in its subsidiaries as well.", "SNS Bank, ASN Bank and RegioBank hold approximately one million current accounts and one and a half million savings accounts, with a total credit balance of approximately EUR 36.4 billion. At least EUR 500 per month is paid into approximately two thirds of the current accounts, which is an indication that these accounts play an important role in the financial transactions of individuals. Consequently all sorts of practical problems [sic] resulting from any insolvency of SNS Bank, such as cashpoints breaking down or standing orders being stopped, will have enormous social effects [sic].", "...", "5. Conclusion", "... [It would appear], at this moment, that nationalisation of the conglomerate as a whole is the only remaining solution for SNS Reaal. For a decision to expropriate to be taken, there has to be a situation of \u2018serious and immediate danger to the stability of the financial system\u2019. As has been observed in the introduction to this letter, DNB considers it irresponsible for SNS Bank to continue banking in the event that DNB in its final SREP-decision imposes on SNS Bank the measure referred to in its intended decision and SNS Bank does not comply with the measure thus imposed within the time-limit set. In the considered view of DNB the above-mentioned legal criterion for nationalisation will then have been met. Should you decide not to proceed with nationalisation, DNB, as the responsible supervisor, would be compelled to seek an emergency arrangement, which would mean implementing the deposit guarantee system.", "An emergency situation is therefore imminent. In the introduction to this letter attention has been drawn to the danger of loss of confidence as a result of any postponement of publication of the annual accounts without announcing an overall solution for SNS Reaal. There is already a loss of confidence, which has manifested itself in an outflow of funds in an amount of approximately EUR 1.4 million since the reports of 16 January 2013 about the position taken by the EC in this case; actually, if it had not been for public confidence in the safety net provided by the State the outflow would probably have been considerably greater.", "In addition to publication of the annual accounts without announcing an overall solution DNB notes other events that could be the beginning of an emergency situation. In the first place, DNB cannot allow Reaal and/or SNS Bank to increase lending to the holding SNS Reaal with which to repay external financing that will end in March. Absent any other funding possibilities this is expected to cause the holding to be unable to make further payments. In addition, if no solution is found, then SNS Bank, owing to its very weak capitalisation and the negative developments in this respect, would run the risk of no longer having access to the European Central Bank\u2019s facilities. This, combined with the outflow of funds that has already occurred, could cause SNS immediate liquidity problems.", "On the above grounds, DNB advises you to make preparations to enable the use of your powers under part 6 of the Financial Supervision Act immediately after the expiry of the time-limit in a final SREP decision if and in so far as one is taken, or even sooner if the situation should so require.\u201d", "This letter was at the time classified confidential. It has since been made available to the public.", "2. The SREP decision", "8. On 27 January 2013 DNB, after SNS Bank had stated its views, gave a decision (the \u201cSREP decision\u201d) which, as relevant to the case before the Court, was in the following terms:", "\u201c6. Decision", "SNS Bank shall supplement its core capital by no less than EUR 1.84 billion no later than 31 January 2013 at 6 p.m., or in any case SNS Bank shall, no later than 31 January 2013 at 6 p.m., present a final solution which, in the considered view of DNB, offers sufficient prospects of success, it being required, at least, that all the parties involved shall demonstrably have committed themselves to the solution presented, and which solution shall lead to the actual supplementing of the said capital shortage in short order.", "7. Final remarks", "Only if the decision set out in paragraph 6 has been fulfilled will it be possible for DNB to conclude that SNS Bank\u2019s established capital (toetsingsvermogen) guarantees controlled and durable cover of its risks. If SNS Bank should prove unable to strengthen its capital position sufficiently and in time, DNB considers that it is irresponsible for SNS Bank to continue banking and DNB will make use of its powers under the Financial Supervision Act. ...\u201d", "3.
