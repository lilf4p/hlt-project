HUNGARY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Egidijus K\u016bris;Ganna Yudkivska;Marko Bo\u0161njak;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque;Vincent A. De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["1. The applicant is a Hungarian national who was born in P\u00e9cs and is detained in Szeged Prison.", "3. On 12 December 2010 the applicant was placed in P\u00e1lhalma Prison. He alleged that during his time in P\u00e1lhalma Prison he had been kept in a cell measuring thirty square metres, which he had had to share with fourteen other inmates. Outdoor exercise had been limited to one hour a day and the applicant had spent the remainder of his time in the cell. Furthermore, the cell had been infected with bed bugs.", "4. In March 2011 the applicant was transferred to the Prison of the Central Transdanubia Region, where he was first accommodated together with seventeen other inmates in a cell measuring forty-five square metres, then together with thirteen other inmates in a cell measuring twenty-five square metres. He claimed that in both cells the toilet had been separated from the living area only by a curtain. The applicant was allowed to take a five-minute shower once a week.", "5. As of 11 January 2012, he was transferred to Baranya County Prison where he was held in a cell measuring sixty square metres and accommodating twenty eight inmates including him. Throughout this confinement he had outdoor stays for only an hour a day in a yard measuring twenty-five square metres. He spent the remainder of his time in the cell.", "6. Between March 2015 and 15 July 2015 the applicant was detained in Veszpr\u00e9m County Prison. The cell where he was held measured seven square metres and accommodated three inmates. It was equipped with a separate toilet. The applicant was allowed to take a ten-minute-long shower once a week.", "7. From 15 July 2015 to 9 July 2016 the applicant was detained in Szombathely Prison, where six persons were held in a cell measuring twelve square metres. Outdoor exercise was limited to one hour a day.", "8. Since 9 July 2016 the applicant has been detained in Szeged Prison with eleven other detainees in a cell measuring twenty-five square metres. The applicant is allowed to move freely outside his cell.", "9. On 25 October 2016 the Hungarian Parliament adopted Act No. CX of 2016, amending certain Acts on criminal matters in relation to the judgment adopted by the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Varga and Others v. Hungary (hereinafter, the \u201c2016 Act\u201d \u2013 see paragraph 15 below). This Act was promulgated on 4 November 2016 and entered into force on 1 January 2017. It was aimed at introducing preventive and compensatory remedies in cases of inadequate conditions of detention.", "10. On 15 September 2017, the Minister of Justice of Hungary addressed to the President of the Court a letter \u201cconcerning the implementation of the pilot judgment in the case of Varga and Others v. Hungary\u201d. The Minister noted that under the 2016 Act, a complaint alleging conditions of detention in violation of Article 3 of the Convention could be presented to the prison governor, who should, as far as practicable, take the necessary actions in order to improve the conditions or counterbalance the injury suffered (for instance: relocation, increasing the time allowed for visits or the time spent in the open air, and improvement of the sanitary facilities). According to the Minister, in view of the progress of the prison capacity expansion programme, there was a \u201creal prospect\u201d of finding penal institutions with sufficient capacity. A preventive remedy could, however, be used only while the detention was still ongoing. After release, and within six months of the termination of the prison sentence, only a compensatory claim could be submitted. This could lead to the granting of a sum calculated on the basis of the number of days spent in conditions contrary to Article 3 of the Convention, the daily tariff ranging from a minimum of 1,200 Hungarian forints (HUF \u2013 approximately 4 euros (EUR)) and a maximum of HUF 1,600 (approximately EUR 5.3). The judge must exercise his or her judicial discretion in order to award an amount proportionate to the gravity of the violation found, taking into account, for instance, the absence of toilets separated from the living space in the cell, in addition to a general situation of overcrowding, or to other inadequate conditions of detention. The sum thus determined must be paid within sixty days of the decision being served.", "11. The Minister further stated that from 1 January to 7 August 2017, 5,447 applications for compensation had been lodged with the penal institutions, thus showing the accessibility of the new remedy. Referring to the strict time-limits provided for by the 2016 Act, the Minister argued that the remedy also satisfied the requirement of quick adjudication and underlined that the judge responsible for the execution of sentences must provide reasons for his or her decision. As to the amount of compensation, the Minister noted that the Italian legislation adopted following the pilot judgment in the case of Torreggiani and Others v. Italy (nos. 57875/09 and 6 others, 8 January 2013) fixed the sum to be granted at EUR 8 per day of detention in conditions incompatible with the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention. Having regard to the burden-bearing capacity and of the economic realities of the two countries, the choice of the Hungarian legislator to fix the daily tariff at between EUR 4 and 5 could be deemed to be reasonable.", "12. The Minister lastly noted that out of 3,554 cases brought before the judges responsible for the execution of sentences, 248 claims had been adjudicated by 14 July 2017, awarding a total amount of HUF 153,510,900 (approximately EUR 497,040). Moreover, due to the extension of the prison capacity achieved as part of the action plan, overcrowding in Hungarian prisons had significantly dropped: whereas in 2014 the occupancy level had been 413%, in 2016 and 2017 the respective figures were 131% and 129%.", "13. In the light of the above, the Minister urged the Court to find that the preventive and compensatory remedies provided for by the 2016 Act were effective and needed to be exhausted in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.", "14. In a letter of 27 September 2017 the Registry of the Court asked the applicant to indicate whether he had used the remedies provided for by the 2016 Act or intended to do so. In his reply of 12 October, the applicant stated that he had lodged a claim under the relevant domestic legislation and the proceedings were still pending before the Szeged High Court.", "15. The 2016 Act introduced, inter alia, new sections into Act No. CCXL of 2013 on the enforcement of punishments, measures, certain coercive measures and confinement for regulatory offences. In so far as relevant, those sections read as follows:", "Compensation for conditions of detention violating fundamental rights", "Section 10/A", "\u201c(1) Convicts and persons detained on other grounds are entitled to compensation for not having been provided with the inmate living space specified in the law and for any other conditions of detention violating the prohibition of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, in particular for violations caused by unseparated toilets, and lack of proper ventilation or lighting or heating and disinfection (henceforth together: conditions of detention violating fundamental rights). Compensation shall be awarded for the number of days spent in conditions of detention violating fundamental rights.

This time-limit is absolute. For the purposes of this subsection, conditions of detention violating fundamental rights will not be considered to have ceased to exist where those conditions are interrupted for a short period, but for a maximum of thirty days, on account of the fact that within the term of imprisonment of the convict or person detained on other grounds the statutory living space has been provided.", "(5) A compensation claim may be lodged by a convict or person detained on other grounds or by their counsel or, if the detainee has already been released, by his legal representative. The compensation claim shall be lodged in writing with the penal institution where the detention is being effected or, if the convict or person detained on other grounds has been released, with the penal institution which released him. In the application for compensation the convict or person detained on other grounds shall give a statement as to whether the European Court of Human Rights (henceforth: the ECHR) has obliged the State to pay damages to him on account of conditions of detention violating fundamental rights and whether a civil court has already awarded him indemnification or damages for infringement of personality rights. If the answer is yes, the detainee shall also state the name of the court and the case number in the application.", "(6) Save for inmates undergoing involuntary treatment or temporary involuntary treatment, a further condition for the lodging of such an application for compensation is the prior submission by the convict or person detained on other grounds of a complaint under Section 144/B to the head of the organ responsible for the enforcement of the sentence about the conditions of detention violating fundamental rights. This condition shall be applicable where the number of days spent in conditions of detention violating fundamental rights has exceeded thirty (30). Where conditions of detention violating fundamental rights exist over a longer period of time, a further complaint does not need to be lodged within three months.. Where the convict or person detained on other grounds could not enforce his right of complaint for reasons beyond his control, it shall not be imputed to him.", "(7) It will be possible to satisfy other claims from the compensation awarded only", "(a) up to the amount of a civil claim or of an indemnification or damages for infringement of personality rights awarded under a final civil judgment in relation to the offence for the enforcement of which the compensation is awarded, and", "(b) up to the amount of a child-support claim enforced in enforcement proceedings for the collection of child support.", "(8) Where in the cases specified in subsection (7) the amount of compensation is not enough to satisfy all the claims, first the child-support claim, then the civil claim and the indemnification or damages for infringement of personality rights awarded on account of the offence shall be satisfied in equal proportion.", "Section 10/B", "(1) The minister responsible for justice shall make arrangements for the payment of the compensation awarded.", "(2) In making the arrangements for the payment of the compensation, the minister responsible for justice shall, from the register kept by the office of the Hungarian Court Bailiffs\u2019 Organisation, request data on any child-support enforcement proceedings stayed or pending against the convict or person detained on other grounds, as well as the case number and the name of the bailiff with jurisdiction in the case.", "(3) Where the data received under subsection (2) or from the penitentiary judge indicate that enforcement proceedings for the collection of child support or for the satisfaction of a civil claim or for the payment of indemnification or damages for infringement of personality rights awarded against the inmate on account of the commission of the offence have been instituted, the minister responsible for justice shall inform the bailiff of the amount of compensation awarded to the debtor and the claims that may be satisfied from the compensation by way of debt collection. In such cases the compensation may, in line with Section 10/A(8), only be paid after the bailiff has taken the necessary enforcement measures for the attachment of the debt.", "(4) Where in his decision the penitentiary judge orders that a partly or fully unpaid civil claim or indemnification or damages for infringement of personality rights awarded on account of the committed offence are to be deducted and paid to the beneficiaries of such claims, the remaining compensation is to be paid to the convict or person detained on other grounds. Where the available data indicate that enforcement proceedings for the collection of child support have been instituted, the compensation may only be paid after the bailiff has, in line with Section 10/A(8), taken the necessary enforcement measures for the attachment of the child support Child support shall be collected primarily from the compensation payable to the convict or person detained on other grounds.", "(5) Payment may be effected via bank transfer to the bank account number given by the convict or person detained on other grounds or paid into the bank account of, or in cash to, the beneficiary of the indemnification or damages for infringement of personality rights awarded on account of the offence committed, in accordance with his or her request. Where the convict or person detained on other grounds is still detained, he may request that the compensation be transferred to a deposit account.", "(6) The minister responsible for justice may process personal data obtained under subsections (2)-(4) and being related to the enforcement of a child support claim or civil claim or indemnification or damages for a violation of personality rights awarded on account of the offence committed, for thirty days from the date of payment of the compensation.", "Compensation proceedings to redress damage resulting", "from conditions of detention violating fundamental rights", "Section 70/A", "(1) A decision on whether compensation is payable to an inmate for damage resulting from conditions of detention violating fundamental rights shall be taken by the penitentiary judge at the request of the inmate or his counsel.
