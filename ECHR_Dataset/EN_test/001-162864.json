The applicant, Ms Gabriele F\u00fcrst-Pfeifer, is an Austrian national who was born in 1964 and lives in M\u00f6dling. She is a psychiatrist and has been registered since the year 2000 as a psychological expert for court proceedings in custody and contact-rights-related disputes and decisions on public care as well as child abuse. Specialised in the psychological examination of children and adolescents, her focus is mainly on custody and contact-rights-related disputes.", "6. The online publication \u201cmeinbezirk.at\u201d was published and edited by the \u201cPrint\u201d Multimedia Company GmbH, a private company which had its registered office in St. P\u00f6lten.", "7. The regional weekly print publication Bezirksblatt, which was sent to every household of the district free, was published and edited by the \u201cPrint\u201d Zeitungsverlag GmbH, a private company which had its registered office in Innsbruck.", "8. On 23 December 2008 an article was published in \u201cmeinbezirk.at\u201d as well as in the print version of Bezirksblatt, which stated as follows:", "\u201cThe quality of experts in the spotlight (Gutachterqualit\u00e4t im Visier)", "Disclosed: Court Expert for custody proceedings a case for therapy", "(Aufgedeckt: N\u00d6 Sorgerechts-Sachverst\u00e4ndige selbst ein Therapie-Fall)", "Suffering from up-and-down mood swings, panic attacks, suicidal thoughts and hallucinations, together with paranoid ideas \u2013 but working as a court-appointed expert. In the last 12 years she has examined over 3.000 married couples in custodyrelated disputes. Now it seems, it gets rough for [the applicant] as an expert report about her psychological condition has been disclosed ...", "A psychological expert report by Dr. M. was commissioned in 1993 in the course of civil proceedings (action because of an alleged breach of promise of marriage) which unearthed the deficiencies of [the applicant] described above. Moreover, Dr. M. came to the conclusion that the applicant\u2019s impairments were hereditary, as the history of her family showed an accumulation of these impairments. Three years later, the applicant was introduced to the \u201cexpert community\u201d at the Wiener Neustadt Regional Court, and her integrity was beyond reproach for a decade \u2013 until now.\u201d", "9. The passage was followed by comments by a member of the Green Party, who had made a criminal complaint against the applicant with the Public Prosecutor\u2019s office, the Youth Advocate at the Regional Government of Lower Austria, and the Vice-President of the Wiener Neustadt Regional Court, who was responsible for managing the list of experts at the court. At the end of the article it was mentioned that the applicant was no longer answering her phone and had withdrawn from all her cases.", "10. As a result of the article the applicant was confronted with questions related to it from colleagues and patients, and proceedings were initiated at the Wiener Neustadt Regional Court to clarify whether she was still fit to work as a court-appointed expert. In the course of those proceedings the applicant\u2019s mental status was also set to be examined.", "11. On 14 January 2009 the applicant lodged an action with the St. P\u00f6lten Regional Court. She sought damages under section 8a of the Media Act (Mediengesetz) and the publication of the judgment claiming that the article and in particular the passages dealing with the psychological expert report on the applicant had violated her intimate personal sphere and compromised her publicly. However, she did not argue that the expert report had been obtained unlawfully.", "12. On 3 April 2009 the St. P\u00f6lten Regional Court (Landesgericht St. P\u00f6lten) allowed the applicant\u2019s action, ordered the publisher to pay damages in the amount of 5,000 euros (EUR) and the operative part of the judgment to be published. Furthermore, the publisher was to bear the costs of the proceedings. The court found that an average reader would understand the article as putting the expert opinion from 1993 in direct relation to the applicant\u2019s work as an expert now, thus questioning the quality of her work. The article, that also featured the applicant\u2019s full name and the description of her psychological impairment, touched her intimate personal sphere, since it created a link between her mental state and the quality of her work. However, the information itself did not allow for such a link, especially since the expert opinion dated from 1993 and dealt only with a very specific question in the context of civil proceedings at the time. The incomplete and manipulative content of the article was not able to meet the standards of reporting on matters of fact. Furthermore, the court did not consider that there was a direct link between the contents of the article and the applicant\u2019s public position, given that she mainly worked as an expert in custody cases, which were not usually heard in public. Furthermore, it could be assumed that the applicant, a psychiatrist herself and a medical doctor, was managing her illness well and was able to do her work without any impairments.", "13. The publisher appealed on points of law and fact, as well as against the sentence (Berufung wegen Nichtigkeit, Schuld und Strafe).", "14. Thereupon, on 30 November 2009, the Vienna Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht Wien) heard the appeal, set aside the judgment of the lower court, and dismissed the applicant\u2019s action. The Court of Appeal confirmed that the article and the impugned passages giving opinions on the applicant\u2019s mental state affected her intimate personal sphere and were capable of compromising her. However, the content of the article was true, as it only repeated true information that had not been disputed by the applicant. Furthermore, the court did not find the article to be incomplete or manipulative, but sufficiently well-balanced and faithful to the different sides of the story in that it also referred to the fact that the applicant\u2019s integrity had never been questioned in ten years; the court also asked for statements from the Vice-President of the Wiener Neustadt Regional Court, a member of the Green Party, and the Youth Advocate of the Regional Government of Lower Austria.", "15. The Court of Appeal further found that the publication in issue was directly linked to the applicant\u2019s public status. She had been included in the list of experts to be appointed by the courts since the year 2000 and had been appointed in several cases. This regular work as an expert in court proceedings belongs beyond doubt to the public sphere (\u201c...ist zweifellos dem \u00f6ffentlichen Leben zuzuordnen...\u201d) as she took part in association with the State-organised judiciary and held an important position in connection with the decision-making process of judges. Even though the impugned expert opinion dated from 1993 and concerned a period in the applicant\u2019s life prior even to that date, the reporting in question touched sufficiently upon the present public activities of the applicant. Considering the importance and sensitivity of the area of custody proceedings and the dominant role of experts in the field, the psychological integrity of an expert assigned to those cases had to be beyond doubt. Any reservation in relation to the mental health of experts \u2013 if based on sufficient reasons \u2013 had to be met with a thorough investigation in the interest of good conduct of the administration of justice, which was what had happened as the next step in the present case. According to the Court of Appeal, the article took up doubts arising from the neurologist opinion in 1993 without denying the applicant\u2019s abilities as an expert in the area. The truthful information in the article and the public interest in the subject matter justified the article\u2019s critical questioning of exactly those abilities.", "16. That judgment was served on the applicant\u2019s representative on 17 December 2009.", "17. In the meantime the applicant lodged an action with the Innsbruck Regional Court on 7 April 2009. She sought damages under section 8a of the Media Act (Mediengesetz) and publication of the judgment claiming that the article, and in particular the passages dealing with the psychological expert report on her, violated her intimate personal sphere and compromised her publicly.", "18. On 2 October 2009 the Innsbruck Regional Court (Landesgericht Innsbruck) granted the applicant\u2019s action, ordered the publisher to pay damages in the amount of 5,000 euros (EUR) and the publication of the operative part of the judgment. Furthermore, costs were awarded against the publisher. The court found that the average reader would understand the article as stating that the applicant was incapable of being an expert in custody proceedings because of her own mental health impairments in 1993 and that this placed in question the quality of the applicant\u2019s work so far. That the applicant\u2019s psychological illness was directly linked to the intimate personal sphere was beyond doubt. The present article not only mentioned the applicant\u2019s mental health status, but also grossly exaggerated individual symptoms, which was also capable of compromising her. The article was so incomplete and distorted that it could not be considered a report of matters of fact. The Regional Court in particular noted that the article did not mention that the period of examination was even earlier than 1993 and that only certain aspects of the expert opinion had been published, while others had not. Scandalously the article created the impression that the applicant had rendered decisive opinions in custody proceedings for over a decade while herself suffering from the symptoms described above. Furthermore, the publication was not linked in any way to the applicant\u2019s public status (\u201c...steht [...] in keinem unmittelbaren Zusammenhang mit dem \u00f6ffentlichen Leben der Antragstellerin\u201d). There was no connection between the applicant\u2019s work at present and her mental health status years ago. Her work in the context of custody proceedings was also not conducted in public.", "19. The publisher appealed on points of law and fact, as well as against the sentence (Berufung wegen Nichtigkeit, Schuld und Strafe).", "20. Thereupon, on 11 February 2010, the Innsbruck Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht Innsbruck) granted the appeal, set aside the judgment of the lower court, and dismissed the applicant\u2019s action. In contrast to the Regional Court it found that the average reader would understand from the article at issue that in 1993 an expert opinion was rendered in respect of the applicant that showed the above-mentioned psychological impairments. However, the article also stated that the applicant\u2019s integrity had not been questioned for over a decade. The article, while focusing on the applicant\u2019s work in custody proceedings, gave space to comments from the Youth Advocate of the Regional Government of Lower Austria, a member of the Green Party, and the Vice-President of the Wiener Neustadt Regional Court. The article did not indicate however that the applicant was not competent to exercise her profession as a psychological expert. Furthermore, the published information was true. The fact that only parts of the expert opinion were repeated in the article did not render the article distortive, nor the relevant information untrue.", "21. As regards the connection to the public sphere and public interest, the Court of Appeal found that the State administration, together with the administration of justice, belonged to the public sphere. The applicant had been included in the list of court-commissioned experts since the year 2000, and her repeated work as an expert in court proceedings must be considered as belonging to the public sphere. The activity was closely linked to the administration of justice, and had a considerable influence on judges\u2019 decision-making processes. The impugned article concerned the applicant\u2019s activity as an expert in custody proceedings. Considering the importance and sensitivity of the area of custody proceedings and the dominant role of experts in the field, the psychological integrity of an expert assigned to those cases had to be beyond doubt. Any reservation in relation to the mental health of experts \u2013 if based on sufficient reasons \u2013 had to be met with a thorough investigation in the interest of the proper administration of justice, which had happened as a next step in the present case. Insofar, a truthful report linked to a person\u2019s public status, which also contained information belonging to the intimate personal sphere must be permitted to be published. The Court of Appeal concluded that the article, by way of an appropriate commentary, critically examined a matter of public interest and therefore exercised its role as a \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d.", "22. That judgment was served on the applicant\u2019s representative on 11 March 2010."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
