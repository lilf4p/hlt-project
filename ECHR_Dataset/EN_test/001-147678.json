THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-1 - Deprivation of liberty)", "JUDGES": "George Nicolaou;Ineta Ziemele;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Nona Tsotsoria;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Paul Mahoney", "TEXT": ["5. The applicant was born in 1955 and is currently detained in HMP Whatton.", "6. On 25 April 2007 he received an indeterminate sentence for public protection (\u201cIPP sentence\u201d) following his conviction of the sexual assault of a fifteen-year old girl. The offence had been committed while the applicant was on licence in the community following his release from a sentence for indecent assault against girls under the age of sixteen and while he was undertaking the Sex Offender Treatment Programme (\u201cSOTP\u201d) in the community. A minimum term (\u201ctariff\u201d) of four years was fixed.", "7. The applicant was initially detained in HMP Armley. It was recommended in 2007 that he complete the SOTP.", "8. In June 2008 he was transferred to HMP Rye Hill. He completed an Enhanced Thinking Skills (\u201cETS\u201d) course in 2008 and the core SOTP on 8 March 2009. On an unknown date, he completed an Alcohol Awareness course.", "9. In August 2009 a Structured Assessment of Risk and Need (\u201cSARN\u201d) report identified that further work was required to reduce the applicant\u2019s risk of reoffending. It was recommended that he complete the extended SOTP and, possibly, a Better Lives Booster (\u201cBLB\u201d) programme. The extended SOTP consisted of seventy-four interactive sessions plus some individual work and generally lasted for around six months.", "10. At a Parole Board review on 7 September 2009 the Panel said that much offending work still had to be done in order to reduce the applicant\u2019s risk and that he should therefore remain in closed conditions.", "11. In September 2009 the applicant was transferred to HMP Acklington. He claims that he had been informed that the extended SOTP was available at that prison.", "12. A memo dated 24 August 2010 from the Programmes Department of HMP Acklington confirmed that the applicant had been assessed as suitable to attend the extended SOTP and that he would have to be transferred to another establishment to complete the course as it was not offered at HMP Acklington.", "13. On 27 August 2010 the applicant completed the Thinking Skills Programme (\u201cTSP\u201d) at HMP Acklington.", "14. In January 2011 a pre-tariff-expiry paper Parole Board review took place. By letter dated 24 February 2011 the applicant was informed that the Parole Board had not recommended his release. His request for an oral hearing was refused.", "15. The letter explained:", "\u201c... The [Intensive Case Management] decision provides a detailed account of the index offence and your previous offending record ... You are given credit for the offence related work you have undertaken but further work in the form of an Extended SOTP (and possible a BLB programme thereafter) is considered necessary to further address your risk factors ... It is clear that significant risk reducing work is required in closed conditions before you can progress further.\u201d", "16. By letter dated 6 April 2011 the National Offender Management Service informed the applicant that the Secretary of State agreed with the Parole Board recommendation. She considered that a number of risk factors were outstanding, namely sexual offending, feelings of grievance, distorted thinking, alcohol misuse and outbursts of anger. She was of the view that the extended SOTP was necessary to reduce the applicant\u2019s risk level. She also indicated that an assessment for the BLB programme was necessary following completion of the extended SOTP and recommended that the applicant continue addressing his alcohol misuse. The letter expressed the expectation that the relevant interventions, or other equivalent risk reduction work, would be completed prior to the next Parole Board review. It clarified, however, that the Secretary of State could not guarantee to place the applicant on the courses identified as there were limits on the availability of resources.", "17. The review period was set at twenty-one months and was made up the following: transfer to an establishment to undertake the extended SOTP; participation in the extended SOTP; participation in post-course reviews; consolidate and test the skills learned; continued development and practice of appropriate risk strategies; assessment for the BLB programme; continued monitoring of alcohol misuse and relapse prevention work if necessary. The review was scheduled to commence in March 2012 and conclude in November 2012, with an oral hearing in September.", "18. On 26 April 2011 the applicant\u2019s tariff period expired.", "19. The applicant sought advice on possible judicial review proceedings in respect of the delay in providing access to the extended SOTP. A letter was sent to HMP Acklington by his solicitors. On 22 September 2011 he was transferred to HMP Whatton.", "20. On 10 October 2011 the applicant requested information from HMP Whatton as to when he would begin the extended SOTP. He was informed in reply that he would be contacted to arrange an assessment as soon as possible.", "21. Meanwhile, the applicant\u2019s solicitors wrote to HMP Whatton seeking information on when he would be allowed to participate in the extended SOTP. By reply dated 28 October 2011, the deputy extended SOTP treatment manager explained:", "\u201cIn order that we can be responsive to the needs of Mr Dillon, it is essential that we allow him a period of settling in at HMP Whatton before an assessment for the Extended SOTP can take place.", "Assessments and placements are prioritised on a number of factors including tariff expiry, risk level and treatment readiness. However, please be assured that an assessment will take place as soon as practically possible.", "We anticipate delivering 4 Extended Programmes in 2012 and Mr Dillon will be considered for one of these programmes, if he is found suitable. The extended programme lasts 5 months. A SARN report will then have to be completed within 26 weeks of treatment being completed. The SARN report will identify any further treatment that is necessary.\u201d", "22. On 12 November 2011 the applicant indicated to HMP Whatton his concern that he might not be adequately prioritised for the extended SOTP, referring to the expectation that the course would be completed by his next Parole Board review. He requested confirmation that he would be prioritised for the extended SOTP.", "23. By reply dated 18 November 2011 he was informed that HMP Whatton made \u201cevery attempt to ensure prisoners are treated fairly and have access to offending behaviour programmes\u201d. However, the letter noted that there were limited resources and that there was a large number of IPP prisoners and life sentence prisoners at HMP Whatton whose tariffs had expired.", "24. On 6 January 2012 the applicant\u2019s solicitors wrote to the Governor of HMP Whatton to notify him of the fact that judicial review proceedings were being contemplated. They sought an undertaking that the applicant would be given access to an extended SOTP scheduled to begin in April 2012.", "25. On 19 January and 6 February 2012 the applicant was reassessed for participation in the extended SOTP. In a report dated 6 February 2012 he was found not to be sufficiently motivated to undertake the course. The report noted that the second meeting had had to be terminated on account of the applicant\u2019s use of abusive and disrespectful language and his loud and aggressive tone. It explained that while, given the applicant\u2019s tariff expiry date, he would have been prioritised for the April 2012 extended SOTP course, it was considered that he was not ready for secondary treatment at that time. It was recommended that the applicant complete individual work with his offender supervisor to consider, inter alia, the costs and benefits of engaging in the extended SOTP and to address his outstanding treatment needs. Further assessment would take place in June/July 2012.", "26. The applicant subsequently pursued a request for a place on an extended SOTP scheduled to commence in August 2012.", "27. On 13 June 2012 the Parole Board notified the applicant of its decision on the papers not to direct his release or to recommend his transfer to open conditions. The Parole Board set out the details of the index offence and noted that the applicant had committed the offence while on a three-year extended licence following another conviction for sexual offences (see paragraph 6 above). It considered that he had breached the trust placed in him and expressed concern that this might not bode well for the applicant\u2019s likely compliance with licence conditions. The Parole Board reiterated the applicant\u2019s risk factors and turned to examine the evidence of any change during sentence. It explained:", "\u201cYou completed the Core SOTP in 2009 and the Thinking Skills Programme in 2010. It was then recommended that you complete the Extended SOTP. Once this has been completed you will be assessed for other programmes such as the Better Lives Booster Programme and the Healthy Sexual Functioning Programme. You are reported to have attended for a programme assessment for the ESOTP at HMP Whatton but prison records state that this was a challenging meeting and that you were not sufficiently motivated to commence the group. You do not agree with this assessment. You will be offered the opportunity to attend for suitability assessment in the future. You have also been put forward for the CALM programme due to the violent offences on your record and difficulties in managing your emotions.\u201d", "28. The Parole Board agreed that the applicant posed a high risk of harm to children. It commended the applicant on his completion of the ETS and core SOTP. However, it concluded:", "\u201c... [T]here is a considerable amount of accredited offending behaviour work still recommended for you to complete to reduce your risks to a level that can be safely managed in less secure conditions. In the first instance it is recommended that you complete the Extended SOTP and CALM and that following the SARN you may need to be assessed for the Better Lives Booster Programme and Health Sexual Functioning Programme. Clearly this will take some considerable time and whilst core areas of risk remain unaddressed there is no merit in an oral hearing being held ...\u201d", "29. The applicant was reassessed for the extended SOTP in July 2012. He was found to be suitable to participate.", "30. In late July 2012 the applicant was informed that he was being considered for a place on an extended SOTP commencing in October 2012.", "31. The applicant completed the extended SOTP in March 2013. He was advised that a SARN report would be completed within the next six months to identify any further work that needed to be done. The SARN report was completed in March 2014."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
