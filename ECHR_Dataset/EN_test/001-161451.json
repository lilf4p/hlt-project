The applicant, Mr Mehmet Nuri Tan\u0131\u015f, is a Turkish national, who was born in 1975 and who is currently serving a prison sentence at the Bolu FType Prison. He is represented before the Court by Mr R. Demir, a lawyer practising in Istanbul.", "The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) are represented by their Agent.", "2. The events that gave rise to the present application are disputed between the parties. They will therefore be presented separately.", "3. On 31 October 2006 the applicant received a parcel at the Tekirda\u011f FType Prison (\u201cthe Tekirda\u011f Prison\u201d), where he was serving his sentence at the material time. As he was being taken to the parcel room by a prison guard, he greeted a fellow inmate in the corridor, without making any physical contact. The guard reacted to their brief interaction by mocking and insulting the applicant. The applicant did not respond to the guard.", "4. Once they reached the parcel room, the guard ordered the applicant to wait outside and the applicant complied. The guard then shouted at him to move further away from the door and to stand against the wall, following which he pushed the applicant forcefully against the wall. In response, the applicant told the guard that he had no right to touch him, at which point the guard allegedly started punching the applicant in the face and kicking his feet while shouting insults at him. Although the applicant restrained himself from hitting back and sought only to protect his face with his hands, the guard called on his colleagues to intervene, claiming that the applicant was attacking him. A number of other guards in the vicinity ran towards them and started hitting the applicant as well. The applicant stated that his inmate friend, M.\u00d6., and the prison governor, who were in the parcel room at the relevant time, had witnessed the events.", "5. After the applicant had collected his parcel, he was taken to single occupancy cell A-T-10, where he was \u201clynched\u201d by a group of guards, who also insulted and threatened him. The blows he received at that time left him with a broken nose, cuts to his lips, serious wounds on his knee, swellings of various sizes on different parts of his head and visible bruises on his eyes.", "6. The following day the applicant asked to be taken to the prison infirmary. The prison doctor examined him and made detailed notes. The applicant did not, however, see what the doctor\u2019s notes contained as he was not allowed to see the medical report.", "7. The Government\u2019s version of the events is based on the report prepared by three prison guards after the incident in question. The relevant parts of the report read as follows:", "\u201c... on 31 October 2006, while collecting his parcel, the detainee Mehmet Nuri Tan\u0131\u015f attempted to shake hands with and speak to another detainee who had received a parcel. This interaction was stopped by the officers and [the applicant] was told that such interaction and contact was not lawful. Nevertheless, the detainee did not change his attitude and [shouted]: \u2018... Who are you to interfere in my business? I will start proceedings against you, I will see you!\u2019 He was placed in cell no. A-T-10 for security reasons because he [had] continued his [insults], while also trying to kick and punch the officers ...\u201d", "8. On the following day, the applicant was taken to the prison infirmary for a medical examination in connection with the disciplinary proceedings that were to be instituted in respect of the incident. According to the medical report, dated 1 November 2006, the prison doctor had noted no signs of illtreatment on the applicant\u2019s body.", "9. On 1 November 2006 disciplinary proceedings were initiated against the applicant for his misbehaviour on 31 October 2006.", "10. On 3 November 2006 the applicant submitted his defence statement \u2013 containing the allegations subsequently submitted to the Court \u2013 to the Prison Disciplinary Board.", "11. On 6 November 2006 the applicant was punished with five days of solitary confinement by the Prison Disciplinary Board as a disciplinary sanction for having insulted and threatened prison officers. It was noted in the disciplinary decision that, contrary to the applicant\u2019s allegations of illtreatment by prison guards, the medical report issued shortly after the incident had not noted any injuries on the applicant\u2019s body.", "12. On 7 November 2006 the Prison Disciplinary Board\u2019s decision was served on the applicant.", "13. On 16 November 2006 the applicant objected to that decision.", "14. The applicant\u2019s objections were dismissed as groundless by the Tekirda\u011f Enforcement Judge and subsequently by the Tekirda\u011f Assize Court on 27 November and 11 December 2006 respectively.", "15. On 1 November 2006 the applicant lodged the following criminal complaint with the Tekirda\u011f public prosecutor, via the prison administration, against the prison guards who had allegedly ill-treated him:", "\u201cYesterday afternoon (on 31 October 2006) at approximately 3 p.m. I was taken out of my cell ... to collect a parcel. The officer who accompanied me insulted me for having said \u201chello\u201d to a friend passing by in the corridor ... I did not see the need to respond to him.", "Once we reached the parcel room, [the officer] told me to wait outside as there was someone else in the room [collecting a] parcel. I complied. He told me to move [and stand] by the door. I moved. He insisted that I stand near the wall ... and then pushed me against the wall.", "[In response] I said to him: \u2018Do not touch me; talk to me like a human being.\u2019 Upon my response, he ... started attacking me physically; he punched me in the face, and started kicking my foot. I then told him that he did not have the right to [use] physical force and that he could institute proceedings against me if I had done something wrong. I also told him that I would institute proceedings against him.", "Thereupon he said: \u2018Who are you to talk, to say that you will report me?\u2019, and started attacking me again. My only response was to protect my face ...", "But the \u2018officer\u2019 (I do not know his name but I can identify him) did not stop there; he distorted the situation by telling the other officers in the corridor [that I was] threatening and attacking him. Upon [hearing him] another officer also attacked me (he punched and kicked me). The other officers tried to stop the attackers.", "I was then taken to the parcel room, and after I had collected my parcel four or five officers took me not to my own cell but to a small room. They insulted me ... and tried to provoke me ... They then put me in an individual cell (TEK 10).", "...After they had brought my belongings to me in the [individual] cell, four or five officers attacked me physically in the cell. For a few minutes these four or five officers punched and kicked me.", "They also threatened me and said: \u2018we\u2019ll show you\u2019, \u2018you are done\u2019, and \u2018we will destroy you\u2019. They also said: \u2018this is how we start proceedings\u2019, and left.", "I have thus been subjected to torture, physical attacks and insults.", "...", "In short, I am not safe here ... A new round of torture may be imminent if no precautions are taken.", "...", "[I therefore request]:", "...", "- The identification of the relevant individuals, the institution of legal proceedings against them, and their punishment, as necessary...\u201d", "16. On 3 November 2006 the governor of the Tekirda\u011f Prison forwarded the applicant\u2019s criminal complaint to the Tekirda\u011f public prosecutor, along with his medical report (dated 1 November 2006), statements taken from three prison guards after the incident, and two incident reports. The governor also informed the public prosecutor that administrative proceedings in respect of the incident had been instituted.", "17. On 27 November 2006 the Tekirda\u011f public prosecutor requested information from the Tekirda\u011f Prison administration regarding the outcome of the administrative proceedings instituted in respect of the incident of 31 October 2006. On 4 December 2006 the Tekirda\u011f Prison administration furnished the public prosecutor with the information requested.", "18. On 29 December 2006 the applicant made the following statement to the Tekirda\u011f public prosecutor:", "\u201cAs I have already explained in my criminal complaint, on 31 October 2006 I was taken to the parcel room to collect my parcel ... As I was waiting outside the parcel room, the ... officer standing next to me told me to lean against the wall ... I told him: \u2018do not touch me! I will do what is necessary if you tell me like a human being.\u2019 He then attacked me and called on the other officers [to help] as he was being attacked [by me]. They arrived and one of them [joined] the officer who had attacked me while the others separated us. After I had collected my parcel, they took me to room no. Atek-10, where they beat me ... I saw the doctor on 1 November 2006 in relation to this incident. The doctor examined me and saw my injuries. I do not understand why [he then] reported no signs of blows. I have lodged a separate complaint; I would also like to complain about the doctor. The prison governor was also there at the time of the event but he did not intervene ... therefore, I am also making a complaint against him.\u201d", "19. On 22 and 24 January 2007 the public prosecutor took statements from the prison governor and the two prison guards who had allegedly been involved in the incident. They all stated that the applicant had not been beaten up as alleged but had only been warned orally not to interact with another detainee and had then been restrained when he had started attacking one of them. They stated that had the applicant been ill-treated in any way, this would have been determined by the medical examination to which he had been subjected shortly after the alleged incident.", "20. On 24 January 2007 the public prosecutor took a statement from the doctor who had examined the applicant on 1 November 2006. The doctor, who worked at the Tekirda\u011f State Hospital but who had been on temporary duty at the Tekirda\u011f F-Type Prison at the relevant time, made the following statement:", "\u201c... [He] was brought to the prison infirmary by the prison officers. He said that he had been beaten up and requested a report. I examined the individual but there were no signs of beating or the use of force on his body. I prepared my report accordingly. He showed me where he had allegedly been hit but I did not see any [injuries]. I [do] not understand why he lodged a complaint against me. I carried out my duty in accordance with the law. I do not accept the accusations against me.\u201d", "21. On the same day, the Tekirda\u011f public prosecutor decided not to prosecute the prison officers and the doctor. The public prosecutor found that, contrary to his allegations, the applicant had not been assaulted by the prison guards on the day in question but had only been warned a number of times to stop interacting with other inmates while waiting outside the parcel room. Instead of complying with these orders, the applicant had threatened and attempted to attack the guards. On account of his rowdy behaviour he had been placed in a single-person cell for security reasons. The doctor who had examined him the next day had moreover noted no signs of physical violence on the applicant\u2019s body. The public prosecutor highlighted in this connection that he had questioned the prison doctor in relation to the applicant\u2019s allegations and that the doctor had testified to the accuracy of his medical findings and had denied the applicant\u2019s accusations. Lastly, the public prosecutor referred to the outcome of the disciplinary investigation instituted against the prison guards involved in the incident (see paragraph 25 below for details), which had found that the guards had acted lawfully. In the light of the evidence before him, the public prosecutor concluded that the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment were unfounded.", "22. On 19 February 2007 the applicant lodged an objection with the \u00c7orlu Assize Court against the decision of the Tekirda\u011f public prosecutor. He argued that the public prosecutor had failed to establish the facts accurately and had, in particular, not examined with sufficient care his allegations of ill-treatment in cell no. A-T-10. A review of the footage from the surveillance cameras in the corridors would have verified the accuracy of his allegations. He further maintained that the prison doctor had initially noted the injuries on his body, lips and eyes, but that he might have subsequently changed his medical report under duress from the prison authorities.", "23. On 13 March 2007 the \u00c7orlu Assize Court requested the relevant investigation file from the Tekirda\u011f public prosecutor in order to be able proceed with the examination of the applicant\u2019s objection. On 10 September 2007 the Assize Court repeated its request.", "24. On 2 October 2007, following the receipt of the investigation file, the \u00c7orlu Assize Court upheld the Tekirda\u011f public prosecutor\u2019s decision not to prosecute on the basis of the contents of the investigation file and the reasoning in that decision, and dismissed the applicant\u2019s objection.", "25. In the meantime, disciplinary proceedings were also instituted against the prison guards. However, on the basis of the statements given by the relevant guards and the applicant\u2019s medical report dated 1 November 2006, the Prison Disciplinary Board decided on 22 November 2006 that the officers had acted in accordance with the law and that they had not committed any wrongdoings.", "26. On 17 May 2006 the applicant was diagnosed with acute sinusitis by the Tekirda\u011f Prison doctor and was prescribed medication to ease his breathing difficulties.", "27. On 1 December 2006, prior to the execution of his disciplinary sanction, the applicant was subjected to a general medical check. The prison doctor who examined the applicant noted that his breathing and heartbeat were normal, that his blood pressure was 12/7, and that he was medically fit to serve his sanction.", "28. On 26 June 2007 the applicant was once again examined by the prison doctor and given different medicine to provide relief for nasal congestion.", "29. On 15 January 2008 the applicant was prescribed new medication for acute sinusitis. The prison doctor also asked for him to be referred for further examination to the ear, nose and throat clinic at the Tekirda\u011f State Hospital.", "30. On 17 January 2008 the applicant was examined at the ear, nose and throat clinic at the Tekirda\u011f State Hospital, where he was prescribed a different nasal spray.", "31. Apart from the examinations noted below, the applicant was admitted to the Tekirda\u011f Prison infirmary on fifteen other occasions between 25 December 2003 and 26 June 2007, all at his request, with complaints such as vitamin deficiency, constipation, nausea, fatigue, gastritis and nail fungus.", "32. It appears that on 2 February 2008 the applicant was transferred from the Tekirda\u011f F-Type Prison to the Bolu F-Type Prison. On the same day, the applicant was subjected to a medical examination, during which no injuries were noted on his body. The medical report, which bore the applicant\u2019s signature, did not refer to any health complaints made by the applicant, and only mentioned that he suffered from sinusitis.", "33. Documents submitted by the Government reveal that between 4 February 2008 and 28 October 2013 the applicant underwent some sixtyfive medical examinations, all at his request, at the Bolu F-Type Prison infirmary in relation to various health complaints, mostly concerning his dermatological and eye problems. Between the same dates, he was referred to the Bolu \u0130zzet Baysal State Hospital on at least twelve occasions in relation to the same problems."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
