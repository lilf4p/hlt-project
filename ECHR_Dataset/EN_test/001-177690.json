The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Sofia.", "6. The applicant is a former police officer. Criminal proceedings were brought against him in 1996.", "7. By a decision of the competent prosecutor of 6 March 1996, as provided under domestic law at the time, the applicant was placed under house arrest. The period of arrest continued until 3 April 1996, when the applicant was remanded in custody. He was once again placed under house arrest on 1 July 1996 and was released on 30 September 1997.", "8. The applicant therefore was deprived of his liberty for one year, six months and twenty-five days.", "9. In a final judgment of 27 January 1998 the Sofia Military Court found the applicant guilty of failing to perform his duties and he was given a oneyear suspended prison sentence.", "10. In another set of proceedings, in a final judgment of 26 March 2003 the Supreme Court of Cassation convicted the applicant of fraud and sentenced him to one year of imprisonment.", "11. The court also held in the second set of proceedings that the applicant should serve a single sentence for all his offences, which was set at one year in prison.", "12. On 1 July 2003 the applicant was once again detained and placed in prison to serve his sentence. He was released on 18 September 2003 by a decision of the competent prosecutor. The prosecutor noted that the period of pre-trial detention should have been deducted from the applicant\u2019s sentence, which meant he had already served it.", "13. As he had worked in prison the applicant was also entitled to a reduction of his sentence by seventeen days.", "14. In 2004 the applicant brought a tort action against the prosecution authorities under section 2(6) of the State and Municipalities\u2019 Responsibility for Damage Act (see paragraph 21 below). He claimed 20,000 Bulgarian levs (BGN) for non-pecuniary damage for his detention in 1996-97 to the extent it had exceeded the set term of imprisonment and BGN 40,000 for his imprisonment between 1 July and 18 September 2003.", "15. The domestic courts examined witnesses and a court-appointed psychologist who said that the applicant had been traumatised by the experience and suffered from anxiety, that his personality had been \u201cpermanently altered\u201d, that he had difficulties communicating with others, and that his family ties had been \u201cirreparably damaged\u201d.", "16. In a judgment of 2 May 2006 the Sofia City Court (hereinafter \u201cthe City Court\u201d) allowed the claim in part, finding that the applicant had been detained for nine months and twenty-nine days in excess of his sentence and awarding him BGN 10,000 for non-pecuniary damage. It stated that his detention in 1996-97 had been \u201cunjustified\u201d and that his imprisonment in 2003 had amounted to \u201cunlawful detention without any valid grounds\u201d.", "17. In accordance with the applicable provisions of domestic law, the City Court ordered the applicant to pay BGN 2,040 (the equivalent of 1,040 euros \u2013 EUR) in court fees, calculated as a pro rata percentage of the part of his claim that had been dismissed.", "18. The judgment was upheld on 18 June 2007 by the Sofia Court of Appeal (hereinafter \u201cthe Court of Appeal\u201d), which specified that the prosecution authorities were also liable to pay default interest on the above amount, calculated from 18 September 2003.", "19. In a final judgment of 24 April 2009 the Supreme Court of Cassation reduced the award to BGN 3,000 (approximately EUR 1,530), plus default interest. It justified the reduction by referring to the \u201cnature of the offences\u201d the applicant had been convicted for, the \u201cregime under which the sentence had been served\u201d and the \u201csocially acceptable criteria for justice\u201d. It did not deal with the matter of court fees and took no separate decision in that regard.", "20. The Court has not been informed whether and when the amount above was paid to the applicant. Calculations made with a calculator available on the Internet show that the default interest on BGN 3,000 for the period from 18 September 2003 to 24 April 2009 would be BGN 2,265 (the equivalent of EUR 1,155)."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
