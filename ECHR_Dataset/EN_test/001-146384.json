At a plenary session on 30 April 2013, during a pre-agenda speech, Mr Kar\u00e1csony and Mr Szil\u00e1gyi showed a billboard in the session hall displaying the text \u201cFIDESZ [the party on government].

The Speaker proposed that the maximum fine as regards Mr Szil\u00e1gyi (a third of his monthly remuneration) be applied, since he was an elected official of Parliament, not just an ordinary MP.", "A decision approving the proposal of the Speaker was adopted by the plenary on 13 May 2013, without a debate.", "10. On 21 May 2013 during the final vote on Bill no. T/10881 Mr Dorosz and Ms Szab\u00f3 presented a billboard with the text \u201cHere Operates the National Tobacco Mafia\u201d.", "11.

XXXVI of 2012 on Parliament.

A constitutional complaint was filed, concerning a sanction for disruptive conduct, by MP E.N., a member of the opposition party Jobbik, and rejected by the Constitutional Court on 4 November 2013 (decision nos. 3206/2013.

XXXVI of 2012 on Parliament. It held in particular that the restrictions imposed on him for conduct falling under the above provisions \u2013 that is, \u201cgravely offensive expression\u201d \u2013 were in compliance with the Fundamental Law. His complaint in respect of section 49(4) was rejected because this provision, concerning \u201cgravely offensive conduct\u201d, was not applicable in that case.", "The Constitutional Court went on to observe that there was no remedy available to that complainant against the measure.", "Lastly, the Constitutional Court held that parliamentary disciplinary law concerned Parliament\u2019s interior business and the MPs\u2019 conduct as parliamentarians, rather than citizens\u2019 rights or obligations; and that therefore no requirement of a remedy against a parliamentary disciplinary measure could be deduced from Article XXVIII(7) of the Fundamental Law."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10", "13"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
