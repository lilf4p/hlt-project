On the latter day he was transferred to Celje prison. He stayed there until 9 December 2009, when he was further transferred to Ljubljana prison, the Section Novo mesto (the Section Novo mesto). The applicant\u2019s complaints do not relate to the conditions of detention in Celje prison.", "7. In the period between 1 July 2009 and 23 September 2009 the applicant was held in the closed section of Ljubljana prison. From 1 July 2009 to 13 July 2009 he was held in cell 7 (third floor) measuring 16.8 square metres (including a separate 1.72 square metre sanitary facility). From 13 July 2009 to 17 July 2009 he was held in cell 4 (third floor) measuring 18 square metres (including a separate 1.72 square metre sanitary facility).

All the cells in the closed and semi-open sections contained, apart from the furniture, five sleeping places (two bunk beds and one single bed). According to the applicant, five prisoners were being held in each of the cells during his detention. The Government, however, submitted that the number varied between four and five. Each cell had one 107 x 110 cm double casement window, which the prisoners could freely open or close.", "10. As regards the general characteristics of the cells in the closed and semi-open sections, material conditions inside the cells therein, sanitary conditions and health care, see the judgment in \u0160trucl and Others v.

As to the out-of-cell time in the closed section, the Court found in the aforementioned judgment that sentenced prisoners in the closed section of the prison were locked up in their cells and were only able to leave them if they applied for certain activities, most of which were to take place in the recreation room. There was, however, only one 50square-metre recreation room per floor, which was to be used by ten inmates at most (\u0160trucl and Others \u00a7 86).", "12. As to the out-of-cell time in the semi-open section, the Government submitted that the cell doors in the semi-open section of the prison were unlocked, except from 9.45 p.m. (on Fridays, Saturdays and before holidays from midnight) until 6.00 a.m. (on Saturdays, Sundays and during holidays until 8.30 a.m.). During this time prisoners could move freely in the corridor (35.7 square metres), living quarters of co-prisoners or in the indoor or outdoor exercise areas, in accordance with prison rules. The Government alleged that this regime had been in place for several years.
