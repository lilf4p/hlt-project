The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Saransk.", "6. In 2005 the applicant brought civil proceedings against the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Mordoviya (\u201cthe Ministry\u201d) seeking compensation for damage to his health caused during his service in the police (\u201cthe compensation\u201d).", "7. On 7 November 2005 the Leninskiy District Court of Saransk (\u201cthe District Court\u201d) found in the applicant\u2019s favour and ordered the Ministry: (a) to pay the applicant the compensation due to him for the period from 19 November 2004 to 31 October 2005 in the amount of 77,250.12 Russian roubles (RUB); and (b) starting from 1 November 2005, to make monthly compensation payments to the applicant of RUB 6,892.92 with subsequent indexation in accordance with the law. The judgment was not appealed against and became final on 22 November 2005.", "8. However, on 12 October 2006, following a request lodged by the Ministry, the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Mordoviya (\u201cthe Presidium\u201d) quashed the final judgment by way of supervisory review and dismissed the applicant\u2019s claims. The Presidium found that the firstinstance court had erroneously applied and interpreted substantive legal provisions which had resulted in their significant violation. The Presidium held that there was no basis under domestic law for awarding the applicant the compensation sought and that he was entitled instead to insurance payments. The applicant did not provide the Court with information as to whether he had applied for those payments and/or was receiving them.", "9. The District Court\u2019s judgment of 7 November 2005 had been duly enforced until it was quashed by way of supervisory review."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
