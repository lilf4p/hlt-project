The applicant, Magyar Helsinki Bizotts\u00e1g (Hungarian Helsinki Committee), is a non-governmental organisation (NGO) that was founded in 1989. It monitors the implementation of international human-rights standards in Hungary, provides legal representation to victims of alleged human-rights abuses and promotes legal education and training both in Hungary and abroad. Its main areas of activity are protecting the rights of asylum seekers and foreigners in need of international protection, and monitoring the human-rights performance of law-enforcement agencies and the judicial system. In particular, it focuses on access to justice, conditions of detention, and the effective enforcement of the right to defence.", "11. Between 2005 and 2007 the applicant NGO conducted a project \u201cModel Legal Aid Board Programme\u201d aimed at developing and testing a model to overcome shortcomings in the system for the ex officio appointment of defence counsel. The study summarising the outcome of the project was published in 2007 under the title \u201cWithout Defence\u201d, suggesting that there should be a standard set of criteria developed to assess the quality of defence counsel\u2019s work.", "12. In 2008, as a follow-up to its 2005-2007 survey, the applicant NGO launched a new project entitled \u201cThe Right to Effective Defence and the Reform of the ex-Officio Appointment System\u201d. Together with the Ministry of Justice and Law Enforcement and various bar associations, the applicant NGO developed a questionnaire aimed at evaluating the performance of defence counsel. It also assessed the quality of legal representation provided by ex officio appointed and retained defence counsel, by examining the case files in 150 closed criminal cases. In parallel, the applicant NGO made a contribution in respect of Hungary to the comparative research project \u201cEffective Defence Rights in the European Union and Access to Justice: Investigating and Promoting Best Practices\u201d carried out in nine European countries and funded by the European Commission and the Open Society Justice Initiative.", "The results of the two projects were presented at a conference in April 2009, the conclusions of which were summarised in the report \u201cIn the Shadow of Suspicion: A critical account of enforcing the right to an effective defence\u201d.", "13. In addition, the applicant NGO carried out continuous advocacy activities for reform of the ex officio appointments system; in cooperation with the Budapest Bar Association, it also drew up recommendations for a proposed code of professional ethics for ex officio defence counsel.", "14. In the applicant NGO\u2019s assessment, its research showed that the system of ex officio appointed defenders did not operate adequately, essentially because the investigative authorities, in particular the police, were free to choose defence counsel from a list compiled by the relevant bar associations. This gave rise to distrust on the part of defendants. Furthermore, according to the applicant NGO\u2019s findings, many police departments had recourse to the same lawyers or law firms in the majority of cases, resulting in defence counsels\u2019 dependency on ex officio appointments to earn their living. The applicant NGO also concluded that the selection system lacked transparency.", "15. In 2009, in the framework of the project \u201cSteps Towards a Transparent Appointment System in Criminal Legal Aid\u201d, an experimental method was put in place, in cooperation with the applicant NGO, the county bar associations and certain county police departments. A key facet of this method was replacement of the existing system of discretionary appointments by a randomised computer-generated one.", "16. As a feature of the project, the applicant NGO requested the names of the public defenders selected in 2008 and the number of assignments given to each lawyer from a total of twenty-eight police departments, situated in the seven Hungarian regions. The aim of the data request was to demonstrate whether there existed discrepancies in police departments\u2019 practice in appointing defence counsel from the lists provided by the bar associations. These requests were made under section 20 (1) of Act no. LXIII of 1992 (\u201cthe Data Act\u201d). The applicant NGO maintained that the number of defence counsel appointments was public-interest data (k\u00f6z\u00e9rdek\u0171 adat) and that thus the names of defence counsel were data subject to disclosure in the public interest (k\u00f6z\u00e9rdekb\u0151l nyilv\u00e1nos adat).", "17. Seventeen police departments complied with the request; a further five police departments disclosed the requested information following a successful legal challenge by the applicant NGO.", "18. On 18 August 2009 the applicant NGO addressed the same request to the Hajd\u00fa-Bihar County Police Department, seeking access to information concerning the names of defence counsel appointed in the police department\u2019s area of jurisdiction and the number of appointments given to each defence counsel.", "19. In its response of 26 August 2009 the Hajd\u00fa-Bihar County Police Department refused the applicant NGO\u2019s request, stating that \u201cthe names of the defence counsel are not public-interest data nor information subject to disclosure in the public interest under section 19(4) of the Data Act, since defence counsel are not members of a body performing State, municipal or public duties. Thus their names constitute private data, which are not to be disclosed under the law\u201d. The police department also referred to the disproportionate burden the provision of the data would impose on it.", "20. A similar request by the applicant NGO was rejected by the Debrecen Police Department on 27 August 2009.", "21. On 25 September 2009 the applicant NGO brought an action against these two police departments, arguing that ex officio defence counsel performed a duty in the interest of the public which was financed from public funds. Data concerning them thus qualified as information subject to disclosure in the public interest.", "22. In its counter-claim, the Hajd\u00fa-Bihar County Police Department maintained its view that the names of defence counsel constituted personal data rather than information subject to disclosure in the public interest, since they neither carried out their tasks within the scope of the duties and competences of the police departments, nor were they members of those bodies. It further maintained that processing the data requested by the applicant NGO would entail a prohibitive workload.", "23. The Debrecen Police Department requested the discontinuation of the proceedings.", "24. The Debrecen District Court joined the two cases. On 21 October 2009 the District Court found for the applicant NGO, ordering the respondents to release the relevant information within 60 days.", "25. The court found that although defence counsel did not qualify as persons performing public duties, they were also not employees or agents of the respondent police departments, and the question whether defence was an activity of a public-interest nature was a matter which should be assessed with reference to its aim and role. Referring to Article 46 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on mandatory defence and to Article 48 of the same Code on the investigative authorities\u2019 duty to appoint defence counsel under certain conditions, the court observed that the duties of the investigative authorities also included giving effect to the constitutional right to defence. The court concluded that measures concerning the exercise of mandatory defence qualified as public-interest activities, and any related data were of great importance for society and were not to be considered as a matter of personality rights or subject to the protection of private interests. The names of defence counsel and the number of their respective appointments did not therefore constitute information of a private nature, in relation to which disclosure would only be possible with the approval of the person concerned. The court went on to state that, given the public-interest nature of mandatory defence, the interest in informing society seemed to be stronger than the need to protect privacy, which in any case was not infringed since the role of defence counsel was public from the moment of indictment. The court ordered the respondents to surrender the information requested.", "26. Both police departments appealed, reiterating in essence their argument that the names and number of appointments of defence counsel did not represent information subject to disclosure in the public interest, but personal data, since those persons did not perform State, municipal or public duties. They also maintained that the transfer of the requested information would cause an undue burden.", "27. In its judgment of 23 February 2010, the Hajd\u00fa-Bihar County Regional Court, acting as a second-instance court, overturned the firstinstance judgment and dismissed the applicant NGO\u2019s claim in its entirety. The court rejected the applicant NGO\u2019s argument that ex officio defence counsel exercised public functions within the meaning of the Data Act. In the court\u2019s view, the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure relied on by the applicant NGO provided for equal recognition before the law and for the right to defence and imposed a duty on the State to ensure these rights. However, the provisions did not prescribe that the activities of ex officio defence counsel were public duties, irrespective of the fact that they were financed by the State. The court held that the duty of the police to appoint defence counsel in certain cases was to be distinguished from the latter\u2019s activities. It noted that personal data could only be processed under section 5(1) of the Data Act for a well-defined purpose in the exercise of a right or in fulfilment of an obligation, and that personal data processed by the police departments could only be transferred with the permission of the person concerned.", "28. The applicant NGO sought review of the second-instance judgment, maintaining that although the names of the defence counsel and the number of their respective appointments were personal data, this was nevertheless information subject to disclosure in the public interest as being related to the public duties carried out by ex officio defence counsel.", "29. The Supreme Court dismissed the applicant NGO\u2019s petition for review on 15 September 2010. It upheld the Regional Court\u2019s judgment in substance, partly modifying its reasoning.", "30. The Supreme Court held as follows:", "\u201c... [W]hat needs to be examined is whether defence counsel are to be considered \u2018other persons performing public duties\u2019. The Supreme Court considers, in compliance with Recommendation no. 1234/H/2006 of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Data Protection, that the question of whether an individual was a person performing public duties has to be determined solely on the basis of the provisions of the Data Act. Only a person vested with independent powers and competences is to be considered a person performing public duties.", "In answering this question [of interpretation of the notion of \u2018persons performing public duties\u2019], the applicant\u2019s argument concerning Article 137(2) of the Criminal Code is irrelevant, since that provision only prescribes that defence counsel were to be regarded as persons performing public duties for the purposes of the Criminal Code itself, but not for the purposes of the Data Act or for any other legal relationship.", "Under Article 57 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution, the State has a duty to secure the right to defence. The courts, the prosecution services and the investigative authorities perform this task by, in particular, ensuring the right to defence (Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure) and by appointing defence counsel when required under Articles 46 and 48 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In so doing, these bodies accomplish their public duties, which are thus terminated with the appointment of defence counsel. Following his or her appointment, a defence counsel\u2019s activities constitute private activities although they are performed in pursuance of a public goal.", "The court has thus found that defence counsel cannot be regarded as \u2018other persons performing public duties\u2019, since no powers or competences defined by law are vested in them. The mere fact that procedural laws specify rights and obligations in respect of persons performing the task of defence counsel in criminal proceedings cannot be interpreted as constituting powers and competences defined by law. In respect of the right to defence, the Code of Criminal Procedure prescribes obligations only for authorities, not for defence counsel. The wording of Article 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which states that prosecution, defence and adjudication are separate tasks, also supports this view.", "Thus, the names and number of appointments of defence counsel constitute personal data under section 2(1) of the Data Act. Accordingly, under section 19(4) of the Data Act, the respondent police departments cannot be obliged to surrender such personal data. It follows that the second-instance court was right to dismiss the applicant\u2019s action.\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
