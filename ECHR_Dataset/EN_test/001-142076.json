On 12 May 2003 an identification parade took place in the presence of two attesting witnesses.

In March 2003 he had been asked to drive D. in exchange for payment. Zh. and My. had been with them. They had stopped near a building. Everybody except the applicant had left the car. The applicant stated that he had slept in the car for a night and a day. Then D., Zh. and two unknown persons had driven \u201cto the garages\u201d. Everybody had left and he had stayed in the car.

M. and M.L. testified that they had seen four or five persons break into the house that night. They had tied M.L. up and had taken money. M. had been severely beaten by D.

In this finding, the court referred to various pieces of evidence, including the record of the reconstruction of events where Zh. explained how he, D., P., L. and the applicant had committed a robbery; the record of the identification parades in which M., M.G. and M.L. had recognised the applicant; and the conclusion of the forensic examination of tyre tracks found near M.\u2019s house, which matched the applicant\u2019s car.", "22. In respect of the applicant\u2019s punishment, the court noted that the applicant was young, had positive character traits, and it was the first crime he had committed; however, his guilt had been aggravated by the fact that he was transporting criminals to and from the place of the crime.", "23. The applicant\u2019s lawyer appealed against that decision. In her appeal she stated that the applicant had been ill-treated and had pleaded guilty under physical pressure. The applicant had been paid by D. to drive him and the others. As the applicant had been drunk, D. had driven the car himself. The applicant had remained in the car all the time. The applicant\u2019s dog had also been in the car as the applicant had initially been taking him to an acquaintance to have him mated. Once there, he had been asked to drive D. The applicant\u2019s lawyer also noted that during the investigation stage the victims had given contradictory statements as to whether they had seen their aggressors. Moreover, the identification parade had been carried out in the absence of a lawyer.", "24. On 18 August 2005 the Poltava Regional Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. The court held that the applicant\u2019s guilt was confirmed by the testimony of D. and Zh. given during the pre-trial investigation in the presence of their lawyers. The court also noted that the applicant\u2019s complaints of ill-treatment were unsubstantiated and that the separate ruling adopted on 9 November 2004 (see paragraph 36 below) had been quashed accordingly.", "25. On 23 February 2006 the Supreme Court of Ukraine rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal in cassation.

The applicant stated that police officers had beaten him in Kyiv and on 7 May 2003 in Pyryatyn. They had hit him with a book on the head, punched him, threatened him with murder and rape, and put a gas mask over his face and blown cigarette smoke into it. After being severely beaten he had been forced to confess.", "27. On an unspecified date the applicant made a complaint about this illtreatment.", "28. The case-file materials contain references to an expert forensic medical examination performed on 12 September 2003 (the applicant stated that it was performed on 12 May 2003 following his complaint lodged on 9 May 2003). According to the references, the expert concluded that the applicant had minor bodily injuries which could have been caused by \u201citems in his surroundings\u201d (\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u043e\u0442\u043e\u0447\u0443\u044e\u0447\u043e\u0457 \u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0438).

On 29 October 2003 an investigative officer of the Pyryatynskyy District Prosecutor\u2019s Office issued a decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings following the applicant\u2019s complaints of ill-treatment. Several police officers had been questioned. They had testified that the applicant had confessed his guilt and that nobody had ill-treated him. The prosecutor also referred to the forensic medical examination report of 12 September 2003.", "30. On 2 April 2004 that decision was quashed by another prosecutor of the same prosecutor\u2019s office. It was noted that not all of the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s complaint had been looked into. In particular, it should have been ascertained why the applicant had been arrested in Kyiv, and under what circumstances he had sustained the bodily injuries; his medical documents should have been studied and his complaints should have been carefully examined.", "31. On 29 April 2004 the Pyryatynskyy District Prosecutor\u2019s Office refused to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers. The decision was similar to the one of 29 October 2003.", "32. On 10 June 2004 the Pyryatynskyy District Court quashed that decision and ordered an additional investigation.

The rest of the decision was similar to the one of 29 October 2003.", "34. On 10 September 2004 the court quashed that decision and remitted the case for additional investigation.

The court stated that the applicant had been unlawfully transported from Kyiv to Pyryatyn and that, according to the forensic medical report, he had had three bruises on his chest from being punched.", "37. On 20 May 2005 the Poltava Regional Court of Appeal adopted another separate ruling in which it requested the Poltava Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office to examine the applicant\u2019s complaints of ill-treatment. The court noted that according to the conclusions of the forensic medical examination of the convicted persons, they had bodily injuries which could have been inflicted on the date and under the circumstances described by them. However, the court did not indicate whether the persons concerned included the applicant. The court also noted that the applicant had made a note on the decision ordering his arrest of 9 May 2003 that he had been illtreated on 7 May 2003. The court further noted that on 11 June 2003 the applicant had complained about ill-treatment, but the case-file contained no response to that complaint.", "38.
