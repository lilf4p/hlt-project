On 10 September 1999 the Prevention of Terrorism Unit in the Criminal Justice Section of the Sisak County Police (Policijska uprava sisa\u010dko-moslava\u010dka, Odjel kriminalisti\u010dke policije, Odsjek za suzbijanje terorizma, hereinafter \u201cthe Sisak Police Prevention of Terrorism Unit\u201d) interviewed a certain S.K.

In addition, about five hundred persons of Serbian origin were listed as having disappeared.

On 24 December 2002 an investigating judge at the Sisak County Court heard evidence from witness M.M., who said that in 1991 he had been a member of the reserve police. One night he had been driving in a car with three of his colleagues (he identified them by their nicknames) when they saw a van parked in the street and several men dressed in camouflage uniforms standing around it. M.M. and his colleagues asked those men what was happening and were told that they had come \u201cto search the house of a Serb who had some hunting weapons\u201d. One of the men took off his balaclava and M.M. recognised him as [A.]H. He also saw an older woman crying and wailing, and asking the men to release the man they were taking with them. M.M. and his friends had then driven away. Later he heard that the man who had been taken away was Vaso Jeli\u0107; he had been taken to Jodno, a sanatorium where Croatian troops were stationed at the material time, opposite the Siscia factory. He had received that information from a person called G., who also told him that Vaso Jeli\u0107 had been liquidated and thrown in the river Kupa.", "18. M.M. further explained that one night he noticed that several persons were being held in the toilet of the ORA military base near Sisak, where he was stationed. Next to the toilet he saw three bodies covered with a blanket. He asked some of his colleagues to give him a lift in their van from the military base to Sisak. They had stopped before arriving in Sisak and thrown three bodies, covered in blankets, into a hole. He had later met all of the men who had been in the van with him in Sisak, but did not know their names. He had been told not to tell anyone.", "19.

On 26 March 2003 the Sisak Police interviewed an anonymous witness who gave information about the killings of persons of Serbian origin in the Sisak area in 1991 and 1992. He said that the arrests and killings of persons of Serbian ethnic origin had been carried out on the orders of \u0110.B., Head of the Sisak Police, who had a list of persons to be arrested and liquidated. His main assistant was his Deputy, V.M. The motive for the arrests had often been material gain. The individuals in question had first been labelled as having abetted enemy activity and being members of the Serbian Democratic Party and then, once they had been arrested, all their valuables had been taken from their houses and sold on. The money had been divided between V.M. and \u0110.B.", "21. As regards the arrest of Vaso Jeli\u0107, the witness identified M.M. as one of the persons implicated. He said that Vaso Jeli\u0107 had first been taken to the police station and then to Jodno. He had then been taken to the ORA and killed there.

He had been assigned to the reserve units of the Sisak County Police, headed by \u0110.B., whose Deputy was V.M. The unit the witness had joined had been headed by Ma.M. The witness named several of his colleagues. \u0110.B., V.M. and the late J.B. had made a list of persons to be arrested and brought to the First Police Station, and given orders to that effect. A.H. had almost always been present when the orders for arrests were given. The members of the reserve units had been given Serbian flags with four C-s, badges and cards allegedly issued by the Serbian Democratic Party, and certificates issued by that Party recognising contributions to its spread in the occupied territories; these items were to be planted in the houses of Serbs in the Sisak area so that they could serve as evidence of enemy activity.", "24. He stated that victims had been arrested at their homes and that money, gold and other valuables had always been taken. The victims had first been taken to the police station, then to Jodno, and later to the ORA military base, where they had been stripped and killed.", "25.

He added that he had carried out orders, as had many others, and that he knew who had ordered what at Jodno, and what had happened there and in other locations in Sisak and the surrounding area.", "28. On 9 October 2008 the State Attorney\u2019s Office issued an instruction for implementation of the Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure to the County State Attorney\u2019s Offices, in which they indicated that an inspection of their work had indicated two main problems: possible partiality of the persons involved in the pending proceedings as regards the ethnicity of the victims or the perpetrators; and the problem of trials in absentia. The instructions favoured impartial investigations of all war crimes, irrespective of the ethnicity of those involved, whether victims or perpetrators, and stressed the duties of those working for the State Attorney in that respect.", "29.
