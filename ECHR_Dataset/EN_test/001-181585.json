THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Revision rejected (Art. 35) Admissibility criteria", "JUDGES": "Branko Lubarda;Dmitry Dedov;Helen Keller;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Johannes Silvis;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra;Paul Mahoney;S\u00edofra O\u2019Leary", "TEXT": ["The cases of T.13 and T.6.", "General remarks", "The applicant Government have submitted the cases of eight persons in which the use of the five techniques and sometimes also other forms of ill-treatment were alleged. The Commission has examined the illustrative cases of T.13 and T.6. The allegations in regard to T.6 concern both the five techniques and other forms of alleged ill-treatment, whereas the allegations in regard to T.13 concern the five techniques only.", "Both cases were among the eleven cases investigated by the Compton Committee. However, neither T.13 nor T.6 had given evidence before that Committee, which based its findings on the oral evidence of the persons who supervised the operations at the centre and of the medical officer who was stationed there, as well as on various medical records, colour photographs and the feeding record (cf. Compton Report, paras. 54 and 55, at p. 14).", "The Delegates of the Commission heard both case witnesses who gave their evidence in detail and were also cross-examined by the respondent Government. They had before them extracts from the medical officer\u2019s journal at Crumlin Road Prison, the medical examination records on arrival and on departure from the interrogation centre and colour photographs of T.6 as well as various reports by psychiatrists who also gave oral evidence.", "However, the Delegates were not able to hear oral evidence from members of the security forces in relation to the allegations concerning the interrogation centre. In the first place no witnesses who had been present at that centre were made available. Secondly, the respondent Government stated at the hearing of witnesses at Sola in January 1975 that all of their witnesses had now been instructed not to reply to any questions regarding the five techniques and their use on the ground that the use of these techniques had been discontinued and that there were security considerations involved. This \u2018embargo\u2019 on the evidence also related to matters connected with a \u2018seminar\u2019 held in Northern Ireland in April 1971 by the English Intelligence Centre for members of the RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary], where the use of the techniques was taught orally (cf. Parker Report, Minority Report, para. 6 at p. 12; also Witness 13G at VR 6, pp. 190 et seq.).", "The Commission does not consider it necessary to pursue this matter any further. It is satisfied that the five methods in aid of interrogation which, as a matter of public record, were used in emergency situations at various other places before they were used in Northern Ireland in 1971 (see Parker Report, Majority Report, para. 10 at p. 3 [..]) were applied to the two case witnesses in the present case. It is further satisfied that a \u2018seminar\u2019 as described was held in April 1971 by the English Intelligence Centre.", "Course of events", "The evidence before the Commission bears out the allegations made by the case witnesses and confirms the findings of the Compton Committee as regards the course of the events for the persons subjected to the five techniques.", "T.13 and T.6 were, together with others, arrested in the early morning hours of 9 August 1971 and brought to Magilligan Camp, being one of the three Regional Holding Centres set up to receive arrested persons. They were held there for two days and, having been selected for special interrogation were brought, on 11 August 1971, to the unknown interrogation centre. On arrival at the centre they were medically examined and at one stage they were taken by helicopter to another place where they were served with a detention order. They were taken back to the centre where they were interrogated in depth being subjected to the five techniques in the following way:", "a. Wall-standing \u2013 the witnesses demonstrated how they were spreadeagled against the wall, with their fingers put high above the head against the wall, the legs spread apart and the feet back, causing them to stand on their toes with the weight of the body mainly on the fingers (the stress position). They were forced to remain in this position. The exact length of time during which the witnesses were required to stand could not be established. Both witnesses said that they lost their sense of time but that it must have been many hours. The Compton Committee while describing the position as being a different one, found that T.13 had been against the wall during periods totalling 23 hours, and T.6 29 hours.", "b. Hooding \u2013 a black or navy coloured bag was put over the witnesses\u2019 heads. Initially it was kept there all the time, except during interrogations, but later T.13 was allowed to take it off when he was alone in the room, provided that he turned his face to the wall.", "c. Noise \u2013 pending interrogations the witnesses were held in a room where there was a continuous loud and hissing noise.", "d. Sleep \u2013 pending interrogations the witnesses were deprived of sleep, but it was not possible to establish for what periods each witness had been without sleep.", "e. Food and drink \u2013 the witnesses were subjected to a reduced diet during their stay at the centre and pending interrogations. It was not possible to establish to what extent they were deprived of nourishment and whether or not they were offered food and drink but refused to take it.", "The witnesses were at the centre from 11 to 17 August 1971, when they were transferred to Crumlin Road Prison in accordance with the detention order.", "In 1971 T.13 and T.6 instituted domestic proceedings to recover damages for wrongful imprisonment and for assault and their claims were settled in 1973 and 1975 respectively for \u00a3 15,000 and \u00a3 14,000.", "Physical and mental effects resulting from the use of the techniques", "(i) Physical effects", "The Commission is satisfied from the evidence given that the witnesses suffered loss of weight resulting from their detention at the unknown interrogation centre and from the use of the five techniques. It is furthermore established that, particularly the wallstanding technique, caused physical pain while it was being applied, but that the pain ceased when the person was no longer in that position.", "(ii) Mental effects", "The witnesses themselves described feelings of anxiety and fear, as well as disorientation and isolation during the time they were subjected to the techniques and afterwards. However, the intensity of such sensations was different in respect of T.13 than in respect of T.6, as a result of differences in their personality. Consequently, T.13 had been more strongly affected by the application of the techniques than T.6.", "On the other hand, the psychiatrists disagreed considerably on the after-effects of the treatment and on the prognosis for recovery. Professors Daly and Bastiaans considered that both witnesses would continue for a long time to have considerable disability shown by bouts of depression, insomnia and a generally neurotic condition resembling that found in victims of Nazi persecution. Drs. 5 and 1 considered that the acute psychiatric symptoms developed by the witnesses during the interrogation had been minor and that their persistence was the result of everyday life in Northern Ireland for an ex-detainee carrying out his work travelling to different localities. In no sense could the witnesses\u2019 experiences be compared with those of the victims of Nazi persecution.", "On the basis of this evidence the Commission is unable to establish the exact degree of the psychiatric after-effects which the use of the five techniques might have had on these witnesses or generally on persons subjected to them. It is satisfied, however, that, depending on the personality of the person concerned, the circumstances in which he finds himself, and the conditions of everyday life in Northern Ireland at the relevant time, some after-effects resulting from the application of the techniques cannot be excluded.", "Findings of the Commission", "The five techniques in aid of interrogation were used in August 1971 on T.13 and T.6. They were applied prior to, between and during interrogations, but not after interrogation was terminated. This means that the persons concerned were subject to the techniques during at least four, possibly five, days. The exact times could not be established. The Commission is satisfied the total periods during which the two witnesses were at the wall, [were] 23 and 29 hours respectively. A certain degree of force was used to make the detainees stand at the wall in the required posture which caused physical pain and exhaustion. The posture required was a stress position and not a normal position required to search a person, although it cannot be considered to be proved that the enforced stress position lasted all the time they were at the wall.", "No physical injury resulted from the application of the techniques as such, but it caused mentally a number of acute psychiatric symptoms. It cannot be excluded that in certain persons some of these symptoms continue to exist for some time afterwards.", "The damages granted to them under settlements in court are substantial sums and, although it is not possible in any settlement to say what part was paid with a view to what claim, it may be presumed that the greater part of the sum was awarded in view of the allegations of ill-treatment including the application of the five techniques, having regard to sums normally awarded by courts for claims of assault as compared with sums normally granted for claims of wrongful imprisonment."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
