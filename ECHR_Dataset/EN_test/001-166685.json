Sh. had resided there as a tenant under the social housing agreement with the city.", "7. On 17 May 2003 Sh. died.", "8. On 25 July 2003 Sh.\u2019s ex-boyfriend, Un., and an unidentified person impersonating Sh. had their marriage registered in the Tambov Region. Un. then applied to the local housing office, where he presented his marriage certificate and was registered as residing in Sh.\u2019s flat as a tenant. On 31 October 2003 the title to the flat was transferred to Un. under the privatisation scheme. On 25 December 2003 the privatisation transaction and Un.\u2019s title to the flat were registered by the Moscow City Committee for Registration of Real Estate Transactions (the \u201cCity Registration Committee\u201d).", "9.

When Un. was released in 2011, having served a prison sentence for fraud, the city authorities had not yet informed the City Registration Committee of the judgments of 5 May and 30 August 2005.

On 8 November 2011 the City Registration Committee registered the sale agreement and S.\u2019s title to the flat.", "12. On 22 December 2011 S. sold the flat to the applicant.

On 30 October 2012 the District Court examined the case. It conceded that the applicant was a bona fide purchaser of the flat. Nevertheless, relying on Article 302 of the Russian Civil Code, the court granted the Housing Department\u2019s claims, pointing out that it remained open to the applicant to sue S. in order to have his rights protected. The applicant appealed.", "15. On 12 March 2013 the Moscow City Court upheld the judgment of 30 October 2012 on appeal.", "16. On 3 June 2013 the City Court refused to grant the applicant leave to lodge a cassation appeal against the judgments of 30 October and 12 March 2013.", "17.

On 28 February 2014 the judgment became final.", "20. On an unspecified date the bailiff instituted enforcement proceedings in respect of the judgment of 22 January 2014. On 17 June 2014 the proceedings were discontinued as it had been impossible to establish S.\u2019s whereabouts.", "21.
