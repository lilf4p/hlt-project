In the court\u2019s view, since the applicants\u2019 guilt of the commission of the above-mentioned crimes was established, the application of the measure of restraint during the investigation was justified.", "The court\u2019s conclusion is a correct one, made following the examination and proper assessment of the legally relevant...\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
