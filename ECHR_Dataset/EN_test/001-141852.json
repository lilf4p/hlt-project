The applicant claims that he, as the owner of the apartment, was not allowed to be present during the search, nor was he told why the apartment was being searched and why he could not be present. The search was conducted late at night (at 11 p.m.) without any special reason. The apartment had been damaged because the police had entered violently, even though the applicant had been willing to give them a key, and the police dog had damaged the floor. The applicant\u2019s car had also been searched.", "6. According to the Government, the minutes drawn up after the search indicated that the applicant, as the owner of the apartment, had been informed about the search. He had been requested to give the police the key to the security lock of the door to the apartment. As no key was available, the security lock was drilled with the applicant\u2019s consent.
