POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-3 - Length of pre-trial detention)", "JUDGES": "Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Ledi Bianku;Paul Mahoney", "TEXT": ["5. The applicant was born in 1973 and is currently detained in Rawicz Prison.", "6. On 13 November 2006 the applicant was arrested and charged with sexual abuse of twenty minor girls.", "7. On 15 November 2006 the Wroc\u0142aw-\u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) decided to detain him on remand. The court relied on a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the aforementioned offences. It attached particular importance to the likelihood that a severe sentence of imprisonment would be imposed on him and to the risk that he would attempt to obstruct the proceedings. The applicant\u2019s appeal, lodged against the detention order, was dismissed by the second-instance court.", "8. The applicant\u2019s detention was subsequently extended by the Wroc\u0142aw-\u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie District Court on 12 February, 8 May and 21 August 2007, by the Wroc\u0142aw Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) on 13 November 2007 and on 12 February 2008, by the Kalisz District Court on 9 May and 13 August 2008, as well as by the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Court of Appeal on 5 November 2008, 18 February, 20 May and on 14 October 2009.", "9. The courts justified their decisions by the particularly high risk of the applicant\u2019s absconding abroad or otherwise obstructing the course of the proceedings and by the severity of the anticipated penalty. They also had regard to the nature of the offences with which he had been charged and considered that, given the applicant\u2019s personality, a release on bail would not sufficiently secure the proper course of the proceedings.", "10. Meanwhile, on 5 May 2008 a bill of indictment against the applicant and another person was lodged with the Kalisz District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy). The prosecutor requested the court to hear 127 witnesses.", "11. The trial started on 17 November 2008. Subsequently, the trial court held seven hearings in 2008, forty-six hearings in 2009 and four hearings in 2010.", "12. On 19 January 2010 the Kalisz District Court convicted the applicant of sexual abuse of twenty minor girls. The court determined that the applicant had committed those offences in various ways. He had sexual intercourse with some of the victims and he sexually abused the others in different ways. He was also found guilty of aiding sexual abuse and of serving alcohol to minors. The first-instance court sentenced the applicant to a cumulative penalty of eight years and six months\u2019 imprisonment.", "13. On the same day, the Kalisz District Court extended the applicant\u2019s detention. His detention was later prolonged by the same court\u2019s decision of 27 April 2010. The applicant\u2019s appeals against these two decisions were dismissed on 10 February 2010 and 26 May 2010, respectively, by the Kalisz Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy). On 29 July and 27 October 2010 the same court granted further extensions of the applicant\u2019s detention.", "The courts relied on the likelihood that a severe sentence would be imposed on the applicant, given that he had been sentenced at firstinstance to eight years and six months\u2019 imprisonment. They considered that there was therefore a risk that the applicant might obstruct the proceedings by absconding. In establishing the existence of this risk they referred to the applicant\u2019s knowledge of foreign languages and to the fact that he had previously travelled abroad. They also stressed the particularly drastic nature of the offences in question.", "14. The applicant and the prosecutor lodged appeals against the firstinstance judgment.", "15. On 2 December 2010 the Kalisz Regional Court altered the judgment in part and increased the applicant\u2019s cumulative sentence to ten years\u2019 imprisonment.", "16. The applicant lodged a cassation appeal (kasacja) with the Supreme Court (S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy). He later withdrew his cassation appeal."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
