On 25 February 2008 the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Armenia adopted decrees dismissing the first, second and third applicants from office. The fourth applicant was dismissed from office by a similar decree on 3 March 2008. As a ground for the dismissals, the decrees referred to sections 40, subsection 1, point (j) and 44, subsection 1, point (c), of the Diplomatic Service Act (\u0540\u0540 \u0585\u0580\u0565\u0576\u0584\u0568 \u00ab\u0534\u056b\u057e\u0561\u0576\u0561\u0563\u056b\u057f\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576 \u056e\u0561\u057c\u0561\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0575\u0561\u0576 \u0574\u0561\u057d\u056b\u0576\u00bb, containing description which stated, inter alia, that a diplomat had no right to use his official capacity and work facilities for the benefit of parties and non-governmental organisations, or in order to carry out other political or religious activity (see paragraphs 22-24 below).", "13. On an unspecified date in March 2008, the applicants instituted administrative proceedings challenging their dismissal and seeking to be reinstated in their work. In particular, they claimed that the decrees on their dismissal contained no reasons regarding the particular instance where they had made use of their official capacity and work facilities for the benefit of parties or non-governmental organisations or for engaging in political or religious activities, as prohibited by the sections of the Diplomatic Service Act. They also claimed that dismissal on the ground of convictions and opinions was prohibited by law.", "14. On 10 April 2008 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as a respondent, lodged a response with the Administrative Court (\u0540\u0540 \u057e\u0561\u0580\u0579\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576 \u0564\u0561\u057f\u0561\u0580\u0561\u0576), claiming that the applicants, by making their statement of 24 February 2008 which had then been reported by the mass media and announced during the demonstration, had engaged in political activities. Furthermore, the applicants had made use of their official capacity since they indicated their official titles in the statement.", "15. On 29 May 2008 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 claim, finding that their dismissal from work was lawful since the applicants, by making the impugned statement, in essence had engaged in political activity. In this respect, the Administrative Court mentioned that the impugned statement concerned political processes as it contained a political assessment of election and post-election events. Furthermore, that statement, as well as that of the ambassadors, had been read aloud during the demonstration organised by a political force and had received a political assessment. The Administrative Court also found that the applicants, by indicating their post titles, had made use of their official capacity. The applicants\u2019 right to freedom of expression, as protected by Article 27 of the Constitution (\u0540\u0540 \u054d\u0561\u0570\u0574\u0561\u0576\u0561\u0564\u0580\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0576), was not breached since the applicants, in exercising that right, had made use of their official status and work facilities. Therefore, the restriction on that right was in compliance with Article 43 of the Constitution. Besides, the applicants had not been dismissed on the ground of their political opinion, but because in disseminating that opinion they had made use of their official status, which was prohibited by law.", "16. On an unspecified date, the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law against the judgment of the Administrative Court, claiming, inter alia, a violation of their right to freedom of expression, as protected by Article 10 of the Convention. Besides, they claimed that they had been discriminated against on grounds of political opinion, in violation of Article 14, since those diplomats or state officials who had expressed publicly their support for the pro-governmental candidate had never faced any sanctions: the true reason for their dismissal was their critical opinion of government actions in the sphere of human rights and democratisation. They also claimed that their dismissal had been based on an erroneous interpretation of sections 40, subsection 1, point (j) and 44, subsection 1, point (c), of the Diplomatic Service Act since they had not made use of their official capacity or work facilities when making the impugned statement. Furthermore, the statement had not been made for the benefit of any political party and it could not be qualified as political activity as such.", "17. On 23 September 2008 the Court of Cassation (\u0540\u0540 \u057e\u0573\u057c\u0561\u0562\u0565\u056f \u0564\u0561\u057f\u0561\u0580\u0561\u0576) decided to declare the applicants\u2019 appeal on points of law inadmissible for lack of merit."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
