On 21 July 1998 the applicant addressed a letter (k\u00ebrkes\u00eb) to the Kavaja District Court (\u201cthe District Court\u201d) and the Kavaja district prosecutor (\u201cthe district prosecutor\u201d), stating that he had engaged A., a lawyer, to represent him before the district prosecutor during the investigation and during the trial proceedings.

Judges V.C. and Sh.M., who had been members of the Court of Appeal\u2019s bench that on 10 September 2001 had upheld the decision of 26 December 2000, also sat in the Court of Appeal\u2019s bench that dismissed his appeal on 29 September 2006.", "20.

On 16 March 2011 the applicant\u2019s lawyer was informed of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 25 February 2011 to dismiss the applicant\u2019s constitutional appeal. The Constitutional Court, noting that A. and the applicant\u2019s mother had had knowledge of the trial proceedings, stated that there had been no exceptional circumstances which had prevented the applicant from attending the proceedings in person. It did not examine the applicant\u2019s claim about the impartiality of the District Court and the Court of Appeal"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
