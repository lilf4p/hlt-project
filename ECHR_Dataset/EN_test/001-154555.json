De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["1. The applicants are Turkish nationals. The applicant in the first case, Mr Ahmet Bezek, was born in 1980 and is represented before the Court by Mr U. Sommer, a lawyer practising in Cologne. The applicant in the second case, Mr Sinan Bezek, was born in 1976 and is represented before the Court by Mr G. Bogatz, a lawyer practising in Bendestorf. Both applicants are currently serving a prison sentence in Bremen.", "2.", "3. In the night of 5/6 January 2006 a shooting took place in front of a nightclub in the Bremen entertainment district which left several persons seriously injured.", "4. On 11 December 2007 a Chamber of the Bremen Regional Court, consisting of the presiding judge S., the judge P., one further professional judge and two lay judges, convicted G.L. of attempted manslaughter, grievous bodily harm and unlawfully carrying a firearm and sentenced him to ten years and six months imprisonment.", "5. Based on G.L.\u2019s confession, which was supported by witness evidence, the Chamber considered that G.L. had started the shooting into a group of people standing in front of the night club, thereby accepting that he might inflict lethal injuries. The Chamber did not attach credibility to G. L.\u2019s submissions that the applicants had not been involved in the shooting incident, but considered that G.L. had committed the offences jointly with the two applicants. Based on witness evidence and an expert examination of bullets found on the site, the Chamber considered that the first applicant had fired at least three shots and the second applicant at least one shot. The Chamber considered that G.L. and the applicants had acted upon a joint plan, resulting in each perpetrator being liable for the acts committed by his accomplices under Article 25 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code as joint principals (Mitt\u00e4terschaft, see relevant domestic law, below).", "6. The judgment, which was 151 pages long, inter alia contained the following references to the applicants:", "\u201cAll three of them [G.L. and the two applicants] had been equipped with firearms. It was clear to them \u2013 even without an express agreement, that they would make use of the weapons they carried if the situation should arise....At that time at the latest witness Ahmed Bezek [the first applicant] carried a silver revolver with a 9 mm calibre and Sinan Bezek [the second applicant] a pistol, calibre 7.65 mm, which had been assembled from various weapon parts (p. 34 of the judgment)...Immediately after the accused had fired the first shot, Ahmet and Sinan Bezek drew their weapons and fired in the direction of the B.club (p. 36)...many persons...found themselves within the shooting range of the applicant and of Ahmed and Sinan Bezek (p. 37)...their [the witnesses\u2019] statement is supported by the fact that the accused and the Bezek brothers [the applicants] actually carried weapons (p. 78). The establishment of the facts relating to the other shooters is based on the credible witness statements given by...[The witness] M. has stated that the accused and witnesses Ahmed and Sinan Bezek each carried a weapon in their hand (p. 100)...These statements were confirmed by the testimony given by witness K. He [reported] that he had seen that Sinan Bezek as well as Ahmet Bezek had carried a weapon. Both had shot very rapidly and had then disappeared (p. 100). ... Witness K. has stated that he had heard two shots before arriving at the scene. Shortly afterwards it had really started. He had seen how Sinan Bezek, Ahmet Bezek and the accused had shot (p. 100). Finally, witness D. had stated that he had seen weapons not only in the hands of the accused, but also in the hands of Ahmet and Sinan Bezek, but could not tell for sure whether these two had shot. The accused\u2019s weapon as well as Sinan Bezek\u2019s weapon was black and did not have a drum (p. 100/101). On the basis of the traces and other evidence it has been established...that the projectile with the casing numbered trace no. 28 has been shot from the weapon that had been fired by Sinan Bezek (pp. 105/106). The establishment of the fact that Sinan Bezek was one of the shooters is compatible with the witness testimony (p. 104)....These two pistols had been used by the accused and Sinan Bezek (p. 106)...Sinan Bezek\u2019s pistol was jammed after the first shot (p. 106). The accused is guilty under Articles....of the Criminal Code of attempted manslaughter, causing serious bodily harm and unlawful carrying of a semi-automatic gun, jointly committed with the brothers Ahmet and Sinan Bezek (p. 130)....According to the established facts, the applicant and the witnesses Ahmet and Sinan Bezek had reached at least a tacit understanding to return to the entry of the \u201cT.\u201d [nightclub] and to use the weapons they carried in the expected confrontation with the M.group (p. 131)...The context of the proceedings demonstrates that each of the three shooters was aware of the fact that the respective other ones were armed (p. 131)...The accused\u2019s firing of the first shot had prompted Sinan and Ahmet Bezek to use their own weapons without delay and without any apparent reason (p. 132).\u201d", "7. When giving an oral summary of the reasons of the judgment, the presiding judge S. also referred to the alleged involvement of the two applicants in the incident.", "8. Both applicants were arrested on 6 January 2006 and remained in detention on remand until 21 April 2006. The second applicant was further detained on remand from 17 January 2008 to 28 January 2009 and as from 17 April 2009 until the termination of the criminal proceedings against him.", "9. On 29 February 2008 the Bremen Public Prosecutor issued an indictment against the applicants for attempted manslaughter and violation of the Weapons Act. The Chamber adjudicating the applicants\u2019 case comprised the presiding judge S. and the judge P. \u2013 who had both been sitting on the bench in the trial against G.L. \u2013 one further professional judge and two lay judges.", "10. Since March 2006, the second applicant had been represented by Ms P., a defence counsel who maintained her lawyer\u2019s offices in Frankfurt/Main. The second applicant requested the Regional Court to appoint Mr Bogatz, who also represents him before the Court, as his second counsel.", "11. On 25/26 March 2008 the presiding judge of the Regional Court requested the applicants\u2019 counsels to inform him about their availability from 28 April to 31 December 2008.", "12. On 31 March 2008 Ms P. informed the Regional Court that she would be available as from May 2008 at the earliest. She further suggested scheduling hearings on two days per week, on Mondays and Fridays. She further stated that the second applicant\u2019s defence would be assured in case Mr Bogatz was appointed as second defence counsel. She pointed out that a second defence counsel had been also appointed in the proceedings against G.L.", "13. On 2 April 2008 the presiding judge of the Regional Court informed the applicants\u2019 counsels about the dates of the intended hearings, generally scheduled for three days per week, and asked them to confirm their respective availability. In view of the fact that each of the applicants would only be represented by one court-appointed counsel, it was of imminent importance that the respective counsels arrived in time for the hearings. He further informed the applicants\u2019 counsels about his intention to withdraw the appointment of Ms P. as the second applicant\u2019s court-appointed defence counsel, in view of the distance between her lawyer\u2019s offices situated in Frankfurt/Main and the Bremen Regional Court where the hearings would take place.", "14. On 18 April a preliminary talk took place between the presiding judge, judge P., public prosecution and the applicants\u2019 defence counsels. According to a note to the case-file prepared by the presiding judge following this discussion, Ms P. had not been able to submit a binding declaration that she would be available on all hearing days.", "15. On 23 April 2008 the presiding judge of the Bremen Regional Court withdrew the appointment of Ms P. as the second applicant\u2019s counsel, rejected his request to appoint Mr Bogatz and appointed another counsel, residing in Bremen, as the second applicant\u2019s defence counsel. The Presiding Judge observed that neither of the counsels had confirmed their availability for all the scheduled hearing days. He further observed that the special relation of confidence existing between Ms P. and the second applicant made it desirable that she could continue her assignment. The lawyer of confidence should regularly be assigned unless serious reasons militated against this. However, in the instant case, the remoteness of Ms P.\u2019s offices made it necessary to withdraw her appointment. Under the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, precedence was to be given to lawyers residing in the respective court district. The proximity of the defence counsel was an important aspect of an appropriate defence and of an orderly course of the proceedings. This factor was enhanced by the fact that the accused was in detention on remand and that the proceedings would be lengthy. In spite of the requirement of special expediency in case of detention on remand, Ms P. had failed to submit a binding declaration that she would be available on all (or at least almost all) pre-scheduled hearing dates. The presiding judge finally observed that the further assignment of Ms P. would cause considerable additional expenses caused by times of absence, travel and accommodation costs.", "16. On 9 June 2008 the Hanseatic Court of Appeal dismissed the second applicant\u2019s complaint about this decision. The Court of Appeal considered that the presiding judge of the Bremen Regional Court, when withdrawing Ms P.\u2019s appointment, had stayed within his margin of appreciation. That court noted that the presiding judge had given several objective reasons for his decision. The distance between the defence counsel\u2019s offices and the court seat was an important aspect in assuring adequate defence. While it was true that Ms P. had entertained her offices in Frankfurt already at the time when she was first appointed defence counsel in July 2006, this did not rule out the withdrawal of appointment, in particular if further reasons emerged during the course of proceedings. In this respect, the Court of Appeal observed that the second applicant had been arrested in January 2008 and that his case had to be processed with the special diligence required in case of detention on remand. In spite of the presiding judge\u2019s repeated requests, Ms P.\u2019s had failed to submit a binding and unequivocal statement that she would be able to attend all \u2013 or almost all \u2013 of the scheduled hearings. The Hanseatic Court of Appeal finally observed that the second applicant had failed to establish a specific relation of confidence to Ms P. which would exceptionally justify the exorbitant costs which would be incurred by her appointment as the applicant\u2019s defence counsel.", "17. Ms P. continued to represent the second applicant as his chosen defence counsel until 3 February 2009, when her mandate was discontinued for lack of funds.", "18. On 18 and 25 June 2008 the applicants lodged motions for bias against the two judges S. and P. on the grounds that they had both been sitting on the bench which had delivered judgment against the alleged coperpetrator G.L. They considered the Chamber adjudicating the case of G.L. had taken a definite position on the applicants\u2019 guilt. The findings contained in the judgment against G.L. which related to the applicants\u2019 alleged involvement had not been necessary, as G.L. had made a confession in which he had assumed the full responsibility for the shooting incident. The second applicant further referred to the withdrawal of Ms P. as his defence counsel.", "19. On 27 June 2008 another Chamber of the Regional Court rejected the motions for bias as unfounded. The Regional Court reiterated that a mere prior involvement concerning the same matter did not as such raise doubts as to the judges\u2019 impartiality. There were no specific circumstances which allowed drawing a different conclusion in the instant case. The references made to the applicants\u2019 involvement in the shooting incident had been indispensable for establishing G.L.\u2019s criminal liability within the framework of a joint criminal act. In order to establish the guilt of the accused, the trial chamber had been obliged to assign the different contributions to the different persons involved in the incident. The same applied to the oral summary of the reasoning given by the presiding judge on pronouncement of the judgment against G.L.", "20. The Bremen Regional Court heard the applicants\u2019 case on 119 days as from 25 June 2008.", "21. On 4 March 2010 the Bremen Regional Court convicted the applicants, who had denied any involvement in the shooting incident, of attempted manslaughter, grievous bodily harm and unlawfully carrying a firearm and sentenced the first applicant to eight years\u2019 and the second applicant to seven years\u2019 imprisonment. Based on witness evidence, which was corroborated by circumstantial and expert evidence, the Regional Court found it established that the two applicants had taken part in the shooting of 6 January 2006 and that the second applicant had fired one shot and the first applicant at least three shots before their weapons were jammed. The Regional Court furthermore found it established that the applicants had worked as contact persons for the Bremen police, but did not consider that this fact had an influence on their criminal liability.", "22. The judgment, which ran over 354 pages, contained a summary of the previous proceedings. With regard to the judgment given against G.L., the judgment read as follows:", "\u201cThe Jury Court I convicted him [G.L.] of attempted manslaughter, grievous bodily harm and unlawfully carrying a firearm and sentenced him to 10 years and 6 months\u2019 imprisonment. At that time, the Jury Court I had gained the conviction that G.L., jointly with Ahmet and Sinan Bezek, who are accused here, fired a multitude of shots into a group of people standing in front of the \u201cB.club\u201d. The judgment against G.L. is now final. G.L. was summoned twice to give testimony as a witness in the instant proceedings. Even though he had no right to refuse to give evidence, he refused in the instant proceedings to give testimony...\u201d", "23. Both applicants lodged appeals on points of law against the judgment of 4 March 2010, in which they inter alia complained about the lack of impartiality of the Jury Court adjudicating their case. The second applicant further complained about the withdrawal of appointment of Ms P. as his defence counsel. On 21 June 2011 the Federal Court of Justice dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal on points of law.", "24. On 3 August 2011 the Federal Constitutional Court refused to entertain the applicants\u2019 constitutional complaints.", "25. Article 142 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as in force at the relevant time provided:", "\u201c(1) The presiding judge of the [trial] court choses the defence counsel to be appointed preferably among the lawyers residing in the court district. The accused shall be given the opportunity to name defence counsel of his choice within a time limit to be specified. The presiding judge appoints the defence counsel designated by the accused unless there is an important reason for not doing so.\u201d", "26. Pursuant to Article 155 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, criminal investigations and related decisions concern only the accused and the charges brought against him or her. Article 264 \u00a7 1 stipulates that a judgment rendered in criminal proceedings shall deal with the offence set out in the bill of indictment as determined in more detail in the light of the outcome of the trial.", "27. Article 25 of the Criminal Code provides as follows:", "Principals", "\u201c(1) Any person who commits the offence himself or through another shall be liable as a principal.", "(2) If more than one person commit the offence jointly, each shall be liable as a principal (joint principals).\u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
