The applicant, who was born in 1960 and lives in Paris, is a lawyer (avocat), member of the Paris Bar.", "10. On 19 October 1995 Mr Bernard Borrel, a judge who had been seconded by France for the past year as technical adviser to the Djiboutian Minister of Justice, in the context of cooperation agreements between the two States, was found dead 80 kilometres from the city of Djibouti. His half-naked and partially burnt body was lying some 20 metres below a remote road. The investigation by the Djibouti gendarmerie in the days that followed concluded that he had committed suicide by self-immolation.", "11. On 7 December 1995 a judicial investigation was opened at the Toulouse tribunal de grande instance to determine the cause of death. Bernard Borrel\u2019s body, which was repatriated and interred in Toulouse, underwent an autopsy on 15 February 1996. The report concluded that the death was not suspicious, although the body\u2019s state of decomposition did not permit a precise cause to be established.", "12. On 3 March 1997 Mrs Elisabeth Borrel, the widow of Bernard Borrel and also a judge, disputing the finding of suicide, filed a complaint as a civil party, in her own name and on behalf of her two minor children, against a person or persons unknown for premeditated murder. She appointed the applicant, Mr Morice, to represent her in the proceedings.", "13. On 8 and 23 April 1997 two judicial investigations were opened in respect of premeditated murder committed by a person or persons unknown.", "14. In a decision of 30 April 1997 the judicial investigation into the cause of death and the two investigations in respect of premeditated murder were joined.", "15. On 29 October 1997 the Court of Cassation accepted a request by the applicant to withdraw the case from the Toulouse court and it was transferred to the tribunal de grande instance of Paris, where it was assigned on 12 October 1997 to Ms M., assisted by Mr L.L. on 7 January 1998, both investigating judges, who were to conduct the judicial investigation jointly.", "16. On 19 November 1999 a lawyer at the Brussels Bar informed the police that A., a former senior officer and member of the Djiboutian Presidential Guard, who had found asylum in Belgium, had certain revelations to make concerning Judge Borrel. The information thus disclosed was transmitted to the French authorities via Interpol. A judgment of the Versailles Court of Appeal of 28 May 2009 (see paragraph 18 below) records the following sequence of events: Judges M. and L.L. did not reply, owing to the fact that the witness wished to remain anonymous, and the information was not followed up; the witness\u2019s Belgian lawyer thus contacted the applicant, who arranged for the witness to be interviewed by journalists from the daily newspaper Le Figaro and the French TV channel TF1, at the end of December 1999; lastly, it was as a result of the publication and broadcasting of that interview in early January 2000 that Judges M. and L.L. decided to go to Belgium to assist the Belgian investigator in taking evidence from the witness.", "17. On 31 January 2000 Judges M. and L.L. interviewed the witness in Brussels. It was subsequently alleged by A. that he had been pressurised and intimidated by Judge M. so that he would withdraw his testimony, those complaints being expressly made in a letter of 2 February 2000 from his lawyer to the Crown Prosecutor. In addition, the witness accused the public prosecutor of Djibouti of having threatened him to make him recant his statement, and alleged that the head of the Djibouti secret services had ordered the head of the Presidential Guard, Captain I., to draft a statement discrediting him. Captain I. confirmed A\u2019s accusations concerning him.", "18. Proceedings were brought in France against the public prosecutor of Djibouti and the head of the country\u2019s secret services for the procuring of false evidence, and Judge Borrel\u2019s widow and son, the witness A., Captain I., and a French lawyer A.M., who was implicated, intervened as civil parties. Evidence was taken from Judge M. in her capacity as witness. The public prosecutor and the head of the secret services of Djibouti were sentenced, respectively, to eighteen and twelve months\u2019 imprisonment, and ordered to pay damages to the civil parties, in a judgment of the Versailles Criminal Court of 27 March 2008, before being acquitted by the Versailles Court of Appeal on 28 May 2009.", "19. On 2 February 2000, in the context of the judicial investigation in respect of premeditated murder, three professional unions of judges and prosecutors, namely the Syndicat de la magistrature, the Association professionnelle des magistrats and the Union syndicale des magistrats, applied to be joined to the proceedings as civil parties.", "20. On 16 March 2000 the applicant, acting on behalf of Mrs Borrel, requested, first, that evidence be taken from the witness, A., in Belgium, and secondly that a visit to the scene of the crime in Djibouti, in the presence of the civil parties, be organised.", "21. In a decision of 17 March 2000 the investigating judges M. and L.L. accepted the request concerning A., finding that a new interview was absolutely necessary. They refused, however, to agree to a site visit, as such a visit had already been made twice, once in 1999 and again one week before the decision in question, as they did not see \u201chow a visit to the site in the presence of the civil party would, at th[at] stage of the proceedings, be helpful for the discovery of the truth\u201d. They added that during their visit to Djibouti a few days before, they had been accompanied by two experts, including the director of the Paris Institute of Forensic Medicine, adding that the scene had been filmed and photographed on that occasion.", "22. The applicant and another lawyer appealed against that decision. They filed their pleadings with the Indictments Division, like the lawyer acting for the Syndicat de la magistrature, arguing that the last site visit in the presence of an expert could be regarded as a reconstruction from which the civil parties had been excluded, and that the sole aim of the investigation was to demonstrate that the victim had committed suicide. They also requested that the Indictments Division take over the case from the investigating judges and continue the investigation itself.", "23. In a judgment of 21 June 2000 the Indictments Division of the Paris Court of Appeal found that after two site visits in the absence of the civil parties, one of which closely resembled a reconstruction, the need to organise an on-site reconstruction in the presence of the civil parties so that they could exercise their rights was indispensable for the discovery of the truth. Accordingly, it set aside the decision of Judges M. and L.L. on that point. In addition, it withdrew the case from them and appointed a new investigating judge, Judge P., to continue the investigation.", "24. On 19 June 2007 the Paris public prosecutor, further to the request of the investigating judge then handling the case, on the basis of Article 11, paragraph 3, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, issued a statement to clarify publicly that \u201cwhilst suicide had once been the preferred theory, the evidence gathered, especially since 2002, now point[ed] to a criminal act\u201d, adding that the experts\u2019 reports had determined that \u201cBernard Borrel was lying on the ground when liquids were poured over him in a random manner\u201d.", "25. The proceedings are currently still pending.", "26. The Minister of Justice, by acts of 29 June and 16 October 2000, referred to the National Legal Service Commission (Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de la magistrature \u2013 the \u201cCSM\u201d), in its capacity as disciplinary board for judges, certain shortcomings attributable to Judge M. in the judicial investigation into the \u201cScientology\u201d case for which she was responsible and in which the applicant also represented the civil parties. Judge M. was criticised for not devoting the necessary care and attention to the case file, leaving it practically untouched for five years, for having recourse to a friendly settlement procedure which went beyond the jurisdiction of an investigating judge and for not making copies of all the documents in the case file, thus making it impossible to reconstruct the file after its partial disappearance from her chambers. Judge M. requested that the referral to the CSM be declared null and void, particularly on account of the fact that it had been made public by the director of the Minister\u2019s private office at a press conference, even before she had been personally notified of the decision. In parallel, on 18 October 2000, the Indictments Division of the Paris Court of Appeal upheld a request by the applicant for the withdrawal of the \u201cScientology\u201d case from Judge M.", "27. On 4 July 2000, at a general meeting of judges of the Paris tribunal de grande instance, the issue of the disciplinary proceedings against Judge M. was raised, in particular because they had been announced in the press whereas the judge concerned had not been officially informed and the President of that court had not yet been notified. During that meeting a judge, J.M., stated as follows:", "\u201cWe are not prohibited, as grassroots judges, from saying that we stand by Judge [M.] It is not forbidden to say that Judge [M.] has our support and trust.\u201d", "28. The general meeting drafted the following motion, which was adopted unanimously:", "\u201cThe general meeting of judges of the Paris tribunal de grande instance held on 4 July 2000, without disputing the authority conferred on the Minister of Justice to take disciplinary proceedings in the conditions prescribed by law, is surprised to learn from the press that such proceedings have been initiated against Judge [M.], investigating judge in Paris, whereas to date neither the judge herself nor her judicial hierarchy have been officially informed thereof.\u201d", "29. In the context of a magazine interview published in July-August 2000, the chair of the Syndicat de la magistrature, a civil party in the Borrel case, criticised the \u201clack of impartiality on the part of Judge M. in the Borrel and [L.] cases\u201d, adding that the judges who had signed the motion \u201ccould not have been unaware that in two sensitive cases, the Borrel case and the [L.] case, her impartiality was seriously called into question\u201d.", "30. In a judgment of 5 January 2000, the Paris tribunal de grande instance, in a case brought by the applicant as counsel acting for two civil parties, had found the State liable for gross negligence on the part of the courts service on account of the disappearance of the so-called \u201cScientology\u201d file from the office of Judge M. It awarded damages to the complainants.", "31. On 13 December 2001 the CSM dismissed a plea of nullity from Judge M. and, on the merits, while reproaching her for a certain lack of rigour or a failure to keep track of the case sufficiently, did not impose any disciplinary penalty on her.", "32. On 1 August 2000 Judge P., who had been appointed to replace Judges M. and L.L., drafted a report in which he noted the following chain of events. In response to the applicant\u2019s request concerning the video-recording made in Djibouti in March 2000 and cited by Judges M. and L.L. in their decision of 17 March 2000, Judge P. replied that it was not in the judicial investigation file and was not registered as an exhibit; on the same day, Judge P. asked Judge M. whether she still had the video-cassette; Judge M. promptly gave him a closed and undated envelope with her name on, showing no sign of having been placed under seal, bearing the address of Judge M. as addressee and that of the public prosecutor of Djibouti as sender; the envelope contained a video-cassette and a handwritten card with the letter head of the public prosecutor of Djibouti, these items then being taken by Judge P. and placed under seal. The public prosecutor\u2019s card addressed to Judge M. read as follows (translated from French):", "\u201cHi Marie-Paule,", "As agreed, I am sending you the video-cassette of the Goubet site visit. I hope the picture will be clear enough.", "I watched the show Sans aucun doute (Without any doubt) on TF1. I noticed once again how Mrs Borrel and her lawyers were determined to carry on orchestrating their manipulation.", "I\u2019ll call you soon.", "Say hello to Roger if he\u2019s back, and also to J.C. [D.].", "Speak to you soon.", "Best wishes,"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1", "6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
