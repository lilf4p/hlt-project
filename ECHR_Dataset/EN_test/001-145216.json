The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Bia\u0142a Podlaska.", "6. The applicant and her husband, G.K., had two children, D. and K.", "7. In March 2002 they formed a foster family for two brothers, D.K. and R.K. On 11 August 2002 the Bia\u0142a Podlaska District Court appointed her and her husband as the siblings\u2019 official foster parents.", "8. In January 2003 they fostered three more children, siblings A.C., M.C. and T.C.", "9. In June 2004 the family fostered two other children, sisters A.M. and S.M.", "10. The applicant and her husband took care of nine children altogether, two biological and seven fostered.", "11. In December 2004 G.K. suddenly died. The applicant subsequently applied for dissolution of the foster family. She submitted that she could not cope with the task of running a foster home for nine children on her own.", "12. On 31 January 2005 the Bia\u0142a Podlaska District Court issued an interim care order placing A.C., M.C. and T.C. with another foster family, run by Mr and Mrs P. The applicant was still responsible for the two K. brothers and the two M. sisters as their foster mother.", "13. On 11 August 2005 the Bia\u0142a Podlaska District Court moved the K. brothers to another foster family, run by Mrs W.", "14. In April 2007 the foster family formed by the applicant was dissolved in respect of the two M. sisters.", "15. In January 2008 the applicant married C.R., who did not adopt the applicant\u2019s biological sons D. and K. . The applicant remains their sole legal guardian.", "16. The applicant\u2019s late husband G.K. was covered by an insurance scheme run by the Farmers\u2019 Social Security Fund (Kasa Rolniczego Upezpieczenia Spolecznego \u2013 \u201cthe Fund\u201d). His children were entitled to a survivors\u2019 pension (renta rodzinna) under the scheme. The total amount of the pension payable to survivors was to be divided into equal parts among all eligible individuals \u2013 in G.K.\u2019s case, all his children, both biological and fostered.", "17. In January 2005 the applicant applied to the Fund for the survivors\u2019 pension in respect of all nine children.", "18. On 18 February 2005 the Fund decided that the M. sisters were not eligible for the pension, as less than a year had passed between the applicant\u2019s late husband becoming their foster father and his death. The Fund further established that the remaining seven children \u2013 the applicant\u2019s biological children, the two K. brothers and the three C. siblings \u2212 would be entitled to a pension of PLN 525.70 in total per month. The applicant, as their legal guardian, was appointed beneficiary of the pension.", "19. On 22 February 2005 Mrs P. requested that the Fund grant a pension in respect of the C. siblings, who had by that time become part of the foster family she ran with her husband (see paragraph 12 above).", "20. On 1 March 2005 the Fund issued a new decision revising the amount of the pension to be paid. The applicant\u2019s two biological children and the two K. brothers fostered by her would be entitled to a monthly allowance of PLN 349.60 between them, four-sevenths of the total amount. The three C. siblings being raised by the P. family would be entitled to a monthly allowance of PLN 262.20 between them, three-sevenths of the total amount.", "21. The applicant appealed against the decisions delivered by the Fund. She requested that the court amend its decision of 1 March 2005 and declare that the only individuals eligible were her husband\u2019s biological children. She argued that the children formerly in her foster care had been placed with other families who provided for them and that they should not therefore be entitled to the survivors\u2019 pension in respect of her late husband. She was of the view that the contested decision put her children in a disadvantageous situation in comparison with the foster children.", "22. On 15 November 2005 the Lublin Regional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal, but on 7 February 2007 the Lublin Court of Appeal quashed that judgment and remitted the case to the lower court for re-examination with the participation of the C. and K. siblings\u2019 legal guardians.", "23. On 16 May 2007 the Lublin Regional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal again. The court based its reasoning on the Farmers\u2019 Social Insurance Act 1990 (Ustawa z 20 grudnia 1990 roku o ubezpieczeniu spo\u0142ecznym rolnik\u00f3w \u2013 \u201cthe Act\u201d). Under section 29 (2)(2) of that Act all children of the deceased, including foster children, were eligible for a survivors\u2019 pension. Section 30 of the Act stated that all family members were eligible for a share of the pension, which was to be divided into equal parts, even where the eligible individuals were minors under the care of different guardians. The Regional Court stressed that the spirit of the Act was to treat all children equally in respect of the insurance benefits payable to them on the death of an insured person, irrespective of whether they were biological or foster children. The court found no grounds on which to quash or amend the contested decision.", "24. On 18 December 2007 the Lublin Court of Appeal dismissed a further appeal by the applicant on the same grounds as the first. The court fully concurred with the reasoning of the first-instance court.", "25. On an unspecified date the applicant wrote to the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy to complain about the decisions given in her case. She submitted that her biological children were being treated less favourably than the foster children in respect of their survivors\u2019 pension. She received a response dated 14 February 2008. In that letter, the Director of the Family Benefits Department shared the applicant\u2019s view that the legal provisions in force at that time were indeed unfavourable to biological children in situations where foster children had been moved to other families. The applicant was informed that the relevant legislative amendments were in progress.", "26. According to the most recent relevant decision of the Fund, dated 14 June 2010, the total amount of the pension would from that date be divided into six parts, because T.C. had lost his entitlement having reached the age of majority. From that date onwards, the applicant\u2019s biological children would receive two-sixths of the survivors\u2019 pension. The remainder would be paid to the other children formerly in her and her late husband\u2019s foster care.", "27. The District Family Support Centre (PCPR) awarded the applicant the following amounts in financial support for the foster children:", "for D.K. from 7 March 2002 until 11 August 2005 \u2013 26,308.30 PLN and an additional 6 630,80 PLN for personal care of the child;", "for R.K. from 7 March 2002 until 11 August 2005 \u2013 26,308.30 PLN and an additional 6 630,80 PLN for personal care of the child;", "for T.C. from 1 February 2003 until 31 January 2005 \u2013 15,562.00 PLN and an additional 3 890,40 PLN for personal care of the child;", "for M.C. from 1 February 2003 until 31 January 2005 \u2013 15,562.00 PLN and an additional 3 890,40 PLN for personal care of the child;", "for A.C. from 1 February 2003 until 31 January 2005 \u2013 15,562.00 PLN and an additional 3 890,40 PLN for personal care of the child;", "for A.M. from 14 June 2004 until 27 April 2007 \u2013 22,248.06 PLN and an additional 4 557,00 PLN for personal care of the child;", "for S.M. from 14 June 2004 until 27 April 2007 \u2013 22,248.06 PLN, and an additional 4,557.00 PLN for personal care of the child.", "28.

Siblings T.C., M.C. and A.C. remained in Mr and Mrs P.\u2019s foster family from 31 January 2005 until 26 June 2006 (T.C.) and 7 July 2010 (M.C. and A.C.). By a court decision of 26 June 2006, T.C. was placed in a Staterun children\u2019s home. M.C. and A.C. remained with couple P.\u2019s foster family until 7 July 2010 when the court restored their biological parents\u2019 parental rights. M.C. and A.C. lived with them from that date onwards.", "31. T.C. and M.C. stopped drawing their survivors\u2019 pensions on 1 September 2009 and 1 November 2010 respectively.", "32. Siblings R.K. and D.K. remained in Mrs W.\u2019s foster family from 11 August 2005 until 29 June 2009 and 17 January 2011 respectively. That foster family ultimately ceased to exist because they had reached the age of majority. R.K. subsequently moved in with his biological mother. He stopped receiving his survivors\u2019 pension on 1 August 2010. D.K. moved into college accommodation.", "33. The applicant\u2019s biological sons D.K. and K.K. were entitled to receive the survivors\u2019 pension until 28 February 2012 and 31 July 2012 respectively.
