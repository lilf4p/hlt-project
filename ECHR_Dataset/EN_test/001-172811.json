Between 1986 and 1987 the applicants took part in the clean-up operation at the Chernobyl nuclear disaster site. They were subsequently registered disabled and became entitled to various social benefits and compensation paid on a regular basis.", "5. Considering these benefits insufficient, the applicants together with 482 other people, most of them represented by Ms A., sued the Russian Ministry of Finance for additional compensation corresponding to non-pecuniary damage suffered as a result of their participation in the operation.", "6. On different dates in February and April 2011 the Nalchik Town Court of Kabardino-Balkaria (\u201cthe Town Court\u201d), presided over by Judge Be., allowed their claims in part and awarded each claimant, including the applicants, compensation ranging between 1,200,000 Russian roubles (RUB) and RUB 1,800,000 for non-pecuniary damage.", "7.

On 28 February 2013 the regional Supreme Court quashed the decisions adopted by the Town Court on 6 and 7 June 2011 and granted the defendant authority\u2019s extension request on the ground that it had had a valid reason for missing the statutory time-limit for appeal.", "16.

In particular, she had accepted for examination claims failing to comply with the admissibility criteria, had failed to publish her judgments on the court\u2019s website within a reasonable time, had allowed representatives without proper forms of authority to take part in the proceedings, and had failed to properly inform the parties of the decisions taken.", "21.

Article 1109 \u00a7 3 of the CCvP stipulates that where a decision to award compensation for damage to health is quashed on appeal or by way of supervisory review, and that decision has been taken in the absence of bad faith and miscalculation on the part of the recipient, the compensation itself cannot be claimed back.", "30.
