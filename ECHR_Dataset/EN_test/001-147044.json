Following their refusal, the applicant lodged a claim with the Digora District Court of the Northern Osetiya and Alaniya Republic, asking the court to confirm that he had been residing permanently in Russia since 1991.", "13. On 30 October 2007 the District Court granted the applicant\u2019s request.

The Town Court considered that the applicant was Shermandin Goderziyevich Mazmishvili. It found that, as a person without citizenship, he had failed to have his residency in Russia duly authorised. It therefore imposed a fine on him and ordered his expulsion from Russia to Georgia. The court also held that the applicant should be remanded in custody pending expulsion until 8 September 2010. In particular, the court noted as follows:", "\u201cWhen deciding whether to expel Sh. G.
