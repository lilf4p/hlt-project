On 6 May 2012 a public event entitled the \u201cMarch of Millions\u201d was held in central Moscow to protest against the allegedly rigged presidential elections. The event had been approved by the city authorities in the form of a march followed by a meeting at Bolotnaya Square which was supposed to end at 7.30 p.m. The march was peaceful and held without any disruptions, but when the marchers arrived at Bolotnaya Square it turned out that barriers installed by the police had narrowed the entrance to the meeting venue allegedly restricting the space allocated for the meeting. To control the crowd the police cordon forced the protestors to remain within the barriers. There were numerous clashes between the police and protesters. At 5.30 p.m. the police ordered that the meeting finish early and began to disperse the participants. It took them about two hours to clear the protestors from the square.", "8.

No factual information excluding the detention of [the applicant] on health grounds has been submitted to the court. The court takes into account that [the applicant] may request medical assistance in the detention facility, if necessary ...\u201d", "12.

On 24 September 2012 the Basmannyy District Court extended the applicant\u2019s detention until 6 November 2012, having found that the circumstances that had justified the detention order had not changed. The District Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s allegations of lack of medical assistance in the remand prison as unsubstantiated.

On the same day the District Court extended the applicant\u2019s detention until 6 July 2013. It considered that a milder preventive measure, including release on bail, would not prevent the applicant from obstructing the proper administration of justice. The applicant\u2019s allegations in respect of the deterioration of his health were dismissed; the court relied on the medical statement from the remand prison, according to which his health was satisfactory. On 17 April 2013 the Moscow City Court upheld the extension order.", "17.

Along with the seriousness of the charges, the court based its decision on the findings that \u201cthe reasons which had initially warranted the detention have not changed\u201d and that \u201cno other measures of restraint would secure the aims and goals of the judicial proceedings\u201d. The Moscow City Court upheld this extension order on 2 July 2013.", "19. On 2 August 2013 the Presidium of the Moscow City Court examined the supervisory appeal lodged by the Ombudsman of the Russian Federation.

On 28 October 2013 the Moscow City Court upheld this decision on appeal.", "21.
