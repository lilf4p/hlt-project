During 1991 and 1992 Serbian paramilitary forces gained control of about a third of the territory of Croatia and proclaimed the \u201cSerbian Autonomous Region of Krajina\u201d (Srpska autonomna oblast Krajina, hereinafter \u201cKrajina\u201d). At the beginning of August 1995 the Croatian authorities announced their intention to take military action with the aim of regaining control over Krajina. The operation was codenamed \u201cStorm\u201d (Oluja) and took place from 4 to 7 August 1995. Before the military action, the vast majority of the population of Krajina fled Croatia. Most of them went to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and also to Serbia. Some returned to Croatia after the war. The number of people who fled is estimated at between 100,000 and 150,000.", "7. On 5 November 1997 Croatia ratified the Convention.", "8. The documents submitted by the parties reveal the following facts.", "9. The applicants lived in Knin, within the territory of Krajina.

On 25 April 2001, during the exhumations at the \u201cNew Cemetery\u201d (Novo groblje) in Knin, the first applicant approached the police and said that her husband, J.T., had been buried at that cemetery. The \u0160ibenik-Knin Police Department, Knin Police Station (Policijska uprava \u0161ibensko-kninska, Policijska postaja Knin), then interviewed the first applicant about the circumstances of the death of her husband. She stated that her husband had died on 5 August 1995 near a petrol station in Knin. Given that Knin had been under artillery attack, the first applicant assumed that her husband had been killed by a shell. She further stated that she had seen her husband\u2019s dead body lying on the pavement near the above-mentioned petrol station. She gave a detailed description of his appearance and of the clothes he had been wearing. Members of the Croatian army appeared at the crime scene and took the first applicant to a UNPROFOR (United Nations Protection Force) camp in Knin. She had obtained no further knowledge of the whereabouts of her husband\u2019s body. She assumed that he was buried at a cemetery in Knin.", "11. A number of remains were exhumed during May and June 2001 at the cemetery in Knin.

On 20 June 2001 the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia issued an autopsy report which concluded that the probable cause of the death for the remains which were only in 2010 identified as being those of J.T., was a gunshot to the neck.", "12.

The police indicated that they had conducted interviews with Lj.M. and I.M. However, it was not possible to conduct an interview with the first applicant, since she resided in England.
