The Croatian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms \u0160. Sta\u017enik.", "3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "4. On 29 March 2001 an investigating judge of the Zagreb County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Zagrebu) opened an investigation in respect of the applicant and another person in connection with a suspicion of economic crime.", "5. The applicant appealed against that decision on 9 April 2001, arguing that it had not been sufficiently established that he had committed the alleged offences at issue.", "6. On 26 April 2001 a three-judge panel of the Zagreb County Court, composed of Judges S.P.L., T.I.T. and S.B.B., dismissed his appeal and upheld the decision of the investigating judge on the grounds that a sufficient degree of reasonable suspicion existed to warrant the opening of an investigation.", "7. Following the investigation, on 21 February 2002 the Zagreb Municipal State Attorney\u2019s Office (Op\u0107insko dr\u017eavno odvjetni\u0161tvo u Zagrebu) indicted the applicant and another person in the Zagreb Municipal Criminal Court (Op\u0107inski kazneni sud u Zagrebu) on charges of misfeasance in business.", "8.

The Zagreb Municipal State Attorney\u2019s Office challenged this judgment, with an appeal lodged before the Zagreb County Court on 17 July 2007, arguing that the sentence was too lenient.", "10. On 31 July 2007 the applicant also lodged an appeal against the judgment, alleging numerous substantive and procedural flaws.", "11. An appeal hearing before a panel of judges of the Zagreb County Court, composed of Judges S.B.B., L.S. and T.I.T., was held on 29 January 2008. The applicant and his lawyer were present at the hearing. They did not object to the composition of the appeal panel.", "12. On the same day the Zagreb County Court quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case on the grounds of insufficient reasoning in the judgment.", "13. Following a retrial, on 13 November 2008 the Zagreb Municipal Criminal Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to ten months\u2019 imprisonment, suspended for two years.", "14. The applicant appealed to the Zagreb County Court on 2 January 2009, alleging numerous substantive and procedural flaws in the first-instance judgment.", "15. At an appeal hearing held on 17 November 2009 before a panel of judges of the Zagreb County Court, composed of Judges S.B.B., L.S. and T.I.T., the applicant and his lawyer reiterated the appeal arguments.

On the same day the Zagreb County Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal as ill-founded and upheld the first-instance judgment.", "17. On 26 February 2010 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) complaining, inter alia, that the appeal court had not been impartial owing to the fact that Judges S.B.B. and T.I.T. had sat on the panel which had dismissed his appeal, and the same judges had previously upheld the decision to open an investigation against him in connection with the same offences.", "18. On 9 May 2013 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint as ill-founded on the grounds that the questions which Judges S.B.B. and T.I.T. had had to answer when deciding on the opening of an investigation against him differed from those questions which they had examined upon his appeal against the first-instance judgment adopted after a hearing on the merits of the charges held against him. The Constitutional Court therefore considered that there was nothing to warrant calling into question the impartiality of these particular judges.", "19. The decision of the Constitutional Court was sent to the applicant\u2019s representative on 10 June 2013.", "20.
