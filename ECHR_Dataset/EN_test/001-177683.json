The first applicant left his village in Mali on account of the 2012 armed conflict. He arrived in Morocco in March 2013. He spent approximately nine months in the makeshift camp for migrants on Gurugu Mountain, near the Spanish border crossing into Melilla, a Spanish enclave on the North African coast. He spoke of several raids on the camp by the Moroccan law-enforcement authorities.", "11. The second applicant arrived in Morocco in late 2012. He also stayed in the camp on Gurugu Mountain.", "12. On 13 August 2014 the applicants left the Gurugu Mountain camp and attempted to enter Spain as part of a group of sub-Saharan migrants, via the Melilla border crossing. The crossing comprises three successive fences: two six-metre-high outer fences and a three-metre-high inner fence. A system of infrared CCTV cameras and movement sensors is in place. The applicants and other migrants scaled the first fence in the morning. They claimed that stones had been thrown at them by the Moroccan authorities. The first applicant managed to climb to the top of the third fence, and remained there until the afternoon without medical or legal assistance. The second applicant stated that he had been hit by a stone while climbing the first fence and had fallen, but had subsequently succeeded in climbing over the first two fences. During this time the applicants allegedly witnessed violence against some of the sub-Saharan migrants by the Spanish Guardia Civil and Moroccan law-enforcement officials. At around 3 p.m. and 2 p.m. respectively the first and second applicants climbed down from the third fence, assisted by Spanish law-enforcement officials. As soon as they reached the ground they were apprehended by members of the Guardia Civil, who handcuffed them and sent them back to Morocco. At no point were the applicants\u2019 identities checked. They had no opportunity to explain their personal circumstances or to be assisted by lawyers, interpreters or medical personnel.", "13. The applicants were then transferred to Nador police station, where they requested medical assistance. Their request was refused. They were subsequently taken, together with other individuals who had been returned in similar circumstances, to Fez, some 300 km from Nador, where they were left to fend for themselves. The applicants stated that between 75 and 80 migrants from sub-Saharan Africa had also been returned to Morocco on 13 August 2014.", "14. Journalists and other witnesses were at the scene of the assault on the fences and the expulsions of 13 August 2014. They provided video footage which the applicants submitted to the Court.
