GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6-2 - Charged with a criminal offence)", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Andr\u00e9 Potocki;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Mark Villiger;Vincent A. De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["5. The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Xanten.", "6. The applicant\u2019s daughter A. was born on 9 March 1994. Since their separation in September 1994, the applicant and A.\u2019s mother, Ms J., have been quarrelling over the custody of and contacts with A. The child was initially living with her mother. In 2004, A. was placed in a home.", "7. On 9 November 2006 Ms J. laid an information against the applicant with the police, accusing him of having raped their daughter since 1998. As A. had persistently declared not to be ready to make a statement before the police, the proceedings were initially discontinued. Following a visit of A. to her mother, the latter informed the police that A. was now ready to testify. A. was heard by the police twice in May 2007. On 5 November 2007 psychological expert K., having examined A., submitted a report on the credibility of A.\u2019s submissions.", "8. On 18 January 2008 the M\u00fcnster Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office charged the applicant with fifteen counts of serious sexual abuse of children (Article 176a of the Criminal Code, see paragraph 19 below) and of sexual abuse of a person entrusted to him for upbringing (Article 174 of the Criminal Code, see paragraph 20 below), his daughter A., committed between the beginning of 2002 and summer 2004 mostly in or in the vicinity of Senden. The applicant was accused of having raped A. in his car on thirteen occasions and in a holiday apartment on two occasions when he met her on weekends and during vacations following her parents\u2019 separation.", "9. The applicant was in detention on remand between 14 February 2008 and 26 February 2008, when the execution of the detention order was suspended.", "10. On 17 September 2008 the M\u00fcnster Regional Court, having held five hearings, acquitted the applicant of the charges on account of insufficiency of proof. It further ordered the Treasury to bear the costs of the proceedings and the applicant\u2019s necessary expenses and to pay the applicant compensation for his detention on remand from 14 to 26 February 2008.", "11. The Regional Court, having regard to the testimonies of several witnesses and the (diverging) reports of two psychological experts, K. and B., on the credibility of A.\u2019s submissions, found that the offences the applicant had been charged with had not been proven with the certainty necessary for a criminal conviction. It noted that the applicant had contested the charges. He was only incriminated by A.\u2019s statements. The Regional Court stated that it has not been convinced by A.\u2019s testimony in the hearing that the charges were completely correct, in particular, in terms of a clear definition of the criminal acts and their time frame.", "12. The Regional Court, having regard to the witness statements of two educators who had noted signs of sexual abuse in A.\u2019s conduct, two psychologists who had treated A. and a friend of A., was not persuaded that A. had been influenced by third persons, including her mother, so as to incriminate her father.", "13. The Regional Court then stated in its judgment:", "\u201c... To sum up, the Chamber does not discern any signs of suggestive influence.", "Therefore, the Chamber assumes, in sum, that the core events described by the witness have a factual basis, that is, that the accused actually carried out sexual assaults on his daughter in his car. Nevertheless, the acts could not be substantiated, in terms of either their intensity or their time frame, in a manner that would suffice to secure a conviction. The inconsistencies in the witness\u2019s testimony were so marked that it was impossible to establish precise facts.\u201d", "[\u201c... Zusammengefasst sind Anhaltspunkte einer Suggestion f\u00fcr die Kammer nicht ersichtlich.", "So geht die Kammer im Ergebnis davon aus, dass das von der Zeugin geschilderte Kerngeschehen einen realen Hintergrund hat, n\u00e4mlich dass es tats\u00e4chlich zu sexuellen \u00dcbergriffen des Angeklagten zu Lasten seiner Tochter in seinem Auto gekommen ist. Die Taten lie\u00dfen sich aber dennoch weder ihrer Intensit\u00e4t noch ihrer zeitlichen Einordnung nach in einer f\u00fcr eine Verurteilung hinreichenden Art und Weise konkretisieren. Die Inkonstanzen in den Aussagen der Zeugin waren so gravierend, dass konkrete Feststellungen nicht getroffen werden konnten.\u201c]", "14. In coming to that conclusion, the Regional Court took into account that witness A. had made the impression of being authentic. It was true that her statements had been short and she had appeared being relatively uninvolved. However, seven witnesses who knew A. partly for a longer period of time had confirmed that she generally spoke and acted in that manner and did not discuss problems in detail.", "15. The Regional Court observed, however, that even having regard to these elements, the inconsistencies in witness A.\u2019s statements prevailed to an extent that it was not in a position to establish concrete offences. There were inconsistencies in the witness\u2019s statements on the number of the acts described by her (between 25 and 50), the place of these acts (notably concerning acts in a holiday apartment which the witness mentioned only at a later stage) and the time frame in which they took place (starting when the witness was between four and eight and ending either on the witness\u2019s placement in the home or continuing also after that placement). Moreover, A. had been uncertain in the hearing about the exact manner in which the acts described by her were committed in the car and did not recall any details on several points. A. had, for instance, been very uncertain in the hearing whether the applicant had moved within the car onto the front passenger seat where she had sat or whether he had left the car and walked around it to come on her seat. Moreover, A. had declared several times in the hearing not to have any precise recollection of the events any more.", "16. The judgment was served on the applicant\u2019s counsel on 11 November 2008 and subsequently became final.", "17. On 9 December 2008 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court. He claimed that the Regional Court\u2019s statements \u201cthat the core events described by the witness have a factual basis, that is, that the accused actually carried out sexual assaults on his daughter in his car\u201d had breached his constitutional right to a fair trial, his personality rights and human dignity.", "18. On 10 March 2009 the Federal Constitutional Court declined to consider the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint (file no. 2 BvR 2499/08). The decision was served on the applicant\u2019s counsel on 19 March 2009."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
