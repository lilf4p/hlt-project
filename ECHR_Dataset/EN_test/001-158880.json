De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["6. The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Weinheim.", "7. On 18 and 19 July 2005 the applicant, who campaigns against abortion, distributed leaflets in the immediate vicinity of the medical practices of anesthetists Dr M. and Dr R., who run a day clinic. Furthermore, the applicant deposited leaflets in all letterboxes in the vicinity of the day clinic.", "8. The front page of the leaflets contained the following text in bold letters:", "\u201cIn the day clinic Dr M./Dr R. [full names and address] unlawful abortions are performed\u201d (\u201cIn der Tagesklinik Dr.M./Dr.R. [...] werden rechtswidrige Abtreibungen durchgef\u00fchrt\u201d)", "9. Followed by an explanation set in smaller letters:", "\u201cwhich are, however, allowed by the German legislator and are not subject to criminal liability. The attestation of counselling protects the \u201cdoctor\u201d and the mother from criminal responsibility, but not from their responsibility before God.\u201d (\u201cdie aber der deutsche Gesetzgeber erlaubt und nicht unter Strafe stellt. Der Beratungsschein sch\u00fctzt \u201eArzt\u201c und Mutter vor Strafverfolgung, aber nicht vor der Verantwortung vor Gott.\u201c)", "10. A box below contained the following text:", "\u201cAccording to international criminal law: murder is the intentional \u201cbringing-to-death\u201d of an innocent human being!\u201d (\u201cSinngem\u04d3\u03b2 aus den internationalen Strafgesetzen: Mord ist das vors\u04d3tzliche \u201cZu-Tode-Bringen\u201d eines unschuldigen Menschen!\u201d)", "11. On the back of the folded leaflet, the applicant quoted the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s leading judgment with regard to abortion (see paragraph 28 below) as well as a statement by ChristophWilhelm Hufeland, the personal physician of Goethe and Schiller, dealing with the role of doctors in relation to voluntary euthanasia and abortion. He also cited section 12 \u00a7 1 of the Law on Conflicts in Pregnancy (see paragraph 27 below) and asked readers to make use of their influence on those performing and assisting in abortions.", "Furthermore, the following text appeared on the back of the folded leaflet:", "\u201cThe murder of human beings in Auschwitz was unlawful, but the morally degraded NS-State allowed the murder of innocent people and did not make it subject to criminal liability.\u201d (\u201cDie Ermordung der Menschen in Auschwitz war rechtswidrig, aber der moralisch verkommene NS-Staat hatte den Mord an den unschuldigen Menschen erlaubt und nicht unter Strafe gestellt.\u201d)", "12. Below this sentence the leaflet referred to the website \u201cwww.babycaust.de\u201d. This website, which was operated by the applicant, contained, inter alia, an address list of so-called \u201cabortion doctors\u201d, in which the day clinic and the full names of Dr M. and Dr R. were mentioned. This list was accessible on the website under the link \u201cdeath or life\u201d/\u201crequest for prayers for Germany\u201d (Gebetsanliegen f\u00fcr Deutschland).", "13. Dr M. and Dr R. filed a request for a civil injunction against the applicant. They submitted that only legal abortions were performed at their day clinic. The applicant\u2019s leaflet created the erroneous impression that the abortions performed were contrary to the relevant legal provisions.", "14. On 22 January 2007 the Ulm Regional Court granted the requested injunction and ordered the applicant to desist from further disseminating in the immediate vicinity of the day clinic leaflets containing the plaintiffs\u2019 names and the assertion that unlawful abortions were performed in the plaintiffs\u2019 medical practice. The Regional Court further ordered the applicant to desist from mentioning the plaintiffs\u2019 names and address in the list of \u201cabortion doctors\u201d on the website \u201cwww.babycaust.de\u201d.", "15. The Regional Court considered that the statements in the applicant\u2019s leaflet made the incorrect allegation that abortions were performed outside the legal conditions. This was not called into question by the further explanation that the abortions were not subject to criminal liability, as the whole layout of the leaflet was intended to draw the reader\u2019s attention to the first sentence set in bold letters, while the further additions were set in smaller letters with the intent of dissimulating their content. The Regional Court further considered that by singling out the plaintiffs, who had not given him any reasons to do so, the applicant had created a socalled \u201cpillory effect\u201d. The allegations raised by the applicant seriously interfered with the plaintiffs\u2019 personality rights. It followed that the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression had to cede.", "16. The Regional Court considered that the same principles applied to the mentioning of the plaintiffs\u2019 names on the website entitled \u201cbabycaust.de\u201d. This implied a connection between the plaintiffs and crimes which were, according to the applicant, comparable to the crimes committed by the Nazis during the Holocaust, and was not covered by the applicant\u2019s freedom of expression and had thus not to be tolerated by the plaintiffs.", "17. On 27 October 2007 the Stuttgart Court of Appeal rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal. It did not find it necessary to examine whether the text of the leaflets had to be qualified as a statement of facts or as an expression of opinion as, in any event, the applicant\u2019s freedom of opinion had to cede. The Court of Appeal confirmed the Regional Court\u2019s assessment that the text in the leaflet implied that the plaintiffs performed unlawful actions. This was not called into question by the further explanations, as the average reader could not be expected to draw the distinction between the act of abortion which was justified under Article 218a \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code and the act of abortion which was merely exempt from prosecution under Article 218a \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 26 below). Seen from a layman\u2019s point of view, the text of the leaflet created the impression that the act of abortion, as permitted by the German legislator, amounted to unlawful homicide, or even to murder. The statement was at the very least ambiguous and had not to be tolerated by the plaintiffs.", "18. Even if one were to assume that the leaflet did not contain a wrong statement of facts, the applicant\u2019s freedom of expression had to cede. The Court of Appeal reiterated that freedom of expression conveyed the right to express an opinion even in an offending, shocking or disturbing way. If the expression of opinion was part of a debate on matters of public interest, there was an assumption militating in favour of freedom of expression. However, in the instant case the applicant had created a massive \u201cpillory effect\u201d by singling out the plaintiffs, who had not given the applicant any reason to do so. The performance of abortions was criticised with harsh and rigid words. This was further aggravated by the Holocaust reference. The Court of Appeal further noted that the applicant was not under any specific pressure to express his general criticism of the facilitation of abortions with such a massive violation of the plaintiffs\u2019 personality rights.", "19. The Court of Appeal further considered that it had not been necessary for the plaintiffs to submit the exact content of the website, as this website was generally accessible and its content was thus known. It then went on to state:", "\u201cThe content of the webpage is likewise characterised by the fact that the defendant labels individuals, including the plaintiffs, \u201cabortion doctors\u201d and puts their actions on a level with the national-socialist Holocaust and with mass murder. Therefore, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim to compel the defendant to refrain from performing the impugned action must be granted. In that connection, the court refers to its above reasoning. Furthermore, the defendant himself admitted that he had, on the webpage, labelled the plaintiffs \u201cabortion doctors\u201d who are directly or indirectly involved in the performance of abortions.\u201d", "20. The Court of Appeal did not grant leave to appeal on points of law.", "21. On 12 February 2008 the Federal Court of Justice refused the applicant\u2019s request for legal aid, on the ground that the applicant\u2019s intended appeal on points of law lacked sufficient prospect of success.", "22. On 17 March 2008 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the judgments of the Ulm Regional Court, of the Stuttgart Court of Appeal and against the decision of the Federal Court of Justice. He complained, in particular, that the impugned decisions violated his right to freedom of expression.", "23. On 2 July 2009 the Federal Constitutional Court, sitting as a Committee of three judges, refused to admit the applicant\u2019s complaint for adjudication for being inadmissible, without providing reasons (no. 1 BvR 671/08). This decision was served on the applicant\u2019s counsel on 18 July 2009.", "24. On 8 June 2010 the Federal Constitutional Court, sitting as a Committee of three judges, granted a further constitutional complaint of the applicant dealing with another set of proceedings before the Munich Regional Court and the Munich Court of Appeal (no. 1 BvR 1745/06). In this set of proceedings the courts had granted a civil injunction against the applicant, as the Ulm Regional Court and the Stuttgart Court of Appeal had done in the present case. They had ordered him, inter alia, to desist from disseminating leaflets similar to the ones now in dispute in the immediate vicinity of another gynaecological practice and to desist from publishing on his webpage the information that the doctor in question had performed or assisted in \u201cunlawful\u201d abortions.", "25. The Federal Constitutional Court held that the civil injunction had violated the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression as provided in Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the German Basic Law (Grundgesetz) because the civil courts had not sufficiently taken into account that the doctor, who had himself publicly announced on the Internet that he performed abortions in his gynaecological practice, had not been confronted with an extensive loss of social reputation as a result of the applicant\u2019s activities. Furthermore, it underlined that the applicant had only blamed the doctor for having carried out allegedly immoral acts, but had not reproached him for having committed acts which were subject to criminal liability or forbidden by law in a wider sense. The Federal Constitutional Court moreover insisted on the fact that the applicant had contributed to a highly controversial debate of public interest and pointed out that, against the factual background of that case, the courts had not sufficiently clarified why and to what extent the special relationship between the doctor and women searching for counselling and medical treatment in the practice might have been jeopardised."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
