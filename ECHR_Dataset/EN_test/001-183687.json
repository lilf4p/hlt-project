The applicant was born in 1971 and is currently detained in the Internment Facility at the US Guant\u00e1namo Bay Naval Base in Cuba.", "16. It is to be noted that in the present case involving, as the applicant\u2019s previous application before the Court, complaints of secret detention and torture to which the applicant was allegedly subjected during the extraordinary rendition operations by the United States authorities (see paragraphs 19-88 below) the Court is deprived of the possibility of obtaining any form of direct account of the events complained of from the applicant (see Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 397; and Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 397; see also paragraph 90 below).", "As in Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland and Al Nashiri v. Poland (both cited above), in the present case the facts as adduced by the applicant were to a considerable extent a reconstruction of dates and other elements relevant to his rendition, detention and treatment in the US authorities\u2019 custody, based on various publicly available sources of information. The applicant\u2019s version of the facts as stated in his initial application of 14 July 2011 evolved and partly changed during the proceedings before the Court (see paragraphs 111-117 below).", "The respondent Government contested the applicant\u2019s version of the facts on all accounts, maintaining that there was no evidence demonstrating that they had occurred in Lithuania (see paragraphs 398-405 and 423-446 below).", "17. In consequence, the facts of the case as rendered below (see paragraphs 90-211 below) are based on the applicant\u2019s account supplemented by various items of evidence in the Court\u2019s possession.", "90. In the application and further written pleadings, the applicant\u2019s lawyers stressed that restrictions on information regarding the entirety of Abu Zubaydah\u2019s detention necessarily meant that the case presented a range of complex, unusual and at times unique characteristics that the Court should be aware of in its consideration. In their view, several factors heightened the already significant challenges related to uncovering and presenting evidence in the case.", "First, the clandestine nature of the rendition operations coupled with a concerted cover-up intended to withhold or destroy any evidence relating to the rendition programme inherently limited the applicant\u2019s ability to produce evidence in his case.", "Second, the lack of any meaningful investigation by the Lithuanian authorities, in whose hands much of the necessary information rested, impeded access to evidence and information.", "Third, they referred to what they called \u201cthe unprecedented restrictions on communication\u201d between Mr Abu Zubaydah, his counsel and the Court, which \u201cprecluded the presentation of information or evidence directly from or in relation to the client\u201d. Only the applicant\u2019s US counsel with top-secret security clearance could meet with the applicant and all information obtained from him was presumptively classified. In consequence, counsel could not disclose to other members of the legal team or to the Court any information obtained from the applicant or other classified sources without obtaining the declassification of that information by the US authorities.", "According to the applicant\u2019s lawyers, \u201cAbu Zubaydah [was] a man deprived of his voice, barred from communicating with the outside world or with this Court and from presenting evidence in support of his case\u201d. For that reason, his story was therefore to be told and the case was presented on his behalf by reference principally to publicly available documentation (see also Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 80).", "91. As regards the events preceding the applicant\u2019s secret detention in Poland, i.e. his capture in Faisalabad, Pakistan on 27 March 2002 and his initial detention from that date to 4 December 2002, in Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland the Court held as follows:", "\u201c404. In the light of the above first-hand CIA documentary evidence and clear and convincing expert evidence, the Court finds established beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant, following his capture on 27 March 2002, was detained in the CIA detention facility in Bangkok from an unknown date following his capture to 4 December 2002, that Mr Al Nashiri was also held in the same facility from 15 November 2002 to 4 December 2002 and that they were both moved together to \u2018another CIA black site\u2019 on 4 December 2002 (see also Al Nashiri, cited above, \u00a7 404).\u201d", "The experts, Senator Marty and Mr J.G.S., heard by the Court at the factfinding hearing in Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland and Al Nashiri v. Poland identified the detention facility in Bangkok, Thailand as the one referred to in CIA declassified documents under the codename \u201cCat\u2019s Eye\u201d or \u201cCatseye\u201d (see Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 403; and Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 403). In the 2014 US Senate Committee Report that facility is referred to as \u201cDetention Site Green\u201d.", "92. The 2014 US Senate Committee Report relates the events concerning the applicant\u2019s capture and initial detention as follows:", "\u201cIn late March 2002, Pakistani government authorities, working with the CIA, captured Qa\u2019ida facilitator Abu Zubaydah in a raid during which Abu Zubaydah suffered bullet wounds. At that time, Abu Zubaydah was assessed by CIA officers in ALEC Station, the office within the CIA with specific responsibility for al-Qa\u2019ida, to possess detailed knowledge of al-Qa\u2019ida terrorist attack plans. However, as is described in greater detail in the full Committee Study, this assessment significantly overstated Abu Zubaydah\u2019s role in al-Qa\u2019ida and the information he was likely to possess.", "...", "In late March 2002, anticipating its eventual custody of Abu Zubaydah, the CIA began considering options for his transfer to CIA custody and detention under the MON. The CIA rejected U.S. military custody [REDACTED] in large part because of the lack of security and the fact that Abu Zubaydah would have to be declared to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The CIA\u2019s concerns about custody at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, included the general lack of secrecy and the \u2018possible loss of control to US military and/or FBI\u2019. ...", "Over the course of four days, the CIA settled on a detention site in Country [REDACTED] because of that country\u2019s [REDACTED] and the lack of U.S. court jurisdiction. The only disadvantages identified by the CIA with detention in Country [REDACTED] were that it would not be a \u2018USG-controlled facility\u2019 and that \u2018diplomatic/policy decisions\u2019 would be required. As a[t] March 28, 2002, CIA document acknowledged, the proposal to render Abu Zubaydah to Country [name REDACTED] had not yet been broached with that country\u2019s officials. ...", "The decision to detain Abu Zubaydah at a covert detention facility in Country [REDACTED] did not involve the input of the National Security Council Principals Committee, the Department of State, the U.S. ambassador, or the CIA chief of Station in Country. On March 29, 2002, an email from the Office of the Deputy DCI stated that \u2018[w]e will have to acknowledge certain gaps in our planning/preparations, but this is the option the DDCI will lead with for POTUS consideration\u2019. That morning, the president approved moving forward with the plan to transfer Abu Zubaydah to Country [REDACTED]. During the same Presidential Daily Brief (PDB) session, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld suggested exploring the option of putting Abu Zubaydah on a ship; however, CIA records do not indicate any further input from the principals. That day, the CIA Station in Country obtained the approval of Country\u2019s [REDACTED] officials for the CIA detention site. ... Shortly thereafter, Abu Zubaydah was rendered from Pakistan to Country [REDACTED] where he was held at the first CIA detention site, referred to in this summary as \u2018DETENTION SITE GREEN\u2019.\u201d", "93. The report cited a CIA cable dated April 2002 relating the applicant\u2019s physical conditions of detention as follows:", "\u201c[REDACTED] a cable described Abu Zubaydah\u2019s cell as white with no natural lighting or windows, but with four halogen lights pointed into the cell. An air conditioner was also in the room. A white curtain separated the interrogation room from the cell. The interrogation cell had three padlocks. Abu Zubaydah was also provided with one of two chairs that were rotated based on his level of cooperation (one described as more comfortable than the other). Security officers wore all black uniforms, including boots, gloves, balaclavas, and goggles to keep Abu Zubaydah from identifying the officers, as well as to prevent Abu Zubaydah \u2018from seeing the security guards as individuals who he may attempt to establish a relationship or dialogue with\u2019. The security officers communicated by hand signals when they were with Abu Zubaydah and used hand-cuffs and leg shackles to maintain control. In addition, either loud rock music was played or noise generators were used to enhance Abu Zubaydah\u2019s \u2018sense of hopelessness\u2019. Abu Zubaydah was typically kept naked and sleep deprived.\u201d", "94. The report states that on 3 August 2002 the CIA Headquarters informed the interrogation team at Detention Site Green that it had formal approval to apply the EITs, including waterboarding, against Abu Zubaydah. After Abu Zubaydah had been held in complete isolation for forty-seven days, the most aggressive interrogation phase began \u201cat approximately 11:50 a.m. on August 4, 2002\u201d. The report gives the following description of that particular interrogation session:", "\u201cSecurity personnel entered the cell, shackled and hooded Abu Zubaydah, and removed his towel (Abu Zubaydah was then naked). Without asking any questions, the interrogators placed a rolled towel around his neck as a collar, and backed him up into the cell wall (an interrogator later acknowledged the collar was used to slam Abu Zubaydah against a concrete wall). The interrogators then removed the hood, performed an attention grab, and had Abu Zubaydah watch while a large confinement box was brought into the cell and laid on the floor. A cable states Abu Zubaydah \u2018was unhooded and the large confinement box was carried into the interrogation room and paced [sic] on the floor so as to appear as a coffin\u2019. The interrogators then demanded detailed and verifiable information on terrorist operations planned against the United States, including the names, phone numbers, email addresses, weapon caches, and safe houses of anyone involved. CIA records describe Abu Zubaydah as appearing apprehensive. Each time Abu Zubaydah denied having additional information, the interrogators would perform a facial slap or face grab. At approximately 6:20 PM, Abu Zubaydah was waterboarded for the first time. Over a two-and-a half-hour period, Abu Zubaydah coughed, vomited, and had \u2018involuntary spasms of the torso and extremities\u2019 during waterboarding. Detention site personnel noted that \u2018throughout the process [Abu Zubaydah] was asked and given the opportunity to respond to questions about threats\u2019 to the United States, but Abu Zubaydah continued to maintain that he did not have any additional information to provide.\u201d", "95. From 4 August to 23 August 2002 the CIA interrogators subjected Abu Zubaydah to EITs on a near 24-hour-per-day basis. The report relates the following facts:", "\u201cThe use of the CIA\u2019s enhanced interrogation techniques \u2013 including \u2018walling, attention grasps, slapping, facial hold, stress positions, cramped confinement, white noise and sleep deprivation\u2019 \u2013 continued in \u2018varying combinations, 24 hours a day\u2019 for 17 straight days, through August 20, 2002. When Abu Zubaydah was left alone during this period, he was placed in a stress position, left on the waterboard with a cloth over his face, or locked in one of two confinement boxes. According to the cables, Abu Zubaydah was also subjected to the waterboard \u20182-4 times a day ... with multiple iterations of the watering cycle during each application\u2019.", "The \u2018aggressive phase of interrogation\u2019 continued until August 23, 2002. Over the course of the entire 20 day \u2018aggressive phase of interrogation\u2019, Abu Zubaydah spent a total of 266 hours (11 days, 2 hours) in the large (coffin size) confinement box and 29 hours in a small confinement box, which had a width of 21 inches, a depth of 2.5 feet, and a height of 2.5 feet. The CIA interrogators told Abu Zubaydah that the only way he would leave the facility was in the coffin-shaped confinement box.", "According to the daily cables from DETENTION SITE GREEN, Abu Zubaydah frequently \u2018cried\u2019, \u2018begged\u2019, \u2018pleaded\u2019, and \u2018whimpered\u2019, but continued to deny that he had any additional information on current threats to, or operatives in, the United States.", "By August 9, 2002, the sixth day of the interrogation period, the interrogation team informed CIA Headquarters that they had come to the \u2018collective preliminary assessment\u2019 that it was unlikely Abu Zubaydah \u2018had actionable new information about current threats to the United States\u2019. On August 10, 2002, the interrogation team stated that it was \u2018highly unlikely\u2019 that Abu Zubaydah possessed the information they were seeking. ...", "[REDACTED] DETENTION SITE GREEN cables describe Abu Zubaydah as \u2018compliant\u2019, informing CIA Headquarters that when the interrogator \u2018raised his eyebrow, without instructions\u2019, Abu Zubaydah \u2018slowly walked on his own to the water table and sat down\u2019. When the interrogator \u2018snapped his fingers twice\u2019, Abu Zubaydah would lie flat on the waterboard. Despite the assessment of personnel at the detention site that Abu Zubaydah was compliant, CIA Headquarters stated that they continued to believe that Abu Zubaydah was withholding threat information and instructed the CIA interrogators to continue using the CIA\u2019s enhanced interrogation techniques.", "[REDACTED] At times Abu Zubaydah was described as \u2018hysterical\u2019 and \u2018distressed to the level that he was unable to effectively communicate\u2019. Waterboarding sessions \u2018resulted in immediate fluid intake and involuntary leg, chest and arm spasms\u2019 and \u2018hysterical pleas\u2019. In at least one waterboarding session, Abu Zubaydah \u2018became completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth\u2019. According to CIA records, Abu Zubaydah remained unresponsive until medical intervention, when he regained consciousness and expelled \u2018copious amounts of liquid\u2019.\u201d", "According to the report, \u201cCIA records indicate that Abu Zubaydah never provided the information for which the CIA\u2019s enhanced interrogation techniques were justified and approved\u201d. Furthermore, \u201cas compared to the period prior to August 2002, the quantity and type of intelligence produced by Abu Zubaydah remained largely unchanged during and after the August 2002 use of the CIA enhanced interrogation techniques\u201d.", "96. The report also confirms that Abu Zubaydah and Al Nashiri were held at Detention Site Green until its closure in December 2002 and that they were then moved together to another CIA detention facility, Detention Site Blue. The relevant part of the report reads as follows:", "\u201cIn December 2002, when DETENTION SITE GREEN was closed, Al Nashiri and Abu Zubaydah were rendered to DETENTION SITE BLUE.\u201d", "97. As regards the events after 4 December 2002, in Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland (\u00a7 419) the Court held:", "\u201c419. Assessing all the above facts and evidence as a whole, the Court finds it established beyond reasonable doubt that:", "(1) on 5 December 2002 the applicant, together with Mr Al Nashiri arrived in Szymany on board the CIA rendition aircraft N63MU;", "(2) from 5 December 2002 to 22 September 2003 the applicant was detained in the CIA detention facility in Poland identified as having the codename \u2018Quartz\u2019 and located in Stare Kiejkuty;", "(3) during his detention in Poland under the HVD Programme he was \u2018debriefed\u2019 by the CIA interrogation team and subjected to the standard procedures and treatment routinely applied to High-Value Detainees in the CIA custody, as defined in the relevant CIA documents;", "(4) on 22 September 2003 the applicant was transferred by the CIA from Poland to another CIA secret detention facility elsewhere on board the rendition aircraft N313P.\u201d", "98. The events that took place between 5 December 2002 and 22 September 2003 at the CIA detention facility code-named \u201cQuartz\u201d and located in Poland correspond to the events that the 2014 US Senate Committee Report relates as occurring at \u201cDetention Site Blue\u201d (see paragraphs 24 above and 166 below; see also Al Nashiri v. Romania, cited above, \u00a7 101).", "99. The applicant submitted that on 22 September 2003 he had been transferred from Poland to a CIA detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. In Spring 2004, in anticipation of the US Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Rasul v. Bush granting Guant\u00e1namo detainees the right to legal counsel and habeas corpus review of their detention in a US federal court (see also paragraph 61 above), he had again been secretly transferred, this time to a facility in Morocco, where he had been detained incommunicado for almost a year.", "100. In that regard, he relied on a July 2011 report by the Associated Press stating that \u201caccording to two former US intelligence officials\u201d Abu Zubaydah had been held in \u201ca secret prison in Lithuania\u201d. Another press report indicated that his detention in Lithuania had followed his detention in Morocco.", "101. On the basis of their investigations, research and various material in the public domain, the experts heard by the Court at the fact-finding hearing reconstructed the chronology of the applicant\u2019s transfers and identified the countries of his secret detention in the period from 22 September 2003 to 17-18 February 2005.", "102. In the light of the material in the Court\u2019s possession the chronology of the applicant\u2019s detention can be described as follows.", "103. In Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) the Court, in its findings as to the applicant\u2019s transfer out of Poland considered, among other things, the collation of data from multiple sources, including flight plan messages concerning the N313P flight circuit executed through Poland on 22 September 2003 (see Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 109). Those data showed that N313P had travelled the following routes:", "Take-off Destination Date of flight", "Washington, DC (KIAD) Prague, Czech Republic (LKPR) 21 Sept 2003", "Prague, Czech Republic (LKPR) Tashkent, Uzbekistan (UTTT) 22 Sept 2003", "Tashkent, Uzbekistan (UTTT) Kabul, Afghanistan (OAKB) 21 Sept 2003", "Kabul, Afghanistan (OAKB) Szymany, Poland (EPSY) 22 Sept 2003", "Szymany, Poland (EPSY) Constan\u0163a, Romania (LRCK) 22 Sept 2003", "Constan\u0163a, Romania (LRCK) Rabat, Morocco (GMME) 23 Sept 2003", "Rabat, Morocco (GMME) Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba (MUGM) 24 Sept 2003", "104. Mr J.G.S., at the fact-finding hearing in the above case testified as follows (ibid. \u00a7 312):", "\u201cOne flight circuit however is of particular significance and this is the final part of our presentation in which we would like to discuss how the detention operations in Poland were brought to an end.", "In September 2003 the CIA rendition and detention programme underwent another overhaul analogous to the one which had taken place in December 2002 when Mr Nashiri and Mr Zubaydah were transferred from Thailand to Poland. On this occasion, the CIA executed a rendition circuit which entailed visiting no fewer than five secret detention sites at which CIA detainees were held. These included, in sequence, Szymany in Poland, Bucharest in Romania, Rabat in Morocco and Guant\u00e1namo Bay, a secret CIA compartment of Guant\u00e1namo Bay, having initially commenced in Kabul, Afghanistan. On this particular flight route, it has been found that all of the detainees who remained in Poland at that date were transferred out of Poland and deposited into the successive detention facilities at the onward destinations: Bucharest, Rabat and Guant\u00e1namo. Among those persons was one of the applicants today, Mr Zubaydah, who was taken on that date from Poland to Guant\u00e1namo Bay.", "This particular flight circuit was again disguised by dummy flight planning although significantly not in respect of Poland. It was the sole official declaration of Szymany as a destination in the course of all the CIA\u2019s flights into Poland. The reason therefor being that no detainee was being dropped off in Szymany on the night of 22 September and the methodology of disguising flight planning pertained primarily to those renditions which dropped a detainee off at the destination. Since this visit to Szymany was comprised solely of a pick-up of the remaining detainees, the CIA declared Szymany as a destination, openly, and instead disguised its onward destinations of Bucharest and Rabat, hence demonstrating that the methodology of disguised flight planning continued for the second European site in Bucharest, Romania and indeed for other detention sites situated elsewhere in the world.\u201d", "105. At the fact-finding hearing in the present case, in the course of the PowerPoint presentation, Mr J.G.S. testified as follows:", "\u201cAbu Zubaydah was the first high value detainee, he was arrested in late March 2002 in an operation in Faisalabad, Pakistan and was initially held in Thailand. We have established before this Court the mode of his transfer to Europe. First to Poland on 5 December 2002 and he was detained in that site for 292 days. ... We know that when he departed Poland on 22 September 2003 upon the closure of the site, that he did not go to Romania directly, he was rather held in both Guant\u00e1namo Bay, at the CIA facility there, and in Rabat \u2013 Morocco, for a period of over one year after his departure from Poland. Unlike Mr Nashiri whom we refer to in earlier proceedings [Al Nashiri v. Romania], when Zubaydah left Guant\u00e1namo he was taken back to the same site in Morocco at which he had previously been detained, Rabat \u2013 Morocco, the site which had been the subject of some acrimonious relations between the CIA and its Moroccan counterparts.", "It was in this site that Mr Zubaydah found himself in early 2005, specifically February 2005, when the aforementioned clear-out of Morocco took place and, as I stated, and connected with specific flight paths, the destination of his transfer out of Morocco was Lithuania.\u201d", "106. Mr J.G.S. further explained that the applicant was transferred from Guant\u00e1namo to Rabat on board rendition plane N85VM on 27 March 2004 and provided details of the flight circuit executed by that plane.", "In Mr J.G.S.\u2019 description, \u201cthe CIA facility at Guant\u00e1namo was cleared in March-April 2004 as the CIA sought to evade justice\u201d; in this respect he referred to the passage in the 2014 US Senate Report speaking of moving the CIA detainees from Guant\u00e1namo in anticipation of the US Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Rasul v. Bush (see also paragraph 61 above and paragraph 110 below).", "107. The N85VM flight on 27 March 2004 was the first part of the CIA double rendition circuit performed by that plane between 27 March and 13 April 2004. On the first circuit some prisoners, including the applicant, were transferred from Guant\u00e1namo to Rabat directly. The plane then returned to Washington on 29 March 2004. The second part of the circuit took place between 12 and 13 April 2004 and N85VM brought the remaining prisoners from Guant\u00e1namo via Tenerife, Spain to the CIA secret prison in Bucharest, Romania, returning to Washington via Rabat on 13 April 2004 (see also Al Nashiri v. Romania, no. 33234/12, \u00a7\u00a7 119-120, 31 May 2018).", "108. Mr Black, at the fact-finding hearing, testified as follows:", "\u201cWe know that Abu Zubaydah was in Poland and that he was transferred out of Poland in September 2003. The transfer that took him out of Poland in September 2003 had two possible destinations, one of which was Romania and one of which was Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Prima facie it is possible that he could have gone to either. In 2011 I received an off-the-record briefing and my take-away from this briefing, which I believe to be accurate, was that in the Summer of 2005 or before that Abu Zubaydah had not been held in Romania. It follows from this that Abu Zubaydah must therefore have been taken to Guant\u00e1namo on that flight in September 2003. We know that everyone who was taken there had to be moved out in March or April 2004. They were taken to Morocco. We also know that after a certain time in Morocco, the CIA had too many disagreements with the Moroccan Intelligence Agencies with regard to the treatment of prisoners in Morocco. This is dealt with at some length in the Senate Report. And so everyone who was in Morocco was moved out at the latest in February 2005.\u201d", "109. The 2014 US Senate Committee Report\u2019s section entitled \u201cCountry [name REDACTED] Detains Individuals on the CIA\u2019s Behalf\u201d reads, in so far as relevant, as follows:", "\u201cConsideration of a detention facility in Country [REDACTED] began in [month REDACTED] 2003, when the CIA sought to transfer Ramzi bin al-Shibh from the custody of a foreign government to CIA custody [REDACTED] which had not yet informed the country\u2019 political leadership of the CIA\u2019s request to establish a clandestine detention facility in Country [REDACTED], surveyed potential sites for the facility, while the CIA set aside [USD] [number REDACTED] million for its construction.", "In 2003, the CIA arranged for a \u2018temporary patch\u2019 involving placing two CIA detainees (Ramzi bin al-Shibh and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri) within an already existing Country [REDACTED] detention facility, until the CIA\u2019s own facility could be built.", "...", "By [day/month REDACTED] 2003, after an extension of five months beyond the originally agreed upon timeframe for concluding CIA detention activities in Country [REDACTED], both bin al-Shibh and al-Nashiri had been transferred out of Country [REDACTED] to the CIA detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.\u201d", "110. The report, in the section entitled \u201cUS Supreme Court Action in the case of Rasul v. Bush Forces Transfer of CIA Detainees from Guant\u00e1namo to Bay to Country [name REDACTED]\u201d (see also paragraph 61 above),states:", "\u201cBeginning in September 2003, the CIA held a number of detainees at CIA facilities on the grounds of, but separate from, the U.S. military detention facilities at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. In early January 2004, the CIA and the Department of Justice began discussing the possibility that a pending U.S. Supreme Court case Rasul v. Bush, might grant habeas corpus rights to the five CIA detainees then being held at a CIA detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Shortly after these discussions, CIA officers approached the [REDACTED] in Country [REDACTED] to determine if it would again be willing to host these CIA detainees, who would remain in CIA custody within an already existing Country [REDACTED] facility. By January [day REDACTED] 2004, the [REDACTED] in Country [REDACTED] had agreed to this arrangement for a limited period of time.", "Meanwhile, CIA General Counsel Scott Muller asked the Department of Justice, the National Security Council, and the White House Counsel for advice on whether the five CIA detainees being held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay should remain in Guant\u00e1namo Bay or be moved pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. After consultation with the U.S. solicitor general in February 2004, the Department of Justice recommended that the CIA move four detainees out of a CIA detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay pending the Supreme Court\u2019s resolution of the case. The Department of Justice concluded that a fifth detainee, Ibn Shaykh al-Libi, did not need to be transferred because he had originally been detained under military authority and had been declared to the ICRC. Nonetheless, by April [REDACTED two-digit number] 2004, all five CIA detainees were transferred from Guant\u00e1namo Bay to other CIA detention facilities.", "[REDACTED] Shortly after placing CIA detainees within already existing Country [REDACTED] facility for a second time, tensions arose between the CIA and [REDACTED] Country [REDACTED]. In [month REDACTED] 2004, CIA detainees in a Country [REDACTED] facility claimed to hear cries of pain from other detainees presumed to be in the [REDACTED] facility. When the CIA chief of Station approached the [REDACTED] about the accounts of the CIA detainees, the [REDACTED] stated with \u2018bitter dismay\u2019 that the bilateral relationship was being \u2018tested\u2019. There were also counterintelligence concerns relating to CIA detainee Ramzi bin al-Shibh, who had attempted to influence a Country [REDACTED] officer. These concerns contributed to a request from [REDACTED] in [month REDACTED] 2004 for the CIA to remove all CIA detainees from Country [REDACTED].", "[REDACTED] In [month REDACTED] 2004 the chief of Station in Country [REDACTED] again approached the [REDACTED] with allegations from CIA detainees about the mistreatment of Country [REDACTED] detainees [REDACTED] in the facility, the chief of Station received an angry response that, as he reported to CIA Headquarters, \u2018starkly illustrated the inherent challenges [of] [REDACTED]\u2019. According to the chief of Station, Country [REDACTED] saw the CIA as \u2018querulous and unappreciative recipients of their [REDACTED] cooperation\u2019. By the end of 2004, relations between the CIA and Country [REDACTED] deteriorated, particularly with regard to intelligence cooperation. The CIA detainees were transferred out of Country [REDACTED] in [name of month REDACTED; appears to have comprised eight characters] 2005.\u201d", "111. In his initial submissions of 14 July 2011 and 27 October 2011 the applicant maintained that the existence of a CIA secret prison in Lithuania had first been disclosed in August 2009, when ABC News had reported that according to \u201cformer CIA officials directly involved or briefed\u201d on the CIA HVD Programme, the Lithuanian authorities had provided the CIA with a building on the outskirts of Vilnius where terrorist suspects had been held for \u201cmore than a year\u201d (see also paragraph 257 below).", "112. He further submitted that after his rendition from Poland to Guant\u00e1namo on 22 September 2003 and from Guant\u00e1namo to Rabat in Spring 2004, he had been transferred from Rabat to Lithuania \u201cin early 2005\u201d. Relying on flight information supplied by the Lithuanian Civil Aviation Administration (Civilin\u0117s Aviacijos Administracija \u2013 \u201cCAA\u201d), Reprieve and Interights, he indicated two possible dates \u2013 17 February 2005 and 18 February 2005 \u2013 and two CIA rendition aircraft \u2013 N724CL and N787WH \u2013 on which he could have been transferred to Lithuania.", "113. On 10 September 2012 the applicant filed with the Court\u2019s Registry a pleading entitled \u201cAdditional Submission\u201d in which he rectified and supplemented information of his alleged rendition to and from Lithuania in the light of newly emerging materials in the public domain.", "114. As regards the alleged rendition to Lithuania on 17 February 2005 or 18 February 2005, the information produced by the applicant could be summarised as follows:", "(a) Between 15-19 February 2005, N787WH and N724CL, arranged by CSC, travelled from the USA to Lithuania via Morocco and back to the USA. No other flights of CIA-related aircraft have so far come to light connecting the three countries during or around this period;", "(b) Data from the Federal Aviation Authority and EuroControl showed that N787WH, a Boeing 737 operated by Victory Aviation Florida, executed the following flight circuit on 15-19 February 2005:", "Baltimore (KBWI) - Santa Maria, Azores (LPAZ) - Salzburg (LOWS) - Malaga (LEMG) - Rabat (GMME) - Constan\u0163a /Bucharest (LRCK / LRBS) - Palanga (EYPA) - Copenhagen (EKCH) - Gander (CYQX) - Baltimore (KBWI).", "(c) Data from the Federal Aviation Authority and EuroControl showed that another Boeing 727, registered as N724CL, followed a similar route to N787WH on its flight circuit executed on 15-18 February 2005:", "Van Nuys (KVNY) - Baltimore (KBWI) - Santa Maria, Azores (LPAZ) - Gran Canaria (GCLP) - Rabat (GMME) - Amman (OJAM) - Vilnius (EYVI) - Keflavik (BIKF) - Goose Bay (CYYR) - Baltimore (KBWI) - Van Nuys (KVNY).", "(d) Both planes travelled from the USA to Morocco; their paths then diverged, as N787WH went on to Romania and N724CL to Amman, Jordan. Both planes then re-converged on Lithuania, arriving within twentyfour hours of each other, before returning to the USA.", "115. In his initial submissions the applicant did not indicate any specific date of his rendition from Lithuania.", "116. In his Additional Submission of 10 September 2012 (see also paragraph 112 above), he stated that, according to public sources, the CIA \u201cblack site\u201d in Lithuania had been closed \u201cin the first half of 2006 and its occupants transferred to Afghanistan or other countries\u201d.", "The applicant indicated 25 March 2006 as the date of his rendition from Lithuania, which he linked with the flight circuit executed through Palanga Airport in Lithuania by the CIA rendition plane registered as N733MA on 23-27 March 2006. It was alleged that he had been transferred to Afghanistan by the so-called \u201cdouble-plane switch\u201d. This operation was executed by using two planes, each one of which completed only half the route so that the CIA prisoners could be transferred from one plane to another in an airport in which they converged. It involved N733MA and another CIA rendition aircraft registered as N740EH, which both made a connection in Cairo on the night of 26 March 2006.", "117. It was submitted that N733MA\u2019s landing in Palanga on 25 March 2006 had been mentioned in the Lithuanian Parliamentary inquiry. No further information about it was provided by the Parliamentary investigators, other than that \u201cno customs inspection was carried out\u201d and the border guard provided \u201cno records of the landing and inspection of this aircraft\u201d (see also paragraph 173 below).", "While an entry in the records of the Palanga Airport indicated that N733MA departed from Palanga to Porto, Portugal on 25 March 2006, the analysis of flight plan data released by PANSA and EuroControl showed that N733MA did not fly to Porto but proceeded to Cairo, Egypt. On 26 March 2006 in Cairo the plane converged with another Boeing 737 rendition aircraft registered as N740EH. Afterwards, N733MA travelled from Cairo to Heraklion, Greece. It had left Heraklion for Keflavik, Iceland in the morning of 27 March 2006. On 26 March 2006 N740EH, shortly after the arrival of N733MA in Cairo, took off from there for Kabul, Afghanistan. It then stopped briefly in Amman, Jordan and travelled to Heraklion, Greece. On 28 March 2006 it left Heraklion for Keflavik, Iceland.", "Both planes were chartered by CSC and operated by Miami Air International, Florida.", "118. The applicant produced flight and other data from multiple sources, including extracts from EuroControl and Lithuanian aviation authorities\u2019 flight records, flight messages regarding circuits executed by N787WH on 15-19 February 2005, N724CL on 15-18 February 2005 and the landing of N7333MA at Palanga Airport on 25 March 2006, as well as aircraft charter contracts concluded in respect of those flights.", "He also produced, among other things, flight data concerning the \u201cdouble-switch\u201d flight circuits executed by planes N308AB and N787WH between 4 and 7 October 2005 and by N733MA and N740EH on 2328 March 2006, the Report to the Lithuanian Government on the visit to Lithuania carried out by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCPT\u201d) from 14 to 18 June 2010 (\u201c2011 CPT Report\u201d) and the Briefing and Dossier for the Lithuanian Prosecutor General: CIA Detention in Lithuania and the Senate Intelligence Committee Report dated 11 January 2015 and prepared by Reprieve (\u201c2015 Reprieve Briefing\u201d).", "119.

The 2015 Reprieve Briefing states that the partially released 2014 US Senate Committee Report confirmed previous accounts of CIA secret detention in Lithuania and existing public source data on transfer dates of prisoners into and out of Lithuania and referred to prisoners held in Lithuania. The conclusions were as follows:", "(a) it was established beyond reasonable doubt that one of the facilities adapted by the CIA in Lithuania was used to hold prisoners;", "(b) prisoners were transferred into this facility in February and October 2005;", "(c) prisoners were transferred out of this facility in March 2006;", "(d) the transfers were carried out on planes contracted to Computer Sciences Corporation, all operating within a linked group of contracts.", "121. The document summarises key statements in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report relating to three CIA detention facilities referred to therein \u2013 Detention Site Black, Detention Site Violet and Detention Site Brown and, using also other public source data, concludes that Detention Site Violet was located in Lithuania. Also, on the basis of the number of the characters blackened in the redacted passages of the report, it attempts to decipher certain dates.", "The 2015 Reprieve Briefing\u2019s findings as to the operation of the CIA secret detention site in Lithuania and the flights indicated by the applicant as those on which he could have been transferred from Morocco to Lithuania and out of Lithuania can be summarised as follows.", "122. The Reprieve document provides the following information:", "(a) According to the 2014 US Senate Committee Report, CIA detainees were transferred to Detention Site Black in \u201cthe fall of 2003\u201d. The closure of that site was precipitated by revelations in the Washington Post, published on 2 November 2005 (see also paragraphs 149 and 256 below; see also Al Nashiri v. Romania, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 133 and 161). At this point the host country demanded \u201cwithin [two characters/digits redacted] hours\u201d the site\u2019s closure and the remaining detainees were transferred out of that country \u201cshortly thereafter\u201d;", "(b) Detention Site Violet, in a different country from \u201cBlack\u201d, opened \u201cin early 2005\u201d. The CIA conducted discussions with officials from \u201cViolet\u2019s\u201d host country; these discussions left one such official \u201cshocked\u201d but host country approval was nonetheless given for the facility. Evidently the CIA had originally constructed a \u201cholding cell\u201d in the same country as Detention Site Violet, which was not used. They then decided to \u201cbuild a new, expanded detention facility\u201d in the same country. Approval was provided by an official from that country. Money, in the amount of several million dollars, was also provided to that country, although this required the development of \u201ccomplex mechanisms\u201d to effect the transfer.", "(c) The first detainees were transferred to the expanded site \u201cViolet\u201d [fourteen lower-case characters redacted for the date]. This information corresponds to the flight data analysed by Reprieve, which indicates flights by two planes N787WH and N724CL, contracted by Computer Sciences Corporation, into Lithuania on 17 February and 18 February 2005 respectively. They came via Morocco, Romania and Jordan and were operating under the same renditions-specific contract.", "(d) Detention Site Violet was closed as a result of a lack of available medical care \u201cin [five lower-case characters redacted for the month] 2006.\u201d The CIA then transferred its remaining detainees to Detention Site Brown. At that point, all CIA detainees were located in Country [name redacted];", "(e) Detention Site Brown was in the same country as Detention Sites Cobalt, Gray and Orange. It first received detainees in \u201c[five lower-case characters redacted for the month] 2006\u201d. The 2014 US Senate Committee Report states that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was transferred into Detention Site Brown on \u201c[two characters redacted for the date] March 2006\u201d. Prior to this he was held in a different site, to which he had been transferred after being held at Detention Site Black. He was transferred from that site to site [six upper-case character redacted] in 2005, on a redacted date [eight lower- case characters redacted]. Detention Site Cobalt, on the basis of extensive reporting, can be firmly placed in Afghanistan. Detention Site Brown must therefore be in the same country.", "(f) A transfer of prisoners into Kabul, organised by the CSC within their rendition contracting network took place on 25-26 March 2006. The transfer came from Lithuania and used two planes \u2013 N733MA and N740EH travelling via Cairo. The former carried out the leg of the trip from Lithuania to Cairo, the latter from Cairo to Kabul.", "(g) The above March 2006 transfer matches the closure of Detention Site Violet which, according to the 2014 US Senate Committee Report, was closed as a result of lack of available medical care in [five characters for the month redacted] 2006. The five-character redacted month could only be \u201cMarch\u201d or \u201cApril\u201d on account of the length of the redaction. Of these two possibilities, March fits the data given in the report for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s transfer to Detention Site Brown.", "(h) The lack of medical care which caused the closure of Detention Site Violet seems to have affected Mustafa al-Hawsawi and \u201cfour other CIA detainees\u201d.", "(i) On 1 January 2006 the CIA were holding twenty-eight prisoners, divided between Detention Site Orange and Detention Site Violet.", "(j) Despite the redactions in the above citations, careful reading of the 2014 US Senate Committee Report alongside other public source documents supports the conclusions that:", "\u2013 Detention Site Black was in Romania;", "\u2013 Detention Site Violet was in Lithuania;", "\u2013 Detention Site Brown was in Afghanistan;", "\u2013 CIA detainees were first transferred into Detention Site Violet in February 2005;", "\u2013 Detainees were transferred out of Detention Site Violet into Detention Site Brown in March 2006.", "123. The Reprieve document states that the first transfer occurred in early 2005. The transfer could have been carried out on either or both of two planes (N787WH and N724CL), one from Morocco and Amman, one from Morocco and Bucharest, arriving in Lithuania on 17 and 18 February 2005 respectively.", "(a) N787WH and N724CL were operating under subcontract S1007312 to CSC. Their trips in February 2005 were task orders 20 and 21 of this subcontract.", "(b) Data from EuroControl shows N787WH\u2019s progress from the USA to Morocco, Romania, Lithuania and back.", "On 15 February 2005 it flew from Baltimore Washington International (KBWI) to Santa Maria, Azores (LPAZ). It then filed a flight plan to Munich (EDDM) but was impeded by snow and went instead to Salzburg (LOWS). On 17 February it left Salzburg in the afternoon and headed to Malaga (LEMG), where it paused until the middle of the night. It then left Malaga in the early hours of 18 February 2005, arriving in Rabat (GMME) around 02:40. After just over two hours in Rabat it proceeded to Romania, filing a flight plan into Constan\u0163a (LRCK) \u2013 although its flight plan for the next leg of the trip was filed not out of Constan\u0163a but out of Bucharest B\u0103neasa Airport (LRBS). It left Bucharest in the afternoon of 18 February 2005 and filed a false flight plan into Gothenburg, Sweden. Its true destination was Palanga where it arrived, according to an invoice for \u201cState Charge for Air and Terminal Navigations Services \u2013 Palanga\u201d, at 18:09.", "EuroControl and Palanga airport records both indicate that it left Palanga shortly afterwards, at 19:30, bound for Copenhagen. The plane paused overnight in Copenhagen, then continued to Gander, Canada (CYQX). Information released by the Federal Aviation Authority shows that it then returned to Baltimore International (KBWI/ BWI) and finally to its home base in Florida (FLL).", "(c) Although the Lithuanian Parliamentary Committee on National Security and Defence inquiry cited N787WH\u2019s flight from Bucharest to Palanga on 18 February 2005, the Committee was not aware of the plane\u2019s complete route, its contractual basis, or the identification of its contractual basis with rendition operations (see also paragraph 173 below).", "(d) N724CL\u2019s flight under the same subcontract occurred at the same time (16-17 February 2005) as the flight of N787WH and took a similar route: Rabat (GMME) \u2013 Amman (OJAM) \u2013 Vilnius (EYVI) \u2013 Keflavik (BIKF).", "124. The 2015 Reprieve Briefing states that prisoners were again transferred into Lithuania from Romania in October 2005. The document refers to the flight circuits executed by N308AB and N787WH on 17 October 2005.", "(a) Data from EuroControl shows that N308AB flew from Teterboro, New Jersey, to Slovakia on 4 October 2005. After an overnight stop it proceeded to Romania, filing a flight plan to Constan\u0163a on the evening of 5 October 2005. It left Romania soon afterwards (this time filing a flight plan out of Bucharest) and headed to Tirana, Albania.", "(b) An email and a \u201cpreliminary requirements\u201d document corresponding to this flight give further information, namely that on arrival in Romania the plane was to pick up two people (\u201cPU 2 PAX\u201d) in addition to the five people it had set off with. In Albania it was to \u201cDrop All PAX\u201d. The document instructs: \u201cMust have 3 pilots, NO Flight Attendants. At least a G-IV performance with 10 PAX capability. No customs help\u201d.", "(c) Flight data shows that on its drop-off in Albania N308AB was met by N787WH, which proceeded just over an hour later to Lithuania. N787WH disguised its route into Lithuania by filing a flight plan to Tallinn (EETN). The Vilnius Airport \u201cState Charge\u201d document incorrectly asserts that N787WH arrived from Tallinn, while another airport log shows that it did in fact arrive from Tirana.", "(d) On its arrival in Vilnius, as recorded by the Lithuanian Parliamentary Committee on National Security and Defence (see also paragraph 173 below), a border guard was prevented from carrying out his duties and checking the plane; he observed a vehicle drive away from it and exit the perimeter of the airport.", "125. The 2015 Reprieve Briefing states that the CIA prisoners were transferred out of Lithuania to Afghanistan in March 2006.", "(a) Two trips contracted by Computer Sciences Corporation on 2526 March 2006, involving planes N333MA and N740EH, connect Lithuania to Afghanistan and correspond to the closure of Detention Site Violet and the transfer of its prisoners to Detention Site Brown.", "(b) The Lithuanian parliamentary inquiry noted that N733MA had arrived in Palanga on 25 March 2006, coming from Porto, and that it had returned to Porto; no further information about it was provided, other than the facts that \u201cno customs inspection was carried out\u201d and the border guard provided \u201cno records of the landing and inspection of this aircraft\u201d. Investigation by Reprieve has established that, far from returning to Porto as recorded by officials at Palanga Airport, N733MA continued to Cairo, where it made a connection with N740EH. N740EH then proceeded to Kabul. Both planes were chartered by Computer Sciences Corporation and operated by Miami Air International, Florida.", "(c) Data provided by EuroControl shows that N740EH flew from New Castle, Delaware (KILG) to Marrakesh (GMMX) on 23 March 2006. There is no record of its subsequent movements until 26 March 2006. In the meantime, N733MA, having left Philadelphia International (KPHL), passed through Porto (LPPR), then filed a flight plan to Helsinki (EFHK) on the afternoon of 25 March.", "Instead of going to Helsinki, however, N733MA went to Palanga (EYPA), touching down at 22:25 local time (in close proximity to its scheduled arrival time of 20:38 GMT). It paused for 90 minutes in Palanga. Records from EuroControl and the Polish Air Navigation Authority both show that on leaving Palanga it went not to Porto, as the Lithuanian parliamentary inquiry was informed (see also paragraph 173 below), but to Cairo (HECA). Its scheduled arrival time in Cairo was 02:19 GMT on 26 March.", "(d) While N733MA was making its way to Palanga, N740EH was on its way to Cairo. Although records do not show when it arrived in Cairo, or from where, they do indicate that it left Cairo shortly after N733MA arrived there \u2013 at 02:45 GMT on 26 March 2006 \u2013 and that it went from Cairo to Kabul (OAKB), with an arrival time in Kabul of 08:32.", "N740EH then returned westwards from Kabul, pausing briefly in Amman (OJAI) before making a longer stop in Heraklion (LGIR). It arrived in Heraklion around 23:07 on 26 March 2006. N733MA had also flown to Heraklion direct from Cairo and was waiting there, having arrived at 04:59 the same day. Both planes left Heraklion for Keflavik (BIKF) \u2013 N733MA on the morning of 27 March 2006, and N740EH on the morning of 28 March 2006.", "(e) Documents relating to the planning of these two trips show complex attempts to disguise the fact that the purpose of the trips was to provide a connection between Lithuania and Afghanistan. Both trips were included in one invoice. Consistent with the other trips mentioned in the briefing, the invoice relates the task back to the original rendition subcontract.", "(f) The flight schedule accompanying the charter contract shows that both planes\u2019 destinations were kept secret up to the last minute.", "126. At the fact-finding hearing the experts, Mr J.G.S. and Mr Black, gave evidence on the alleged operation of the CIA secret detention facility in Lithuania, code-named \u201cDetention Site Violet\u201d in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report, the applicant\u2019s alleged rendition to Lithuania, his secret detention and his transfer out of the country. They replied to various questions from the judges and the parties. They testified as follows.", "127. In the course of the PowerPoint presentation Mr J.G.S., when explaining in general the rendition scheme operated by the CIA, characterised Lithuania as a \u201cdrop-off\u201d point for CIA detainees, which had served the purpose of hosting a detention facility. In particular, he stated:", "\u201cI wish to begin by setting out in the form of a graphic illustration the system in which such detention sites were situated. This is a system that spanned the entire globe but it had at its heart several hubs of operation here on the European continent. I am using a map of the world to show those present several categories of places at which aircraft landed in the course of the so-called \u2018war on terror\u2019.", "We categorised these landing points according to a set of criteria developed in 2006 whereby each landing point exhibited certain characteristics which allowed us to discern the purpose for which an aircraft landed there. The four categories as denoted are first stopover points where aircraft tended to stop shortly, primarily to refuel, staging points where often two or more aircraft would converge in their planning or preparation of specific detainee transfer operations, pick up points at which individual suspects, persons captured by the CIA, were taken on board rendition aircraft by CIA rendition crews in order to be flown to secret detention, in places of the last category detainee transfer or drop-off points.", "The original graphic on display here dates to 2006. We are in a position today to add one further detainee transfer drop-off point in Vilnius on the territory of the Republic of Lithuania. Having subsequently uncovered records of flights into and out of that territory and been able to devote an equal amount of rigour and attention to the underlying documents, we have found that Vilnius together with Szymany and Bucharest bore the character of a detainee drop-off point in the CIA\u2019s system of renditions. I will explain how that occurs by developing some of the analysis further.", "...", "Vilnius has been added here for the specific purpose of today\u2019s proceedings albeit that at the time in 2006 and 2007 we did not have sufficient information to place it on the original map. What we can say today about the CIA\u2019s operations of a \u2018black site\u2019 in Lithuania has increased considerably in scope and volume thanks to various declassifications, also various records obtained through court proceedings in the United States of America, and indeed through the diligent efforts of various Lithuanian partners who have investigated this issue since its first exposure in 2009 and 2010.", "... [F]or example ... this is a document on record before the court which attests to the landings of CIA rendition aircraft in Vilnius in the months of February and October 2005. This is significant and this was furnished in 2011 by the Lithuanian authorities themselves. It is significant because the aircraft denoted in these disclosures are not the same aircraft that carried out the bulk of the rendition operations in respect of Poland and Romania earlier in the life of the program.\u201d", "128. According to Mr J.G.S., the first CIA detainees were transferred to Lithuania in February 2005. He stated that 17-18 February 2005 had been the critical juncture at which CIA detention operations overseas had once again been dramatically overhauled and that the removal of CIA detainees from Morocco had led to the opening of their new \u201cblack site\u201d in Lithuania. Mr Zubaydah was transferred to Lithuania in February 2005. Other detainees were transferred to the country in October 2005. The closure of the site had been marked by the transfer of the CIA detainees, including the applicant, out of Lithuania on 25 March 2006. He referred to the following elements in support of his conclusions.", "129. He first referred to the \u201ccyclical nature\u201d of CIA secret detention sites and explained its relevance for the opening and closure of the CIA secret prison in Lithuania as follows:", "\u201cThe Court will recall my reference to the CIA\u2019s in-house aviation service providers. There was a shell company known as Aero Contractors that administered two aircraft N313P and N379P in the early years of the rendition programme and much of the planning for the flights was done by one provider Jeppesen Dataplan. In those early years therefore there is quite a consistent pattern to the execution of rendition operations and that certainly encompasses the timeframe of the Polish site \u2013from December 2002 until September 2003 \u2013 and it encompasses much of the operations at the Romanian site from September 2003 until November 2005. But in Lithuania we do not have any record of a single landing of either of those aircraft, the typical rendition aircraft: neither the Boeing Business Jet, nor the Gulfstream express plane which were used customarily in the early years. However, through these disclosures the Lithuanian records allow us to find out how the CIA developed its methodology, expanded its fleet and in some cases replaced its original operator with new contractors, new aircraft and new modus operandi.", "Among the routes flown by these new aircraft was the putative transfer of the applicant in today\u2019s proceedings into Lithuania in February of 2005. For reasons I have addressed in [Al Nashiri v. Romania] proceedings, Madam President, it stands to reason that February 2005 was another important juncture in the evolution of the CIA secret detention program. As I will demonstrate in my presentation the programme was cyclical in character: detention sites did not exist in perpetuity for the entire lifespan of the war on terror, rather the CIA tended to innovate and improvise to situations as it found them.", "Its earliest sites, in theatre, in a country like Afghanistan, they were able to last somewhat longer because of the context and often also because of the military support that they were able to draw upon, but in the cases of Thailand and Poland and Morocco and even Guant\u00e1namo Bay, extenuating circumstances caused by external factors, whether political, legal or reputational, led to the abrupt closure of detention sites at moments when the CIA had not necessarily planned for them to close.", "So the story of the secret detention programme includes several of these junctures at which one detention site closes abruptly and another opens in its place. However, that February 2005 fits into this pattern for the specific reason that in February 2005 the cooperation with the Moroccan authorities in the administering of a secret detention site in Rabat, Morocco finally ran aground. All the CIA\u2019s remaining detainees in Morocco had to be moved out. In February 2005 the flight data tells us that there were two principal destinations for detainees being taken out of Morocco. Those were the two European sites. Firstly Romania, which we have addressed in the [Al Nashiri v. Romania] proceedings, and secondly, for the first time, Lithuania.\u201d", "He added:", "\u201cDetention sites did not endure for periods of several years, rather at particular junctures in the programme they were abruptly closed and all classified information housed in those facilities destroyed. Here we have the example of when Thailand was closed, December 2002. And by collating material from the reporting the cabling at the base with flight data, including that from our own investigations we identified this juncture of ... December 4th-5th, 2002 as the first of several on which CIA detention and interrogation operations were dramatically overhauled. That meant that one base closed - CATESEYE in Thailand and immediately afterwards a new base opened QUARTZ base in Poland. And just as the detainees from one site moved to another so the operational focus shifted with them. QUARTZ became the facility from 5 December 2002, to which the CIA brought its highest value detainees for HVD interrogation. Likewise, if we move forward nine months, the same report reveals that QUARTZ itself only existed until 22 September 2003, whereupon QUARTZ base in Poland was closed and a successor site BRIGHTLIGHT base in Romania was opened, 22 September 2003. This cyclical nature evidenced in the documents and supported by analysis of the flight data persisted all the way till the end of Europe\u2019s participation in the rendition programme.", "Specifically the last juncture of interest to the Court is that on 25 March 2006. Detention Site Violet, the Lithuanian site itself, would close and would lead to a wholesale transfer of detainees from that site to the final site in the programme back in Afghanistan. So, rather than having multiple sites existing simultaneously and in perpetuity, the story of this programme is of a shifting operational focus whereby each site at one time is the hub of operations where the key interrogations are taking place, where enhanced interrogation techniques are being routinely authorised and instrumentalised, and where new detainees captured are sent by rendition aircraft in order to enable this honing of resources.\u201d", "130. In this connection, in the course of the PowerPoint presentation, Mr J.G.S. demonstrated two rendition circuits executed through Lithuania, the first executed by aircraft N724CL in February 2005, the second by aircraft N787WH on 5-6 October 2005.", "(a) As regards N724CL\u2019s circuit in February 2005:", "\u201cThis circuit in February 2005 encompasses the period from the 15th to 20th February 2005 in which two rendition aircraft deployed to Morocco simultaneously.", "I shall demonstrate the circuit of the aircraft N724CL which embarked here from Gran Canaria to the pickup of the remaining detainees in Rabat - Morocco. It flew the path to Amman - Jordan before flying onward to Vilnius - Lithuania. This is the first of the landings which the Lithuanian authorities themselves evidenced in their documentary submissions of 2011. The aircraft landed in Vilnius on 17 February 2005, the date on which the applicant of ours, the beginning of his secret detention in Lithuania. It departed via Keflav\u00edk before returning to its base in the United States.", "This simple illustration is backed up by a large trench of documentation and in particular it is in respect of these contractor operations that we are able to draw upon the docket of litigation in the United States between two contractors, both of them servicing the CIA\u2019s rendition programme. The name of the case in question which is in the records before the Court is Sportsflight Air Inc. [sic] versus Richmor Aviation.\u201d", "(b) As regards the N787WH circuit in October 2005, Mr J.G.S. testified that it had involved the transfer of detainees between the CIA \u201cblack sites\u201d in Romania and Lithuania, which had been disguised by using both the socalled \u201cdummy\u201d flight planning and the CIA methodology of \u201cswitching\u201d aircraft. The CIA, under its aviation services contract with Computer Sciences Corporation, tasked two rendition aircraft \u2013 N308AB and N787WH \u2013 with flights to Europe simultaneously.", "N308AB arrived in Bratislava, Slovakia from Teterboro, USA, while N787WH landed in Tirana, Albania. A \u201cdummy\u201d flight plan from Bratislava to Constan\u0163a, Romania was filed in respect of N308AB but when the plane entered Romanian airspace, the Romanian aviation authorities navigated it to an undeclared landing in Bucharest. The plane collected CIA detainees from Romania. Subsequently, N308AB flew from Bucharest to Tirana on the night of 5 October 2005. The CIA detainees \u201cswitched\u201d aircraft in Tirana; they were transferred onto N787WH for the rendition flight. A \u201cdummy\u201d flight plan from Tirana to Tallinn, Estonia was filed in respect of N787WH. Instead, the plane flew to Lithuania and the Lithuanian aviation authorities navigated it to an undeclared landing at Vilnius in the early hours of 6 October 2005. The plane dropped off the CIA detainees for ground transportation to the CIA \u201cblack site\u201d in Lithuania. Then the planes departed; N787WH flew to Oslo, Norway and onwards, N308AB made a stopover in Shannon, Ireland and returned to its base in the USA (see also Al Nashiri v. Romania, cited above, \u00a7 135).", "Mr J.G.S. stated, in particular:", "\u201cIn respect of Lithuania I would like to draw attention in particular to the records around the October 2005 flights. On this occasion two aircraft are implicated in the transfer of a single group of detainees. There are records pertaining to N308AB and there are also records pertaining to N787WH. N787WH is a Boeing business Jet, a 737, and as I mentioned it took the place of the earlier N313P aircraft in performing large scale transfers of detainees simultaneously. Among the documents there are emails and other items of correspondence which give an extraordinary insight into the CIA\u2019s planning of these operations.", "If asked how do we know that the deceit was deliberate, how do we know that the disguise was a tactic rather than a facet of in-flight changes, I would point to the documents in this docket which refer explicitly to sleight of hand. They deliberately purport to file flight plans to destinations of which the aircraft has no intention of flying and they include such statements as \u2018no customs help\u2019 or on occasion \u2018drop all passengers\u2019 or on occasion \u2018hard arrival\u2019, which are not legal terms in the planning of international flights; they are rather efforts to circumvent the system of controls and regulations put in place by among others the international civil aviation organisation.", "This particular circuit, which I will demonstrate, is of great relevance to our proceedings today because it links the detention site in Bucharest - Romania with the detention site in Vilnius - Lithuania and demonstrates how the CIA\u2019s tactics to evade accountability had evolved over the course of the programme. Herein we will see not only instances of dummy flight planning, the customary filing of false flight plans but also the use of a new methodology switching aircraft mid operation to avoid the eventuality that the same aircraft appeared in the site of two different places of detention.", "On this map we have two aircraft which arrived in Europe simultaneously on 5 October 2005. The first N308AB arrived from its base in Teterboro \u2013 New Jersey, the second N787WH arrived from Keflav\u00edk and landed at Tirana \u2013 Albania. Tirana Albania was to be the point at which these two aircraft would converge hence it is marked here as a staging point. Before arriving there, however, the first aircraft N308AB filed a dummy flight plan to the false destination of Constan\u0163a, Romania and then flew to its real destination Bucharest B\u0103neasa airport, where it collected detainees from the Romanian detention site. After its collection it flew to Tirana from Bucharest directly with the prior instruction to drop all packs. This in jargon means the passengers on the plane, explicitly here the crew, the rendition personnel who are responsible for removing, securing and transporting the detainees. In Tirana the crew transferred onto the waiting second aircraft N787WH together with the detainees. The dummy flight plan was then filed for this second aircraft furthering the layers of deceit. Tallinn, Estonia was used as a false destination to enable the flight to enter Lithuanian airspace and land at Vilnius airport in Lithuania.", "This is the point at which the detainees on board were dropped off, hence the direct link between the \u2018black site\u2019 in Bucharest and the \u2018black site\u2019 in Vilnius. Both aircraft thereafter returned towards the United States, N787WH flying via Oslo and northward, N308AB flying via stopover in Shannon back to New Jersey. Again Lithuanian records attest to the landing of N787WH in Vilnius, notwithstanding its false or \u2018dummy\u2019 flight planning and this document, which also forms part of the records before the court from the Litcargus provider at Vilnius, is the completion of the switching aircraft operation, a typical and short time on the ground in Vilnius in the early hours of the morning in which the detainees were transported by ground to the detention facility in Lithuania.\u201d", "131. Replying to the judges\u2019 question about the relation between the above circuit and the applicant\u2019s case, Mr J.G.S. testified as follows:", "\u201cYou asked also why did I focus my attention on this pattern of switching aircraft in October 2005 and it is because that operation links two detention sites in European territories, namely the detention site in Romania and the detention site in Lithuania, and illustrates adequately to the Court that there were complex, deliberately deceitful, tactics at play that make it very difficult to follow a particular detainee\u2019s path for the transfers that the CIA undertook in moving its detainees from one site to another. That particular joint operation, involving N308AB and N787WH, is an operation to which I have devoted considerable time in documenting, in correlating, collating different information sources and I am confident in pronouncing that as a rendition operation in which persons from Romania were transported via a switching of aircraft in Tirana to the site in Lithuania. At this present time that operation stands as the only other confirmed inward rendition to Lithuania that I have been able to document from material in the public domain. And it is for that reason that I presented it to the Court because it enhances the certainty with which we can see a detention site existed in Lithuania.\u201d", "132. In reply to the judges\u2019 question as to whether it could be established that the CIA detention facility in Lithuania was code-named \u201cViolet\u201d in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report and, if so, on what basis, Mr J.G.S. testified:", "\u201cThe Detention Site Violet is the colour code name used to denote Lithuania in the [2014 US Senate Committee] Report. I have reached this conclusion by collating information around specific dates, specific detainees, and specific junctures in the broader CIA programme that are explicitly mentioned and unredacted in the report. I refer in particular to the nexus between different detention sites and the cyclical nature of the programme, such that when one site closed another opened, when one site was demoted in importance another site was promoted, and establishing the identity of Detention Site Violet as Lithuania derives from a deep understanding of both Romania\u2019s role under the code name \u2018Black\u2019, and in particular the role played by Morocco, an authority that is only referred to by a country letter rather than a colour, because it did not act as a detention site or \u2018black site\u2019 within the CIA structure. But I would direct the Court in particular to pages 139 to 142 of the [2014 US Senate Committee Report], in which the role of Morocco is described extensively as a country which \u2018detains individuals on the CIA\u2019s behalf\u2019 and through a close reading of these passages linked with the evidence I have presented in these and earlier [Al Nashiri v. Romania] proceedings, one reaches the incontrovertible conclusion that when the facility in Morocco was finally closed the only possibility is that Detention Site Violet, namely Lithuania, then took the detainees from that country in conjunction with \u2018Detention Site Black\u2019. In particular a paragraph on page 142, which describes the end of relations between the CIA and Morocco, concludes with the passage that the CIA detainees were transferred out of this country in February 2005 and corresponds precisely with the flight movements, the planning documentation and the detailed insights afforded by the American litigation proceedings, to lead us from Rabat - Morocco to Vilnius - Lithuania.\u201d", "133. As regards other elements justifying the conclusion that Detention Site Violet was located in Lithuania Mr J.G.S. testified as follows:", "\u201cI would like now to move on to some of the references in the declassified American documents that might help the Court to place the Lithuanian site in the context of the broader rendition detention and interrogation programme. In respect of Lithuania the most important document at hand is the declassified [2014 US Senate Committee Report], the Feinstein Report as it is sometimes known. Whilst incomplete and whilst heavily redacted, the document nonetheless plays into the aforementioned collation or distillation of multiple documentary sources and it is possible to link the colour coded references to specific detention sites in the report to known and recognisable host countries of \u2018black sites\u2019 including that of Lithuania.", "As has been widely reported since this document was declassified the Lithuanian site is associated with the colour code Violet. References in the [2014 US Senate Committee Report] to Detention Site Violet accord completely with the timings, with the character and with the chronological progression of detention operations in respect of Lithuania. Notably I would point the Court to two sections of the report, pages 96 to 98 and pages 154 to 156. In these two sections the Committee engages in an analysis of the reasons behind both the opening and the closing of Detention Site Violet in Lithuania and it delivers several pertinent observations regarding the question of relations with the host national authorities.", "It is important first in order to establish this relation to the coding to recognise that Detention Site Violet was created in a separate country to any of the other detention sites mentioned in the report. So, where there is a raft of evidence connecting Detention Site Cobalt to Afghanistan correlating with many of the detentions we know took place there and indeed many of the techniques practised there; Detention Site Green we know to have been Thailand, the place in which Al Nashiri and today\u2019s applicant Abu Zubaydah were waterboarded and the only site at which videotaping took place; Detention Site Blue, the first European site at Szymany in Poland to which both today\u2019s applicant Mr Zubaydah and Mr Nashiri were transferred upon the closing of the Thai site in December 2002, and as mentioned in earlier [Al Nashiri v. Romania] proceedings Detention Site Black, the site situated in Romania at which Mr Al Nashiri and others were detained between 2003 September and 2005 November.", "The reference to a separate country here opens a new territory to the programme. Here we see discussion of political approval of the site which indicates that the same processes were aptly as pertained in Poland and Romania and as were described in the Marty Reports. The same conceptual framework where authorisation was required to situate a detention site in a European country from the highest levels of government. Here we have references in descriptive narrative to how Lithuanian counterpart officials may have been \u2018shocked\u2019 by the presence of detainees on their territory but \u2018nonetheless\u2019 approved.", "We know from both the [US] Senate inquiry and the inquiry undertaken by the Lithuanian Parliament, the Seimas, that there were in fact two projects in Lithuania aimed at providing support for the CIA detention operations. These are referred to in the Lithuanian reports as Project No. 1 and Project No. 2. In the [2014 US Senate Committee Report] these projects are referred to somewhat more obtusely but notably it states that by mid-2003 the CIA had concluded that its completed but still unused holding cell in this country, by which is meant Project No. 1, was insufficient, given the growing number of CIA detainees in the programme and the CIA\u2019s interest in interrogating multiple detainees at the same detention site. This sentence is very important in respect of Lithuania because it corresponds precisely with the description of the provenance of Project No. 2 furnished by the Lithuanian Parliament. It states the CIA thus sought to build a new expanded detention facility in the country. The Committee report provides insight into both the opening and the closing of the site referred to in Romania and this is important because it will also help to situate the Lithuanian site in the timeline. Here, as mentioned in earlier proceedings, we learned that Detention Site Black opened in the fall of 2003, the specific date 22 September 2003. We also learn that it closed within a period of only a few days after the publication of the expos\u00e9 in the Washington Post; namely on 5 November 2005. The Detention Site Black closed. Therefore, the reference to a separate country means a site that endured beyond Detention Site Black in Romania and in fact endured beyond the period at which the secret detention system in Europe was known about, hence my earlier reference. The Lithuanian Detention Site Violet became the longest or latest standing European detention site. ...\u201d", "He added:", "\u201cI want to share the few further insights into operations in Lithuania which come by looking at specific CIA detainee case studies. We have been able definitively to associate three of the CIA\u2019s high-value detainees with the site in Lithuania. However, we know that at least five persons were detained there because in the Senate Committee Inquiry Report it refers to one of these men, Mustafa al-Hawsawi, and four others simultaneously being in country. So today I am only in a position to provide references to these three individuals here: the applicant in today\u2019s proceedings, the applicant Abu Zubaydah, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, at the bottom left, who was detained at one time in each of the European sites - in Poland, then in Romania and finally in Lithuania, and the aforementioned Mustafa al-Hawsawi, who became one of the reasons for which the site was closed, as I will illustrate.\u201d", "134. In reply to the judges\u2019 question whether the applicant\u2019s allegations that he had been transferred to Lithuania on 17 or 18 February 2005 and transferred out of the country on 25 March 2006 could be confirmed, Mr J.G.S. testified:", "\u201cWith regard to inward transfer, I can attest that an operation was mandated by the CIA through the air branch of its rendition group to its principal air services/division services contractor to carry out a movement of detainees held in Morocco towards other active \u2018black sites\u2019/detention sites, namely those in Romania and Lithuania. I can further attest by analysis of the documents that this operation was executed by using two aircraft. The two aircraft you mentioned, N724CL and N787WH. In my presentation I illustrated the flight of N724CL for the express reason that that aircraft flew, and can be demonstrated to have flown, to Vilnius. And Vilnius is unambiguously the airfield associated with the detention site in Lithuania, the physical location of which, as I have suggested, is undisputed.", "In my experience each detention site is inexorably connected with one destination airfield, hence the Polish site with Szymany airport, hence the Romanian site with Bucharest B\u0103neasa and in my understanding the Lithuanian site is principally primarily associated with the airfield Vilnius airport, denoted by its code EYVI. That is the reason I chose that flight to illustrate to the Court.", "However, I cannot rule out the possibility that another airfield may have been used in conjunction with Vilnius in operating in Lithuania, and at the present time there is insufficient evidence in the public domain to make a categorical determination, for example as to the use of Palanga airfield. By way of explanation, the tactical methodologies of the CIA did evolve over time as I have presented to the Court today. This switching aircraft methodology was something which was not used in the early years of the programme, it was rather a later resort. So it is eminently possible that in pursuit of the same objectives absolute secrecy, security of transfer, evasion of accountability, the CIA innovated new methods of transfer which entailed using other airports inside the territory of Lithuania. I cannot rule that out nor can I make a categorical pronouncement as to which of those two aircraft brought Mr Zubaydah to Lithuania.", "I can, however, state that he was detained there in that last year of Europe\u2019s participation in the \u2018black sites\u2019 programme, and that at this moment the only known and evidenced outward flight from Lithuania was the N733MA flight on 25 March 2006, which engaged in an analogous switching aircraft operation, and carried ultimately the detainees who were left at Detention Site Violet to Detention Site Brown, the newly opened site in Afghanistan, thereby closing the chapter on the Lithuanian site. On that front and again, notwithstanding my recognition that other evidence may yet be revealed, I would feel confident in associating this aircraft with the outward rendition of Mr Zubaydah.\u201d", "In that context, he also added:", "\u201cI cannot rule out that there was another form of deceit or sleight of hand at play that led to the appearance of two Lithuanian airports in some of these flight routes. Palanga does not immediately strike me as being an airfield associated with the site because of its geographical distance from Antaviliai, but I cannot rule out that perhaps flights landed there and detainees were then transported onwards by some other means. I do not have categorical information on that question. What I can say is that the flights mentioned in the statement of facts, as I have read it, include two flights in this period in February, between 15 and 20 February 2005, one of which is confirmed to have landed at Vilnius, N724CL on 17 February, the other of which N787WH is recorded as having landed at Palanga. On one of these aircraft the applicant was brought to Lithuania but beyond that categorical certainty is not yet achievable.\u201d", "As regards the applicant\u2019s transfer out of Lithuania, he further stated:", "\u201cYou asked about the destination of his outward flight and it is fairly clear that that was Afghanistan. I would say beyond a reasonable doubt he was taken to Afghanistan when he left Lithuania, because he was one of the fourteen high-value detainees who were transported from Afghanistan to Guant\u00e1namo Bay and declared by President George W. Bush to have been held in the CIA programme in September 2006, when he revealed its existence for the first time to the world. So there were no further renditions between March 2006 and September 2006. So I would be confident in concluding that he was taken from Lithuania to Afghanistan and thereafter to Guant\u00e1namo, and I believe the records that are before the Court state as to how and when those transfers took place.\u201d", "135. As regards the applicant\u2019s alleged detention at the CIA detention site in Lithuania and the closure of that site, Mr J.G.S. also stated:", "\u201cMr Zubaydah does not have a mention by name in [the 2014 US Senate Committee Report] in connection with the Site Violet but the other two detainees cited here, both do. In the case of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, there is a lengthy description of his detention in multiple different sites, notably in this passage the reference to his being transferred to Detention Site Violet on that earlier switching aircraft circuit in October 2005. He was also held in Lithuania up until the point of the site\u2019s closure. Hence his final transfer to Detention Site Brown which was in Afghanistan on March 25, 2006. The passage around Khalid Sheikh Mohammed also talks about how reporting around him accounted for up to 15% of all CIA detainee intelligence reporting, which demonstrates his enduring importance to the purported intelligence gathering objectives of the programme. I find that pertinent because Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was detained in Poland, he was detained in Romania, he was detained in Lithuania, and he stands as a symbol of the centrality of these detention sites in Europe to the overall objectives of the CIA\u2019s programme.", "The third detainee, Mustafa al-Hawsawi is mentioned in the report in relation to his need for medical care. In this passage here which comes from the later section, pages 154 -156, it states that the CIA was forced to seek assistance from three thirdparty countries in providing medical care to Mustafa al-Hawsawi because the local authorities in Lithuania had been unable to guarantee provision of emergency medical care. And as is stated explicitly in the Senate Committee\u2019s Report, based upon cables sent from the base at Detention Site Violet, these medical issues resulted in the closing of the site in this country in the date March 2006. It was at that point that the CIA transferred its remaining detainees to Detention Site Brown.", "In my view these passages, when read in conjunction with the other documents, constitute a fairly comprehensive record of the reasoning and indeed the methodology behind the closure of the Lithuanian site. Furthermore, subsequent packet passage refers to the overall number of persons in the programme at 1 January 2006 as having been twenty-eight. It states that these twenty-eight persons were divided between only two active operational facilities at that time. One was Detention Site Orange in Afghanistan but importantly the other was Detention Site Violet, the Lithuanian site. The date references here, corresponding with the different flights we have had coming in and later going out, place Detention Site Violet in that time period as the hub of detention operations.\u201d", "136. In response to the Government\u2019s question as to whether he could attribute a colour code to each CIA \u201cblack site\u201d mentioned in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report and whether there had been any locations with no colour codes, Mr J.G.S. stated:", "\u201cYes, I can attribute colour codes as mentioned in the Senate Committee Report to each of the detention locations that had the character of a CIA \u2018black site\u2019. In order to be clear, there were some places used by the CIA that did not meet the precise criteria of a \u2018black site\u2019, a customised high-value detainee facility. Those criteria were set out in the Inspector General\u2019s Report. I indicated it in my presentation, and among the criteria were the exclusive operation by CIA agents and contractors without the participation of foreign counterparts. The criteria for a \u2018black site\u2019 are in fact enumerated in several of the CIA documents and those sites in the Senate Committee Report were all accorded a colour code. So, for example, whilst Lithuania is associated with Violet, Romania is associated with Black, Poland is associated with Blue, Thailand is associated with Green, in Afghanistan there are several sites, notably Cobalt, Orange and Brown. At Guant\u00e1namo also there are multiple sites, notably Maroon and Indigo in the report. But Morocco, a country in which CIA detainees were housed at several points in the programme, does not have its own colour code because it did not meet the criteria as a customised high-value detainee facility. Specifically, Moroccans participated in the detention of CIA HVDs on their territory and they housed those persons within existing detention operations in Morocco, as is described in the report. So I can attribute colour codes to every one of the \u2018black sites\u2019 and I can also further identify countries that did not have a colour code, but which bore characteristics unique to one country and through the collation of other data sources allow me to categorically pronounce where they were situated. I am not alone in this endeavour, I can say that, having met with several of those involved in the Senate inquiry process, I believe that most reasonably informed observers would be able to associate now the publicly available information with at least one or more of those colour codes. I am not alone, this is not at a simple personal conclusion. It is one which is widely shared, not contradicted across the community of investigators who have occupied themselves with these matters.\u201d", "137. Replying to the judges\u2019 questions as to whether it could be established that Abu Zubaydah had been secretly detained at Detention Site Violet and what was the physical location of that site on Lithuanian territory, Mr J.G.S testified:", "\u201cThe report does not mention the applicant Mr Zubaydah explicitly by name in connection with the Detention Site Violet. However, through an intimate familiarity with the chronology of his detention, much of which I have presented in evidence in these proceedings and the prior proceedings, I have reached the conclusion that there is only one place he could have been in the early part of 2005 and that that place was indeed Morocco. Furthermore, having closely analysed the text regarding Morocco in the report, some of which derives from cables declassified correspondence and other sources which I have also engaged with, I know that the transfers out of Morocco in 2005 went to other active \u2018black sites\u2019, that one of these was \u2018Detention Site Black\u2019 in Romania, but that there was also another one in a separate country, to use the terms of the report and based on the answer I gave to Your Honourable colleague Judge Sicilianos, this other country was Lithuania. Because the applicant Mr Zubaydah did not arrive in Romania, \u2018Detention Site Black\u2019, which I know based upon my years\u2019 long investigations into the operations of that site much of which I have presented to the Court, the only other destination to which he could have been transferred was the active site in Lithuania and this transfer took place in accordance with the flights described in February 2005. Therefore, on the balance of probabilities, I believe it is established that Abu Zubaydah was secretly detained at Site Violet.", "As to the physical location of the facility in Lithuania it is my understanding that there is no dispute that there was a facility purpose-built, that this was the converted site of the horseback riding academy at Antaviliai, that the CIA oversaw the construction afresh, that this place was referred to as Project No. 2 in the Seimas parliamentary inquiry in Lithuania, and that the evidence gathered both through the Senate Inquiry and through the Lithuanian authorities\u2019 own inquiries is in fact perfectly convergent on this point.", "I should also note that esteemed colleagues in the Committee for Prevention of Torture have visited the site and chronicled many aspects of it, which accord perfectly with the description of secret detention facilities I am familiar with from the American documentation. So as to the physical location, I think it is established beyond a reasonable doubt that this place was the \u2018black site\u2019 on the territory of Lithuania.\u201d", "138. In response to the judges\u2019 question as to what extent, in comparison to Mr Abu Zubaydah\u2019s case against Poland, or to Al Nashiri v. Poland and Al Nashiri v. Romania, he considered his conclusions in the present case to be based on the same elements of certainty, Mr J.G.S. stated:", "\u201cThank you, Your Honour, and I appreciate very much the focus on my choice of words because I have attempted, wherever possible, to be quite precise and circumspect in the pronouncements I make with regards to issues of fact. You are quite correct that in respect of this same applicant in his application against Poland I was able to make categorical pronouncements against a burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that he was transferred into Poland on a specific date, that he was subjected to specific forms of treatment, that he was held together with Mr Nashiri and various other aspects, because they were described chapter and verse in documents declassified and made public by the CIA itself, notably the Inspector General\u2019s Report. In respect of Romania, again by virtue of its earlier start date of operations, it was included by reference in the Inspector General\u2019s inquiry and furthermore features prominently in the [US] Senate\u2019s inquiry. 2003, according to the Senate, is the year in which the most high-value detainees persons involved in this programme were captured and interrogated, so understandably, since the Romanian site was the hub of operations, the most important \u2018black site\u2019 at that time, it is possible to glean a higher quality and volume of evidence from the declassified documents in respect of Romania, hence being able to associate more high-value detainees, more types of treatment as practised on the territory, and indeed a greater degree of certainty when pronouncing on questions of fact in respect of Romania.", "As I mentioned in the presentation, Lithuania was the latest of the European sites to be opened and therefore received detainees at a later phase of their detention cycles or, alternatively, received fewer detainees whose cases were subjected to the scrutiny of the oversight bodies I have mentioned. There is no Inspector General reference to Lithuania because at the moment when he published his special review in May 2004, the site in Lithuania had not yet been opened. In the Senate Report there are extensive references to Detention Site Violet, but naturally because the preponderance of detainees and their interrogations had taken place in the earlier years of the programme, it is not possible to find as many specific or explicit date references or references to specific renditions as is the case for the other two countries.\u201d", "139. Lastly, in reply to the applicant\u2019s counsel question as to whether, based on his years as investigator, he was satisfied or was in doubt as to Abu Zubaydah\u2019s presence in Morocco, Afghanistan and Lithuania at times referred to by him, Mr J.G.S. testified:", "\u201cYes, I am satisfied as to the presence of Mr Zubaydah, respectively in early 2005 in Morocco up to the point where the CIA detention site in Morocco was cleared, thereafter on the territory of Lithuania in the detention site coded as \u2018Violet\u2019 and thereafter on the territory of Afghanistan in the detention site coded as \u2018Brown\u2019.\u201d", "140. Mr Black, in reply to the judges\u2019 question regarding the alleged existence of the CIA detention facility in Lithuania, in particular whether it could be established beyond reasonable doubt that it had operated in Lithuania and, if so, whether its location could be established, stated:", "\u201cThe answer to both parts of that question is unequivocally yes. It is certainly the case beyond reasonable doubt that the CIA established a detention centre in Lithuania. It is certainly the case beyond reasonable doubt that that facility \u2013 the facility that they established was in fact used for the purpose of holding prisoners \u2013 was in the warehouse outside the village of Antaviliai, a little bit to the north-east of Vilnius. So the issue of the evidence that allows me to make these statements and to say that they are beyond reasonable doubt is necessarily fairly lengthy and it rests on a number of key points which I shall do my best to summarise as concisely as possible.", "The Senate Report clearly indicated the times of operation of a site which it called Violet, which operated from February 2005 until March 2006. The site was in a country where there had previously been another site established that was in fact never used. This is discussed in the Senate Report. This detail of there having been two sites, one never used and one which was used between February 2005 and March 2006, corresponds accurately with the details given in the Lithuanian Parliamentary Committee\u2019s investigation published in 2009, where they state very clearly that their partners, by which they mean the CIA, equipped two sites: one that was not used and one that was used for a purpose which the Parliamentary Committee does not reach a firm conclusion on, at least in its printed document. Now, it is further the case that my research has established flights going into and out of Lithuania precisely at the times that prisoners are said to have been moved into and out of the facility in Violet and that this corresponds with flights into and out of Lithuania in, firstly, February 2005, then in October 2005 and lastly in March 2006. And it is further the case that all these flights are contractually related, that is they are related by their contract numbers, their task order numbers, their invoice numbers and other details to an overall contract, that \u2013 we have been able to establish beyond reasonable doubt \u2013 was used by the CIA, by the US Government, for the purpose of outsourcing the movement of prisoners. I think that covers the essentials of how we can identify the Violet, the country that site Violet was in, with Lithuania.", "In terms of the precise circumstances of the building in Antaviliai, it is clear from documents that were gathered by the Parliamentary Committee in Lithuania, as well as from my own field researches \u2013 around that area I made several trips to that place in 2011-2012 to interview people around there \u2013 it is clear from those interviews and those documents that that building was essentially bought by a company and that Americans were in it, were fitting it out, were then guarding it, that vehicles were coming and going with tinted windows, there was one person living in the vicinity who called this \u2018certain emptiness\u2019, was the phrase he used that settled over the site at the time. The Parliamentary Report is quite clear that the CIA were occupying the building and it is also quite clear that Lithuanian officers did not necessarily have access to the entire building or if they did have access to it they did not necessarily take advantage of that access. It is also clear that the planes which were arriving in Lithuania, pursuant to the contracts that I mentioned, were being met by a very special regime of, there is a witness statement, that was made by an employee of the border guards and transmitted by his boss \u2013 whose name I believe is Kasperavi\u010dius, although probably I am pronouncing that wrong \u2013 in which he describes the landing of a plane on 6 October 2005 in Vilnius, and he describes how he was told by State security officials that he was not allowed to carry out his normal inspections of the plane and that, although he was kept away from the plane by a security coordinator, he was able to see in the distance a vehicle driving away from the plane. Now new documents which have been released very recently, earlier this month by the CIA pursuant to information requests by the American civil liberties union, allow us to clarify today that that plane was transporting Khalid Sheikh Mohammed into Lithuania. Previously in the dossier that I submitted to the prosecutor in January 2015, I said that it was not clear whether he came on the February flight or the October flight. It is now clear that he came on the October flight. I am sorry that it is a rather long-winded answer to your question, but I think that it has covered most of the main points that I think are necessary and sufficient to show that there was a prison in Lithuania and that it was in the site in Antaviliai.\u201d", "141. In reply to the judges\u2019 question whether it could be established beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Abu Zubaydah had been secretly detained in Lithuania, Mr Black testified:", "\u201cI have no doubt that Site Violet was in Lithuania and I have no doubt that prisoners were held in it, including, as I said before, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, also including others who I believe, on the basis of my professional opinion, include Abu Zubaydah. To explain why I believe Abu Zubaydah was held in Lithuania, we need to retrace our steps in a way so that I can explain to you the logical sequence of events that leads me to this conclusion. ...", "We ... know that after a certain time in Morocco, the CIA had too many disagreements with the Moroccan Intelligence Agencies with regard to the treatment of prisoners in Morocco. This is dealt with at some length in the Senate Report. And so everyone who was in Morocco was moved out at the latest in February 2005. Now again, prima facie, it is possible that Abu Zubaydah, being in Morocco in February 2005, was moved either to Romania or to Lithuania. But again, the statement which I take to be accurate, that he was not in Romania in or prior to the Summer 2005, means that logically he must have gone to Lithuania on that flight on 18 February 2005. I can explain momentarily why I believe he was on N787WH and not on N724CL but if you do not mind I will come back to that.", "There is a further indicator of his presence in Lithuania, specifically soon after February 2005 \u2013 which is new research that has been done by my colleague, Sam Raphael, at the rendition project which has not yet been published, I have seen his work product and I have worked with it and I believe it will be published later this year \u2013 this research indicates that a cable relating to Abu Zubaydah was sent in March 2005, although the provenance of the cable is redacted, the length of the redaction is consistent with it coming from Lithuania and inconsistent with the coming from either of the two possible sites at the time which are in Romania or in Afghanistan. Cumulatively I take the total effect of all these bits of evidence to my satisfaction to say that beyond reasonable doubt Abu Zubaydah was held in Lithuania, starting in February 2005.\u201d", "142. As regards the date and the flight on which the applicant had been transferred from Morocco to Lithuania, Mr Black testified:", "\u201cThe reason I believe that he was flown in on the plane on 18 February rather than that on 17 February is simply that when you analyse the logs that we published for the 17 February flights, what appears is that everyone on that plane actually got off it in Jordan prior to its landing in Lithuania. So I do not think that the N724CL plane, that went via Jordan to Vilnius, transported prisoners into Lithuania. What it did in Jordan I do not know. I think it is also clear, it follows subsequently, that everybody who was held in Lithuania was moved out in March 2006, on 25 March 2006. I think perhaps it was previously unclear, a couple of years ago, where their destination was, but it is now clear \u2013 and it has been corroborated by the Senate Report \u2013 that the country to which they were moved was Afghanistan.\u201d", "143. In his reply to the judges\u2019 further question about the flight of N787WH on 18 February 2005, identified as being the one on which the applicant had been transferred to Lithuania, Mr Black confirmed that, in his view, on the basis of evidence this had been established beyond reasonable doubt, adding that \u201cto provide an alternative narrative one ha[d] to enter a kind of world of absurdity\u201d.", "When a similar question regarding the dates on which the applicant had been transferred into and out of Lithuania was put by the Government \u2013whose representatives also asked how relevant the N787WH October 2005 flight was in the context of the applicant\u2019s alleged rendition \u2013 Mr Black stated:", "\u201cSo to clarify, I believe that Abu Zubaydah was flown into Lithuania on N787WH on 18 February 2005. I believe that he was flown out of Lithuania on N733MA and N740EH on 25 March 2006. The reason I mention the October 2005 flight is because it is to that flight that we can firmly correlate, again in my opinion beyond reasonable doubt, the arrival of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in Lithuania and I mention it because (a) it provides more evidence of the pattern of conduct that was engaged by and in Lithuania and (b) because it is specifically for that flight that we have the data relating to the very special, as it were, welcoming procedures that the flight had. Although it has been clarified I believe by the Lithuanian Parliamentary Committee that these same procedures were also in effect for other flights, but I mention that one because the document exists that describes very clearly what these procedures were. So I believe it is important holistically taking into account all the evidence that is available to us \u2013 I believe that flight is another important part of the puzzle.\u201d", "144. In response to the Government\u2019s further question whether the 2014 US Senate Committee Report \u2013 on which his conclusions were based \u2013indicated the years and exact months of the opening and closure of Detention Site Violet, Mr Black stated:", "\u201cIf I remember rightly, the Senate Report indicates the year and the months are generally redacted. Because of the way in which they are redacted it is possible to deduce the number of letters, so in a sense it is easy to say which is a long month and which is a short month. One can tell that, let\u2019s say, it might be February but not June or so on. Now, the weights of these redactions has to be calculated in accordance when they correlate other public information. So, for example, the new document released of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s Combatant Status Review Tribunal, is consistent with the redacted Senate Report but it also adds new unredacted information, to the extent that it gives the months of October and March, which are what our reconstruction initially was. And the same can be said of the redacted February. In one place there is a word that is the same length as February that has been redacted and in another place it says \u2018in early 2005\u2019. We have the flights that are the only flights at that point that correspond to it. Taking the whole weight of those and other indicators, to me, that is the only solution that makes any sense is the solution that indeed the site in Lithuania operated at the times that we have stated and was serviced by the flights that we have stated.\u201d", "145. In reply to the Government\u2019s question as to whether the 2014 US Senate Committee Report did state that the national institutions had refused highvalue detainees access to medical institutions, Mr Black stated:", "\u201cYes, that was specifically stated of Site Violet in the Senate Report and it was also discussed in the new release of the, I think it is called, the facility audit, which is one of the documents released in the last few weeks by the CIA. That document describes the problems that the CIA had in 2005 and 2006 getting medical attention in host countries. Now the new document, the facility audit, does not specifically mention which countries it refers to, although the only countries that were operating at the time that it covers were Lithuania and Afghanistan. The Senate Report on the other hand, contextually, in that paragraph it is clear, I believe, that it references to Lithuania and what it says is that they did not have the right type of medical facilities on their site to deal with medical problems and that they initially had an agreement with the host country that the host country would provide medical facilities in such eventualities. The host country had decided that it was not going to do that. The word that is used in the facility audit is that it \u2018reneged\u2019. I do not think that word is used in the Senate Report.\u201d", "146.

At the fact-finding hearing Mr J.G.S. made the following statements concerning the treatment to which the applicant could be subjected during his alleged detention in Lithuania:", "\u201cThe bulk of the enhanced interrogation to which Mr Zubaydah was subjected is clearly documented as having taken place in Thailand. There he was waterboarded and there he was subjected to a grotesque form of experimentation whereby unauthorised and sometimes barely authorised techniques were practised upon him as the CIA developed its early rules and regulations as to how detainees could lawfully be interrogated. By the time he reached Poland, however, he had been declared compliant. So it is not possible to state with certainty which additional techniques were used on him in Europe.\u201d", "In reply to the judges\u2019 further question regarding that matter, he stated:", "\u201cIt is not possible to pronounce categorically on specific interrogation techniques or other forms of treatment or ill-treatment practised on Mr Zubaydah in Lithuania, because, again, they are not explicitly described in any of the reports available to us in the public domain. However, I would be prepared to state that the conditions of confinement in the \u2018black site\u2019 in Lithuania alone pass a threshold that in our human rights protection culture, signified by the European Convention on Human Rights, amounts to a violation of Article 3. There are, by routine and described in documents, practices such as sensory deprivation, sleep deprivation, denial of religious rights, incommunicado detention, indefinite detention on a prolonged basis, as well as a variety of conditioning techniques, as the CIA calls them, which in any other case would themselves be considered forms of ill-treatment. Here they do not even warrant mention in the reporting, because they had become commonplace, but I would not wish for the absence of explicit descriptions of waterboarding or other EITs to be taken as a sign that he was not ill-treated during his time in Lithuania. And I should also point out that, having been detained at that point for more than three years and even up to four years in the totality of his transfer through the sites, there must have been a cumulative effect to the ill-treatment which he underwent at the hands of his captors.\u201d", "155. Mr Black testified as follows:", "\u201c... [I]t is true that relatively there is less information about treatment of prisoners in the CIA detention programme in 2005-2006 than there is in the previous years. There are a few exceptions to this. The recently declassified Memorandum from the CIA\u2019s Office of Medical Services, which is part of the batch of the records declassified earlier this month, is dated December 2004. It comes into force directly prior to the time that \u2013 I take - Abu Zubaydah to have been rendered into Lithuania. This document describes basically the full range of enhanced interrogation techniques, in other words it makes clear that as of December 2004 and thus into 2005, that this full range of techniques is available, it is on the menu. In terms to what extent these techniques were used, we have relatively few indications but there are a couple that I think are worth mentioning. The Senate Report states that there are several occasions on which for example the CIA failed to adhere to his own guidelines in keeping naked prisoners in cold conditions. The guidelines are set out in the Memorandum that I just mentioned, the December 2004 Office of Medical Services Memorandum. The Senate Report says that after that Memorandum, going up until the last time it cites is December 2005, there were prisoners who were being held in colder conditions than what this Memorandum sanctioned. Likewise there were prisoners who were captured in 2005, including Abu Faraj al-Libbi, whom we know from the Senate Report was exposed to lengthy sleep deprivation. Beyond that I do not have any further information about precise conditions, although it is clear \u2013 it has been reiterated by the recent batch of declassified documents \u2013 that during this time 2005 \u2013 2006, prisoners continued to be held in solitary confinement, that is clear. It is also clear that prior to their arrival in the last site in Afghanistan, which was in March 2006, they did not have any access to natural light.

As stated above, according to the experts, on 25 March 2006 the applicant was transferred from Lithuania to Afghanistan via a double-plane switch in Cairo and was subsequently detained at the CIA\u2019s only remaining detention facility \u2013 Detention Site Brown (see paragraphs 133-134, 138 and 140-144 above).", "159.

Although progress has been made to improve conditions of detention at Guant\u00e1namo, there are still many areas of concern. The Inter-American Commission notes in this regard that detainees at Camp 7 do not enjoy the same treatment accorded to other prisoners; that health care faces many challenges, in particular given the ageing population at Guant\u00e1namo; and that religion is still a sensitive issue. Further, the IACHR is especially concerned with the suffering, fear and anguish caused by the situation of ongoing indefinite detention, which has led to several hunger strikes as a form of protest and, in some extreme cases, to the drastic decision by prisoners to end their lives.", "...", "122. The Inter-American Commission has received troubling information regarding prison conditions at Camp 7, a single-cell facility currently used to house a small group of special detainees, known as \u2018high-value detainees\u2019. These detainees are reportedly held incommunicado and are not subject to the same treatment accorded to other prisoners. On May 20, 2013, a group of eighteen military and civilian defense counsel representing the \u2018high-value detainees\u2019 sent a joint request to Secretary of Defense Charles Hagel to improve the conditions of confinement in Guant\u00e1namo. They pointed out that these detainees are not permitted to contact their families by telephone or video; that their access to religious materials has been restricted (such as the sayings and descriptions of the life of the Prophet Mohammed); that they have limited recreational opportunities; and that they are not permitted to participate in group prayer, contrary to the entitlements of other detainees.", "...", "136. The Inter-American Commission considers that the conditions of confinement described above constitute a violation of the right to humane treatment. Further, in order to guarantee that prisoners\u2019 rights are effectively protected in accordance with applicable international human rights standards, the State must ensure that all persons deprived of liberty have access to judicial remedies. The IACHR notes with deep concern that prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo have been prevented from litigating any aspect of the conditions of their detention before federal courts, which constitutes per se a violation of one of their most fundamental human rights. This point, as well as some recent developments regarding this issue, will be assessed in the chapter on access to justice. Further, as it will be addressed below, detainees\u2019 lack of legal protection and the resulting anguish caused by the uncertainty regarding their future has led them to take the extreme step of hunger strikes to demand changes in their situation.\u201d", "163.

The lawyers have stated that publicly available records described how prior injuries had been exacerbated by his ill-treatment and by his extended isolation, resulting in his permanent brain damage and physical impairment.", "The applicant is suffering from blinding headaches and has developed an excruciating sensitivity to sound. Between 2008 and 2011 alone he experienced more than 300 seizures. At some point during his captivity, he lost his left eye.

In his official report, the officer stated that a car drove away from the aircraft and left the territory of the airport border control point.

Daba\u0161inskas, with the knowledge of Director General of the SSD A. Pocius, provided the US officers with opportunities to have unrestricted access to the aircraft on at least two occasions. In addition, at least on one occasion the opportunities for inspection of the aircraft by the SBGS officers were deliberately restricted. In all the above-mentioned cases, there was no customs inspection. Therefore, it was impossible to establish either the identity of the passengers or the purpose of the cargo.", "2. Did secret CIA detention centres operate in the territory of the Republic of Lithuania?", "The cases of partnership cooperation which are of relevance to the parliamentary investigation, carried out by the SSD in 2002-2006 and involving the equipment of certain tailored facilities, may be referred to as Project No. 1 and Project No. 2.", "Based on the information received in the course of the parliamentary investigation, the implementation of partnership cooperation Project No. 1 was commenced by the SSD in 2002. In the course of the project, facilities suitable for holding detainees were equipped, taking account of the requests and conditions set out by the partners. Director General of the SSD M. Laurinkus and his deputy D. Daba\u0161inskas both had knowledge of the project. When instructing the contractors to equip the facilities, the latter mentioned that the project \u2018had been blessed by the top officials of the State\u2019; however, according to the testimony of the then political leadership, they had not been informed of it.", "According to the data available to the Committee, the facilities were not used for the purpose of holding detainees. At present, they are used for other purposes.", "The SSD submitted information that based on the documents held by the SSD, these facilities were equipped for the purpose other than holding detainees.", "The implementation of Project No. 2, which was also examined in the course of the parliamentary investigation, was commenced by the SSD in the beginning of 2004. The necessary acquisitions were made for the purpose of implementation of the project, construction works were carried out to equip the facility, with the progress of works ensured by the partners themselves. The building was reconstructed to meet certain security requirements.", "The SSD officers participated in the implementation of this project together with partners and, according to the officers, had unrestricted access to all the premises of the facility, however, when representatives of the partners were present in the facility, they did not visit some of the premises. The time of such meetings and adequate arrangements were communicated to the SSD officers by Deputy Director General of the SSD D. Daba\u0161inskas.", "According to the SSD officers, representatives of the partners were never left alone in the facility. They were always accompanied by either D. Daba\u0161inskas or one of the SSD officers.", "According to the information received in the course of the investigation, it is evident that the SSD did not seek to control the activities of the partners in Project No. 2. The SSD did not monitor and record cargoes brought in and out and did not control the arrival and departure of the partners; in addition, the SSD did not always have the possibility to observe every person arriving and departing.", "The procedure for accounting and using monetary funds and material valuables intended for financing of joint actions is approved by internal regulations of the SSD, however, based on the explanation provided in the course of the parliamentary investigation regarding one of the implemented joint projects and monetary funds used for its implementation, the accounting of these funds was inappropriate. Explanations provided by individual persons in relation to the sources of financing of joint actions, amounts of monetary funds used for separate actions or accounting thereof are not consistent and therefore require further investigation.", "The Committee established that the SSD had received a request from the partners to equip facilities in Lithuania suitable for holding detainees.", "While implementing Project No. 1 in 2002, conditions were created for holding detainees in Lithuania; however, according to the data available to the Committee, the premises were not used for that purpose.", "The persons who gave testimony to the Committee deny any preconditions for and possibilities of holding and interrogating detainees at the facilities of Project No. 2; however, the layout of the building, its enclosed nature and protection of the perimeter as well as fragmented presence of the SSD staff in the premises allowed for the performance of actions by officers of the partners without the control of the SSD and use of the infrastructure at their discretion.", "3. Did state institutions of the Republic of Lithuania (politicians, officers and civil servants) consider the issues relating to activities of secret CIA detention centres in the territory of the Republic of Lithuania, transportation and confinement of detainees in the territory of the Republic of Lithuania?", "The Committee received certain information about international cooperation of the SSD with partners and application of special measures provided for in the Law on Intelligence during joint operations. The legal basis of international cooperation of the SSD is laid down in the Law on Intelligence. ...", "When summarising [the relevant provisions of the Law on Intelligence], a conclusion should be drawn that legal acts do not directly require the directions (tasks) of international cooperation of the SSD to be approved at any specific political level (at the State Defence Council, the CNSD); such directions (tasks) used to arise from a general need for international cooperation and direct contacts of the SSD with secret services of other countries. However, in seeking to obtain recommendations of the State Defence Council concerning international cooperation, the SSD could submit to the State Defence Council (or the President of the Republic, who initiates sittings of the State Defence Council) the information necessary to draw up such recommendations. In 2002-2005, such issues were not considered at the State Defence Council and there were no recommendations. This is partially confirmed by the letter of the Secretary of the State Defence Council of 3 December 2009, stating that in 2001-2005 wide-scale direct cooperation between the SSD and CIA was mentioned only once - at a sitting of the State Defence Council (19 September 2001) when considering the issue on international terrorism and anti-terrorist actions and prevention, crisis management and the legal base.", "None of the country\u2019s top officials, according to them, were informed about the purposes and content of partnership cooperation of the SSD in 2002. Only several officers of the SSD had knowledge of Project No. 1.", "According to the testimony of the former Director General of the SSD M. Laurinkus, in mid-2003 he informed the then President of the Republic R. Paksas about a possibility, after Lithuania\u2019s accession to NATO, to receive a request to participate in the programme concerning the transportation of detainees. According to the testimony of R. Paksas, Lithuania was requested permission to bring into the country the persons suspected of terrorism. The information submitted to the President of the Republic did not contain any mention of a detention centre or a prison. In August of the same year, when President of the Republic R. Paksas enquired the then acting Director General D. Daba\u0161inskas if there was any new information concerning Lithuania\u2019s participation in the said programme, he was told that there was no new information.", "Although Director General of the SSD M. Laurinkus received a negative answer from President of the Republic R. Paksas regarding the bringing into the Republic of Lithuania of persons interrogated by the USA, neither the then President of the Republic R. Paksas nor acting President of the Republic A. Paulauskas was asked for political approval of activities under Project No. 2. M. Laurinkus had knowledge of launching the activities under Project No. 2 in MarchApril 2004. According to President of the Republic V. Adamkus, he was informed about cooperation with the USA in general terms and no information was provided to him about running of Project No. 2 in 2004-2006. According to A. Pocius, President of the Republic V. Adamkus and his advisors were adequately informed of the project. Several SSD officers, including M. Laurinkus, A. Pocius, D. Daba\u0161inskas, had the knowledge of Project No. 2 at the time of launching and running thereof.", "On 18 August 2009, Head of the SSD P. Malakauskas informed President of the Republic D. Grybauskait\u0117 (as well as former Presidents of the Republic V. Adamkus and A. M. Brazauskas) that ABC News was preparing articles about the CIA detainees who had allegedly been confined in Lithuania and planning to name one of the facilities owned by the SSD as a prison. P. Malakauskas could not deny the possibility of confinement in Lithuania of the persons detained by the CIA.", "Likewise, while considering the reports of the SSD, the CNSD was provided information about international cooperation in a fragmentary manner. For instance, when considering the SSD\u2019s activity report of 2003, it was mentioned that \u2018cooperation with NATO member states is in progress. A wish for more active cooperation with the SSD can already be perceived on the side of the Allies, which will require additional staff, investments.\u2019 Decisions of the CNSD on the SSD\u2019s reports never contained any proposals concerning international cooperation.", "Information gathered by the Committee and the explanations received by it show that the State Defence Council, the Government and the Seimas have not considered issues relating to any activities of secret CIA detention centres in the territory of the Republic of Lithuania, or to the transportation and confinement of detainees in the territory of the Republic of Lithuania.", "According to the country\u2019s top officials (Presidents of the Republic, Prime Ministers, and Speakers of the Seimas), the members of the CNSD of the Seimas were informed about the international cooperation between the SSD and the CIA in a general fashion, without discussing specific operations or their outcomes. The mention of wide-scale direct cooperation between the SSD and CIA was made only once, at a sitting of the State Defence Council (19 September 2001) when considering the issue of international terrorism and anti-terrorist actions and prevention, crisis management and the legal bases for all these. Transportation and detention of detainees were not discussed at the sitting of the State Defence Council of Lithuania. The CNSD of the Seimas was not informed of the nature of the cooperation taking place.", "On the basis of the information received, the Committee established that when carrying out the SSD partnership cooperation Project No. 1 and Project No. 2, the then heads of the SSD did not inform any of the country\u2019s top officials of the purposes and content of the said Projects.\u201d", "175. The final proposal was formulated as follows: \u201cto propose to the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office to investigate whether the actions of M. Laurinkus, A. Pocius and D. Daba\u0161inskas had elements of abuse of office or exceeding authority\u201d.", "176. The findings were accompanied by eight recommendations, including, among other things, \u201cenhancing coordination and control of activities of intelligence services\u201d, \u201cimproving the provision of information to the country\u2019s top officials\u201d and \u201cimproving provisions of the Law on Intelligence\u201d.", "177. The applicant supplied a summary of the transcripts of the debates on the CNSD Findings held in the Lithuanian Parliament on 14 January 2010.", "178. That documents reads, in so far as relevant, as follows:", "\u201cMP A. Anu\u0161auskas, Chairman of the CNSD, is invited to present the draft Resolution on the Findings.", "... During the investigation, the Committee obtained considerable amount of secret information, ranging from restricted to highly classified information marked as \u2018Top Secret\u2019. Because of the high amount of classified information, the preparation of the findings was not an easy task.", "The classified information was related to the activities of secret services and subtle options the services use in their work. Without these subtle options, neither intelligence nor cooperation with the special services of other states in such areas as fight with terrorism would be possible.", "Despite that, parliamentary control of secret services must nevertheless be exceptional and strong. Some of the data, gathered during the investigation, were not made public as it constitutes a state secret.", "To summarize the investigation, the Committee has established that CIA aircraft have landed in Lithuania. It has not established whether the persons detained by the CIA were transported to or transferred through the Lithuanian territory; the heads of the SSD at that time created conditions for the U.S. officers to access the planes unobstructed at least on two occasions.", "Moreover, at least once State Border Guard Service officers were prevented from performing border control checks. During all of the mentioned incidents, customs inspections were not carried out.", "The Committee has established that the SSD received a request from partners to install premises in Lithuania, suitable for keeping detainees. ...", "423. As noted above, the Government dismissed the applicant\u2019s allegations as being unsupported by any evidence and, consequently, lacking any factual basis. They also challenged the credibility of the evidence relied on by the applicant and denied that Lithuania had any knowledge of, or complicity in, the operation of the CIA HVD Programme on its territory at the material time (see paragraphs 398-405 above).", "The Government\u2019s conclusions on the facts and evidence were as follows.", "424. The Government contested the evidential value of the material produced by the applicant. They stressed that most of that material had originated in various public sources whose credibility had not been verifiable. The Government would not play down the significance of publicly available information about the CIA\u2019s HVD Programme; indeed, in the El-Masri case (cited above) similar material on public record had been taken into account by the Court.", "However, in contrast to the present case, that material had constituted merely a supplementary source for the Court\u2019s findings. In El-Masri the Court had relied first of all on the applicant\u2019s description of the circumstances, which had been very detailed and, secondly, on indirect evidence obtained during the international inquiries and the investigation in Germany. The Court had had at its disposal scientific evidence, such as a test of the applicant\u2019s hair follicles, geological records confirming the applicant\u2019s recollection or sketches of the layout of the prison in Afghanistan that the applicant had drawn. Only in addition had the Court relied on the material available in the public domain. In the present case, the applicant had built his case the other way round, starting from publicly available information and, in fact, also finishing with it as he had been unable to produce any other evidence.", "425. As regards the applicant\u2019s reliance on the case of Richmor Aviation Inc. v. Sportsflight Air Inc. (see paragraphs 450-451 below), the Government saw little, if any, connection with his alleged detention in Lithuania. The case had concerned a commercial dispute between two aviation companies, where the plaintiff, Richmor Aviation, had submitted an invoice to Sportsflight Air demanding payment for unused flight time for thirty-two months between May 2002 and January 2005. It did not appear that the companies had exclusively carried out rendition flights. The aircraft mentioned in the case-file differed from those appearing in the present case. The events that had given rise to the litigation had occurred prior to the flights to Lithuania, before February 2005. Even if the witnesses in the Richmor case had given some fragmentary testimony to the effect that the flights contracted by the US Government through the companies at the material time (from May 2002 to January 2005) and performed by the Gulfstream IV aircraft could be used sometimes for the purposes of the rendition programme, this had nothing to do with the flights to and from Lithuania allegedly used for the applicant\u2019s rendition.", "426. The Government did not dispute the fact that during the relevant period, as well as earlier, there had been a number of CIA-linked aircraft landings in Lithuania at Palanga and Vilnius airports. The circumstances relating to those landings had been thoroughly analysed in the course of the pre-trial investigation and no links between the impugned aircraft and the CIA rendition programme had been established. In particular, all persons who had been present at the time of arrivals or departures of the planes, including the airports\u2019 employees, officers of the SBGS and the SSD had been questioned and all relevant documents had been obtained from the SSD. From the totality of that material the prosecutor had concluded that no detained persons had ever been brought into or taken from the territory of Lithuania. Furthermore, no link had been found between the flights in question and any detainees of the CIA in general and the Projects No. 1 or No. 2 in particular. The prosecuting authorities had established that despite the fact that on some occasions Customs and SBGS inspections had not been carried out, it appeared from the documents provided by the SSD that in all instances the SSD officers had had access to the aircraft in accordance with the Law on Intelligence. It had also been established that the SSD officers, who had sought and obtained uninterrupted access to the airports\u2019 sectors at which the CIA aircraft had landed, had acted in a lawful manner and had not abused their office or exceeded the limits of their authority.", "427. As regards the flights N787WH of 18 February 2005 and N733MA of 25 March 2006 indicated by the applicant as those on which he had been brought into and taken out of Lithuania, the prosecution having investigated in detail both flights had established beyond any reasonable doubt that no CIA detainee (including the applicant) had been transported on them. The same applied to any other CIA-linked flights landings during the period in question.", "The evidence collected in the investigation had revealed the true purpose of the N787WH\u2019s and N733MA\u2019s landings. In that connection, twenty-six witnesses had been questioned and abundant documentary evidence had been obtained.", "428. It had been established that the N787WH flight of 18 February 2005 had arrived with, in the Government\u2019s words, \u201cfive foreign citizens of one State\u201d and three crew members. Needless to say, the Government added, the applicant had not been among them. All of them had gone through a State border control for passengers between 20:05 and 20:15 and again between 20:30 and 20:50. Then the plane had left for Copenhagen. The purpose of the landing had been a carriage of some specific cargo, which explained why the vehicle had been seen next to the plane and then leaving. The carriage of the cargo had been related to the activities of the SSD, and the nature of the activities explained why the SSD had asked to be provided with access to the plane.", "Likewise, the N733MA flight of 25 March 2006 had brought cargo into Lithuania and had not been involved in the transportation of the CIA detainees.", "429. Notwithstanding the fact that there was no data in the pre-trial investigation as to the purpose of the cargo, on the basis of the whole body of material collected it might be concluded that \u201csome specific cargo\u201d could have been communications equipment necessary for the technical maintenance of the implementation of a joint project of the SSD and the partners. Due to the particular importance of certain cargo, the Intelligence Services would request direct access to planes. For this purpose, as confirmed by witnesses M, O and N, classified letters used to be written to the airport and the SBGS.", "As regards the flight N787WH on 18 February 2005 it might be concluded that five persons, US citizens, had arrived at Palanga airport. As regards the cargo on the flight N733MA of 25 March 2006, it might be concluded that some equipment could have been carried on the flight at issue. It had been packed in boxes of not less than one metre in length, which, as V confirmed, had been carried by two persons. There was a record in the investigation file showing that the cargo could have been exported by the flight on 25 March 2006, as confirmed by officer O. According to the testimony of the witnesses, it might be concluded that the vehicles of partners used to enter and leave the airports escorted by the SSD officers. The officers used to escort them to the plane; officer V had stated that he had been fifty metres away from the plane.", "The investigation file included the SSD\u2019s requests submitted in respect of both flights; both of them had been duly reasoned and indicated the purpose of the flights, which constituted a State secret. No customs control had been performed in either case, not because of the SSD\u2019s requests but due to legal regulations under which it had not been obligatory and could be performed on an occasional basis.", "430. The SSD had asked the administration of the airport in both instances to allow their officials to access the airport in order to carry consignments and parcels from the airport to their final destination and nothing else. The SSD had never asked for a customs or State border control not to be carried out. It had not interfered in any way with the functions of the State Border Security Service. According to testimonies of many SSD officials, these two flights had not been exceptional and they were not the only ones where the SSD had asked for permission to have access to certain aircraft. In general, over the years 2005-2006 there had been an enormous number of flights of various NATO States with military, official and non-official delegations. According to the testimony of the director of the Civil Aviation Authority, Palanga International Airport had mostly been used for those landings since it received less flights than Vilnius International Airport.", "431. All the SSD officials involved in the reception and transport of the cargo had been questioned by the prosecutors in that connection and had described in detail what the cargo looked like, where it had been transported, whether anyone else had been able to see it and why special supervision of the SSD had been needed. All of them had testified that it had been only boxes which had been unloaded first from the aircraft and then other boxes and some parcels which had been loaded into the aircraft. There had been many of them, all of the same size, definitely too small to place any person inside. The loading itself had been carried out openly and could be seen by the employees of the airport. The boxes brought by the aircraft had been carried by the SSD officials to Vilnius, but not to Project No. 1 or Project No. 2.", "432. At the public hearing, answering the judges\u2019 questions as to the nature of the cargo, the Government further explained that the cargo had contained \u201cspecial equipment that had been meant for a special investigation department\u201d \u2013 and that the purpose had been \u201cto equip this department and its personnel\u201d.", "433. The Government maintained that the pre-trial investigation had established conclusively that no secret prison run by the CIA had existed in Lithuania.", "In particular, the applicant\u2019s allegation that a CIA secret detention facility had operated on the premises of Project No. 2 and that Project No. 1 had been designated for that purpose but not used as such had lacked any factual basis.", "434. It was true that Project No. 1, which had been carried out in 2002 by the SSD and the CIA and the Project No. 2, which had been implemented by the same partners in 2004, had involved the reconstruction and fitting-out of certain premises. However, evidence gathered by the prosecutor had conclusively excluded the possibility of either of these premises having been used as a prison for CIA detainees.", "435. In the course of the pre-trial investigation numerous persons had been questioned \u2013 not only those who had participated directly in the construction works on Project No. 1, but also those responsible for its subsequent use.", "Having analysed all relevant evidence, the prosecutor \u2013 contrary to the statement made by the CNSD that \u201cconditions [had been] created for holding detainees\u201d \u2013 had concluded that this building had been used exclusively by the SSD officers and that it had been absolutely unsuitable for holding detainees due to its geographical location (the city centre) and the facilities on the premises.", "In that regard, the Government also underlined that the CNSD Findings had to be seen in the light of its competence and the nature of parliamentary inquiries performed by it. According to the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling of 13 May 2004, \u201cthe Seimas [was] neither an institution of pre-trial investigation, nor a prosecutor\u2019s office, nor the court\u201d and therefore its conclusions were not \u201cbinding on institutions of pre-trial investigation, the prosecutor\u2019s office or the court\u201d (see also paragraph 219 above).", "436. The premises referred to as Project No. 1 were situated in an auxiliary building in the yard next to the main building at Z. Sierakausko Street in Vilnius where the premises of the SSD had been located at the material time. In 2002 the auxiliary building had been in an emergency condition, and repair works had been needed. As all repair works had been documented, the documentation had been received and analysed by the prosecutor. The builders had confirmed that no wishes had been expressed by the SSD officers that the work be related to the detention of any persons.", "One of the witnesses, who, at the relevant time, had been in charge of the administration of both Projects No. 1 and No. 2, had described the purpose of the premises in the building referred to as Project No. 1 at Z. Sierakausko Street for which they had been fitted out, though he had testified that the premises had never been used since 2002 for that particular purpose. This purpose had been closely related with the structure and functions performed by the SSD, which in themselves constituted a State secret and therefore could not be declassified. Those statements had been corroborated by many other lower SSD officials and technical workers, who had testified that the premises had never been used for any other purposes that were not related to the needs of the SSD.", "437. As regards Project No. 2, the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, based on witness testimony, had established that no special facilities suitable for holding detainees had ever been installed inside the building. In particular, there had been no premises fitted with bars or otherwise specifically adapted for detention purposes. Also, it had been established that access had been permanently controlled and the persons in charge of the building\u2019s security had confirmed that no detainees had ever been present there. Thus, having regard to all the relevant evidence, the prosecution, contrary to the CNSD\u2019s findings that the SSD officers had not always had the possibility of monitoring the arrival and departure of persons at Project No. 2, concluded that access to Project No. 2 had been under permanent control, thus ruling out the possibility of bringing detainees into the building.", "438. Project No. 2 was located in Antaviliai. The building had been acquired for the needs of the SSD in accordance with the requirements of national law and the repair work on the premises had started in 2004. The work had been finished in January 2005. All the SSD officials involved in this project (Director General, Deputy Director General and other SSD officials of lower rank), had been questioned by the prosecutors. They had testified that the purpose of the premises in question could not have \u2013 and in fact had not had \u2013 anything to do with the detention of any persons. All witnesses had spoken of classrooms, living and meeting rooms, as well as sports rooms. The SSD officials of lower rank had been in charge of the repair work on the premises and the security of the building after its completion. Having been questioned several times, they had confirmed that no facilities suitable for holding detainees had ever been fitted in the building. The building had never been left without supervision of the SSD officials, who had testified that there had been no secret or closed zones inside it which would not be accessible to them. Also, in the Government\u2019s view, the geographical location of the building had made it totally unsuitable for detention as it was situated in the village of Antaviliai and surrounded by residential houses.", "439. According to the Director General of the SSD at the relevant time, the building had been used at the beginning of 2005 to a very limited extent \u2013 several meetings took place there. As the SSD officials in charge of the building\u2019s security had testified, it had been used randomly and only for short-term meetings in which the SSD officials and their guests had participated. The visitors had been driven there exclusively by the authorised SSD officials. Thus, contrary to the findings of the CNSD, it had not been possible for any other persons save the SSD officials to use the building at their discretion. In the second half of 2005 the surveillance of the building had been taken over by the SSD\u2019s section. At that time it had temporarily not been used at all but had remained open to the SSD employees. Since 2007 the SSD training centre had occupied the building.", "440. All documents related to the Projects No. 1 and No. 2 had been collected from the SSD, including material containing State secrets. Part of those documents, for instance the records of the on-site inspection of Projects No. 1 and No. 2 together with annexes comprising the photos of the buildings, premises and their surroundings, had been declassified and submitted to the Court. The materials clearly showed that no prison could have been hosted on those premises.", "441. In sum, the prosecutor had found that both premises had, at the relevant time, served other purposes, which had in no way been related to the holding or confinement of persons, although those purposes could not be declassified for the simple reason that the SSD\u2019s partner would have to consent to such disclosure.", "442. At the public hearing, the Government reiterated the above statements. They added that after analysing all the relevant circumstances it had been established that the flight N787WH on 18 February 2005 and the flight N733MA on 25 March 2006 had been used for transporting a specialpurpose cargo and that cargo could not contain the applicant or any other person. It had been the connection equipment for the SSD providing them and their partners with technical services in order to implement their joint project. That explained why they had asked for direct access to the aircraft.", "As regards the alleged locations of the CIA prison, Project No. 1 had been used for operational activities, Project No. 2 had been used for intelligence activities. The facilities of Project No. 2 had never been used for their original purpose and they had later been reconverted and used as the SSD\u2019s training centre.", "Replying to the judges\u2019 questions as to why the 2002 SSD Resolution and the 2002 SSD Action Plan referring to the purpose of the premises to be selected had spoken of the \u201cextradition of secret intelligence collaborators\u201d, the Government explained that this was due to the terminology used at that time \u2013 at present that term would correspond to \u201cexfiltration\u201d or \u201cextraction\u201d, meaning the relocation of special agents or secret agents into their normal life or natural environment.", "The added that, as regards the purposes served by the facilities, Project No. 1 had been meant for special officers and their \u201cextraction\u201d, while Project No. 2 had been the support centre for intelligence.", "443. The Government argued that there had been no credible evidence confirming the applicant\u2019s presence on the territory of Lithuania. The present case was built on some leaked information which had appeared in media in 2009 and which referred to the alleged existence of CIA secret detention facilities in Lithuania. That information had never been confirmed officially, either directly or indirectly.", "Moreover, the applicant\u2019s lawyers had referred to unknown \u201cpublic sources\u201d indicating that the applicant had been moved from Morocco to Lithuania in early 2005, that the Lithuanian prison site had been closed in the first half of 2006 and that its occupants had been transferred to Afghanistan or other countries. In essence, the entire case rested on the routes of certain flights and their alleged links with the CIA. The applicant had described in detail the routes of N787WH on 15-19 February 2005 and N733MA on 23-27 March 2006, highlighting the stopovers of the first aircraft in Morocco and the second one in Cairo. He also referred to some invoices and contracts regarding those flights which, in his view, indicated their links with the CIA and the extraordinary rendition programme. Not a single direct or indirect piece of evidence had ever been produced that would reveal the slightest connection between the applicant and the flights in question.", "The Government said that in this regard they would appeal to pure common sense \u2013 the routes of the flights demonstrated nothing more than the fact that the aircraft had landed for a short while in Lithuania. Even if their links with the CIA were confirmed, this did not prove by itself Lithuania\u2019s involvement in the HVD Programme, still less the applicant\u2019s secret detention on its territory.", "444. The Government regretted the suffering sustained by the persons, including the applicant, detained under that programme. However, they could not but emphasise that while this might have occurred somewhere in Europe, it had not happened in Lithuania.", "445. In the Government\u2019s submission, not a single high-level State politician or official had in any way admitted to knowing of or agreeing to the involvement of Lithuania in the CIA extraordinary rendition programme. It was true that the SSD officials had given some consideration to the possibility of having requests for assistance from the US authorities in the context of the war on terror but this possibility had proved to be purely theoretical because there had been no requests for the detention of any individuals.", "In that regard, the Government referred to the statements of the State officials and the SSD officers who had been questioned in the pre-trial investigation. They also relied on the letter of 26 November 2009 written by Mr Adamkus, the former President of Lithuania, to the CNSD in which he had stated that he had never been informed of any CIA prisons in the country (see also paragraph 367 above). Nor had any other former President of the Republic had had any such knowledge. In the investigation the Heads of State had testified that they had not known about any transfer of any detainees and had not given their consent to the transportation of any persons held by the CIA.", "446. The Government said that they agreed with the Court\u2019s conclusions in Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland that without the knowledge of the State authorities and their assistance, the CIA HVD Programme could not have been executed, and that the running of the CIA prisons would have been impossible in the countries concerned. However, as stated above, Lithuania had not had any knowledge of such activities on its territory. The fact that in 2005-2006, as the applicant argued, there had been generalised knowledge of the HVD Programme owing to findings of international inquiries and public reports disclosing the nature of the CIA secret scheme, was irrelevant since Lithuania had not been included in any of the inquiries and there had been no CIA prison in the country.", "447. The applicant maintained that the whole body of evidence from numerous sources, such as the international inquiries, recent research into the CIA rendition and secret detention operations, abundant aviation data confirming the CIA planes landings in Lithuania, declassified CIA documents, the 2014 US Senate Committee Report and evidence from the experts heard by the Court conclusively confirmed his allegations.", "In his submission, it was established beyond reasonable doubt that a CIA secret detention facility \u2013 referred to as \u201cDetention Site Violet\u201d in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report \u2013 had operated in Lithuania in 2005-2006 and that he had been detained at that facility from 17 or 18 February 2005 to 25 March 2006.", "448. The applicant said that the Government\u2019s objection to his reliance on public documents, reports and other material as evidence in this case was unfounded. The Court had on a number of occasions stated that it would freely evaluate all the evidence, and might draw \u201csuch inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions\u201d. The Court routinely relied on public source evidence; this was demonstrated, for instance, in El-Masri where the Court had taken into account publicly available information of a similar nature and evidence from a range of other sources, including reports from Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights and the ICRC. It had also cited numerous media reports.", "Consequently, the Government\u2019s objections to the nature of the evidence in the case was not based on the Court\u2019s established approach to evidence. The Court would take into account all available sources of evidence and determine whether, in the circumstances of cases such as this, taken together they were sufficient to give rise to \u201cstrong and concordant inferences\u201d of State responsibility. In the applicant\u2019s view, the range of evidence submitted in his case considered as a whole more than satisfied the relevant test.", "449. The applicant considered that the Government\u2019s suggestion that the flights referenced in his submissions as being CIA rendition flights, even if chartered by the CIA, could have had other purposes or simply stopped at some places for technical reasons, lacked any support in the facts.", "While apparently plausible, this assertion had no merit in the context of the assembled data presented as evidence to the Court. A large number of international and regional bodies, human rights organisations and respected and credible media outlets, which had acknowledged the evidence disclosing that rendition flights flew into and out of Lithuania, disagreed. For example, on 11 September 2012 the LIBE Committee, following its April 2012 visit to Lithuania, had issued a resolution noting \u201cnew evidence provided by the Eurocontrol data showing that plane N787WH, alleged to have transported Abu Zubaydah, [had] stop[ped] in Morocco on 18 February 2005 on its way to Romania and Lithuania\u201d. It had also noted that analysis of the Eurocontrol data had revealed new information through flight plans connecting Romania to Lithuania, via a plane switch in Tirana, Albania, on 5 October 2005, and Lithuania to Afghanistan, via Cairo, Egypt, on 26 March 2006. This was mirrored in the findings and reports of other international organisations.", "450. In the light of the accumulated material before the Court it was evident that the planes passing through Lithuania in February 2005 and March 2006 had been chartered by the US Government in the context and for the purpose of the rendition programme. A clear line of evidence connected these flights to Lithuania.", "To begin with, all the flights involved in rendition into and out of Lithuania had been chartered by a US company, Computer Sciences Corporation on behalf of the US Government. This prime contract originated in 2002 with another US company, DynCorp Systems and Solutions LLC (DynCorp), and was then inherited by CSC through its purchase of DynCorp in 2004. The US Government\u2019s initial contract with DynCorp had given rise to a succession of subcontracts, including the agreement with Capital Aviation of 17 June 2002 and a similar agreement between Sportsflight Air as authorised agent for DynCorp and plane operator Richmor Aviation on 18 June 2002.", "These companies, along with various other plane operators including Victory Aviation (operating N787WH) and Miami Air International (operating N733MA and N740EH), had thereby established a method and pattern of doing business which had lasted at least until 2006.", "451. The February 2005 flights of N787WH and N724CL, travelling from the USA to Lithuania via Morocco, had been arranged under CSC\u2019s subcontract with Sportsflight Air Inc. trading as Capital Aviation. These flights corresponded to the dates on which information indicated that the applicant had been transferred from Morocco to Lithuania in early 2005. The March 2006 flights of N733MA and N740EH had also been arranged under CSC\u2019s successor subcontract with Sportsflight.", "Flights organised and billed by Sportsflight and CSC had been the subject of civil litigation in New York, concluding in 2011, between Sportsflight and Richmor Aviation. During this litigation, both parties had made clear that the flights had been part of the rendition programme and that the contractual arrangements under which these flights were provided had been set up to facilitate that programme.", "452. Furthermore, all the flights connecting with Lithuania in February 2005 and March 2006, as well as flight N787WH in October 2005, exhibited a common pattern of behaviour designed for the sole purpose of disguising the true flight routes, the so-called \u201cdummy\u201d flight planning.", "Taking into account, on a cumulative basis, all the available evidence such as the contracts and invoices, the patterns of behaviour, the statements made in the litigation referred to above, the timing of the flights, and the overall context within which rendition flights had been shown to take place, there was a compelling basis on which to conclude that the sole purpose of the flights of N787WH, N724CL, N733MA and N740EH had been to interconnect the CIA\u2019s various secret prison locations. In addition, these interconnections had been made at times when, according to authoritative news reports, prisoner transfers had been made between the respective countries.", "453. Lastly, even if one were to leave aside the entire significance of the above evidence, in the applicant\u2019s view a number of questions would remain. For instance, why, if these had been entirely innocent or \u201ctechnical\u201d stopovers had the SBGS been prevented from inspecting the planes? Why had the planes been cordoned off by the SSD? Why had a vehicle been seen leaving one of the planes, and the airport, if this had merely been a \u201ctechnical\u201d stop?", "454. In the applicant\u2019s submission, the evidence before the Court established beyond reasonable doubt, based on strong and concordant inferences of fact, that Lithuania had housed a CIA secret black-site, a site at which the applicant had been detained between 17 or 18 February 2005 and 25 March 2006. The 2014 US Senate Committee Report had referred to a detention site codenamed \u201cViolet\u201d, which multiple independent investigators had consistently and unequivocally identified as referring to Lithuania, as confirmed by the experts at the fact-finding hearing.", "The 2014 US Senate Committee Report stated that Detention Site Violet had specifically been developed to ensure that multiple detainees could be interrogated simultaneously, that the site had begun operating as a detention centre in 2005 and that it had been closed down in 2006 due to the lack of medical care for ailing detainees. The report\u2019s categorical findings corresponded to and confirmed the credibility of a host of other evidence available at a much earlier stage. This included flight data and contracts, information collected by the Lithuanian Parliament\u2019s own Committee on National Security and Defence, the Lithuanian prosecutor\u2019s own investigation file, the statements and findings of multiple additional inquiries at the regional and international level and the work of nongovernmental organisations, journalists and investigators.", "455. At the fact-finding hearing the Court had heard evidence from the experts of the highest calibre who, having investigated and analysed the CIA HVD Programme for many years, had confirmed that, consistent with a cyclical pattern of sudden site closures, Lithuania had undoubtedly set up a secret detention site in 2005 following the closure of the site in Morocco.", "Lithuania had become, as Mr J.G.S. had described it, the hub for detention of high-value detainees at that point. It had been the experts\u2019 firm and consistent professional assessments as investigators, that the evidence had showed that Abu Zubaydah had been among those detained in Lithuania. Senator Marty had noted that if one had taken the trouble to reconstruct the story, one could only come to that conclusion. Mr J.G.S.\u2019s work had definitively associated Abu Zubaydah with Lithuania and Mr Black had found that the detention of Abu Zubaydah in Lithuania had been beyond reasonable doubt.", "456. One aspect of the evidence before the Court, considered in detail by the experts, included evidence from multiple sources that showed the landing of rendition flights in Lithuania on 17 and 18 February 2005, having followed a circuitous route, from the United States via Morocco, where the applicant was known to have been detained at the relevant time. Likewise it showed that on 25 March 2006 another rendition flight departed from Lithuania, en route to Afghanistan, where again it was known that the applicant had been detained in 2006. False flight plans had been filed for the Lithuanian leg of these journeys, showing alternative destinations in accordance with standard modus operandi for rendition flights.", "The Government had argued that there was no evidence that these had been rendition flights. Yet the pattern these flights displayed, the paths they had taken, and the contracts and invoices, combined with other corresponding details, had led to them being consistently identified by investigators, parliamentary and other inquiries, and by the experts of the Court, unequivocally as flights whose sole purpose had been extraordinary rendition. If any doubt remained about whether these had been rendition flights, it had been dispelled in the above-mentioned civil litigation between sub-contractors in US courts where the flight operators had themselves stated, in their pleadings, in clear and explicit terms that this contract had been for rendition flights carried out for the US Government.", "457. The dates and routes of these rendition flights and the periods of operation of Detention Site Violet corresponded with the conclusive evidence of the applicant\u2019s location prior to and after Lithuania. As the Court noted in Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, the applicant, after being captured in Pakistan, had been transferred to secret CIA detention in Thailand, from there to Poland, and then on to a secret CIA site in Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Expert testimony had confirmed earlier reports that in 2004 he had been moved out of Guant\u00e1namo Bay \u2013 in anticipation of the US Supreme Court ruling granting access to lawyers and habeas corpus review \u2013 and he had been transferred to Morocco. As the experts had explained, the Moroccan site had closed in February 2005, prompting the opening of the next site in the cycle, Lithuania, precisely when rendition flights had flown the route from Morocco to Lithuania. In March 2006, the Lithuanian site itself had closed, prompting the transfer of the applicant, like all of the remaining CIA detainees, to Afghanistan. It was from Afghanistan that he had ultimately been transferred back to Guant\u00e1namo Bay in September 2006.", "458. Referring to the Government\u2019s explanations as to the \u201cspecial cargo\u201d and the purposes served by Project No. 2 given at the public hearing, the applicant said these facts were entirely consistent with his statements and did not really provide any information that would counter his case. In particular, the transportation of the \u201ccargo\u201d was fully consistent with the expert testimony given by Mr J.G.S. in Husayn (Abu Zubaydah), stating that the high-value detainees had been treated as human cargo and that when they had been brought into a country they had not been registered \u2013 even if the passengers on the plane had been registered. Likewise, the Government\u2019s claim that Project No. 2 had been for a special intelligence purpose was entirely consistent with the purpose of Detention Site Violet and the applicant\u2019s submissions in that respect.", "459. In conclusion, the applicant contended that multiple strands of corroborating evidence considered together, supportive of the first 2009 media accounts citing CIA insiders, led to the irresistible conclusion that, as confirmed by the experts, Lithuania had hosted Detention Site Violet. It had been set up by the Lithuanian authorities and had been operated with their assistance by the CIA and the applicant had been detained at that site between 17 or 18 February 2005 and 25 March 2006.", "460. The applicant maintained that multiple sources, including the 2014 US Senate Committee Report, the CNSD Findings and press reports, mentioned high-level members of the Government and intelligence agencies as having approved the establishment of the CIA sites. The 2014 US Senate Committee Report made it clear that millions of dollars had been covertly transferred to show appreciation for the country\u2019s support for the HVD Programme.", "461. Furthermore, the applicant emphasised, for State responsibility to be engaged under the Convention it was not necessary for the highest level official of a State to have known and approved the setting up of the CIA secret \u201cblack site\u201d in the country. It was sufficient for the relevant officials within the State to have approved and to have been responsible. In the applicant\u2019s view, there was compelling evidence that the Lithuanian State had actively undertaken to facilitate and make possible his rendition to, and secret detention in, Lithuania.", "462. The applicant reiterated that there had been no plausible room for doubt as to Lithuania\u2019s knowledge of the nature of the secret detention system in 2005 and 2006. This had been clear from the vast publicly available information, including extensive media coverage which had reverberated around the globe, including in Lithuania, detailing the secret detention programme, specifically identifying Eastern European \u201cblack sites\u201d, the nature of the enhanced interrogation techniques, and identifying Abu Zubaydah by name as one the missing \u201cghost prisoners\u201d. The Marty Inquiry was already underway when the applicant had been detained in Lithuania. To suggest innocent ignorance on the part of the authorities as to what might have been going on in the secret site that they set up for the CIA by 2005 simply beggared belief.", "463. In addition, evidence showed that high-level officials had had specific and direct knowledge. For example, the former President had publicly admitted having been asked by the head of intelligence whether he would be willing to bring accused terrorists into the country unofficially. The head of intelligence in response had noted that he had enquired as to the President\u2019s position precisely on the basis that he had known what had been going on in the world.", "In another example, also from 2005, while the applicant was still detained in Lithuania, the Lithuanian Government attended a NATO-EU meeting with Ms Condoleezza Rice; Mr Fava\u2019s testimony set out in Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) made it clear that all member States had known about the enhanced interrogation techniques. That had been clear from the records of the meeting.", "464. As experts had testified, while not everyone would have known, just as in all other host countries, some certainly had known and had approved. It was beyond reasonable doubt that by 2005 Lithuania had known of the real risk of violations on its territory and evidence demonstrated that the authorities had taken no measures to prevent, to monitor or even to enquire. The parliamentary inquiry concluded that it had been evident that the SSD had not sought to control the CIA\u2019s activities in the country and the premises placed at their disposal. It had not monitored or recorded cargoes brought in and out of the country, and it had not controlled the CIA\u2019s arrival and departure. This lack of oversight was confirmed by the prosecution file. The Lithuanian authorities had not only failed to exercise due diligence to prevent violations but they had actively intervened to support and enable them. As the evidence showed, again including evidence from the prosecution file, the Lithuanian officials had agreed to, purchased and helped to equip the CIA\u2019s secret sites. The Lithuanian officials had provided vital logistics and support for the site, keeping local inquiries at bay. The Lithuanian authorities had intervened to ensure that normal oversight of CIA flights had been lifted by the use of classified letters that had ensured that neither planes, nor passengers, nor cargo had been monitored or inspected. This had been true specifically of the rendition flights identified by the experts as bringing the CIA detainees into the country and taking them out again.", "465. Referring to the knowledge of the US authorities\u2019 practices in respect of suspected terrorists attributable to any Contracting State to the Convention at the material time, AI/ICJ pointed to, among other things, the following facts that had been a matter of public knowledge.", "466. They stressed at the outset that already on 16 September 2001, in an interview, the US Vice President Richard Cheney had said that, in response to the attacks of 11 September, the US intelligence agencies would operate on \u201cthe dark side\u201d, and had agreed that US restrictions on working with \u201cthose who [had] violated human rights\u201d would need to be lifted.", "AI warned in November 2001 that the USA might exploit its existing rendition policy in the context of what it was calling the \u201cwar on terror\u201d to avoid human rights protections. From early 2002 it became clear that nonUS nationals outside the USA suspected of involvement in international terrorism were at a real risk of secret transfer and arbitrary detention by US forces.", "467. In that regard, AI/ICJ submitted that from January 2002 to 2003 the USA had transferred more than 600 foreign nationals to the US Naval Base in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, with reports from the outset of ill-treatment during transfers, holding them without charge or trial or access to the courts, lawyers or relatives. By July 2005, there were more than 500 men held there.", "Cases of arbitrary detention and secret transfer continued to emerge during 2002. In April 2002, alongside the case of Abu Zubaydah, arrested in Pakistan and whose whereabouts after transfer to US custody remained unknown AI reported that \u201cthe US authorities had transferred dozens of people to countries where they [might] be subjected to interrogation tactics -including torture [...]. In some cases, it [was] alleged that US intelligence agents [had] remained closely involved in the interrogation\u201d.", "Also, in December 2002, the Washington Post reported on a secret CIA facility at Bagram, Afghanistan, and the CIA\u2019s use of \u201cstress and duress\u201d techniques, including sleep deprivation, stress positions and hooding, and the use of renditions by the CIA. Thus, as early as the end of 2002, any Contracting Party was or should have been aware that there was substantial credible information in the public domain that the USA was engaging in practices of enforced disappearance, arbitrary detention, secret detainee transfers, and torture or other ill-treatment.", "468. In the years 2003 and 2004 information continued to emerge. In June 2003, for example, AI reported that the CIA had been involved in the arrest in Malawi of five men and their rendition out of that country to an undisclosed location. In August 2003, AI reported that Indonesian national Riduan Isamuddin, also known as Hambali, was being interrogated in US custody in incommunicado detention at an undisclosed location after his arrest in Thailand.", "In January 2004, the ICRC issued a press release stating that \u201c[b]eyond Bagram and Guant\u00e1namo Bay, the ICRC [was] increasingly concerned about the fate of an unknown number of people captured as part of the socalled global war on terror and held in undisclosed locations\u201d. Furthermore, a February 2004 confidential report of the ICRC on Coalition abuses in Iraq, leaked in 2004 and published in the media at that time, found that detainees labelled by the USA as \u201chigh-value\u201d were at particular risk of torture and other ill-treatment and that \u201chigh value detainees\u201d had been held for months in a facility at Baghdad International Airport in conditions that violated international law.", "In May 2004, AI publicly denounced as torture the interrogation technique known as \u201cwaterboarding\u201d reportedly used against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, a \u201chigh-value detainee\u201d who had by then been held in secret US detention for more than a year following his arrest in Pakistan in March 2003.", "469. In June 2004, the Washington Post published a leaked August 2002 memorandum written in the US Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel. The memo advised, inter alia, that presidential powers or the doctrines of necessity or self-defence could override the criminal liability for torture under US law, and that a \u201csignificant range of acts\u201d would not be punishable as they did not amount to torture. Another government memorandum leaked in 2004 asserted that not applying the Geneva Conventions to \u201ccaptured terrorists and their sponsors\u201d would reduce the threat of domestic prosecution of US interrogators for war crimes.", "In June 2004, a December 2002 memorandum signed by the US Secretary of Defense was declassified. It had authorized \u201ccounterresistance\u201d techniques for use at Guant\u00e1namo, including stress positions, sleep deprivation, sensory deprivation, stripping, hooding, exploitation of phobias, and prolonged isolation. A 2003 Pentagon Working Group report on \u201cdetainee interrogations in the global war on terrorism\u201d, declassified and published in June 2004 after an earlier draft of it was leaked, recommended the use of various techniques, including environmental manipulation, threat of rendition, isolation, sleep deprivation, removal of clothing, exploitation of phobias, prolonged standing, and hooding.", "470. In October 2004, AI published a 200-page report on US human rights violations in the \u201cwar on terror\u201d, including case details of secret transfers of detainees, the alleged existence of secret US detention facilities, and torture and other ill-treatment. The numerous rendition cases listed included detailed allegations made by Khaled el-Masri.", "In addition, in its annual reports covering each of the years from 2002 to 2005, AI made multiple references to human rights violations in the context of US counterterrorism operations, not only in the entries on the USA, but also in a number of other country entries. Paper copies of these reports were widely distributed, including to media and governments. For example, copies of the reports were mailed at the time of their publication directly to the President, the Prime Minister, the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Justice in Vilnius, Lithuania.", "471. In the AI/ICJ\u2019s submission, by early 2005 it was beyond reasonable doubt that the USA was engaging in human rights violations against detainees, including holding individuals in secret custody at undisclosed locations, and that detainees labelled \u201chigh-value\u201d were at particular risk as the USA pursued intelligence on al-Qaeda and associated groups.", "Consequently, by 2005, any Contracting Party agreeing to host a CIA \u201cblack site\u201d on its territory would or should have known that such a site would be part of a programme that involved unlawful transfer, enforced disappearance, and torture or other ill- treatment. Further, any Contracting Party would or should have known that any US assurances that a detainee previously subjected to the US programme would be treated in a manner consistent with international law, in the case of further transfer, lacked credibility. Any State would or should have known that even if not transferred to further undisclosed detention, the alternative for a \u201chighvalue\u201d detainee would be indefinite arbitrary detention without charge or committal for trial by military commission with the power to hand down death sentences.", "472. The HFHR focused on their experience regarding Poland\u2019s involvement in the CIA extraordinary rendition programme. They produced a number of documents, including flight data, concerning eleven landings of the CIA-rendition aircraft in Poland, ten of which had occurred at Szymany military airfield between 5 December 2002 (the date of the applicant\u2019s rendition to Poland) and 22 September 2003 (the date of the applicant\u2019s rendition from Poland) and one landing of a plane from Kabul in Warsaw en route to Keflavik that occurred on 28 July 2005.", "473. The parties expressed opposing views on the standard and burden of proof to be applied in the present case.", "474. The Government reiterated that there was no evidence that the facts complained of had taken place in Lithuania. In their view, the applicant\u2019s allegations could not be considered sufficiently convincing or established beyond reasonable doubt, as required by the Court\u2019s case-law.", "In that regard, the Government referred to the standard of proof applied by the Court in El-Masri (cited above), emphasising that the present case was substantially different in several aspects. In the first place, in the ElMasri case the applicant himself had lodged the case and presented his statements; his account had been supported by a large amount of indirect evidence obtained during the international inquiries and the investigation by the German authorities. As the Court held, Mr El-Masri\u2019s case had been \u201ca case of documented rendition\u201d. Secondly, there had been other relevant elements corroborating the applicant\u2019s story. Thirdly, the circumstances described by the applicant had been verified and confirmed by other international investigations concerning the applicant, to mention only the Marty and Fava Inquiries. Lastly, the Court had before it a written statement made by one of the State\u2019s top officials confirming the facts established in the course of the investigations and the applicant\u2019s consistent and coherent description of events. All this material taken together satisfied the Court that there had been prima facie evidence in favour of the applicant\u2019s version of events, and, consequently, it found the applicant\u2019s allegations sufficiently convincing and established beyond reasonable doubt.", "In contrast, Mr Abu Zubaydah had failed to produce such evidence and to make a credible claim either before the domestic authorities or before the Court. In view of the foregoing, the Government were confident that the burden of proof should not be shifted to them.", "475. The Government further stressed that the applicant\u2019s allegations concerning rendition to and from Lithuania, and his secret detention and illtreatment in CIA secret facilities in Lithuania had been rejected in their entirety as unfounded following the pre-trial investigation carried out by the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office.", "Those proceedings followed the Seimas inquiry. While it was true that the Seimas had come to conclusions that had left some doubt as to whether any CIA prisoners had been transported to and from the country and whether a CIA secret prison had operated on the premises of Project No. 1 and Project No. 2, all such doubts had been dispelled in the criminal investigation.", "In that context, the Government also drew the Court\u2019s attention to the limited competence of the Seimas and the nature of its inquiry as defined in the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling of 13 May 2004, holding that \u201cthe Seimas [was] neither an institution of pre-trial investigation under the Constitution, nor the prosecutor\u2019s office, nor the court\u201d and that \u201cthe conclusions of the Seimas ... investigation ... may not be construed as legal qualification of the actions that [it had] investigated ... and of other circumstances ... elucidated by it\u201d. Consequently, the Seimas findings had not been binding and remained subject to the verification in the prosecutor\u2019s investigation.", "476. The Government attached particular importance to the prosecutor\u2019s conclusion that in the course of the pre-trial investigation no evidence concerning unlawful rendition by the CIA of any persons, including the applicant, to or from Lithuania had been obtained. That decision had been based on a wide range of evidence, including classified sources, conclusively refuting the applicant\u2019s version of the events. Those findings, made as they were on a solid evidential basis could not, therefore, be undermined by the mere flight data or other information available in the public domain.", "477. In conclusion, the Government asked the Court to hold that there was no prima facie evidence in support of the applicant\u2019s version of events and that, accordingly, the burden of proof could not be shifted to them.", "478. The applicant submitted that in his case against Poland, the Court had acknowledged the undeniable evidential challenges that arose in a case of this nature, and how the facts of the case, and the nature of the allegations, conditioned the Court\u2019s approach to evidence and proof.", "As regards the \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d standard, to which the Government referred, the Court had long been clear that this did not have the meaning commonly associated with that term in criminal law and domestic systems. Proof might flow from the existence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences of presumptions of fact. The Court must adopt an approach consistent with its purpose as a Human Rights Court. Where the events in issue lay wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the domestic authorities, strong presumptions of fact might arise. When prima facie evidence was presented, the burden of proof shifted to the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation.", "479. In the applicant\u2019s view, the evidence in his case more than met the relevant standard of prima facie evidence and created, at a minimum, strong and concordant inferences of fact as to his secret detention on Lithuanian soil. The Government had failed to provide any satisfactory explanation in the face of overwhelming evidence that they had established a \u201cblack site\u201d on their territory. Instead, they had engaged in a policy of denial and obfuscation, drawing categorical conclusions that there could not possibly have been detainees on Lithuanian soil. These conclusions were plainly at odds with the evidence before the Court. As the Court in the Polish case had noted, given the nature of the case, the fact that there was no document identifying Abu Zubaydah by name as a detainee on a specific flight or in a specific secret prison site was not surprising and could not determine the outcome in this case. As the evidence plainly showed and as all the three experts had concluded, Abu Zubaydah had been transferred to the Lithuanian \u201cblack site\u201d on the relevant dates.", "480. The Court is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and has consistently recognised that it must be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (see Imakayeva v. Russia, no. 7615/02, \u00a7 113, ECHR 2006XIII (extracts); Aslakhanova and Others v. Russia, nos. 2944/06 and 4 others, \u00a7 96, 18 December 2012; and El-Masri, cited above, \u00a7 154; Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 393; and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 393).", "481. In assessing evidence, the Court has adopted the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d. However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems which use that standard. Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on the responsibility of Contracting States under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention \u2013 to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention \u2013 conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions.", "According to the Court\u2019s established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof, are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake. The Court is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a Contracting State has violated fundamental rights (see, among other examples, Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 161, Series A no. 25; Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7 147, ECHR 2005VII; Creang\u0103 v. Romania [GC], no. 29226/03, \u00a7 88, 23 February 2012; and El-Masri, cited above, \u00a7 151; Georgia v. Russia (I) [GC], no. 13255/07, \u00a7\u00a7 93-94, ECHR 2014 (extracts); Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 394; Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 394; and Nasr and Ghali v. Italy, no. 44883/09, \u00a7 119, 23 February 2016).", "482. While it is for the applicant to make a prima facie case and adduce appropriate evidence, if the respondent Government in their response to his allegations fail to disclose crucial documents to enable the Court to establish the facts or otherwise provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred, strong inferences can be drawn (see Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90 and 8 others, \u00a7 184, ECHR 2009, with further references; Kadirova and Others v. Russia, no. 5432/07, \u00a7 94, 27 March 2012; Aslakhanova and Others, cited above, \u00a7 97; Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 395; and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 395).", "483. Furthermore, the Convention proceedings do not in all cases lend themselves to a strict application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio. According to the Court\u2019s case-law under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, for instance as in the case of persons under their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during that detention. The burden of proof in such a case may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, \u00a7 85, ECHR 1999-IV; Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000-VII; and Imakayeva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 114-115; El-Masri, cited above, \u00a7 152; Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 396; Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 396; and Nasr and Ghali, cited above, \u00a7 220).", "In the absence of such explanation the Court can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the respondent Government (see El-Masri, cited above, \u00a7 152).", "484. The Court has already noted that it is not in a position to receive a direct account of the events complained of from the applicant (see paragraphs 15-16 above; also compare and contrast with other previous cases involving complaints about torture, ill-treatment in custody or unlawful detention, for example, El-Masri, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 16-36 and 156167; Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7\u00a7 13-24, ECHR 1999V; Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, \u00a7\u00a7 16-18, ECHR 2006IX; and Ila\u015fcu and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 188-211).", "485. The regime applied to High Value Detainees such as the applicant is described in detail in the CIA declassified documents, the 2014 US Senate Committee Report and also, on the basis, inter alia, of the applicant\u2019s own account, in the 2007 ICRC Report. That regime included transfers of detainees to multiple locations and involved holding them in continuous solitary confinement and incommunicado detention throughout the entire period of their undisclosed detention. The transfers to unknown locations and unpredictable conditions of detention were specifically designed to deepen their sense of disorientation and isolation. The detainees were usually unaware of their exact location (see Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 397-398; Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 397398; and paragraphs 47-58, 85 and 299 above).", "486. As held in Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) (cited above, \u00a7 397) and as emerges from the material cited above (see paragraphs 90-164 above), since 27 March 2002 the applicant has not had contact with the outside world, save the ICRC team in October and December 2006, the Combatant Status Review Tribunal\u2019s members and his US counsel. It has also been submitted that the applicant\u2019s communications with the outside world are subject to unprecedented restrictions and that his communications with his US counsel and his account of experiences in CIA custody are presumptively classified. In fact, for the last sixteen years, he has been subjected to a practical ban on communication with others, apart from mail contact with his family which was allowed at some point after his transfer to Guant\u00e1namo (see paragraphs 161-163 and 407 above).", "487. The above difficulties in gathering and producing evidence in the present case caused by the restrictions on the applicant\u2019s contact with the outside world and by the extreme secrecy surrounding the US rendition operations have inevitably had an impact on his ability to plead his case before the Court. Indeed, in his application and further written pleadings the events complained of were to a considerable extent reconstructed from threads of information gleaned from numerous public sources.", "In consequence, the Court\u2019s establishment of the facts of the case is to a great extent based on circumstantial evidence, including a large amount of evidence obtained through the international inquiries, considerably redacted documents released by the CIA, the declassified 2014 US Senate Committee Report, other public sources and the testimony of the experts heard by the Court (see also Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 400; and Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 400).", "488. Furthermore, it is to be noted that while the Government firmly denied the applicant\u2019s allegations in so far as they concerned Lithuania, they refrained from making any comments on the facts relating to the circumstances preceding his alleged rendition to Lithuania on 17 or 18 February 2005 or following his alleged transfer from the country on 25 March 2006 (see paragraphs 423-446 above).", "However, the facts complained of in the present case are part of a chain of events lasting from 27 March 2002 to 5 September 2006 and concerning various countries. The examination of the case necessarily involves the establishment of links between the dates and periods relevant to the applicant\u2019s detention and a sequence of alleged rendition flights to those countries. Accordingly, the Court\u2019s establishment of the facts and assessment of evidence cannot be limited to the events that allegedly took place in Lithuania but must, in so far as is necessary and relevant for the findings in the present case, take into account the circumstances occurring before and after his alleged detention in Lithuania (see Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 401-417); and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 401-419).", "489. The Court has already established beyond reasonable doubt the facts concerning the applicant\u2019s capture, rendition and secret detention until 22 September 2003, the date of his rendition on plane N313P from Poland to another CIA secret detention facility (see Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 401-404 and 406-419). The relevant passages from Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) containing the Court\u2019s findings of fact are cited above (see paragraphs 91 and 97 above). Some additional elements, which are all fully consistent with the Court\u2019s establishment of the facts in that case, can also be found in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report (see paragraphs 92-96 and 98 above).", "490. It is alleged that before being rendered by the CIA to Lithuania the applicant had been detained in Guant\u00e1namo from 23 September 2003 to Spring 2004 and, subsequently in Rabat, Morocco until 17 or 18 February 2005 (see paragraph 99 above).", "491. In Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) Mr J.G.S. testified that on 22 September 2003 the plane N313P had taken the applicant from Szymany, Poland via Bucharest and Rabat to Guant\u00e1namo. The plane\u2019s destinations to Romania and Morocco had been disguised by the so-called \u201cdummy\u201d flight planning, showing, among other things Constan\u0163a, not Bucharest as the arrival airport in Romania (see Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 109 and 312; see also paragraphs 103-104 above).", "In the present case, Mr Black, having analysed the available evidence, testified that \u201cAbu Zubaydah must have ... been taken to Guant\u00e1namo on that flight\u201d (see paragraph 108 above).", "492. The N313P rendition circuit of 20-24 September 2003 was analysed in detail in Husayn (Abu Zubaydah), where, as stated above, the Court held that on 22 September 2003 Mr Abu Zubaydah had been transferred by the CIA from Poland on board that plane to another CIA secret detention facility elsewhere. It also held that this flight had marked the end of CIA-associated aircraft landings in Poland and the closure of the CIA \u201cblack site\u201d codenamed \u201cQuartz\u201d in that country (see Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 414 and 419). The collation of data from multiple sources shows that the plane left Washington D.C. on 20 September 2003 and undertook a four-day flight circuit during which it landed in six countries. It arrived in Szymany from Kabul. It flew from Szymany to Bucharest, then to Rabat and from Rabat to Guant\u00e1namo on the night of 23 September 2003, landing there in the morning of 24 September 2003 (see paragraphs 103-104 and 108 above).", "493. The 2014 US Senate Committee Report confirms that \u201cbeginning in September 2003\u201d the CIA held its detainees at CIA facilities in Guant\u00e1namo and that by a \u2013 redacted but clearly two-digit \u2013 date in April 2004 \u201call five CIA detainees were transferred from Guant\u00e1namo to other CIA detention facilities\u201d pending the US Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Rasul v. Bush which, as the US authorities expected, \u201cmight grant habeas corpus rights to the five CIA detainees\u201d. The transfer was preceded by consultations among the US authorities in February 2004. It was recommended by the US Department of Justice (see paragraphs 61 and 110 above).", "494. At the fact-finding hearing in the present case, Mr J.G.S. explained that the applicant had been transferred from Guant\u00e1namo on board the rendition plane N85VM on 27 March 2004. The flight was first part of the CIA double rendition circuit performed by that plane between 27 March and 13 April 2004. On the first circuit some prisoners, including the applicant, were transferred to Rabat directly (see paragraph 107 above). Mr Black confirmed that everyone who had been taken to Guant\u00e1namo had had to be moved out in March or April 2004 (see paragraph 108). The experts identified the country to which the applicant had been transferred from Guant\u00e1namo as Morocco on the basis of the correlation of the flight data and unredacted information in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report (see paragraphs 105-108 above).", "495. Furthermore, both experts confirmed that the CIA, due to various disagreements with the Moroccan authorities, had been forced to take all its prisoners out of Morocco in early 2005. In that regard, the 2014 US Senate Committee Report relates \u201ctensions\u201d with a country whose name is redacted. Those tensions arose in connection with the \u201cdeterioration of intelligence cooperation\u201d and the treatment of their prisoners by the local authorities, resulting in \u201ccries of pain\u201d being heard by CIA detainees kept in the same detention facility. It states that the CIA detainees were transferred out of the country concerned in 2005; the month was redacted but seems to have comprised eight characters (see paragraphs 105-110 above).", "Both experts indicated February 2005 as the month in question. Mr J.G.S., referring to the Moroccan detention facility, testified that \u201cit [had been] in this site that Mr Zubaydah found himself in early 2005, specifically February 2005, when the aforementioned clear-out of Morocco [had taken] place\u201d (see paragraph 105 above). Mr Black stated that \u201cafter a certain time in Morocco, the CIA [had] had too many disagreements with the Moroccan Intelligence Agencies with regard to treatment of prisoners in Morocco. ... And so everyone who [had been] in Morocco [had been] moved out at the latest in February 2005\u201d (see paragraph 108).", "496. In the light of the material in its possession \u2013 which has not been as such contested by the Government (see paragraph 488 above) \u2013 the Court finds no counter evidence capable of casting doubt on the accuracy of the experts\u2019 conclusions regarding the above sequence of events, the places of the applicant\u2019s secret detention and the dates of his transfers during the relevant period.", "497. Accordingly, the Court finds it established beyond reasonable doubt that:", "(1) on 22 September 2003 on board N313P the applicant was transferred by the CIA from Szymany, Poland to Guant\u00e1namo, Cuba;", "(2) from 24 September 2003 to 27 March 2004 the applicant was detained in Guant\u00e1namo;", "(3) on 27 March 2004 on board N85VM the applicant was transferred by the CIA from Guant\u00e1namo to Rabat, Morocco;", "(4) from 27 March 2004 to an unspecified date in the month (redacted in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report), identified by the experts as February 2005, the applicant was detained in Morocco at a facility used by the CIA; and", "(5) on an unspecified date in February 2005 he was transferred by the CIA from Morocco to another detention facility elsewhere.", "498. It is alleged that a CIA secret detention facility, codenamed \u201cDetention Site Violet\u201d operated in Lithuania from 17 or 18 February 2005, the dates on which either or both CIA rendition planes N724CL and N787WH brought CIA detainees to Lithuania, to 25 March 2006, when it was closed following the detainees\u2019 transfer out of Lithuania on board the rendition plane N733MA (see paragraphs 111-117 and 449-459 above). The Government denied that a CIA detention facility had ever existed in Lithuania (see paragraphs 423-446 above).", "499. The Court notes at the outset that although the Government have contested the applicant\u2019s version of events on all accounts, they have not disputed the following facts, which were also established in the Seimas inquiry and confirmed in the course of the pre-trial investigation conducted in 2010-2011 (see paragraphs 174, 199, 307-349, and 367-370 above):", "(a) In 2002-2005 the CIA-related aircraft repeatedly crossed Lithuania\u2019s airspace; according to the CNSD Findings, on at least twenty-nine occasions.", "(b) In the period from 17 February 2005 to 25 March 2006 four CIA-related aircraft landed in Lithuania:", "\u2013 planes N724CL and N787WH landed at Vilnius International Airport on, respectively, 17 February 2005 and 6 October 2005;", "\u2013 planes N787WH and N733MA landed at Palanga International Airport on, respectively, 18 February 2005 and 25 March 2006.", "(d) On three occasions the SSD officers received the CIA aircraft and \u201cescorted what was brought by them\u201d with the knowledge of the heads of the SSD:", "\u2013 on 18 February 2005 N787WH, which landed at Palanga airport with five US passengers on board, without any thorough customs inspection of the plane being carried out; according to the CNSD Findings, \u201cno cargo was unloaded from it or onto it\u201d;", "\u2013 on 6 October 2005 N787WH, which landed at Vilnius airport, where a certain R.R., the SBGS officer, was prevented from inspecting the aircraft and no customs inspection of the plane was carried out; and", "\u2013 on 25 March 2006 N733MA, which landed at Palanga airport, but the SBGS documents contained no records of the landing and inspection of the plane, and no customs inspection was carried out.", "(e) In connection with the landing of N787WH in Vilnius on 6 October 2005 and of N733MA in Palanga on 25 March 2006 the SSD issued classified letters to the SBGS, but the letter regarding the landing on 6 October 2005 was delivered ex post facto, and before that event the SSD had never issued such letters.", "(f) The SSD high-ranking officers provided the US officers with unrestricted access to the aircraft at least on two occasions, including on 6 October 2005.", "(g) In 2002-2006 the SSD and the CIA were in \u201cpartnership cooperation\u201d, which involved the \u201cequipment of certain tailored facilities\u201d, i.e. Project No. 1 and Project No. 2.", "(h) The facilities of Project No. 1 were installed in 2002.", "(i) The SSD started the implementation of Project No. 2 in cooperation with the CIA at the beginning of 2004; this involved assisting the CIA in the acquisition of the land and building in Antaviliai and carrying out construction work in order to equip the facility; the work was carried out by contractors brought by the CIA to Lithuania; the materials and equipment for the facility were brought to Lithuania by the CIA in containers.", "(j) Project No. 1 and Project No. 2 were fully financed by the CIA.", "(k) Witnesses A and B2, politicians questioned in the criminal investigation, were addressed in connection with \u201cthe temporary possibility of holding persons suspected of terrorism\u201d and \u201cas regards the transportation and holding [of] people in Lithuania\u201d.", "500. The Court further notes that, according to the material in the case file, the first public disclosure of Lithuania\u2019s possible participation in the CIA secret detention scheme appeared on 20 August 2009 in the ABC News report. The report was followed by a more detailed publication of 18 November 2009. The reports mentioned \u201cCIA officials directly involved in or briefed on the highly classified [HVD] programme\u201d, \u201ca former US intelligence official\u201d, \u201cone of the former CIA officers involved in the secret prison program\u201d, \u201cLithuanian officials\u201d and \u201ca current Lithuanian government official\u201d as their sources.", "The August 2009 ABC News report stated that \u201cLithuanian officials [had] provided the CIA with a building on the outskirts of Vilnius ... where as many as eight suspects [had been] held for more than a year until late 2005 when they [had been] moved because of public disclosures\u201d. The reporters said that they had viewed flight logs \u2013 shown to them by \u201cone of the former CIA officers involved in the secret prison program\u201d, confirming that CIA planes made \u201crepeated flights into Lithuania during that period\u201d and that the purpose of the flights had been \u201cto move terrorist suspects\u201d. The officer told the reporters that the CIA had \u201carranged for false plans to be submitted to European aviation authorities\u201d. It was also reported that \u201cthe prison in Lithuania [had been] one of eight facilities the CIA set up after 9/11 to detain and interrogate al Qaeda operatives captured around the world\u201d (in this connection, see also paragraph 166 above).", "In November 2009 ABC News reported that a current Lithuanian government official and a former US intelligence official had told them that the CIA had \u201cbuilt one of its secret European prisons inside an exclusive riding academy outside Vilnius\u201d. ABC News stated that \u201cthe CIA [had built a thick concrete wall inside the riding area. Behind the wall, it [had] built what one Lithuanian source [had] called a \u2018building within a building\u2019. On a series of thick concrete pads, it [had] installed what a source called \u2018prefabricated pods\u2019 to house prisoners, each separated from another by five or six feet. Each pod included a shower, a bed and a toilet. Separate cells were constructed for interrogations. ... Intelligence officers working at the prison [had been] housed next door in the converted stable ... Electrical power for both structures [had been] provided by a 2003 Caterpillar autonomous generator. All the electrical outlets in the renovated structure [had been] 110 volts, meaning that they [had been] designed for American appliances\u201d (see paragraphs 258-259 above).", "501. The Government have contested the evidential value of the above publications and, in general terms, expressed reservations as to the evidential value of media and other reports in the public domain (see paragraphs 423-424 above).", "However, at the material time the Lithuanian authorities apparently considered the August 2009 ABC News disclosure sufficiently credible, given that the report prompted the joint meeting of the CNSD and Committee on Foreign Affairs on 9 September 2009 and the further parliamentary inquiry, which was opened on 5 November 2009. In the course of the inquiry the CNSD interviewed fifty-five persons, including the highest authorities of the State, and obtained various evidence, including classified information (see paragraphs 167-176 above).", "The CNSD, made the following findings:", "(a) In 2002-2005 the aircraft that had been linked in official investigations to the transportation of CIA detainees had crossed Lithuania\u2019s airspace on repeated occasions.", "(b) It had not been established whether CIA detainees had been transported through Lithuania; however, conditions for such transportation had existed.", "(c) The SSD had received a request from the CIA to equip facilities suitable for holding detainees.", "(d) The SSD, in Project No. 1, had created conditions for holding detainees in Lithuania; \u201dfacilities suitable for holding detainees [had been] equipped, taking account of the requests and conditions set out by the partners\u201d; however, according to evidence in the CNSD\u2019s possession the premises had not been used for that purpose.", "(e) While persons who had given evidence to the CNSD had denied that there existed any preconditions for holding and interrogating detainees at Project No. 2, the layout of the building, its enclosed nature and protection of the perimeter, as well as the fragmented presence of the SSD staff at the premises allowed the CIA officers to carry out activities without the SSD\u2019s control and to use the infrastructure at their discretion.", "The above Findings were endorsed by the Seimas in its Resolution of 19 January 2010 (see paragraph 174 above).", "502. The Government submitted that the CNSD Findings had been subsequently verified in the pre-trial investigation conducted in 2010-2011. According to the Government, the investigation, based on the testimony of witnesses who had been directly involved in the implementation of Project No. 1 and Project No. 2, and in the landing and departure procedures for CIA flights, had conclusively established that there had been no CIA secret detention centre in Lithuania, that the facilities of Project No. 1 and Project No. 2 had not been, and could not have been, used for holding detainees and that there had been no evidence of CIA detainees ever being held in the country. The sole purpose of the CIA planes landing was, in the Government\u2019s words, the delivery of a \u201cspecial cargo\u201d, described as a \u201cconnection\u201d or \u201ccommunication\u201d equipment providing the SSD and the CIA \u201cwith technical services in order to implement their joint project\u201d. The Government also attached importance to the fact that Lithuania had not been the object of any international inquiries conducted into the European countries\u2019 collusion in the CIA HVD Programme (see paragraphs 426-446 above).", "503. As regards the latter argument, the Court observes that it is true that, on account of the fact that the allegations of the CIA secret prison being run in Lithuania emerged only in August 2009 (see paragraphs 258 and 500 above), Lithuania had not been included in any of the inquiries carried out by the Council of Europe and the European Parliament in 2005-2007 (see paragraphs 269-286 above). Nor were any international investigations of a scale comparable to the Marty Inquiry and the Fava Inquiry subsequently conducted into the allegations concerning Lithuania.", "504. However, the investigative work of the experts involved in the 2010 UN Joint Study encompassed Lithuania\u2019s possible involvement in the CIA scheme of secret prisons. According to the UN experts, research for the study, including data strings relating to the country, appear to confirm that it was integrated into the CIA extraordinary rendition programme in 2004 (see paragraph 303 above).", "505. The CPT delegation visit to Lithuania on 14-18 June 2010 and the 2011 CPT Report involved the issue of alleged CIA secret prisons. While the central focus for the delegation was to try to assess the effectiveness of the pre-trial investigation which was at that time pending, the CPT considered it important to visit the \u201ctwo tailored facilities\u201d identified in the CNSD Findings as Project No. 1 and Project No. 2. The 2011 CPT Report, referring to Project No. 2, described the facilities as \u201cfar larger than\u201d Project No. 1\u201d and consisting of \u201ctwo buildings ... connected and divided into four distinct sectors\u201d. In one of the buildings, \u201cthe layout of premises resembled a large metal container enclosed with a surrounding external structure\u201d. The CPT refrained from providing a more detailed description of the facilities but concluded that even though when visited by the delegation the premises did not contain anything that was \u201chighly suggestive of a context of detention\u201d, both Project No. 1 and Project No. 2 could be adapted for detention purposes \u201cwith relatively little effort\u201d (see paragraphs 350-352 above).", "506. It is also to be noted that since at least early 2012, the European Parliament, through the LIBE Committee, has conducted an inquiry into allegations concerning Lithuania\u2019s complicity in the CIA extraordinary rendition scheme. As part of the inquiry, the LIBE delegation visited Lithuania and carried out an inspection of Project No. 2 which, in the words of the LIBE Rapporteur, Ms Flautre, was described as a \u201ckind of building within the building, a double-shell structure\u201d equipped with an \u201cenormous air-conditioning system and a water-pumping system, the purpose of which [was] not evident\u201d (see paragraph 289 above). That visit gave rise to concerns subsequently expressed in the 2012 EP Resolution, which stated that \u201cthe layout [of Project No. 2] and installations inside appear[ed] to be compatible with the detention of prisoners\u201d (see paragraph 290 above).", "507. Furthermore, the conclusions of the pre-trial investigation relied on by the Government and the Government\u2019s explanation of the purpose of the CIA planes landing seem to have been contradicted by other evidence in the Court\u2019s possession, including material available in the public domain and the experts\u2019 testimony.", "To begin with, as regards the purpose of the CIA-linked planes landing in Lithuania at the material time, the extensive flight data produced by the applicant, including the data in the 2015 Reprieve Briefing, and expert evidence show that in respect of three out of four planes that landed in and departed from Vilnius and Palanga airports during the period from 17 February 2005 to 25 March 2006 the CIA used its methodology of \u201cdummy\u201d flight planning, that is to say, a deliberate disguise of their true destinations by declaring in the flight plans the route that the planes did not, nor even intended to, fly (see paragraphs 123-125 and 130-133 above). According to expert evidence obtained by the Court in Al Nashiri v. Poland and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, as well as in the present case, the methodology of disguising flight planning pertained primarily to those renditions which dropped detainees off at the destination \u2013 in other words, at the airport connected with the CIA secret detention facility (see Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 316-318; and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 310-312; see also paragraph 127 above).", "(a) Significantly, the N787WH\u2019s circuit executed on 15-19 February 2005 included two disguised \u2013 undeclared \u2013 destinations on the plane\u2019s route from Rabat to Palanga. The first disguised destination was Bucharest, whereas the flight plan was filed for Constan\u0163a; the second one was Palanga, whereas the flight plan was filed for Gothenburg (see paragraph 123 above).", "(b) The N787WH\u2019s circuit on 1-7 October 2005 was disguised by both the \u201cdummy\u201d flight planning and switching aircraft in the course of the rendition operation, also called a \u201cdouble-plane switch\u201d \u2013 that is to say, another CIA method of disguising its prisoner-transfers, which was designed, according to expert J.G.S., to avoid the eventuality of the same aircraft appearing at the site of two different places of secret detention (see paragraph 129 above; see also Al Nashiri v. Romania, cited above, \u00a7 135).", "The experts testified that the \u201cdouble-plane switch\u201d operation had been executed on 5-6 October 2005 in Tirana by two planes \u2013 N308AB, which arrived there from Bucharest after collecting detainees from the CIA \u201cblack site\u201d in Romania, and N787WH. The CIA detainees \u201cswitched\u201d planes in Tirana and they were transferred from N308AB onto N787WH for the rendition flight. On its departure from Tirana, N787WH filed a false plan to Tallinn in order to enable the flight to enter Lithuanian airspace, but its true destination was Vilnius, where it landed on 6 October 2005 in the early hours (see paragraphs 114, 130-131 and 140 above).", "In relation to this flight it is also noteworthy that the flight data submitted by the Lithuanian aviation authorities to the CNSD in the course of the Seimas inquiry indicated that N787WH had arrived from Antalya, Turkey (see paragraph 174 above). Witnesses questioned in the pre-trial investigation gave inconsistent indications as to where the plane arrived from. For instance, Witness B3 spoke of an \u201cunplanned aircraft from Antalya\u201d (see paragraph 315 above). Witness B4 (\u201cperson B\u201d) said that it had \u201carrived from Tallinn without passengers\u201d and that it had \u201carrived in Tallinn from Antalya\u201d (see paragraph 316 above). The Administration of Civil Aviation, for its part, informed the prosecutor that \u201cthey could [have] confuse[d] the code of Antalya and Tirana due to their similarity\u201d (see paragraph 183 above).", "(c) According to the experts, a combination of \u201cdummy\u201d flight planning and aircraft switching methodologies was likewise used in connection with the N733MA flight on 25 March 2006 (see paragraphs 134 and 140 above). The Palanga airport records indicated that on that date the plane had arrived in Palanga from Porto and that it had left for Porto on the same day (see paragraphs 125 and 174 above). However, as stated in the 2015 Reprieve Briefing and confirmed by the experts at the fact-finding hearing, a false plan was filed for Porto, whereas the plane flew to Cairo where it made connection with N740EH, another CIA rendition plane. The 2015 Reprieve Briefing also states that the documents relating to the planning of these two trips showed complex attempts to disguise the fact that the purpose of the trips was to provide a connection between Lithuania and Afghanistan (see paragraph 125 above).", "In the Court\u2019s view, the CIA\u2019s above repeated, deliberate recourse to the complex flight-disguising methodologies typical of rendition flights transporting detainees to \u201cblack sites\u201d does not appear to be consistent with the stated purpose of the CIA-linked planes landing in Lithuania, which according to the Government had been merely the delivery of \u201cspecial cargo\u201d, described as \u201ccommunication\u201d or \u201cconnection\u201d equipment\u201d, in the context of the routine intelligence cooperation (see paragraphs 427-432 above).", "508. The Court further observes that in respect of the above planes the authorities applied a distinct practice, which resembles the special procedure for landings of CIA aircraft in Szymany airport followed by the Polish authorities in December 2002-September 2003 and found by the Court to have been one of the elements indicative of the State\u2019s complicity in the CIA HVD Programme (see Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 418 and 442; and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 420 and 444).", "In particular, as in Poland, the planes were not subject to any customs or the border guard control. On 6 October 2005 the SBGS officer R.R. was prevented from carrying out the N787WH plane inspection (see paragraphs 174 and 366 above). In connection with the arrivals of the \u201cpartners\u2019\u201d and the SSD officers at the airports, classified letters asking for access to the aircraft were issued to the SBGS at least on two occasions \u2013 one ex post facto, following the above incident with the SBGS officer on 6 October 2005 and one in connection with the N733MA landing in Palanga on 25 March 2006. Also, the rendition planes landing involved special security procedures organised by the CIA\u2019s counterpart in Lithuania. As confirmed by the SSD officers questioned in the course of the pre-trial investigation, they used to escort \u201cthe partners\u201d, that is to say, the CIA teams to and from Vilnius and Palanga airports. In that connection, the CIA asked the SSD to make security arrangements. In the airport, the CIA vehicles approached the aircraft, whereas the SSD\u2019s escorting vehicles remained at some distance (see paragraphs 174, 184, 315, 329, 337, 346, 366, 370-371 above).", "509. At the fact-finding hearing held in the present case the experts, Mr J.G.S. and Mr Black, confirmed categorically that \u2013 beyond reasonable doubt \u2013 a CIA secret detention facility had operated in Lithuania in the period indicated by the applicant. In the same categorical terms they identified Lithuania as a country hosting the CIA secret detention facility codenamed \u201cDetention Site Violet\u201d in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report (see paragraphs 128-145 above). The 2015 Reprieve Briefing, relying on research into the CIA rendition operations, the analysis of the public data regarding the CIA prisoners\u2019 transfers and the unredacted parts of the report, likewise concluded that it had been established beyond reasonable doubt that one of the facilities adapted by the CIA in Lithuania had been used to hold prisoners and that Detention Site Violet had been located in Lithuania (see paragraphs 120-122 above).", "510. The experts and the Briefing gave the same time-frame \u2013 February 2005-March 2006 \u2013 for the CIA\u2019s secret prison operation. The Briefing stated that the opening of the site had been marked by the transfer of prisoners which could have been effected on either or both of two CIA rendition aircraft \u2013 N724CL, which landed in Vilnius on 17 February 2005, or N787WH, which landed in Palanga on 18 February 2005 (see paragraph 123 above).", "Both experts stated that the opening of the CIA \u201cblack site\u201d in Lithuania had been prompted by the disagreements with the Moroccan authorities in the administering of a secret detention site used by the CIA in Rabat, which had led to the transfer of the CIA detainees out of Morocco (see paragraphs 129, 132-133 and 139-141 above).", "511. In that regard, Mr J.G.S. referred to the \u201ccyclical nature\u201d of the CIA detention sites and explained that the CIA HVD Programme had included several junctures \u201cat which one detention close[d] abruptly and another open[ed] in its place\u201d. In his view, \u201c17-18 February 2005 had been the critical juncture at which CIA detention operations overseas had been dramatically overhauled\u201d. In the light of the flight data of February 2005, there were only two destinations for detainees being taken from Morocco \u2013Romania and Lithuania.", "Mr J.G.S. reached the \u201cincontrovertible conclusion\u201d that when the facility in Morocco had been finally closed, the only possibility was that Detention Site Violet in Lithuania then took the detainees from Morocco in conjunction with Detention Site Black in Romania (see paragraphs 129-137 above). He further stated that references in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report had \u201caccorded completely with the timings, with the character and with the chronological progression of detention operations in respect of Lithuania\u201d. He referred to the report\u2019s sections stating that Detention Site Violet had been created in a \u201cseparate country\u201d from any of the other detention sites mentioned therein. This, in his view, had opened a new territory in the CIA HVD Programme and referred to a site that had endured beyond the life span of Detention Site Black in Romania which, according to report, was closed shortly after the Washington Post publication of 2 November 2005.", "In that connection, Mr J.G.S. also testified that the two projects in Lithuania aimed at providing support to the CIA detention operations, referred to in the Seimas inquiry as Project No. 1 and Project No. 2, corresponded to the description of two facilities in the country hosting Detention Site Violet. In particular, the report stated that by mid-2003 the CIA had concluded that its completed but still unused holding cell in the country \u2013 by which it had meant Project No. 1 \u2013 had been insufficient. It further stated that the CIA had thus sought to build a new expanded facility in the country. This corresponded precisely with the description of the provenance of Project No. 2 as given in the CNSD Findings (see paragraph 133 above).", "512. Mr Black said that the report clearly indicated that Detention Site Violet had operated from February 2005 to March 2006. The site had been in a country where there had previously been another site that had never been used. This detail of there having been two sites, one never used and one that had been used between February 2005 and March 2006 corresponded accurately with the parliamentary inquiry\u2019s findings, stating that \u201cpartners\u201d \u2013 the CIA \u2013 had equipped two sites. His research established that flights went into and out of Lithuania precisely at the time that the prisoners were said to have been moved into and out of Detention Site Violet. This corresponded with flights into and out of Lithuania in, firstly, February 2005, then in October 2005 and lastly in March 2006 (see paragraph 140 above).", "Mr Black added that, taking into account the whole weight of various indicators, \u201cthe only solution that ma[d]e any sense is that the solution that indeed the site in Lithuania [had] operated at the times that we [had] stated and [had been] serviced by the flights that we [had] stated\u201d (see paragraph 144 above).", "513. In that context the Court would also note that, as shown by the evidence referred to above, the 17-18 February 2005 flights were followed by the landing on 6 October 2005 of the plane N787WH, which, according to the experts, transferred CIA detainees, via a \u201cdouble-plane switch\u201d operation in Tirana, from the CIA facility codenamed \u201cDetention Site Black\u201d in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report and located in Bucharest. Mr Black added that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had been transferred from Romania to Detention Site Violet in Lithuania on that plane (see paragraphs 130-131 and 143-144 above).", "514. The experts were not in complete agreement as to which date \u2013 17 or 18 February 2005 \u2013 was the one definitely marking the opening of the CIA \u201cblack site\u201d in Lithuania.", "Mr J.G.S. considered that it was more likely that the flight of N734CL on 17 February 2005 signified the opening of the \u201cblack site\u201d, since it had landed in Vilnius and Vilnius was the airport physically associated with Antaviliai, the location of the CIA facility. However, he did not rule out the possibility that another airfield, Palanga, may have been used in conjunction with Vilnius (see paragraphs 130, 134 and 137 above).", "Mr Black, for his part, was categorical in stating that the transfer of detainees from Morocco to Lithuania had been executed by the N787WH flight into Palanga on 18 February 2005 (see paragraphs 141-142 above).", "However, the Court does not find it indispensable to rule on which specific date the CIA site in Lithuania opened given that, according to the evidence before it, there were only these two, closely situated, dates on which it could have happened.", "515. As regards the date marking the end of Detention Site Violet\u2019s operation, both Mr J.G.S. and Mr Black stated that it had been closed as a result of medical issues experienced by CIA detainees, who had been refused medical treatment in the country, as described in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report. The experts linked the closure to the rendition mission executed by the plane N733MA, which had landed in Palanga on 25 March 2006. They stated that it had taken the CIA prisoners via Cairo by means of an aircraft switching operation to another detention facility, which they unambiguously identified as \u201cDetention Site Brown\u201d located in Afghanistan. The 2015 LIBE Briefing likewise stated that the above transfer had matched the closure of Detention Site Violet. In that regard, it also referred to the passages in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report, stating that the site had been closed as a result of lack of available medical care in the \u201cfive-character redacted\u201d month in 2006 \u2013 the redacted month could only be \u201cMarch\u201d or \u201cApril\u201d on account of the length of the redaction (see paragraphs 122-125 and 128-145 above).", "516. As regards the physical location of Detention Site Violet, both Mr J.G.S. and Mr Black stated that, beyond reasonable doubt, it had been located in Antaviliai, a neighbourhood of Vilnius, in the former horse-riding academy converted into a customised CIA detention facility, the construction of which had been supervised by the CIA \u201cafresh\u201d. Mr Black, who in 2011-2012 had made several trips to Antaviliai to interview local people, said it was clear from those interviews that the Americans had been there, had been fitting the site out, had been guarding the place and that vehicles with tinted windows had been coming and going (see paragraphs 137 and 140 above).", "517. Lastly, the experts, on the analysis of the 2014 US Senate Committee Report and recently declassified CIA material, also established that at least five CIA prisoners were held at Detention Site Violet and conclusively identified three of them \u2013 Mustafa al-Hawsawi, who was explicitly mentioned in the report in connection with medical issues experienced at that site, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the applicant (see paragraphs 133, 135 and 141 above).", "518. The Court observes that the 2014 US Senate Committee Report includes several references to Detention Site Violet. It clearly refers to two detention facilities in the country hosting that site: one completed but, \u201cby mid-2003\u201d, still unused and considered by the CIA as insufficient \u201cgiven the growing number of CIA detainees in the program and the CIA\u2019s interest in interrogating multiple detainees at the same detention site\u201d and one \u201cexpanded\u201d which the CIA \u201csought to build\u201d. In that connection, the CIA offered some redacted sum of USD million \u201cto \u2018show appreciation\u2019 ... for the ... support\u201d for the CIA HVD Programme (see paragraph 147 above). That information is consistent with evidence from witnesses M, N, O and P, who were questioned in the criminal investigation. They confirmed that in 2003 N and O had been assigned to assist their CIA partners in finding suitable premises for a joint project \u2013 an \u201cintelligence support centre\u201d\u2013 in respect of which the partners had \u201cused to cover all expenses\u201d. According to Witness P, in 2002-2003 the \u201cpartners\u201d had come and proposed to organise a joint operation, \u201cto establish the premises in Lithuania for the protection of secret collaborators\u201d. Witness O said that the CIA partners had chosen the premises which had then become Project No. 2 and that they had started to come in Spring 2004, had carried out the work themselves and had brought material and the equipment in the containers (see paragraphs 333337 above).", "519. The 2014 US Senate Report further states that Detention Site Violet \u201copened in early 2005\u201d (see paragraph 148 above). This element corresponds to the dates of the landings of the rendition planes N724CL and N787WH \u2013 17 and 18 February 2005. It also corresponds to the statement of Witness S, who testified that Project No. 2 had been \u201cestablished at the beginning of 2005\u201d (see paragraph 341 above).", "The closure of Detention Site Violet is mentioned in the report in a specific context and chronology, namely \u201cpress stories\u201d, in particular the Washigton Post publication of 2 November 2005 that led to the closure of Detention Site Black and \u201cthe CIA\u2019s inability to provide emergency medical care\u201d due to the refusal of the country hosting Detention Site Violet to admit Mustafa al-Hawsawi, one of the CIA detainees, to a local hospital. This refusal, according to the report, resulted in the CIA\u2019s having sought assistance from third-party countries in providing medical care to him and \u201cfour other CIA detainees with acute ailments\u201d. In relation to the Washington Post publication, the report gives a fairly specific time-frame for the closure of Detention Site Black, which occurred \u201cshortly thereafter\u201d. However, Detention Site Violet still operated in \u201cearly January 2006\u201d. At that time \u201cthe CIA was holding twenty-eight detainees in its two remaining facilities, Detention Site Violet ... and Detention Site Orange\u201d. Detention Site Violet was closed in 2006, in the month whose name comprised five characters which were redacted in the report (see paragraph 149 above). As noted in the 2015 Reprieve Briefing, there are only two possibilities: the relevant month could be either \u201cMarch\u201d or \u201cApril\u201d 2006.", "520. Considering the material referred to above as whole, the Court is satisfied that there is prima facie evidence in favour of the applicant\u2019s allegation that the CIA secret detention site operated in Lithuania between 17 or 18 February 2005 and 25 March 2006. Accordingly, the burden of proof should shift to the respondent Government (see El-Masri, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 154-165 and paragraph 482 above).", "521. However, the Government have failed to demonstrate why the evidence referred to above cannot serve to corroborate the applicant\u2019s allegations. Apart from their reliance on the conclusions of the criminal investigation of 2010-2011 and, in particular, the testimony of witnesses who, as the Government underlined, had all consistently denied that any transfers of CIA detainees had taken place or that a CIA had run a secret detention facility in Lithuania, they have not offered convincing reasons for the series and purpose of the CIA-associated aircraft landings at Vilnius and Palanga between 17 February 2005 and 25 March 2006, the special procedures followed by the authorities in that connection and the actual purpose served by Project No. 2 at the material time (see paragraphs 424443 above).", "522. The witness testimony obtained in the criminal investigation is the key evidence adduced by the Government in support of their arguments (see paragraphs 307-349 above). The Court has not had the possibility of having access to full versions of the testimony since the relevant material was and still is classified. It has nevertheless been able to assess that evidence on the basis of a summary description produced by the Government (see paragraphs 304-306 above).", "Having considered the material submitted, the Court finds a number of elements that do not appear to be consistent with the version of events presented by the Government.", "523. First, the Government asserted that both Project No. 1 and No. 2 were found to have been completely unsuitable for secret detention (see paragraphs 433-442 above).", "The Court does not find it necessary to analyse in detail the purposes actually served by Project No. 1 or determine whether or not that facility was used, as the Government argued at the oral hearing, for \u201cextraction\u201d or \u201cexfiltration\u201d of secret agents or otherwise, since in the present case it is not claimed that CIA detainees were held in that facility. It thus suffices for the Court to take note of the CNSD\u2019s conclusion that in Project No. 1 \u201cconditions were created for holding detainees in Lithuania\u201d (see paragraph 174 above).", "524. Secondly, as regards Project No. 2, the Government submitted that while the exact purpose served by the premises at the material time could not be revealed since it was classified, the witnesses had unequivocally confirmed that no premises suitable for detainees had been located there. Moreover, access to the premises had been under the permanent surveillance of the SSD and there had been no secret zones inaccessible to the SSD officers in the building. This excluded any possibility of unauthorised access or holding detainees in the premises (see paragraphs 436-441 above).", "However, the Court notes that Witnesses N and O, the SSD officers assigned to assist the CIA partners, who escorted them to and from the airports and who were also responsible for supervision of the premises, said that they had not visited all the rooms. Witness N said that he had not had access to the \u201cadministration area\u201d. O was not given access to all the premises. Moreover, the building was apparently not used for the purpose of the declared \u201cjoint operation\u201d of an intelligence support centre. The only Lithuanian intelligence personnel present in the building were the three SSD officers M, N and O, who supervised the building on changing shifts even if nobody was there. Witness O stated that he had not known who had arrived at the premises or \u201cwith what they had been occupied with\u201d. Witness N \u201cwas not aware of the contents of the operations\u201d that were carried out in Project No. 2. Witnesses N and O \u201cactively supervised\u201d the building until the second half of 2005 but then the number of the CIA partners\u2019 visits decreased (see paragraphs 333-337 above).", "525. As regards the Government\u2019s explanation that the premises were acquired for the SSD\u2019s needs and used for \u201cshort-term meetings\u201d with \u201ctheir guests\u201d (see paragraph 439 above), the layout of one of the buildings at Project No. 2, depicted by the CPT as \u201ca large metal container enclosed within a surrounding external structure\u201d and by the LIBE delegation as \u201ca kind of building within the building\u201d (see paragraphs 289 and 352 above) does not strike the Court as being a structure typical for the declared purpose. Also, no convincing explanation has been provided as to why Project No. 2, claimed to have been designated for an \u201cintelligence support centre\u201d and reconstructed with evidently considerable effort and expense on the part of the CIA had \u2013 according to the witnesses \u2013 been virtually unused by the SSD or their partners throughout 2005 (see paragraphs 333-338 and 341 above).", "526. The Government further argued that in the light of abundant evidence it had been established in the criminal investigation that the purpose of two CIA-linked flights into Palanga, alleged to have transported the applicant to and out of Lithuania, namely N787WH and N733MA, which had taken place on, respectively, 18 February 2005 and 25 March 2006 had been the delivery of a \u201cspecial cargo\u201d. The object of the delivery was \u201cspecial equipment for a special investigation department\u201d in a number of boxes, which had all been of the same size, one metre long (see paragraphs 427-432 above).", "527. However, the witness statements relied on are not only partly inconsistent with each other but they also do not fully support the Government\u2019s account. Furthermore, the Government\u2019s account is at variance with evidence collected in the course of the parliamentary inquiry. In this regard, the Court would refer to testimony given by the SSD officers involved in escorting \u201ccargo\u201d and the CIA partners to and from the Lithuanian airports and to the CNSD Findings.", "528. As regards the Government\u2019s submission that the purpose of the flight N787WH which landed in Palanga on 18 February 2005 was the delivery of cargo containing the \u201cconnection\u201d or \u201ccommunication\u201d equipment (see paragraphs 428-432 above), the Court notes that none of the witnesses heard in the criminal investigation referred to any \u201cdelivery of cargo\u201d to Lithuania in relation to the plane in question (see paragraphs 333337 and 346 above). It further notes that the Government\u2019s contention stands in contrast with the CNSD Findings, which in the light of the evidence gathered in the inquiry, established that \u201cno cargo was unloaded from it or onto it\u201d (see paragraph 174 above). However, as confirmed by the 2010 SBGS letter, \u201cfive US citizens arrived in the Republic of Lithuania on that plane\u201d (see paragraph 371 above).", "529. Moreover, the statements made by witnesses V and O do not support the Government\u2019s contention that the purpose of the flight N733MA into Palanga on 25 March 2006 was likewise \u201cto deliver equipment\u201d for the Lithuanian \u201cspecial investigation department\u201d. On the contrary, the two escorting officers clearly related the loading of a \u201ccargo\u201d onto the CIA aircraft from the CIA partners\u2019 vehicles (see paragraphs 333-337 and 346 above). This happened in the course of what was called an \u201coperation\u201d, which suggests that the activities involved in the aircraft landing and loading were not quite of a routine nature. As in respect of the other CIA aircraft landings referred to above (see paragraphs 507-508 above), the special procedure, without any customs or SBGS control, had been applied.", "530. Having regard to the inconsistency of the Government\u2019s version with the witness statements and the factual findings made by the Lithuanian Parliament and in the light of the documentary and expert evidence analysed in detail above, the Government\u2019s explanations as to the purposes served by the CIA rendition flights landing in Lithuania between 17 February 2005 and 25 March 2006 and the facility Project No. 2 cannot be regarded as convincing.", "531. In view of the foregoing and taking into account all the elements analysed in detail above, the Court concludes that the Government have not produced any evidence capable of contradicting the applicant\u2019s allegations.", "In particular, they have not refuted the applicant\u2019s argument that the planes N724CL, N787WH and N733MA that landed in Lithuania between 17 February 2005 and 25 March 2006 served the purposes of the CIA rendition operations and the conclusions of the experts heard by the Court, categorically stating that the aircraft in question were used by the CIA for transportation of prisoners into Lithuania. Nor have they refuted the applicant\u2019s assertion that the above rendition flights marked the opening and the closure of a CIA secret prison referred to in the 2014 US Senate Report as \u201cDetention Site Violet\u201d, which was conclusively confirmed by expert evidence to the effect that Detention Site Violet was located in Lithuania and operated during the period indicated by the applicant (see also and compare with Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 414-415; and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 414-415).", "532. Consequently, the Court considers the applicant\u2019s allegations sufficiently convincing and, having regard to the above evidence from various sources corroborating his version, finds it established beyond reasonable doubt that:", "(a) a CIA detention facility, codenamed Detention Site Violet according to the 2014 US Senate Committee Report, was located in Lithuania;", "(b) the facility started operating either from 17 February 2005, the date of the CIA rendition flight N724CL into Vilnius airport, or from 18 February 2005, the date of the CIA rendition flight N787WH into Palanga airport; and", "(c) the facility was closed on 25 March 2006 and its closure was marked by the CIA rendition flight N733MA into Palanga airport, which arrived from Porto, Portugal and, having disguised its destination in its flight plan by indicating Porto, on the same day took off for Cairo, Egypt.", "533. It is alleged that the applicant was transferred to Lithuania from Rabat, Morocco either on 17 February 2005 on board N724CL or on 18 February 2006 on board N787WH and that he had been secretly detained at Detention Site Violet in Lithuania until 25 March 2005, when he had been transferred out of Lithuania on board N733MA (see paragraphs 112117 above).", "534. The Court is mindful of the fact that, as regards the applicant\u2019s actual presence in Lithuania, there is no direct evidence that it was the applicant who was transported on 17 or 18 February 2005, the two possible dates indicated by the experts (see paragraphs 130-135 above) from Rabat to Lithuania or that he was subsequently transferred on 25 March 2006 from Lithuania to another CIA secret detention facility on board the plane N733MA.", "The applicant, who for years on end was held in detention conditions specifically designed to isolate and disorientate detainees by transfers to unknown locations, even if he had been allowed to testify before the Court, would not be able to say where he was detained. Nor can it be reasonably expected that he will ever, on his own, be able to identify the places in which he was held.", "No trace of the applicant can, or will, be found in any official flight or border police records in Lithuania or in other countries because his presence on the planes and on their territories was, by the very nature of the rendition operations, purposefully not to be recorded. As confirmed by expert J.G.S. in Al Nashiri v. Poland and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, in the countries concerned the official records showing numbers of passengers and crew arriving and departing on the rendition planes neither included, nor purported to include detainees who were brought into or out of the territory involuntarily, by means of clandestine HVD renditions. Those detainees were never listed among the persons on board in documents filed with any official institution (see Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 410-411; and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 410-411).", "535. In view of the foregoing, in order to ascertain whether or not it can be concluded that the applicant was detained at Detention Site Violet in Lithuania at the relevant time, the Court will take into account all the facts that have already been found established beyond reasonable doubt (see paragraphs 489-532 above) and analyse all other material in its possession, including, in particular, the 2014 US Senate Committee Report and expert evidence reconstructing the chronology of the applicant\u2019s rendition and detention in 2002-2006 (see paragraphs 102-156, 159, 167-200 and 264-395 above).", "536. As noted above, the facts of the present case form an integral part of a chain of events lasting from the applicant\u2019s capture on 27 March 2002 to his transfer by the CIA into the custody of the US military authorities in the Guant\u00e1namo Bay Naval Base on 5 September 2006. Those events took place in multiple countries hosting the CIA secret detention facilities that operated under the HVD Programme during that period. They involve a continuing sequence of the applicant\u2019s renditions from one country to another, with the periods of his detention at each country\u2019s \u201cblack site\u201d being marked by the movements of the CIA\u2019s rendition aircraft corresponding to locations within the network of secret prisons (see paragraphs 485-488 above).", "537. The Court further notes that the facts concerning the applicant\u2019s secret detention and continuous renditions from the time of his capture in Faisalabad, Pakistan, on 27 March 2002 to his rendition from Rabat, Morocco, in February 2005, including the names of the countries in which he was detained, the exact dates on which he was transferred by the CIA to and out of each country and the identities of all the rendition planes on which he was transferred have already been established conclusively and to the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt in Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland and in the present case (see Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 404 and 419; and paragraphs 489-532 above).", "538. In particular, it has been established beyond reasonable doubt that until an unspecified date in February 2005 the applicant was held in secret detention in Morocco, at a facility used by the CIA and that on that date he was transferred by the CIA from Morocco to another detention facility elsewhere (see paragraph 497 above).", "It has also been established to the same standard of proof, beyond reasonable doubt, that:", "(a) The CIA secret detention facility codenamed \u201cDetention Site Violet\u201d in the 2014 US Senate Committee Report became operational in Lithuania either on 17 February 2005, the date of the CIA rendition flight N724CL from Rabat via Amman, which landed at Vilnius airport or on 18 February 2005, the date of the CIA rendition flight N787WH from Rabat via Bucharest, which landed at Palanga airport.", "(b) The Detention Site Violet operated in Lithuania until 25 March 2006, the date of the CIA rendition flight N733MA from Palanga airport to Cairo (see paragraph 532 above).", "539. It accordingly remains for the Court to determine whether it has been adequately demonstrated to the required standard of proof that the applicant was transferred from Morocco to Lithuania on either of the February 2005 CIA flights and whether he was secretly detained in Lithuania over the subsequent period, until 25 March 2006.", "540. The Court observes that the main argument put forward by the Government is that there is no credible evidence confirming the applicant\u2019s presence in Lithuania during that period and no link between the impugned flights and the applicant. In the Government\u2019s submission, even if the flights had been linked with the CIA and landed in Lithuania, it could not constitute a proof of his detention in the country (see paragraphs 426 and 443 above).", "It has already been reiterated above that, given the veil of secrecy surrounding the CIA rendition operations, it cannot be expected that any traces of the applicant are to be found in any official flight or border control records in Lithuania or elsewhere. As in other cases concerning the CIA HVD Programme the fate of the applicant can be reconstructed only by an analysis of strings of data from various sources available in the public domain and expert evidence (see paragraph 487 above). The fact that the applicant\u2019s name does not appear in the official record with reference to his alleged secret detention in Lithuania is not therefore decisive for the Court\u2019s assessment.", "541. In that regard, the Court notes that the 2014 US Senate Committee Report contains a number of often extensive references to the applicant, in particular in relation to the EITs inflicted on him during the series of interrogations, including the use of waterboarding, in the early stages of his secret detention at Detention Site Green located in Thailand and \u201cdebriefing\u201d that he underwent at Detention Site Blue located in Poland (see paragraphs 92-96 above). Yet, as also confirmed by the experts, the report does not mention the applicant explicitly by name in connection with Detention Site Violet (see paragraphs 135, 137 and 141 above).", "542. Nonetheless, the experts, following a comprehensive analysis of the entirety of the available documentary evidence concerning the CIA\u2019s extraordinary rendition operations at the material time, were able to conclude that he had been detained at that site on the basis of a number of other elements consistently demonstrating that there is no \u2013 and there could not be any \u2013 alternative account of the applicant\u2019s fate following his February 2005 rendition from Morocco.", "The Court would reiterate that the experts started by determining, beyond reasonable doubt, that Morocco was the only place in which the applicant could have been detained in February 2005 and that, according to the rendition aircraft schedules at that time he could only have been transferred from there either to Detention Site Black in Romania or to Detention Site Violet in Lithuania. On the basis of evidence indicating his absence from Detention Site Black in the relevant period, the one and only remaining destination of the applicant\u2019s transfer from Rabat was Detention Site Violet. They further went on to infer information relevant for the applicant from unredacted passages of the report concerning other HVDs in CIA custody, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Mustafa al-Hawsawi, simultaneously being detained in the country hosting Detention Site Violet. The experts correlated this information with the data relating to the CIA detainee transfers in the period of the operation of the Lithuanian site, including the transfer from Detention Site Black to Detention Site Violet on 6 October 2005 and the transfer from Detention Site Violet, via Cairo and an aircraft switching operation, to Detention Site Brown (see paragraphs 132, 134-135, 137 and 141143 above).", "543. The Court would refer, in particular, to the following statements made by the experts.", "Mr J.G.S. stated that \u201cthrough an intimate familiarity with the chronology of [the applicant\u2019s] detention\u201d he had reached the conclusion that \u201cthere [was] only one place he could have been in the early part of 2005 and that that place was indeed Morocco\u201d. He knew that \u201cthe transfers out of Morocco in 2005 went to other active \u2018black sites\u2019 that that one of these was \u2018Detention Site Black\u2019 in Romania, but that there was also another one in a separate country ... and ... this other country was Lithuania\u201d. He added that \u201cbecause [the applicant] did not arrive in Romania, \u2018Detention Site Black\u2019\u201d \u2013 which he knew based on his \u201cyears\u2019 long investigations into the operations of that site ... the only other destination to which he could have been transferred was the active site in Lithuania and this transfer took place in accordance with the flights ... in February 2005\u201d (see paragraph 137 above).", "Mr Black testified that, based on the overall effect of the evidence, he was satisfied \u201cthat beyond reasonable doubt Abu Zubaydah was held in Lithuania starting from February 2005\u201d. He said that while prima facie it was possible that the applicant, being in Morocco in February 2005, had been moved either to Romania or to Lithuania, there was evidence indicating, first, that he was not in Romania in or prior to the Summer 2005 and, second, that he was in Lithuania in March 2005 (see paragraphs 141144 above).", "544. The experts attributed a different threshold of proof to their conclusions.", "Mr J.G.S. stated that on the \u201cbalance of probabilities\u201d, he believed it was established that the applicant had been secretly detained at Detention Site Violet (see paragraph 137). He was nevertheless satisfied as to \u201cthe presence of Mr Zubaydah, respectively in early 2005 in Morocco up to the point where the CIA detention [facility] [had been] cleared, thereafter on the territory of Lithuania in Detention Site coded as \u2018Violet\u2019 and thereafter on the territory of Afghanistan in the Detention Site coded as \u2018Brown\u2019\u201d (see paragraph 139 above). Also, he said that there was a \u201ccategorical certainty\u201d that the applicant had been brought to Lithuania on one of the February 2005 flights from Morocco to Lithuania \u2013 N724CL or N787WH \u2013 either on 17 or on 18 February 2005 and that \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt he [had been] taken to Afghanistan when he [had] left Lithuania\u201d (see paragraphs 134, 137 and 139 above).", "Mr Black categorically stated that the applicant, beyond reasonable doubt, had been held in Lithuania from February 2005 onwards and that he believed that the applicant had been \u201cflown into Lithuania on N787WH on 18 February 2005 and flown out of Lithuania on N733MA and N70EH on 25 March 2006\u201d (see paragraphs 142-143 above).", "545. The Court does not consider that this difference in terminology used by the experts has a direct and dispositive bearing on its own assessment of the evidence. It reiterates that, while in assessing evidence it applies \u201cthe standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt\u201d, that concept is independent from the approach of the national legal systems which use that standard. The Court is not called upon to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability based on \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d or \u201cbalance of probabilities\u201d standards as applied by the domestic courts but on the responsibility of the respondent State under the Convention (see paragraph 481 above, with references to the Court\u2019s case-law).", "546. Based on its free evaluation of all the material in its possession, the Court considers that there is prima facie evidence corroborating the applicant\u2019s allegation as to his secret detention in Lithuania, at Detention Site Violet, from 17 or 18 February 2005 to 25 March 2006. Consequently, the burden of proof should shift to the respondent Government.", "547. However, the Government, apart from their above contention that there is no credible evidence confirming the applicant\u2019s detention in Lithuania, in particular in any border control records, and their general denial that any CIA secret detention facility had operated in the country, have not adduced any counter-evidence capable of refuting the experts\u2019 conclusions.", "Having regard to the very nature of the CIA secret detention scheme, the Government\u2019s argument that there is no indication of the applicant\u2019s physical presence in Lithuania \u2013 which they sought to support by the fact that his name had not been found in the records of passengers on the flights in February 2005-March 2006 (see paragraphs 426-428 above) \u2013 cannot be upheld. In the Court\u2019s view, it would be unacceptable if the Government, having failed to comply with their obligation to register duly and in accordance with the domestic law all persons arriving on or departing from Lithuanian territory on the CIA planes and having relinquished any border control in respect of the rendition aircraft (see paragraphs 508 above), could take advantage of those omissions in the fact-finding procedure before the Court. When allowing the CIA to operate a detention site on Lithuanian soil the Government were, by pure virtue of Article 5 of the Convention, required to secure the information necessary to identify detainees brought to the country (see paragraphs 652-654 below, with references to the Court\u2019s case-law). The Court cannot accept that the Government\u2019s failure to do so should have adverse consequences for the applicant in its assessment of whether it has been adequately demonstrated by the Government, against the strong prima facie case made by the applicant, that his detention in Lithuania did not take place.", "548. In view of the foregoing, the Court considers the applicant\u2019s allegations sufficiently convincing. For the same reasons as stated above in regard to the date marking the opening of Detention Site Violet (see paragraph 514 above), the Court does not find it indispensable to rule on which of the two dates indicated by the applicant \u2013 17 or 18 February 2005 \u2013 and on which of the two planes \u2013 N724CL or N787WH \u2013 he was brought to Lithuania.", "Consequently, on the basis of strong, clear and concordant inferences as related above, the Court finds it proven to the required standard of proof that:", "(a) on 17 or 18 February 2005 the applicant was transferred by the CIA to from Rabat, Morocco to Lithuania on board either the rendition plane N724CL or the rendition plane N787WH;", "(b) from 17 or 18 February 2005 to 25 March 2006 the applicant was detained in the CIA detention facility in Lithuania codenamed \u201cDetention Site Violet\u201d according to the 2014 US Senate Committee Report; and", "(c) on 25 March 2006 on board the rendition plane N733MA and via a subsequent aircraft-switching operation the applicant was transferred by the CIA out of Lithuania to another CIA detention facility, identified by the experts as being codenamed \u201cDetention Site Brown\u201d according to the 2014 US Senate Committee Report.", "549. The applicant stated that, as in Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland on account of the secrecy of the HVD Programme and restrictions on his communications with the Court, he could not present specific evidence of what had happened to him in Lithuania. However, as the Court found in the above case, at an absolute minimum detainees in CIA custody, whether in Lithuania or elsewhere, would have been subjected to the applicable standard conditions of detention at the relevant time, including solitary confinement, shackling, exposure to bright light, low and loud noise on a constant basis and the standard conditions of transfer, stripping, shaving, hooding, diapering and strapping down into painful crammed positions.", "The Government have not addressed this issue.", "550. The Court observes that, in contrast to treatment inflicted on the applicant during an early period of his secret detention, which is often documented in detail in various material (see paragraphs 92-97 above), there is no evidence demonstrating any instances of similar acts at Detention Site Violet. According to the 2014 US Senate Committee Report, the applicant from his capture to his transfer to US military custody on 5 September 2006 \u201cprovided information\u201d, which resulted \u201cin 766 disseminated intelligence reports\u201d. The fact that nearly 600 such reports were produced between September 2002 and September 2006 indicates that he was continually interrogated or \u201cdebriefed\u201d by the CIA during the entire period of his secret detention (see paragraph 156 above). However, in the light of the material in the Court\u2019s possession, it does not appear that in Lithuania the applicant was subjected to the EITs in connection with interrogations (see paragraphs 48-55 above).", "As regards recourse to harsh interrogation techniques at the relevant time, the 2014 US Senate Committee Report states in general terms that in mid-2004 the CIA temporarily suspended the use of the EITs. While their use was at some point resumed and they were apparently applied throughout the most part of 2005, such techniques were again temporarily suspended in late 2005 and in 2006. However, the applicant\u2019s name is not mentioned in that context (see paragraph 86 above).", "551. According to the experts, it was not possible to pronounce categorically on specific interrogation techniques or other forms of treatment or ill-treatment practised on the applicant in Lithuania, as in 20052006 there was less information about the treatment of prisoners in the HVD Programme than there had been in the previous years. However, the CIA documents and the 2014 US Senate Committee Report described the routine conditions of detention at \u201cblack sites\u201d, which included such practices as sensory deprivation, sleep deprivation, denial or religious rights and incommunicado detention. Those conditions alone passed the threshold of treatment prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention (see paragraphs 154155 above).", "552. As regards the Court\u2019s establishment of the facts of the case, detailed rules governing conditions in which the CIA kept its prisoners leave no room for speculation as to the basic aspects of the situation in which the applicant found himself from 17 or 18 February 2005 to 25 March 2006. The Court therefore finds it established beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was kept \u2013 as any other high-value detainee \u2013 in conditions described in the DCI Confinement Guidelines, which applied from the end of January 2003 to September 2006 to all CIA detainees (see paragraphs 54-56 above; see also Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 418-419 and 510).", "While at this stage it is premature to characterise the treatment to which the applicant was subjected during his detention at Detention Site Violet for the purposes of his complaint under the substantive limb of Article 3 of the Convention, the Court would point out that that regime included at least \u201csix standard conditions of confinement\u201d. That meant blindfolding or hooding the detainees, designed to disorient them and keep from learning their location or the layout of the detention facility; removal of hair upon arrival at the site; incommunicado, solitary confinement; continuous noise of high and varying intensity played at all times; continuous light such that each cell was illuminated to about the same brightness as an office; and use of leg shackles in all aspects of detainee management and movement (see paragraphs 55-56 above).", "553. The Government firmly denied that the State authorities had received any CIA request that would even vaguely imply the running of a secret detention facility on Lithuanian territory. The prospects of receiving from the US authorities a request for assistance in the \u201cwar on terror\u201d had been considered by the SSD on a purely theoretical basis. Moreover, in the criminal investigation all the Heads of State in office at the material time had consistently testified that they had not known about any detainees transfers and had not given their consent to the transportation of any persons held by the CIA (see paragraph 445 above).", "554. However, the above contention does not seem to be supported by the CNSD Findings, which established that the SSD had received a request from the CIA \u201cto equip facilities in Lithuania suitable for holding detainees\u201d. In that connection, the CNSD referred to the testimony of the former Head of State, Mr Rolandas Paksas who had confirmed that Lithuania had been asked for permission to bring into the country persons suspected of terrorism; however, the information that he had received had not mentioned a detention centre or prison. The former Director General of the SSD, Mr Me\u010dys Laurinkus testified that in mid-2003 he had informed Mr Paksas about a possibility of receiving a \u201crequest to participate in the programme concerning the transportation of detainees\u201d after Lithuania\u2019s accession to NATO (see paragraph 174 above). In that context, the Court would refer to the 2014 US Senate Report, which states, in relation to Detention Site Violet, that at the same time, that is \u201cby mid-2003\u201d, the CIA \u201chad concluded that its completed but still unused holding cell in Country ... [had been] insufficient\u201d and had \u201csought to build a new, expanded detention facility in the country\u201d (see paragraph 147 above). The Court would also note that Lithuania\u2019s accession to NATO took place on 29 March 2004 (see paragraph 364 above).", "The CNSD further established that, \u201cwhen carrying out the SSD partnership cooperation Project No. 1 and Project No. 2, the ... heads of the SSD [had] not inform[ed] any of the country\u2019s officials of the purposes and content of the said projects\u201d. On the basis of the material in its possession, it related that although Mr Laurinkus had received a negative answer from Mr Paksas in respect of the \u201cbringing into the Republic of Lithuania of persons interrogated by the USA\u201d, he had not asked either Mr Paksas or acting Head of State, Mr Art\u016bras Paulauskas, for \u201cpolitical approval of activities under Project No. 2\u201d. Mr Laurinkus had \u201chad knowledge of launching the activities under Project No. 2\u201d in MarchApril 2004 \u2013 which, the Court would note, was around the same time as Lithuania\u2019s accession to NATO. Several SSD officers, including the Director General, Mr Arvydas Pocius, and acting Director General, Mr Dainius Daba\u0161inskas had \u201chad knowledge of Project No. 2 at the time of launching\u201d (see paragraph 174 above).", "Mr Valdas Adamkus, the former Head of State stated that \u201cno information [had been] provided to [him] about running Project No. 2 in 2004-2006\u201d. However, according to Mr Pocius, Mr Adamkus had been \u201cadequately informed\u201d of Project No. 2 (see paragraphs 174, 177-178 and 367 above).", "In the Seimas public debate on the CNSD Findings it was again confirmed that the SSD had received a request from the CIA \u201cto install premises ... suitable for keeping detainees\u201d (see paragraphs 177-178 above).", "555. Witness evidence obtained in the criminal investigation also confirms that fact. Witness A, an important political post-holder at the relevant time, testified that Mr Laurinkus had addressed Mr Paksas in connection with a \u201ctemporary possibility to hold persons suspected of terrorism\u201d and received a negative answer (see paragraph 307 above). Witness B2, an another important political post-holder, confirmed that he had been addressed \u201cas regards the transportation and holding [of] people in Lithuania\u201d and that he had not approved the idea (see paragraph 314 above).", "556. Moreover, referring to the availability of information of the establishment of the CIA clandestine detention sites, the 2014 US Senate Committee Report clearly confirms that the \u201cpolitical leaders of host countries were generally informed of their existence\u201d (see paragraph 79 above).", "The report further confirms that an approval for the CIA detention facility corresponding to Project No. 2 was received from the authorities. Although the relevant section specifying a person or authority is heavily redacted, it clearly states that \u201cthe plan to construct the expanded facility was approved by the [redacted] of the Country\u201d \u2013 which, however, required \u201ccomplex mechanisms\u201d in order to provide an unspecified amount of USD million to the country\u2019s authorities. The money was offered to \u201cshow appreciation\u201d for the support for the CIA programme. It may be inferred from the report that certain national authorities \u201cprobably [had] an incomplete notion\u201d as to the CIA facility\u2019s \u201cactual function\u201d. Also, the report refers to a certain official who, when he became aware of the facility, was described as \u201cshocked\u201d but \u201cnonetheless approved\u201d it (see paragraph 147 above).", "557. As regards the money paid by the CIA to the authorities, the Court would note that the fact that such financial rewards were, as a matter of general policy and practice, offered to the authorities of countries hosting CIA \u201cblack sites\u201d is confirmed in Conclusion 20 of the 2014 US Senate Committee Report. The conclusion states that \u201cto encourage governments to clandestinely host CIA detention sites, or to increase support for existing sites, the CIA provided millions of dollars in cash payments to foreign government officials\u201d and that \u201cthe CIA Headquarters encouraged CIA Stations to construct \u2018wish lists\u2019 of proposed financial assistance\u201d and \u201cto \u2018think big\u2019 in terms of that assistance\u201d (see paragraph 89 above).", "558. It is undisputed and has been confirmed by the CNSD Findings and in the criminal investigation that Project No. 1 and Project No. 2 were implemented in cooperation with the CIA. Nor has it been contested that in the framework of that cooperation the SSD adapted the premises of Project No. 1 according to the CIA\u2019s requests, assisted the CIA in acquiring the premises of Project No. 2 and adapting and reconstructing the premises for the CIA\u2019s needs (see paragraphs 174 and 199 above). The cooperation dated back to 2002 and started from the adaptation of Project No. 1. Later, in 2003 several officers of the SSD were assigned to assist the CIA in finding a suitable location for Project No. 2 and purchasing the land and buildings in Antaviliai. Both projects were fully financed by the CIA. Starting from the beginning of 2005 when the Project No. 2, according to Witness S, was \u201cestablished\u201d, the SSD officers ensured the security and surveillance of the premises (see paragraphs 333-338 and 341 above).", "559. In Al Nashiri v. Poland and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland the fact that the national authorities had cooperated with the CIA in disguising the rendition aircraft\u2019s actual routes and validated incomplete or false flight plans in order to cover up the CIA\u2019s activities in the country was considered relevant for the Court\u2019s assessment of the State authorities\u2019 knowledge of, and complicity in, the HVD Programme (see Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 419-422; and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 421-424). The Court will follow that approach in analysing the facts of the present case.", "560. It has already been established that in respect of three rendition flights \u2013 N787WH on 18 February 2005, N787WH on 6 October 2005 and N733MA on 25 March 2006 the CIA used the methodology of \u201cdummy\u201d flight planning \u2013 an intentional disguise of flight plans for rendition aircraft applied by the air companies contracted by the CIA (see paragraph 507 above).", "As the Court found in the judgments referred to above, the \u201cdummy\u201d flight planning, a deliberate effort to cover up the CIA flights into the country, required active cooperation on the part of the host countries through which the planes travelled. In addition to granting the CIA rendition aircraft overflight permissions, the national authorities navigated the planes through the country\u2019s airspace to undeclared destinations in contravention of international aviation regulations and issued false landing permits (ibid.).", "561. Consequently, the fact that the Lithuanian aviation authorities participated in the process demonstrated that Lithuania knowingly assisted in the CIA scheme disguising the rendition planes.", "562. The Government acknowledged that the CIA planes on two occasions had not been subject to the customs and SBGS control, in connection with the delivery of a \u201cspecial cargo\u201d for the Lithuanian services (see paragraph 429 above). To this end, the SSD addressed classified letters to the relevant authorities. The purpose was to obtain unrestricted access to the aircraft for the SSD and the CIA partners. As described by the witnesses questioned in the criminal investigation, the CIA teams were escorted to the area in the airport and drove in their vehicles to the aircraft, whereas the SSD officers escorting them remained in their vehicles at some distance. As noted above, that practice resembled the special procedure followed by the Polish authorities in respect of the CIA rendition planes landings in Szymany in December 2002-September 2003 (see paragraph 508 above, with references to Al Nashiri v. Poland and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland).", "563. The Court considers, as it did in Al Nashiri v. Poland and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, that the circumstances and conditions in which HVDs were routinely transferred by the CIA from rendition planes to the CIA \u201cblack sites\u201d in the host countries should be taken into account in the context of the State authorities\u2019 alleged knowledge and complicity in the HVD Programme (see Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 437; and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 439).", "It follows from the Court\u2019s findings in the above cases and the CIA material describing the routine procedure for transfers of detainees between the \u201cblack sites\u201d (see paragraphs 47-48 above) that for the duration of his transfer a HVD was \u201csecurely shackled\u201d by his hands and feet, deprived of sight and sound by the use of blindfolds, earmuffs and a hood and that upon arrival at his destination was moved to the \u201cblack site\u201d under the same conditions.", "564. The Court finds it inconceivable that the transportation of prisoners over land from the planes to the CIA detention site could, for all practical purposes, have been effected without at least minimal assistance by the host country\u2019s authorities, to mention only securing the area near and around the landing planes and providing conditions for a secret and safe transfer of passengers. Inevitably, the Lithuanian personnel responsible for security arrangements, in particular the reception of the flights and on-land transit, must have witnessed at least some elements of the detainees\u2019 transfer to Detention Site Violet, for instance the loading or unloading of blindfolded and shackled passengers from the planes (see also Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 330 and 437; and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 322 and 439).", "Consequently, the Court concludes that the Lithuanian authorities which received the CIA personnel in the airport could not have been unaware that the persons brought by them to Lithuania were the CIA prisoners.", "565. The Court also attaches importance to various material referring to ill-treatment and abuse of terrorist suspects captured and detained by US authorities in the \u201cwar on terror\u201d, which was available in the public domain at the relevant time (see El Masri, cited above, \u00a7 160; Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 439; Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 441; and Nasr and Ghali, cited above, \u00a7 234).", "566. Before analysing that material, the Court would refer to President Bush\u2019s memorandum of 7 February 2002, stating that neither al-Qaeda nor Taliban detainees qualified as prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions and that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, did not apply to them (see paragraph 226-231 above). The White House Press Secretary announced that decision at the press conference on the same day. It was widely commented in the US and international media. That decision, however, included a disclaimer that even detainees \u201cnot legally entitled\u201d to be treated humanely would be so treated, and also spoke of respecting the principles of the Geneva Conventions \u201cto the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity\u201d (see paragraphs 29-30 above). Consequently, already at this very early stage of the \u201cwar on terror\u201d it was well known that \u201cmilitary necessity\u201d was a parameter for determining the treatment to be received by the captured terrorist suspects.", "567. The Court would further note that from at least January 2002, when the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a statement relating to detention of Taliban and al-Qaeda prisoners in Guant\u00e1namo, strong concerns were expressed publicly as to the treatment of detainees, in particular the use of \u201cstress and duress\u201d methods of interrogations and arbitrary and incommunicado detention. From January 2002 onwards the international governmental and non-governmental organisations regularly published reports and statements disclosing ill-treatment and abuse to which captured terrorist suspects were subjected in US custody in various places, for instance in Guant\u00e1namo and the US Bagram military base in Afghanistan. The material summarised above and cited in the AI/ICJ\u2019s amicus curiae brief include only some sources selected from a large amount of documents available in the public domain throughout the above period (see paragraphs 234-250 and 465-471 above).", "Moreover, in the 2003 PACE Resolution of 26 June 2003 \u2013 of which Lithuania, one of the Council of Europe\u2019s member States, must have been aware \u2013 the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe was \u201cdeeply concerned at the conditions of detention\u201d of captured \u201cunlawful combatants\u201d held in the custody of the US authorities (see paragraph 238 above).", "568. At the material time the ill-treatment, use of harsh interrogation measures, and arbitrary detention of al-Qaeda and Taliban prisoners in US custody, as well as the existence of \u201cUS overseas centres\u201d for interrogations was also often reported in the international media from early 2002 (see paragraphs 251-255 above). Following the Washington Post report on 2 November 2005, which disclosed the complicity of the \u201cEastern European countries\u201d in the CIA HVD Programme and prompted the closure of \u201cblack sites\u201d in Europe, as well as the ABC News disclosure and the 2005 HRW Statement naming Poland and Romania as CIA accomplices, there could be no doubt as what kind of activities had been carried out by the CIA in the countries concerned (see paragraphs 248-249 and 256-257 above). At that time, Detention Site Violet in Lithuania was still active.", "The issue of the CIA renditions and abusive detention and interrogation practices used against the captured terrorist suspects in their custody was also present, reported and discussed in the Lithuanian media. In particular, between June 2004 and November 2005 the Lithuanian press published a number of articles concerning secret renditions, ill-treatment of prisoners and the abusive conditions under which detainees were held and interrogated (see paragraph 263 above).", "569. As in Al Nashiri v. Poland (cited above, \u00a7 434) and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland (cited above, \u00a7 436) the Court considers the informal transatlantic meeting of the European Union and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation foreign ministers with the then US Secretary of State, Ms Condoleezza Rice, held on 7 December 2005, to be one of the elements relevant for its assessment of the respondent State\u2019s knowledge of the CIA rendition and secret detention operations in 2003-2005.", "570. In his testimony in Al Nashiri v. Poland and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, Mr Fava stated that the meeting had been convened in connection with recent international media reports, including disclosures by the Washington Post and ABC News of, respectively, 2 November 2005 and 5 December 2005, naming European countries that had allegedly had CIA \u201cblack sites\u201d on their territories (see Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 306 and 434; and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 300 and 436). He also described the content of the \u201cdebriefing\u201d of that meeting, a document that the TDIP obtained from a credible confidential source in the offices of the European Union. He stated that it had appeared from Ms Rice\u2019s statement \u201cwe all know about these techniques\u201d made in the context of the CIA operations and interrogations of terrorist suspects, which had been recorded in the debriefing that there had been an attempt on the USA\u2019s part to share the \u201cweight of accusations\u201d (ibid., see alsp paragraph 359 above)).", "As pointed out by the applicant (see paragraph 460 above), Lithuania, an EU and NATO member must have participated in that meeting and been aware of the issues discussed. At that time, the CIA detention site in Lithuania was still active.", "571. The Court is mindful of the fact that knowledge of the CIA rendition and secret detention operations and the scale of abuse to which high-value detainees were subjected in CIA custody has evolved over time, from 2002 to the present day. A considerable part of the evidence before the Court emerged several years after the events complained of (see paragraphs 22-24, 34-56, 287-294 and 296-303 above; see also Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 440; and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 442).", "Lithuania\u2019s alleged knowledge and complicity in the HVD Programme must be assessed with reference to the elements that its authorities knew or ought to have known at or closely around the relevant time, that is to say, between 17 or 18 February 2005 and 25 March 2006. However, the Court, as it has done in respect of the establishment of the facts relating to the applicant\u2019s secret detention in Lithuania, will also rely on recent evidence which, as for instance the 2014 US Senate Committee Report and expert evidence obtained by the Court, relate, explain or disclose facts occurring in the past (see Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 440 and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 442).", "572. In its assessment, the Court has considered all the evidence in its possession and the various related circumstances referred to above. Having regard to all these elements taken as a whole, the Court finds that the Lithuania authorities knew that the CIA operated, on Lithuanian territory, a detention facility for the purposes of secretly detaining and interrogating terrorist suspects captured within the \u201cwar on terror\u201d operation by the US authorities.", "This finding is based on the material referred to extensively above, in particular the evidence deriving from the 2014 US Senate Committee Report and, to a considerable extent, the evidence from experts.", "The passages of the report relating the approval for the plan to construct the expanded detention facility given by the Detention Site Violet host country leave no doubt as to the Lithuanian high-office holders\u2019 prior acceptance of hosting a CIA detention site on their territory. Nor can there be any doubt that they provided \u201ccooperation and support\u201d for the \u201cdetention programme\u201d and that, in appreciation, were offered and accepted a financial reward, amounting to some redacted sum of USD million (see paragraphs 554-557 above).", "573. Furthermore, the experts, who in the course of their inquiries also had the benefit of contact with various sources, including confidential ones, unanimously and categorically stated that Lithuania not only ought to have known but actually did know of the nature and purposes of the CIA activities in the country.", "Senator Marty stated that since the operation had been governed by the \u201cneed-to-know\u201d secrecy principle, only those few people who had absolutely needed to know had known about it. As in other countries, there had been persons at the highest level of the Lithuanian State who had had certain knowledge of what had been going on but even those who had come to know had not necessarily known all the details. Yet somebody had allowed the CIA to move about freely and have access to premises where they had been allowed to do what they had wanted without any control whatsoever. He described the national authorities\u2019 conduct as complicity which had not been active; the national authorities had not participated in the CIA interrogations (see paragraph 382 above).", "Mr J.G.S. testified that the authorities of Lithuania had known about the existence of the detention facility and that through the highest levels of their government had approved and authorised its presence on their territory. In his view, they certainly should have known the purpose which the facility had served because its nature and purpose was part of a systematic practice, which had already been implemented by the CIA across multiple other countries and had been widely reported by the time the site in Lithuania had become active. There had been different degrees of knowledge in different sectors of Lithuania\u2019s authorities. At the operational level the details had been known to a very small number of trusted counterparts, primarily within the secret services. He added that he was not aware of any single instance of a CIA detention site having existed anywhere in the world without the express knowledge and authorisation of the host authorities (see paragraph 387 above).", "Mr Black stated that it had been clear from the 2014 US Senate Committee Report that the Lithuanian officials had been aware of the CIA programme operating on their territory. He added that, as he could say from his accumulated knowledge of the CIA HVD Programme and close reading of the 2014 US Senate Committee Report, some host country officials had always known that there had been prisoners held in the facilities. That did not imply that every single host country official had known but in Lithuania\u2019s case it was evident that at least some had known that the prisoners had been held on their territory and they had known that they had been receiving money to facilitate this (see paragraphs 392-393 above).", "574. The Court, as in previous similar cases, does not consider that the Lithuanian authorities necessarily knew the details of what exactly went on inside the CIA secret facility or witnessed treatment or interrogations to which the CIA prisoners were subjected in Lithuania. As in other countries hosting clandestine prisons, the operation of the site was entirely in the hands of the CIA and the interrogations were exclusively the CIA\u2019s responsibility (see paragraph 272 above; see also Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 441; and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 443).", "575. However, in the Court\u2019s view, even if the Lithuanian authorities did not have, or could not have had, complete knowledge of the HVD Programme, the facts available to them through their contacts and cooperation with their CIA partners, taken together with extensive and widely available information on torture, ill-treatment, abuse and harsh interrogation measures inflicted on terrorist-suspects in US custody which in 2002-2005 circulated in the public domain, including the Lithuanian press (see paragraphs 565-568 above), enabled them to conjure up a reasonably accurate image of the CIA\u2019s activities and, more particularly, the treatment to which the CIA was likely to have subjected their prisoners in Lithuania.", "In that regard the Court would reiterate that in Al Nashiri v. Poland and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland it has found that already in 2002-2003 the public sources reported practices resorted to, or tolerated by, the US authorities that were manifestly contrary to the principles of the Convention. All the more so did the authorities, in 2005-2006, have good reason to believe that a person detained under the CIA rendition and secret detention programme could be exposed to a serious risk of treatment contrary to those principles on their territory.", "It further observes that it is \u2013 as was the case in respect of Poland \u2013 inconceivable that the rendition aircraft could have crossed the country\u2019s airspace, landed atand departed from its airports, or that the CIA could have occupied the premises offered by the national authorities and transported detainees there, without the State authorities being informed of or involved in the preparation and execution of the HVD Programme on their territory. Nor can it stand to reason that activities of such character and scale, possibly vital for the country\u2019s military and political interests, could have been undertaken on Lithuanian territory without the Lithuanian authorities\u2019 knowledge and without the necessary authorisation and assistance being given at the appropriate level of the State (see Al Nashiri v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 441-442 and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 443-444).", "576. The Court accordingly finds it established beyond reasonable doubt that:", "(a) the Lithuanian authorities knew of the nature and purposes of the CIA\u2019s activities on its territory at the material time;", "(b) the Lithuanian authorities, by approving the hosting of the CIA Detention Site Violet, enabling the CIA to use its airspace and airports and to disguise the movements of rendition aircraft, providing logistics and services, securing the premises for the CIA and transportation of the CIA teams with detainees on land, cooperated in the preparation and execution of the CIA rendition, secret detention and interrogation operations on its territory; and", "(c) given their knowledge of the nature and purposes of the CIA\u2019s activities on their territory and their involvement in the execution of that programme, the Lithuanian authorities knew that, by enabling the CIA to detain terrorist suspects \u2013 including the applicant \u2013 on their territory, they were exposing them to a serious risk of treatment contrary to the Convention."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3", "5", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
