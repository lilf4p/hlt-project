The applicant, Mr Mikhail Novruk, is a Moldovan national who was born in 1972. He is represented before the Court by Ms I. Khrunova, a lawyer practising in Kazan.", "7. In 2000, Mr Novruk and Ms O., a Russian national, started living together as a couple in Moldova. In 2001, a boy was born to their union; he acquired Russian nationality by birth. Two years later O. and their son moved to the Primorskiy region of Russia, where most of her family lived. In 2005 Mr Novruk joined them in Russia, and in the same year they married. They divorced in 2008.", "8. In 2009, Mr Novruk met Ms S., a Russian national. In March 2010, he travelled to Moldova to renew his passport, where he discovered that he was HIV-positive. Three weeks later Mr Novruk returned to Vladivostok and on 24 April 2010 he and S. married. S. has a daughter from her previous marriage and she is also a foster parent to nine orphaned children, some of whom are HIV-positive.", "9. In June 2010 Mr Novruk applied to the Primorskiy Region Federal Migration Service for a temporary residence permit. By a letter of 8 July 2010 he was informed that his application was refused by reference to section 7 \u00a7 1 (13) of the Foreign Nationals Act, which restricted the issue of residence permits to foreign nationals who could show that they were HIVnegative.", "10. On 4 October 2010 the Sovetskiy District Court of Vladivostok, dismissed a challenge by the applicant to that decision, finding in particular that the Federal Migration Service had been required by law to reject his application for a residence permit. On 16 November 2010 the Primorskiy Regional Court upheld that judgment on appeal.", "11. The applicant Ms Anna Viktorovna Kravchenko is a Ukrainian national who was born in 1982. She is represented before the Court by Ms N. Yermolayeva, a lawyer practising in Moscow.", "12. In 2003, Ms Kravchenko married Mr D., a Russian national. They started living in Moscow. During her pregnancy she was diagnosed as HIVpositive. On 4 April 2003 her son F. was born. He acquired Russian nationality by birth.", "13. In 2009, Ms Kravchenko applied for a temporary residence permit. By a letter of 25 May 2009 the Federal Migration Service refused her application by reference to section 7 \u00a7 1 (13) of the Foreign Nationals Act and ordered her to leave Russia within fifteen days or face deportation. Ms Kravchenko challenged the refusal with the courts.", "14. On 23 September 2009 the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court, Moscow, found for Ms Kravchenko, noting in particular that the Migration Service had decided on her application without taking into account that her minor child and husband were both Russian nationals. It directed the Migration Service to reconsider the application.", "15. Further to the District Court\u2019s decision, Ms Kravchenko lodged a new application for a residence permit. On 15 January 2010 the Migration Service rejected it, referring to the same provision of the Foreign Nationals Act.", "16. Ms Kravchenko applied again for a judicial review. By a judgment of 3 September 2010, the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow granted a stay of enforcement of the Migration Service decision and ordered it to reconsider the matter in the light of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 12 May 2006 and the Convention principles. Ms Kravchenko appealed; she submitted that the District Court should have ruled that the Migration Service refusal had been unlawful.", "17. On 8 February 2011 the Moscow City Court dismissed Ms Kravchenko\u2019s appeal against the District Court\u2019s judgment, finding that \u201cthere were no grounds to vary the judgment, because the Moscow division of the Federal Migration Service had actually complied with it\u201d.", "18. The applicant, Mr Roman Khalupa, is a Moldovan national who was born in 1974. He was granted legal aid and is represented before the Court by Mr D. Bartenev, a lawyer practising in St Petersburg.", "19. In 2005, Mr Khalupa married Ms E., a Russian national. Their children, a girl A. and a boy B., were born in 2005 and 2008 respectively. The family were living in St Petersburg.", "20. In early 2008 Mr Khalupa took a blood test with a view to obtaining a health certificate to support his application for a temporary residence permit. He was found to be HIV-positive. The hospital reported the results of his test to the St Petersburg division of the Federal Migration Service, which issued a decision of 4 June 2008 on the undesirability of Mr Khalupa\u2019s stay in Russia because he would pose a \u201creal threat to public health\u201d. On 17 June 2008 the director of the Federal Migration Service ratified that decision.", "21. On 1 August 2008 the decision was notified to Mr Khalupa; he left Russia three days later, in compliance with the law. He took up residence in Dubossary in the \u201cMoldavian Republic of Transdniestria\u201d.", "22. On the day following the pronouncement of the Kiyutin v. Russia judgment (no. 2700/10, ECHR 2011), Ms E., acting on Mr Khalupa\u2019s behalf, applied to the St Petersburg division of the Federal Migration Service, asking it to set aside the decision by which his presence in Russia had been pronounced undesirable. She submitted medical documents showing that Mr Khalupa posed no danger to public health because he was receiving appropriate treatment. Her request was forwarded to the legal department of the Federal Migration Service for review. In a letter of 5 May 2011 addressed to the deputy director of the visas and registration department of the Federal Migration Service, the director of the legal department acknowledged that the decision of 4 June 2008 had not taken fully into account Mr Khalupa\u2019s family ties in Russia. Nevertheless, on 12 September 2011 the deputy director of the St Petersburg division of the Federal Migration Service informed Mr Khalupa and Ms E. that their applications for review of the decision of 4 June 2008 had been refused. His letter did not specify the grounds for refusing the request.", "23. Mr Khalupa complained to court. On 30 January 2012 the Basmannyy District Court of Moscow dismissed his complaint, finding firstly that his rights and freedoms had not been interfered with, and secondly that the director of the Federal Migration Service was not empowered to review or set aside a decision by which an individual\u2019s presence in Russia had been declared undesirable. That judgment was upheld on appeal on 16 May 2012 by the Moscow City Court. On 12 December 2012 the Presidium of the City Court rejected Mr Khalupa\u2019s cassation appeal.", "24. Mr Khalupa also challenged the compatibility of section 25.10 of the Entry and Exit Procedures Act with the Constitution, in that it allowed an executive agency to pronounce his presence undesirable solely because of his HIV-positive status. By decision no. 902-O of 4 June 2013, the Constitutional Court declared his challenge inadmissible, finding that the impugned section was needed for the protection of public health from infectious diseases, including HIV. The Constitutional Court reiterated that its decision of 12 May 2006 (cited in paragraph 60 below) remained valid and applicable, and that the decision pronouncing someone\u2019s presence undesirable must take full account of humanitarian considerations and the factual circumstances of each case, including the family links and state of health of the individual concerned.", "25. On 14 January 2014 Mr Khalupa\u2019s representative asked the Consumer Protection Authority to review the undesirability decision and to allow him to visit his children in Russia. By a letter of 13 February 2014 the deputy head of the CPA replied that it did not have the authority to reverse a decision issued by the Federal Migration Service.", "26. The applicant, Ms Irina Grigoryevna Ostrovskaya, was born in 1953 in the Kurgan Region of the Russian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic of the USSR. She is represented before the Court by Ms O. Leonova, a lawyer practising in Samara.", "27. In 1966 her parents took Ms Ostrovskaya and her sister to live in the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic of the USSR. In 1972 Ms Ostrovskaya got married and gave birth to a boy. Two years later her sister also married and moved back to Russia. Following the collapse of the USSR, Ms Ostrovskaya acquired Uzbek nationality.", "28. After the death of her parents and husband and her son\u2019s move to Russia in 2006, Ms Ostrovskaya remained in Uzbekistan alone. In September 2011 she decided to move to Russia to share the flat occupied by her son\u2019s and her sister\u2019s families. Ms Ostrovksaya\u2019s sister and her husband are Russian nationals; her son and his family are Uzbek nationals with valid Russian residence permits.", "29. In November 2011 Ms Ostrovskaya applied for a temporary residence permit. During a medical examination she tested HIV-positive.", "30. By decision of 17 January 2012, the Samara division of the Federal Migration Service refused her application for residence permit by reference to section 7 \u00a7 1 (13) of the Foreign Nationals Act, and informed her accordingly. On 27 March 2012 a further notification to the same effect was sent by the Federal Migration Service.", "31. By a letter of 9 June 2012 the Samara division of the Consumer Protection Authority notified Ms Ostrovskaya that she should leave Russia by 30 June 2012 or face deportation. The letter indicated that on 30 May 2012 the director of the Federal Consumer Protection Authority determined that her presence on Russian territory was undesirable by virtue of section 25.10 of the Entry and Exit Procedures Act.", "32. On 26 June 2012 Ms Ostrovskaya complained to court, relying on humanitarian grounds in her claim that she should be allowed to stay in Russia. By a judgment of 23 July 2012, upheld on appeal on 17 September 2012, the Samara District and Regional Courts held that the decision to refuse her a residence permit had been lawfully given by the Migration Service within its jurisdiction and in compliance with the Foreign Nationals Act and its internal regulations. The District Court declared that it would not take any humanitarian considerations into account because Ms Ostrovskaya had missed the three-month time-limit for submitting her claim, and she had a receipt of notification as early as 16 February 2012. The undesirability decision had been issued by the Federal Consumer Protection Authority rather than by its Samara division; since Ms Ostrovskaya had designated the latter, but not the former, as the defendant in her claim, the courts refused to review what they described as an \u201cactually non-existent decision\u201d.", "33. On 6 November 2012 the Regional Court refused her leave to appeal to a cassation instance.", "34. The applicant, Mr V.V., is a national of Kazakhstan who was born in 1983 and lives in Yekaterinburg. The Court granted the applicant\u2019s request for his identity not to be disclosed to the public (Rule 47 \u00a7 4).", "35. V.V. came to Russia in 2006 to study at a medical college. Since 23 November 2007 he has been living with his partner Mr X, who also represented him in the present proceedings before the Court. They have maintained a common household, shared expenses and travelled together. They have met each other\u2019s parents. V.V. submitted copies of travel documents and family photographs.", "36. On 11 March 2012 V.V. applied to the Sverdlovsk division of the Federal Migration Service for a temporary residence permit. He committed himself to producing an HIV certificate within thirty days. On 16 April 2012 the Sverdlovsk Regional Centre for Aids Prevention and Treatment certified him to be HIV-positive.", "37. On 28 April 2012 the Federal Migration Service refused his application for a residence permit by reference to section 7 \u00a7 1 (13) of the Foreign Nationals Act. V.V. challenged the refusal before a court.", "38. On 26 July 2012 the Verkh-Isetskiy District Court of Yekaterinburg upheld the refusal, finding in particular that V.V.\u2019s HIV status amounted to an \u201cactual threat to the health of the Russian population\u201d and that V.V.\u2019s living with a same-sex partner was not equivalent to having a family.", "39. On 21 November 2012 the Sverdlovsk Regional Court heard an appeal by V.V. against the District Court\u2019s decision and, referring in particular to the Kiyutin judgment, held that V.V.\u2019s HIV-positive status could not on its own be a ground for a restriction on his rights. Since the Migration Service did not cite any other grounds in its decision, the Regional Court enjoined it to carry out a new assessment of the application for a residence permit. The judgment became final and enforceable.", "40. In the meantime, on 24 April 2012 the Sverdlovsk division of the Consumer Protection Authority forwarded a copy of V.V.\u2019s diagnosis to the Federal Consumer Protection Authority, with a view to pronouncing his presence in Russia undesirable. On 16 November 2012 the federal authority asked the regional division to re-administer the HIV test. On 25 December 2012 V.V. again tested positive for HIV.", "41. On 15 March 2013 the Federal Consumer Protection Authority pronounced V.V.\u2019s presence in Russia undesirable in accordance with section 25.10 of the Entry and Exit Procedures Act. The decision stated that V.V. had been infected with HIV and had avoided treatment. It cited in evidence medical certificates dated 16 April and 25 December 2012. V.V.\u2019s representative challenged the decision before a court.", "42. On 26 April 2013 V.V. travelled from Russia to Kazakhstan. On his way back two days later, he was refused entry into Russia by reference to that decision.", "43. On 30 May 2013 the Verkh-Isetskiy District Court allowed the challenge, finding that the undesirability decision had been unlawful because it did not refer to any grounds other than V.V.\u2019s HIV-positive status. It also granted a stay of enforcement of that decision, enabling V.V. to return to Russia, which he did.", "44. However, on 13 August 2013 the Sverdlovsk Regional Court reversed the District Court\u2019s decision and dismissed the claim. It held that the ban against V.V. had been put in place not only because he was infected with HIV but also because he had refused to give contact details of his former partners during an \u201cepidemiological investigation of the HIV infection\u201d, that is when filling out a questionnaire at the hospital. The Regional Court also examined V.V.\u2019s personal circumstances and found that he was single, that his next of kin lived in Kazakhstan, that he did not have a family relationship with any Russian nationals, that he lived in a student hostel rather than in a rented flat, and that he had no resources to pay for HIV treatment.", "45. On 19 February 2014 the Sverdlovsk Regional Court refused leave to appeal to the cassation instance. It found in particular:", "\u201cThe facts which, in the claimant\u2019s view, are of legal significance but which the appeal court failed to take into account, including ... his voluntary compliance with the obligation to inform his former partners about a possible HIV infection, his being in a steady sexual relationship ... cannot be established on the basis of the claimant\u2019s and his representative\u2019s statements alone.", "The court did not see any evidence of any social links the claimant has in the Russian Federation. The claimant and his representative merely confirmed that they have a sexual relationship, which does not equate to social links.", "A threat to public health ... could result from the fact that the claimant has a registered place of residence and actually lives in a hostel, which is a public place; this fact alone put the health of the other residents of the dormitory at risk because the claimant may use the same public facilities ...\u201d", "46. On 1 April 2014 a judge of the Supreme Court refused him leave to appeal to the Supreme Court.", "47. After notice of the case had been given to the Government, on 7 July 2014 V.V. informed the Court that the Government Representative\u2019s office had forwarded the case materials to the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office with a request to inquire whether or not V.V. was lawfully present in Russia, whether or not he was continuing his studies, and whether his representative before the Court Mr X could have been his partner. The request contained full personal details of V.V. The Prosecutor General sent the request to the local prosecutor\u2019s office in Yekaterinburg. As it happened, Mr X was a former employee in that prosecutor\u2019s office. A prosecutor summonsed Mr X for an interview and put questions about the nature of his relationship with V.V., whether V.V. was still present in Russia, and where they lived. Law-enforcement officers also visited their neighbours and asked them how long V.V. and Mr X had lived together and whether they had girlfriends.", "48. The Government submitted a copy of a statement from a prosecutor in charge of human rights and federal law compliance, dated 6 August 2014, from which it appears that on 1 June 2014 Mr X had been asked to attend the Sverdlovsk regional prosecutor\u2019s office in his capacity as V.V.\u2019s representative. He was interviewed about \u201cthe exercise by V.V. of his labour, family and migration rights\u201d. The interview was conducted \u201ctactfully\u201d (\u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0435), and no pressure was put on him. The police and migration authorities had established that no one lived at the address which V.V. had listed as his registered place of residence. The Government also produced a copy of the statement signed by Mr X on 1 June 2014. Mr X clarified that V. had been living in a stable same-sex relationship since 2007. He refused to name V.\u2019s partner or to say whether he was V.\u2019s partner: in his capacity as V.\u2019s representative he was not required to disclose any information about his own private life. He also briefly described V.\u2019s education, employment and migration status."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["34"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
