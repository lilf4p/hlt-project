On 5 July 2001 the Adana Police Station received a complaint that damaged CDs were being sold from a street stand. A number of police officers went to the venue and talked the applicant and M.Y. into a solution with the complainant, but they did not arrest them because their activity had not constituted an offence.", "8. On 7 July 2001 the applicant and M.Y. lodged a criminal complaint with the Adana prosecutor against a police officer who they alleged had ill-treated them on 5 July 2001. At the time of their complaint they did not know the identity of the police officer but gave a description of his physical appearance.

On 9 July 2001 the applicant went back to the Adana prosecutor\u2019s office and complained that he had been injured as a result of the ill-treatment. In order to provide evidence of his injuries the applicant requested a medical examination.

On 10 July 2001 the applicant also applied to the Adana branch of the Turkish Human Rights Foundation, where a number of physical and psychological assessments were carried out by the doctors working for the Foundation. According to a report drawn up on 22 October 2001, the applicant had a perforation in his left eardrum and he was suffering from acute post-traumatic stress disorder. The report concluded that the doctors\u2019 findings were compatible with the applicant\u2019s story of ill-treatment.", "12. In the Turkish Human Rights Foundation\u2019s report the applicant was reported as having described the incident and told the doctors that after he was punched on his ear, his eardrum had been perforated and he was no longer able to hear on that side. He added that, at the end of his arrest, he had not been taken to a forensic doctor for the required medical check, but the police officers had taken him to a private doctor, where he was diagnosed with ear perforation.

He said that he did not know the name of the officer, but he could identify him. M.Y. affirmed the same in his statement.

On 2 August 2001, a chief police commissioner who had been entrusted with the duty of investigating the applicant\u2019s allegations, questioned the applicant, his relative M.Y., the suspect and two other police officers as witnesses. That administrative investigation was conducted because the domestic law applicable at the time required prosecutors to seek permission from the administrative authorities before they could prosecute a police officer (see paragraph 58 below). A police officer, V.A., who worked at the Adana police station, testified as a witness. He stated that the applicant had neither been arrested nor ill-treated on 5 July 2001.", "17.

As a result, until June 2004 the criminal court was unable to summon him to take part in the proceedings.", "23. On 18 March 2003 and 29 September 2003 the witnesses proposed by the applicant testified before the criminal court. The first witness stated that he had helped the applicant at his CD stand occasionally, and that he had seen him on the day of the incident. The applicant had told him that he had been ill-treated by the police because he had refused to provide them with free CDs. The other witness testified that he had taken the applicant to the hospital, and during that time the applicant had told him that he had been beaten in the police station.", "24.

The criminal court also asked him to identify the suspect from his photograph. M.Y. stated that he needed to see the suspect in person in order to be able to identify him because he considered that he would not be able to do so from the photographs.", "27. On 5 January 2006 the criminal court was informed that the suspect could not appear before the court because he was in Kosovo. The suspect could not be brought before the court until December 2006.", "28.
