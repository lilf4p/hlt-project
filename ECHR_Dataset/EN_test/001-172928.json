On 29 August 2009 he was interviewed about his identity, nationality and travel itinerary (eerste gehoor). It emerged that he had lodged a previous asylum request in Malta.", "5. A Dublin Claim interview (gehoor Dublinclaim) was held on 31 August 2009 in which the applicant described the conditions in which he had been detained in Malta. Asylum-seekers lived in tents, the camp was overcrowded and sanitary facilities were filthy. He objected to being sent back to Malta as he did not wish to face the same conditions of detention again.", "6. On 29 September 2009 the Deputy Minister of Justice (Staatssecretaris van Justitie) rejected the applicant\u2019s asylum request on the ground, in so far as relevant to the case before the Court, that under Article 16 of Council Regulation (EC) No 343/2003 of 18 February 2003 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national (\u201cthe Dublin Regulation\u201d) the State responsible for examining his application for asylum was Malta and Malta had agreed to take him back.", "7.
