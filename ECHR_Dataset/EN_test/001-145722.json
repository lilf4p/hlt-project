TURKEY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3;Guido Raimondi;Helen Keller;Jon Fridrik Kj\u00f8lbro;Paul Lemmens;Robert Spano", "TEXT": ["1. The applicants, whose names and places of residence are set out in the appendix, are Turkish nationals. They are represented before the Court by Ms Deniz Karakurt, a lawyer practising in Izmir.", "2. summarised as follows.", "3. The applicants were the mayors of 190 municipalities at the time of lodging their application with the Court.", "4. On 6 March 2008 the Parliament of Turkey adopted Law no. 5747 \u201con establishing districts within the boundaries of metropolitan municipalities and amending various laws\u201d, which was published in the Official Gazette of 22 March 2008 and entered into force on that date. Law no. 5747 stipulated, inter alia, that the legal personality of a number of municipalities, including those headed by the applicants, would be abolished and that either those administrative units would become villages/neighbourhoods and join other municipalities, or a certain number of them would together constitute new municipalities. Law no. 5747 further stipulated that the legal personality of those municipalities, as well as their authority and rights, would continue to exist until the next general local elections were held.", "5. On 9 April 2008 three members of parliament from the CHP, the main opposition party, Mr H.S. Okay, Mr K. Anadol and Mr K. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, the party leader, made an application to the Constitutional Court of Turkey. The MPs requested the Constitutional Court to repeal certain provisions of Law no. 5747, including those applicable to the applicants\u2019 municipalities. The MPs claimed, inter alia, that there was no public interest in abolishing the legal personality of certain municipalities and that Law no. 5747 had been adopted so that the governing party, the AKP, could win the local elections in the areas in issue. They further submitted that a referendum should have been held in the municipalities in question, in accordance with the Law on Municipalities (Law no. 5393), and that Law no. 5747 was in contravention of the provisions of the Law on Elections in Local Administrations (Law no. 2972) and the Constitution. On this last point, the MPs submitted that, according to Article 67 of the Constitution, a legislative amendment concerning elections would not be applicable to elections held within one year of the entry into force of those amendments and that the local election process of 2009 would start on 1 January 2009, in line with the provisions of Law no. 2972. They therefore considered that Law no. 5747 should not be applied to the local elections of 29 March 2009.", "6. On 31 October 2008 the Constitutional Court rendered its decision in the case (case no. 2008/34, decision no. 2008/153) and dismissed the case in so far as it concerned the municipalities headed by the applicants. The court noted at the outset that the MPs had not requested the repeal of the provision which concerned the entry into force of Law no. 5747, and that therefore their submissions regarding the compatibility of Law no. 5747 with Article 67 of the Constitution could not be examined.", "7. As regards the submission that a referendum should have been held in accordance with Law no. 5393 and that the provisions of Law no. 5747 were incompatible with Law no. 2972, the Constitutional Court held that a legal norm could be reviewed only in the light of the relevant constitutional norm and not in relation to another legal norm. It further held that the legislature had the authority to make, amend and repeal laws and the responsibility to maintain harmonisation between laws. The Constitutional Court concluded that it could therefore not review the compatibility of the provisions of Law no. 5747 with those contained in Law no. 5393 and Law no. 2972.", "8. Lastly, as to the allegations that the provisions of Law no. 5747 lacked public interest and that this law had been passed for political reasons, the Constitutional Court noted at the outset that it had the authority to examine whether certain legislation had been passed with the purpose of serving the public interest. The court further noted that the question of whether a legal norm was compatible with the needs of the country was political in nature and that the legislature was permitted a degree of discretion on that point. The court considered that it could not assess the existence of a public interest on the basis of the political choice of the legislature alone. The Constitutional Court further noted that in accordance with the Constitution, the administrative units were to be determined, through laws, by the legislature and taking into account their geographical features, economic circumstances and need for public services. The court observed that the petition lodged by the MPs for the repeal of certain provisions of Law no. 5747 did not contain any concrete argument as to how those provisions did not serve the public interest but were the result of the political considerations of the governing party. The Constitutional Court also observed that the aim of the changes brought about by Law no. 5747 was the efficient functioning of the public services provided by the local administrations and the efficient and productive use of public resources by the central administration. The Constitutional Court held that there was no evidence demonstrating that the amendments had been made with the aim of acquiring political or personal gain. The court lastly noted that since, in accordance with Law no. 5747, the legal personality of the municipalities in question, as well as their authority and rights, would continue to exist until the first general local elections were held, the legislature had respected the will of the electorate regarding the last five-year election period in the areas concerned.", "9. On 29 March 2009 the local elections were held and as a result the legal personality of the municipalities headed by the applicants ceased to exist on that day.", "10.
