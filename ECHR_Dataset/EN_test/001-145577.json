De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["7. Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu, a man of Roma ethnicity, was born on 15 September 1985. His father was unknown, and his mother, Florica C\u00e2mpeanu, who died in 2001, abandoned him at birth. Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was therefore placed in an orphanage, the Corlate Centre, where he grew up.", "In 1990 Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was diagnosed as HIV-positive. He was later diagnosed with \u201cprofound intellectual disability, an IQ of 30 and HIV\u201d and was accordingly classified as belonging to the \u201csevere\u201d disability group. In time, he also developed associated symptoms such as pulmonary tuberculosis, pneumonia and chronic hepatitis.", "In March 1992 he was transferred to the Craiova Centre for Disabled Children and at a later date to the Craiova no. 7 Placement Centre (\u201cthe Placement Centre\u201d).", "8. On 30 September 2003 the Dolj County Child Protection Panel (\u201cthe Panel\u201d) ordered that Mr C\u00e2mpeanu should no longer be cared for by the State. The decision was justified on the grounds that Mr C\u00e2mpeanu had recently turned eighteen and was not enrolled in any form of education at the time.", "Although the social worker dealing with Mr C\u00e2mpeanu had recommended transferring him to the local Neuropsychological Recovery and Rehabilitation Centre, the Panel ordered that a competent social worker should take all measures necessary for Mr C\u00e2mpeanu to be transferred to the Poiana Mare Neuropsychiatric Hospital (\u201cthe PMH\u201d). According to the relevant law, the decision could be challenged before the Craiova District Court.", "Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was not present in person and was not represented at the hearing held by the Panel.", "9. On 14 October 2003 Mr C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s health was reassessed by the Dolj County Council Disabled Adults Medical Examination Panel. The assessment resulted solely in a finding of HIV infection, corresponding to the \u201caverage\u201d disability group. It was also mentioned that the patient was \u201csocially integrated\u201d.", "10. Subsequently, on an unspecified date in October or November 2003, a medical and welfare assessment of Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was carried out by a social worker and a doctor from the Placement Centre as a prerequisite for his admission to a medical and social care centre. Under the heading \u201cLegal representative\u201d they indicated \u201cabandoned at birth\u201d, while the space next to \u201cPerson to contact in case of emergency\u201d was left blank. The diagnosis indicated was \u201csevere intellectual disability, HIV-positive\u201d, without any reference to the previous diagnosis (see paragraph 9 above). The following information was included in the assessment report: \u201crequires supervision and intermittent assistance with personal care\u201d, and the report concluded that Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was able to take care of himself, but at the same time required considerable support.", "11. By a letter dated 16 October 2003, the PMH informed the Panel that it could not admit Mr C\u00e2mpeanu, who had been diagnosed with HIV and mental disability, as the hospital lacked the facilities necessary to treat individuals with such a diagnosis.", "12. Following this refusal, between October 2003 and January 2004 the Panel and the County Department for the Protection of the Rights of the Child (\u201cthe Child Protection Department\u201d) contacted a series of institutions, asking for assistance in identifying a social care or psychiatric establishment willing to admit Mr C\u00e2mpeanu. While stating that the PMH had refused to admit the patient because he had HIV, the Child Protection Department asked for the cooperation of the institutions concerned, mentioning that Mr C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s condition \u201cdid not necessitate hospitalisation, but rather continuous supervision in a specialist institution\u201d.", "13. The Panel eventually identified the Cetate-Dolj Medical and Social Care Centre (\u201cthe CMSC\u201d) as an appropriate establishment where Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu could be placed. In its request to the CMSC, the Panel mentioned only that Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was HIV-positive, corresponding to the average disability group, without referring to his learning difficulties.", "14. On 5 February 2004 Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was admitted to the CMSC. According to a report issued by the CMSC and sent to the CLR on 5 March 2004 detailing his condition upon admission, Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was in an advanced state of \u201cpsychiatric and physical degradation\u201d, was dressed in a tattered tracksuit, with no underwear or shoes, and did not have any antiretroviral medication or information concerning his medical condition. It was noted that the patient \u201crefused to cooperate\u201d.", "In her statement to the prosecutor on 22 July 2004 in the context of the domestic proceedings (described in section B below), M.V., the doctor who had treated Mr C\u00e2mpeanu at the Placement Centre, justified the failure to provide appropriate medication or information on the basis that she did not know whether, depending on the results of the most recent investigation (see paragraph 9 above), it would be necessary to modify his treatment.", "A medical examination carried out upon Mr C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s admission to the CMSC concluded that he suffered from \u201csevere intellectual disability, HIV infection and malnutrition\u201d. At that time, he was 168 centimetres tall and weighed 45 kilograms. It was mentioned that \u201che could not orient himself in time and space and he could not eat or care for his personal hygiene by himself\u201d.", "15. During the evening of 6 February 2004 Mr C\u00e2mpeanu became agitated. According to the above-mentioned report by the CMSC (see paragraph 14 above), on the morning of 7 February 2004 he \u201cbecame violent, assaulted other patients, broke a window and tore up a mattress and his clothes and sheets\u201d. He was given phenobarbital and then diazepam to calm him down.", "16. On 9 February 2004 Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was taken to the PMH for examination, diagnosis and treatment, as it was the nearest psychiatric establishment. He was again diagnosed with \u201csevere intellectual disability\u201d. However, his condition was described as \u201cnot a psychiatric emergency\u201d, as \u201che was not agitated\u201d. Dr L.G. diagnosed him with \u201cmedium intellectual disability\u201d and prescribed sedative medicines (carbamazepine and diazepam).", "According to the medical records kept at the PMH, no information regarding Mr C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s medical history could be obtained upon his admission to the hospital, as he \u201cwould not cooperate\u201d. In the statement she gave to the investigative authorities on 8 December 2005, Dr D.M. from the PMH stated that \u201cthe patient was different in that it was not possible to communicate with him and he had mental disabilities\u201d.", "17. Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was returned to the CMSC on the same day, by which time his health had worsened considerably. At that time, the CMSC had received a supply of antiretroviral medication and thus his treatment was resumed. Despite these measures, his condition did not improve, and his medical records noted that he continued to be \u201cagitated\u201d and \u201cviolent\u201d.", "18. The CMSC decided that because it lacked the facilities needed to treat Mr C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s condition, it was impossible to keep him there any longer. The hospital sent a request to the Placement Centre asking it to refer him to a different establishment. However, the Placement Centre refused the request on the ground that he was already \u201coutside its jurisdiction\u201d.", "19. On 11 February 2004 E.O., the Director of the CMSC, allegedly called the Dolj County Public Health Department and asked it to come up with a solution that would allow Mr C\u00e2mpeanu to be transferred to a facility which was more suitable for the treatment of his health problems. It appears that she was advised to transfer him to the PMH for a period of four to five days for psychiatric treatment.", "20. On 13 February 2004 Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was transferred from the CMSC to the PMH, on the understanding that his stay at the PMH would last for three or four days with the purpose of attempting to provide treatment for his hyperaggressive behaviour. He was placed in Psychiatric Department V.", "21. On 15 February 2004 Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was placed under the care of Dr L.G. Given the fact that Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was HIV-positive, the doctor decided to transfer him to Psychiatric Department VI. She continued to be in charge of his psychiatric treatment, as that department had only two general, non-specialist doctors and no psychiatrists on its staff.", "22. On 19 February 2004 Mr C\u00e2mpeanu stopped eating and refused to take his medication. He was therefore prescribed an intravenous treatment which included glucose and vitamins. Upon examination by the doctor, he was found to be \u201cgenerally unwell\u201d.", "23. On 20 February 2004 a team of monitors from the CLR visited the PMH and noticed Mr C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s condition. According to the information included in a report by CLR staff on that visit, Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was alone in an isolated, unheated and locked room, which contained only a bed without any bedding. He was dressed only in a pyjama top. At the time he could not eat or use the toilet without assistance. However, the staff at the PMH refused to help him, allegedly for fear that they would contract HIV. Consequently, the only nutrition provided to Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was glucose, through a drip. The report concluded that the hospital had failed to provide him with the most basic treatment and care services.", "The CLR representatives stated that they had asked for him to be transferred immediately to the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Craiova, where he could receive appropriate treatment. However, the hospital manager had decided against that request, believing that the patient was not an \u201cemergency case, but a social case\u201d, and that in any event he would not be able to withstand the trip.", "24. Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu died on the evening of 20 February 2004. According to his death certificate, issued on 23 February 2004, the immediate cause of death was cardiorespiratory insufficiency. The certificate also noted that his HIV infection was the \u201coriginal morbid condition\u201d and designated \u201cintellectual disability\u201d as \u201canother important morbid condition\u201d.", "25. In spite of the legal provisions that made it compulsory to carry out an autopsy when a death occurred in a psychiatric hospital (Joint Order no. 1134/255/2000 of the Minister of Justice and the Minister of Health), the PMH did not carry out an autopsy on the body, stating that \u201cit was not believed to be a suspicious death, taking into consideration the two serious conditions displayed by the patient\u201d (namely intellectual disability and HIV infection).", "26. Unaware of Mr C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s death, on 21 February 2004 the CLR had drafted several urgent letters and then sent them to a number of local and central officials, including the Minister of Health, the prefect of Dolj County, the mayor of Poiana Mare and the director of the Dolj County Public Health Department, highlighting Mr C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s extremely critical condition and the fact that he had been transferred to an institution that was unable to provide him with appropriate care, in view of his HIV infection; the CLR further criticised the inadequate treatment he was receiving and asked for emergency measures to be taken to address the situation. It further stated that Mr C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s admission to the CMSC and subsequent transfer to the PMH had been in breach of his human rights, and urged that an appropriate investigation of the matter be launched.", "On 22 February 2004 the CLR issued a press release highlighting the conditions and the treatment received by patients at the PMH, making particular reference to the case of Mr C\u00e2mpeanu and calling for urgent action.", "27. In a letter of 15 June 2004 to the Prosecutor General of Romania, the CLR requested an update on the state of proceedings following the criminal complaint it had lodged with that institution on 23 February 2004 in relation to the circumstances leading up to Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s death; in the complaint it had emphasised that Mr C\u00e2mpeanu had not been placed in an appropriate medical institution, as required by his medical and mental condition.", "28. On the same day, the CLR lodged two further criminal complaints, one with the prosecutor\u2019s office attached to the Craiova District Court and the other with the prosecutor\u2019s office attached to the Craiova County Court. The CLR repeated its request for a criminal investigation to be opened in relation to the circumstances leading up to and surrounding Mr C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s death, alleging that the following offences had been committed:", "(i) negligence, by employees of the Child Protection Department and of the Placement Centre (Article 249 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code);", "(ii) malfeasance and nonfeasance against a person\u2019s interests and endangering a person unable to care for himself or herself, by employees of the CMSC (Articles 246 and 314 of the Criminal Code); and", "(iii) homicide by negligence or endangering a person unable to care for himself or herself, by employees of the PMH (Article 178 \u00a7 2 and Article 314 of the Criminal Code).", "The CLR further argued that the Medical Examination Panel had wrongly classified Mr C\u00e2mpeanu as being in the medium disability group, contrary to previous and subsequent diagnoses (see paragraph 9 above). In turn, the Child Protection Department had failed to institute proceedings for the appointment of a guardian when Mr C\u00e2mpeanu had reached the age of majority, in breach of existing legislation.", "Moreover, the Placement Centre had failed to supply the required antiretroviral medication to CMSC staff when Mr C\u00e2mpeanu had been transferred there on 5 February 2004, which might have caused his death two weeks later.", "The CLR also claimed that the transfer from the CMSC to the PMH had been unnecessary, improper and contrary to existing legislation, the measure having been taken without the patient\u2019s or his representative\u2019s consent, as required by the Patients\u2019 Rights Act (Law no. 46/2003).", "Lastly, the CLR argued that Mr C\u00e2mpeanu had not received adequate care, treatment or nutrition at the PMH.", "29. On 22 August 2004 the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office informed the CLR that the case had been sent to the prosecutor\u2019s office attached to the Dolj County Court for investigation.", "On 31 August 2004 the prosecutor\u2019s office attached to the Dolj County Court informed the CLR that a criminal file had been opened in response to its complaint, and that the investigation had been allocated to the Criminal Investigation Department of the Dolj County Police Department (\u201cthe Police Department\u201d).", "30. On 14 September 2004, at the request of the prosecutor\u2019s office, a forensic report was issued by the Craiova Institute of Forensic Medicine. Based on the medical records submitted, the report concluded as follows:", "\u201cMedical treatment was prescribed for [the patient\u2019s] HIV and his psychiatric condition, the treatment [being] correct and appropriate as to the dosage, in connection with the patient\u2019s clinical and immunological condition.", "It cannot be ascertained whether the patient had indeed taken his prescribed medication, having regard to his advanced state of psychosomatic degradation.\u201d", "31. On 22 October 2004 Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s body was exhumed and an autopsy carried out. A forensic report was subsequently issued on 2 February 2005, recording that the body showed advanced signs of cachexia and concluding as follows:", "\u201c... the death was not violent. It was due to cardiorespiratory insufficiency caused by pneumonia, a complication suffered during the progression of the HIV infection. Upon exhumation, no traces of violence were noticed.\u201d", "32. On 19 July 2005 the prosecutor\u2019s office attached to the Dolj County Court issued a decision not to prosecute, holding, inter alia, that, according to the evidence produced, the medical treatment provided to the patient had been appropriate, and that the death had not been violent, but rather had been caused by a complication which had occurred during the progression of Mr C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s HIV infection.", "33. On 8 August 2005 the CLR lodged a complaint against that decision with the Chief Prosecutor of the prosecutor\u2019s office attached to the Dolj County Court, claiming, inter alia, that some of the submissions it had made concerning the medical treatment given to the patient, the alleged discontinuation of the antiretroviral treatment and the living conditions in the hospitals had not been examined.", "On 23 August 2005 the Chief Prosecutor allowed the complaint, set aside the decision of 19 July 2005 and ordered the reopening of the investigation so that all aspects of the case could be examined. Specific instructions were given as to certain medical documents that needed to be examined, once they had been obtained from the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Craiova, the Placement Centre, the CMSC and the PMH. The doctors who had treated Mr C\u00e2mpeanu were to be questioned. The circumstances in which the antiretroviral treatment had or had not been provided to the patient while he was in the CMSC and in the PMH were to be clarified, especially as the medical records at the PMH did not mention anything on that account.", "34. On 11 December 2006 the prosecutor\u2019s office attached to the Dolj County Court decided that, pursuant to new procedural rules in force, it lacked jurisdiction to carry out the investigation, and referred the case file to the prosecutor\u2019s office attached to the Calafat District Court.", "35. On 11 January 2006 the Police Department asked the Dolj County Medical Association (\u201cthe Medical Association\u201d) to provide it with an opinion on \u201cwhether the therapeutic approach [adopted] was correct in view of the diagnosis [established in the autopsy report] or whether it contains indications of medical malpractice\u201d.", "On 20 July 2006, the Disciplinary Board of the Medical Association ruled that there were no grounds for taking disciplinary action against staff at the PMH:", "\u201c... the psychotropic treatment, as noted in the general clinical observation notes from the PMH, was appropriate ... [and therefore] ... the information received suggests that the doctors\u2019 decisions were correct, without any suspicion of medical malpractice [arising from] an opportunistic infection associated with HIV [being] incorrectly treated.\u201d", "That decision was challenged by the Police Department, but on 23 November 2006 the challenge was rejected as out of time.", "36. On 30 March 2007 the prosecutor\u2019s office attached to the Calafat District Court issued a fresh decision not to prosecute. The prosecutor relied in his reasoning on the evidence adduced in the file, as well as on the decision issued by the Disciplinary Board of the Medical Association.", "37. The CLR lodged a complaint against that decision, submitting that the majority of the instructions given in the Chief Prosecutor\u2019s decision of 23 August 2005 (see paragraph 33 above) had been ignored. The complaint was dismissed by the Chief Prosecutor of the prosecutor\u2019s office attached to the Calafat District Court on 4 June 2007. The brief statement of reasons in the decision referred to the conclusions of the forensic report of 14 September 2004 and the Medical Association\u2019s decision of 20 July 2006.", "On 10 August 2007 the CLR challenged that decision before the Calafat District Court.", "38. On 3 October 2007 the Calafat District Court allowed the complaint, set aside the decisions of 30 March 2007 and 4 June 2007 and ordered the reopening of the investigation, holding that several aspects of Mr C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s death had not been examined and that more evidence needed to be produced.", "Among the shortcomings highlighted by the court were the following: most of the documents which were supposed to have been obtained from the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Craiova and the Placement Centre had not actually been added to the investigation file (the forensic documents on the basis of which Mr C\u00e2mpeanu had been admitted to the CMSC and transferred to the PMH; the clinical and paraclinical tests undertaken; the records of questioning of the doctors and nurses who had been responsible for Mr C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s care; and the HIV testing guidelines). Contradictions in the statements of those involved in Mr C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s admission to the CMSC had not been clarified, and neither had the circumstances relating to the interruption of his antiretroviral treatment after being transferred to the PMH. In addition, the contradictory claims of medical personnel from the CMSC and the PMH regarding Mr C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s alleged \u201cstate of agitation\u201d had not been clarified.", "The investigators had also failed to ascertain whether the medical staff at the PMH had carried out the necessary tests after Mr C\u00e2mpeanu had been admitted there and whether he had received antiretrovirals or any other appropriate medication. The investigators had failed to establish the origin of the oedema noted on Mr C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s face and lower limbs and whether the therapeutic approach adopted at the PMH had been correct. Given these failures, the request for an opinion from the Medical Association had been premature and should be resubmitted once the investigation file had been completed.", "39. The prosecutor\u2019s office attached to the Calafat District Court appealed against that judgment. On 4 April 2008 the Dolj County Court allowed the appeal, quashed the judgment delivered by the Calafat District Court and dismissed the CLR\u2019s complaint concerning the decision of 30 March 2007 not to prosecute.", "The court mainly relied on the conclusions of the forensic report and the autopsy report, and also on the decision of the Medical Association, all of which had stated that there had been no causal link between the medical treatment given to Mr C\u00e2mpeanu and his death.", "40. In response to the complaints lodged by the CLR (see paragraph 26 above), on 8 March 2004 the prefect of Dolj County established a commission with the task of carrying out an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s death. The commission was made up of representatives of the Child Protection Department, the Public Health Department, the Criminal Investigations Department of the Police Department and the prefect\u2019s office. The commission was given ten days to complete the investigation and submit a report on its findings.", "The commission\u2019s report concluded that all procedures relating to Mr C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s treatment after his discharge from the Placement Centre had been lawful and justified in view of his diagnosis. The commission found only one irregularity, in that an autopsy had not been carried out immediately after Mr C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s death, in breach of existing legislation (see paragraph 25 above).", "41. On 26 June 2004 the CLR filed a complaint with the National Authority for the Protection and Adoption of Children (\u201cthe National Authority\u201d), criticising several deficiencies concerning mainly the failure to appoint a guardian for Mr C\u00e2mpeanu and to place him in an appropriate medical institution. The CLR reiterated its complaint on 4 August 2004, submitting that the wrongful transfer of Mr C\u00e2mpeanu to the PMH could raise issues under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e) of the Convention.", "In response to those allegations, the National Authority issued a report on 21 October 2004 on the circumstances surrounding Mr C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s death. The National Authority acknowledged that the Panel had acted ultra vires when ordering Mr C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s admission to the PMH. However, it stated that in any event, the order had been of no consequence, given that the institution had initially refused to accept Mr C\u00e2mpeanu (see paragraph 11 above).", "The National Authority concluded that the Child Protection Department had acted in line with the principles of professional ethics and best practice when it had transferred Mr C\u00e2mpeanu to the CMSC. At the same time, the National Authority stated that it was not authorised to pass judgment on Mr C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s subsequent transfer to the PMH.", "Similarly, the National Authority declined to express an opinion on the allegedly wrongful categorisation of Mr C\u00e2mpeanu as belonging to the medium disability group, or on the events which had occurred after his admission to the CMSC.", "42. On 24 March 2004 the Dolj County Public Health Department informed the CLR that a commission made up of various county-level officials had concluded that \u201cno human rights were breached\u201d in connection with Mr C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s death, as his successive admissions to hospital had been justified by Article 9 of Law no. 584/2002 on measures for the prevention of the spread of HIV infection and the protection of persons infected with HIV or suffering from AIDS.", "43. On 16 March 2005, following a criminal investigation concerning the death of seventeen patients at the PMH, the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office sent a letter to the Ministry of Health, requiring it to take certain administrative measures to address the situation at the hospital. While noting that no criminal wrongdoing was detectable in connection with the deaths in question, the letter highlighted \u201cadministrative deficiencies\u201d observed at the hospital and called for appropriate measures to be taken as regards the following problems:", "\u201c[L]ack of heating in the patients\u2019 rooms; hypocaloric food; insufficient staff, poorly trained in providing care to mentally disabled patients; lack of effective medication; extremely limited opportunities to carry out paraclinical investigations ..., all these factors having encouraged the onset of infectious diseases, as well as their fatal progression ...\u201d", "44. In a decision of 15 June 2006 concerning a criminal complaint lodged by the CLR on behalf of another patient, P.C., who had died at the PMH, the High Court of Cassation and Justice dismissed an objection by the public prosecutor that the CLR did not have locus standi. It found that the CLR did indeed have locus standi to pursue proceedings of this nature with a view to elucidating the circumstances in which seventeen patients had died at the PMH in January and February 2004, in view of its field of activity and stated aims as a foundation for the protection of human rights. The court held as follows:", "\u201cThe High Court considers that the CLR may be regarded as \u2018any other person whose legitimate interests are harmed\u2019 within the meaning of Article 2781 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The legitimacy of its interest lies in the CLR\u2019s request that the circumstances which led to the death of seventeen patients at the PMH in January and February 2004 be determined and elucidated; its aim was thus to safeguard the right to life and the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment ... by initiating an official criminal investigation that would be effective and exhaustive so as to identify those responsible for breaches of the above-mentioned rights, in accordance with the requirements of Articles 2 and 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. [It also aimed] to raise the awareness of society as to the need to protect fundamental human rights and freedoms and to ensure access to justice, which corresponds to the NGO\u2019s stated goals.", "Its legitimate interest has been demonstrated by the initiation of investigations, which are currently pending.", "At the same time, the possibility for the CLR to lodge a complaint in accordance with Article 2781 ... represents a judicial remedy of which the complainant availed itself, also in compliance with the provisions of Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights ...\u201d", "45. The CLR submitted an expert opinion, dated 4 January 2012 and issued by Dr Adriaan van Es, a member of the Forensic Advisory Team and director of the International Federation of Health and Human Rights Organisations (IFHHRO), assisted by Anca Boeriu, Project Officer at the IFHHRO. The opinion was based on copies of the evidence which the CLR also submitted to the Court, including the medical records from the CMSC and the PMH.", "The expert opinion referred to the \u201cvery poor, substandard, often absent or missing\u201d medical records at the PMH and the CMSC, in which the description of Mr C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s clinical situation was \u201cscant\u201d. It noted that while at the PMH the patient had never been consulted by an infectiousdisease specialist. Also, contrary to Romanian law, no autopsy had taken place immediately after the patient\u2019s death.", "Concerning the antiretroviral treatment, the documents available did not provide reliable information as to whether it had been received on a continuous basis. Therefore, as a result of inappropriate treatment, Mr C\u00e2mpeanu might have suffered from a relapse of HIV, and also from opportunistic infections such as pneumocystis pneumonia (pneumonia appeared in the autopsy report as the cause of death). The opinion noted that pneumonia had not been diagnosed or treated while the patient was at the PMH or the CMSC, even though it was a very common disease in HIV patients. Common laboratory tests to monitor the patient\u2019s HIV status had never been carried out.", "The expert opinion stated that certain behavioural signs interpreted as psychiatric disorders might have been caused by septicaemia.", "Therefore, the risks of discontinued antiretroviral treatment, the possibility of opportunistic infections and the patient\u2019s history of tuberculosis should have led to Mr C\u00e2mpeanu being admitted to an infectious-disease department of a general hospital, and not to a psychiatric institution.", "46. The report concluded that Mr C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s death at the PMH had been the result of \u201cgross medical negligence\u201d. The management of HIV and opportunistic infections had failed to comply with international standards and medical ethics, as had the counselling and treatment provided to the patient for his severe intellectual disability.

After each visit, the CPT issued very critical reports, highlighting the \u201cinhuman and degrading living conditions\u201d at the PMH.", "Following a visit to several of the medical institutions indicated as problematic in the CPT\u2019s reports, among them the PMH, the Ministry of Health issued a report on 2 September 2003. It concluded that at the PMH the medication provided to patients was inadequate, either because there was no link between the psychiatric diagnosis and the treatment provided, or because the medical examinations were very limited. Several deficiencies were found concerning management efficiency and the insufficient number of medical staff in relation to the number of patients.", "48.
