The applicant, Mr Jovo Grubi\u0107, is a Croatian national who was born in 1952 and lives in Golubi\u0107. He was represented before the Court by Mr L. \u0160u\u0161ak, a lawyer practising in Zagreb.", "2. The Croatian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms \u0160. Sta\u017enik.", "3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "4. During 1991 and 1992 Serbian paramilitary forces gained control over about one-third of the territory of Croatia and proclaimed the \u201cSerbian Autonomous region of Krajina\u201d (Srpska autonomna oblast Krajina, hereinafter \u201cKrajina\u201d). The applicant\u2019s mother, N.G., remained living in Golubi\u0107, a village in \u201cKrajina\u201d. At the beginning of August 1995 the Croatian authorities announced a military action with the aim of regaining control over \u201cKrajina\u201d. The action was codenamed \u201cStorm\u201d, and took place from 4 to 7 August 1995. Before that action, the vast majority of the population of \u201cKrajina\u201d fled Croatia, firstly to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and later on many of them went to live in Serbia. Some returned to Croatia after the war. The number of people who fled is estimated at between 100,000 and 150,000.", "5. On 23 May 2002 the applicant lodged a request with the Yugoslav Red Cross in Belgrade for a search for his mother. He alleged that his mother had disappeared on 5 August 1995 in Golubi\u0107, during the \u201cStorm\u201d military action.", "6. In May 2002 the body of the applicant\u2019s mother was exhumed in Golubi\u0107 and transferred to the Zagreb Forensic Institute (Zavod za sudksu medicine u Zagrebu). On 19 November 2002 an autopsy was carried out which failed to establish the cause of death. On 6 December 2002 the applicant received the autopsy report and the body was given to the family. On an unspecified date it was buried in the Golubi\u0107 graveyard.", "7. On 27 December 2006 the applicant brought a civil action for damages against the State in the Knin Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Kninu). On 7 December 2007 the claim was dismissed on the ground that the circumstances of the death of his mother remained unknown. Thus the applicant had failed to prove either that his mother had been killed by Croatian army soldiers or that her death \u201cresulted from an act of terror or violence aimed at gravely disturbing public order\u201d and that her death was not war-related. This judgment was upheld by the \u0160ibenik County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u \u0160ibeniku) on 30 August 2010, and by the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) on 6 April 2011.", "8.
