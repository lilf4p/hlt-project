The applicant, Mr Nikola Kova\u010devi\u0107, is a Croatian national who was born in 1966 and lives in Zapre\u0161i\u0107. He was represented before the Court by Mr M. \u010ci\u010dkovi\u0107, a lawyer practising in Zagreb.", "2. The Croatian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms \u0160. Sta\u017enik.", "3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "4. On 17 August 2002 the applicant was physically attacked by a certain M.M. Following the said event, on 25 November 2002 M.M. was found guilty in minor offence proceedings for breaching public order and peace and ordered to pay a fine.", "5. On 21 July 2003 the applicant lodged a civil action with the Zagreb Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Zagrebu) against M.M., claiming damages in connection with the physical attack on him. He submitted medical documentation in relation to the injuries he had sustained and requested that an expert report be obtained detailing the duration and intensity of his physical pain and mental suffering as a result of the attack on him.", "6. On 23 August 2005 the Zagreb Municipal Court declared that it lacked jurisdiction to examine the applicant\u2019s case. The case was referred to the Dubrovnik Municipal Court (Op\u0107inski sud u Dubrovniku) as the competent court.", "7. At a hearing held on 6 December 2005 the trial judge informed the applicant of the possibility of hiring a lawyer to assist him in the proceedings. The applicant maintained that he wished to represent himself.", "8. At a hearing held on 14 June 2006 the applicant and M.M.\u2019s representative agreed that the trial court should question the parties and three witnesses, and should order an expert medical report detailing the means of infliction, the duration and the intensity of the applicant\u2019s physical pain and mental suffering as a result of M.M.\u2019s attack on him.", "9. On 6 September 2006 the trial court heard evidence from the applicant.", "10. On 27 October 2006 the trial court heard two witnesses, as well as the applicant (the plaintiff) and the defendant. It dismissed the applicant\u2019s proposal for the police records of action undertaken in relation to the attack on him to be obtained. The applicant then stated that he had no further proposals for evidence. The relevant part of the record of the hearing reads as follows:", "\u201cThe plaintiff proposes in the next part of the proceedings to seek from the police their records of action undertaken, but the judge dismisses that evidence proposal, given that the minor offence proceedings file has been obtained ...", "The plaintiff does not have any further evidence, or any proposal to adduce further evidence. The judge explains what evidence he can propose in the proceedings and in what manner, and warns him of the repercussions of applying the burden of proof rule.", "...", "The Court renders a", "decision", "Given that the parties do not have any further proposals for evidence, even after a warning of the repercussions of applying the burden of proof rule, the court, which cannot itself propose evidence in these proceedings, closes the hearing.\u201d", "The applicant signed the record of the hearing without expressing any objections.", "11. On 3 November 2006 the Dubrovnik Municipal Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s civil action on the grounds that the scope and intensity of the consequences of the attack on him by M.M. had not been proven as he had not proposed the gathering of the necessary evidence, that is to say the obtaining of a medical expert report. The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows:", "\u201cThe medical documentation in question was included in the civil action, the credibility of which was undisputed ... The court does not have the expertise to establish facts on the basis of medical documentation \u2013 that requires the expertise of a medical expert. However, in order to use the assistance of an expert in proving a fact or clarifying the real nature of the matter, it is necessary that a party, in this case the plaintiff, proposes doing so. It is only then that the court can order an examination and an expert report on the question of whether the plaintiff sustained injuries in the incident concerned, and if so, which and of what kind, and also whether he experienced mental suffering and physical pain, and if so, of what intensity and duration...", "Therefore, there was neither any evidence as to the viability and the extent of the consequences, nor any proposal to adduce such evidence (obtaining the medical expert report), as the damage caused by the defendant to the plaintiff ...", "The court warned the plaintiff of the repercussions of applying the burden of proof rule at a hearing held on 7 October 2006 \u2012 after he [the plaintiff] stated that he had neither any further evidence nor any proposals to adduce further evidence \u2012 and informed him that he could be represented by a lawyer ... which he [the plaintiff] disregarded.\u201d", "12. The applicant appealed against this judgment, alleging in particular that his statement concerning the obtaining of a medical expert report had been incorrectly entered into the record of the hearing. The relevant part of his appeal reads as follows:", "\u201c...the statement which appears in the reasoning of the first-instance judgment to the effect that the plaintiff did not propose the obtainment of an expert report is incorrect, because the plaintiff\u2019s statement in that respect was not correctly entered in the records. In particular, the plaintiff stated that, if the court could not establish the facts on the basis of the offered evidence, and if the presence of the plaintiff\u2019s witness (N.I.) could not be ensured, then, if necessary, [the court should] supplement the evidence as to the facts with an expert report.", "The court misinterpreted the plaintiff\u2019s statement in that respect and therefore came to the wrong conclusion ...\u201d", "13. 16 On July 2009 the Dubrovnik County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Dubrovniku) dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal as ill-founded, holding that the first-instance court had duly examined all the parties\u2019 relevant submissions. It noted in particular that the record of the hearing held before the first-instance court indicated that the trial judge had warned the applicant of the repercussions of failing to propose the gathering of relevant evidence, and that the records had been signed without any objections.", "14. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske), alleging in particular that the lower courts should not have dismissed his civil action merely because no expert report had been obtained in the proceedings.", "15. On 30 March 2011 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law as ill-founded. It held, in particular, that the lower courts had correctly dismissed the applicant\u2019s civil action by applying the burden of proof rule, given that the applicant, although warned, had failed to propose that an expert medical report be obtained.", "16. The applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint before the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske), challenging the decisions of the lower courts. He alleged, in particular, that the courts had dismissed his civil action on the grounds that he had failed to propose that the expert medical report be obtained, even though he had expressly proposed that such evidence be obtained at the hearing held on 14 June 2006.", "17. On 25 January 2012 the Constitutional Court declared the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded. This decision was served on the applicant\u2019s representative on 15 February 2012."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
