A list of the applicants is set out in the appendix. All the applicants are nationals of Bosnia and Herzegovina and are represented by Ms T. Drobnjak, a lawyer practicing in Belgrade.", "2. The Serbian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) are represented by their Agent, Ms N. Plav\u0161i\u0107.", "3. Following its declaration of independence from the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) in March 1992, a brutal war broke out in Bosnia and Herzegovina. More than 100,000 people were killed and more than 2,000,000 others were displaced as a result of \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d or generalised violence. The following local forces were the main parties to the conflict: the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine, hereinafter ARBH), which was mostly made up of Bosniacs and loyal to the central authorities in Sarajevo, the Croatian Defence Council (Hrvatsko vije\u0107e odbrane, hereinafter HVO), which was mostly made up of Croats, and the Army of the Republika Srpska (Vojska Republike Srpske, hereinafter VRS) which was mostly made up of Serbs. The conflict ended in December 1995 when the General Framework Agreement for Peace (\u201cthe Dayton Agreement\u201d) entered into force between Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (succeeded by Serbia by 2006).", "4. \u017depa, a town in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina, is situated some twelve kilometres from the border with Serbia. Before the war it had a population of less than 3,000, of whom the majority were Bosniacs. During the war, \u017depa was one of three Bosniac enclaves in eastern Bosnia surrounded by the VRS. In 1993 it was declared a \u201csafe area\u201d by the United Nations Security Council.", "5. In 1995, there were between 6,500 and 8,000 people living in \u017depa, of whom some two-thirds were displaced persons from other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.", "6. On 12 July 1995 the VRS attacked the \u017depa \u201csafe area\u201d, capturing it on 25 July. In the days that followed, several hundred Bosniacs \u2013 predominantly able-bodied men who refused to surrender to VRS forces \u2013 managed to cross the border and flee to Serbia. The present applicants\u2019 relatives were among them.", "7. When \u017depa was captured by the VRS, the applicants\u2019 relatives (Mr Abid Agi\u0107, the brother of the first applicant; Mr \u0160e\u0107an Dizdarevi\u0107, the son of the second applicant and brother of the third and the fourth applicant; Mr Edem Torlak, the father of the fifth applicant and the husband of the sixth applicant; and Mr Meho Jahi\u0107, the husband of the seventh applicant) crossed into Serbia from Bosnia and Herzegovina, hoping that they would be able to find refuge in a third country. They were discovered by a border guard patrol of the Yugoslav Army (Vojska Jugoslavije, hereinafter VJ) and taken to two detention camps. It would appear that more than 800 exiled individuals were brought to the camps between 29 July and 3 August 1995. The applicants claim that the men received notification that they had prisoner-of-war status; it is not clear whether all of them were indeed members of ARBH or some of them were civilians. The first camp, \u0160ljivovica, was situated in the municipality of \u010cajetina and the second, Mitrovo Polje, in the municipality of Aleksandrovac, both in Serbia. The \u0160ljivovica detention camp was located in an abandoned workers\u2019 barracks and Mitrovo Polje in a former children\u2019s recreational facility.", "8. Both camps were guarded by the Serbian police force and none of the applicants was allowed to leave them. According to the applicants, during their transportation to the camps or while interned in them, their relatives were either murdered or died as a result of torture and lack of medical assistance.", "9. During their existence the camps were visited by representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the State Commission for Missing Persons of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The latter compiled a report in which it found that the conditions of detention were disturbing.", "10. Following the entry into force of the Dayton Agreement, the UNHCR facilitated the transfer of the camp survivors into third countries and the camps were closed in February/April 1996.", "11. The applicants maintained that Mr Agi\u0107, along with the other men, was captured by a border guard stationed at the Jago\u0161tica watch-tower on 31 July or 1 August 1995. Upon capture and before being handed over to the competent police authorities, he was severely beaten by the soldiers and died there from the injuries sustained.", "12. The Government maintained that nobody by the name of Abid Agi\u0107 is mentioned in the relevant police or military records.", "13. The applicants maintained that Mr Dizdarevi\u0107, who was seventeen years old at the time, was captured along with the other men by a border guard stationed at the Jago\u0161tica watch-tower on 31 July or 1 August 1995. Upon capture and before being handed to the competent police authorities, he was repeatedly kicked in the abdomen by the soldiers, sustaining internal injuries as a result. He was then transferred to an internment camp where, despite the deterioration of his health, he was not provided with medical care. He died of the inflicted injuries on the way to hospital on 9 September 1995.", "14. The Government maintained that the autopsy report shows that Mr Dizdarevi\u0107 died of natural causes due to \u201cheart failure and stay of breathing resulting from self-poisoning caused by deterioration of part of the small intestine, aggravated by breathing of stomach contents as a result of vomiting and acute inflammation of the stomach.\u201d", "15. The applicants made no comment on the Government\u2019s submission.", "16. Mr Torlak was detained at the Jago\u0161tica watch-tower and transported to the \u0160ljivovica camp on 1 August 1995. He was transported with another sixty detainees in a closed curtainside truck designed to transport a maximum of twenty people. He died apparently of suffocation during transportation. His body was taken out of the truck and buried on 11 August 1995 by the Muslim religious community in the Priboj cemetery. There is apparently a pathologist\u2019s report of 10 August 1995, without post mortem examination, stating that he had died from heart attack.", "In June 2007 the Serbian Commission for missing persons ordered the exhumation of his corps, identified him and transported him to Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Commission stated in its request to a competent court that it did not have any information that the persons may have died by the cause of a crime. The autopsy could not determine the cause of death due to the corps\u2019 state.", "17. The applicants maintain that Mr Jahi\u0107 was severely beaten by guards at the \u0160ljivovica camp and that he died of the injuries inflicted in October 1995.", "18. The Government maintained that the only person registered as a detainee under the name of Meho Jahi\u0107 at the \u0160ljivovica camp was transferred to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Belgrade on 7 December 1995 and had been scheduled for emigration to Ireland. They further claim that this person died on 25 January 2005 in Hrasnica, Ilid\u017ea, Bosnia and Herzegovina and was buried in Vlakovo, Ilid\u017ea, Bosnia and Herzegovina.", "19. On 6 September 2011 the Humanitarian Law Centre (Fond za humanitarno pravo, hereinafter FHP), a Belgrade-based NGO, lodged a criminal complaint on behalf of the applicants and other individuals as victims with the Office of the War Crimes Prosecutor of Serbia (Tu\u017eila\u0161tvo za ratne zlo\u010dine, hereinafter OWCP) against more than fifty individuals for alleged war crimes (see paragraph 32 below). In its criminal complaint the FHP submitted statements from the camps\u2019 detainees, medical documentation, documentation from the International Committee of the Red Cross and the State Commission for Missing Persons of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and other evidence. They submitted an extensive list of potential witnesses and proposed other investigative steps. Among those alleged to have taken part in the killings, the Centre identified members of the State Security Agency of Serbia, police officers, and military servicemen of various ranks. It would appear that on 8 September 2011 the OWCP requested the FHP to provide evidence it referred to in the criminal complaint, but the FHP apparently failed to do so.", "20. On 23 September 2011 the OWCP undertook a preliminary verification of the information submitted by the applicants and requested the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence to submit information regarding the criminal complaint.", "21. On 17 November 2011 and 2 December 2011 the Ministry of the Interior submitted two reports to the OWCP. In their reports it was stated that the situation in the camps had been generally good, that the camps had not been enclosed behind a fence, and that residents who were given refugee status had had access to health services, a canteen, a post office, a phone, a bank, and both private visits and visits by officials from international organisations. While one of the reports describes the conditions in \u0160ljivovica camp as unsatisfactory, the conditions in Mitrovo Polje were described as lodgings with the quality of \u201chotel accommodation\u201d. This preliminary examination also revealed some inconsistencies and irregularities in the criminal complaint regarding the identity of the alleged victims and the circumstances of their death and burial.", "22. On 1 March 2013 the OWCP notified the FHP that it decided, having regard to the FHP\u2019s allegations and evidence collected by the OWCP, not to prosecute (da nema mesta krivi\u010dnom gonjenju, Ktrr. 134/11) on the ground that there had not been elements of the alleged war crime or any other crime within the OWCP\u2019s jurisdiction in the acting of the suspects. A reasoned decision (re\u0161enje o odba\u010daju), if it had been made in writing, has neither been sent to the applicants, nor to the FHP.", "23. On 8 April 2013 the applicants lodged a constitutional appeal before the Constitutional Court of Serbia, claiming violations of Articles 2, 3 and 6 of the Convention. On 4 February 2014 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicants\u2019 constitutional appeal, finding that, given the legal nature and content of the OWCP\u2019s decision, it could not be considered as an individual act which was decisive with respect to the applicants\u2019 human rights, as required by Article 170 of the Constitution (da se ne radi o pojedina\u010dnom aktu iz \u010dlana 170. Ustava; see paragraph 25 below).", "24. The decision of the Constitutional Court was delivered to the applicants\u2019 representative on 2 July 2014.", "25. The relevant provisions of the Constitution read as follows:", "Article 170", "\u201cA constitutional appeal may be lodged against individual decisions or actions of State bodies or organisations exercising delegated public powers which violate or deny human or minority rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution, if other legal remedies for their protection have already been exhausted or have not been prescribed.\u201d", "26.
