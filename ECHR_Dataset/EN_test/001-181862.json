The applicant was born in 1953. He is currently detained in Istanbul.", "12. The applicant is an economics professor and a journalist in Turkey. Prior to the attempted military coup of 15 July 2016, he presented a political discussion programme on Can Erzincan TV, a television channel that was closed down following the adoption of Legislative Decree no. 668, issued on 27 July 2016 in connection with the state of emergency (see paragraphs 14-18 below).", "13. In the years leading up to the attempted coup, the applicant had been known for his critical views on the serving government\u2019s policies.", "14. During the night of 15 to 16 July 2016 a group of members of the Turkish armed forces calling themselves the \u201cPeace at Home Council\u201d attempted to carry out a military coup aimed at overthrowing the democratically elected parliament, government and President of Turkey.", "15. During the attempted coup, soldiers under the instigators\u2019 control bombarded several strategic State buildings, including the parliament building and the presidential compound, attacked the hotel where the President was staying, held the Chief of General Staff hostage, attacked television channels and fired shots at demonstrators. During the night of violence, more than 300 people were killed and more than 2,500 were injured.", "16. The day after the attempted military coup, the national authorities blamed the network linked to Fetullah G\u00fclen, a Turkish citizen living in Pennsylvania (United States of America) and considered to be the leader of a terrorist organisation known as FET\u00d6/PDY (\u201cG\u00fclenist Terror Organisation/Parallel State Structure\u201d). Several criminal investigations were subsequently initiated by the appropriate prosecuting authorities in relation to suspected members of that organisation.", "17. On 20 July 2016 the government declared a state of emergency for a period of three months as from 21 July 2016; the state of emergency was subsequently extended for further periods of three months by the Council of Ministers, chaired by the President, most recently with effect from 19 January 2018.", "18. On 21 July 2016 the Turkish authorities gave notice to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe of a derogation from the Convention under Article 15.", "19. On an unspecified date, the Istanbul public prosecutor initiated a criminal investigation in respect of suspected members of FET\u00d6/PDY. In addition, on the basis of Article 3 \u00a7 1 (l) of Legislative Decree no. 668, he ordered restrictions on the right of the suspects\u2019 lawyers to inspect the contents of the investigation file or to obtain copies of documents in the file. In the course of the criminal investigation, the applicant was arrested at his home on 10 September 2016 and taken into police custody on suspicion of having links to the media wing of the organisation in question.", "20. On the same day, the applicant\u2019s home was searched by police officers without his lawyers being present, as they had been prevented from attending the search on account of the state of emergency.", "21. Later that day, the applicant lodged an objection challenging his detention in police custody and seeking his release. On 12 September 2016 the Istanbul magistrate\u2019s court dismissed the objection.", "22. The applicant remained in police custody for twelve days at the Istanbul police anti-terrorist branch. During his first five days in custody, he was not permitted to speak to his lawyers.", "23. On 20 September 2016, while at the police station, the applicant stated that he was asserting his right to remain silent.", "24. On 21 September 2016 he was questioned by the Istanbul public prosecutor on suspicion of attempting to overthrow the government or to prevent it from discharging its duties (Article 312 of the Criminal Code \u2013 (\u201cthe CC\u201d) and of being a member of the FET\u00d6/PDY terrorist organisation (Article 314 of the CC).", "25. The records of the questioning indicate that the applicant was accused of: (i) attempting to discredit an investigation into an alleged coup (the \u201cBalyoz\u201d case); (ii) making certain statements serving the interests of FET\u00d6/PDY, in particular during a television programme broadcast on Can Erzincan TV on 14 July 2016, in the course of which, according to the public prosecutor, the terrorist organisation had sought to prepare the public for a military coup; (iii) holding an account with Bank Asya, a bank with alleged links to FET\u00d6/PDY; (iv) avoiding a criminal investigation through the assistance of members of the national police suspected of belonging to FET\u00d6/PDY; (v) visiting Fetullah G\u00fclen at his home in Pennsylvania and kissing his hand; and (vi) having in his possession a United States one-dollar bill with an \u201cF\u201d serial number (denoting the initial of the forename Fetullah). In reply, the applicant stated that he did not know any Turkish army officers and had no links to the attempted coup. The comments he had made during the television programme in question had been intended as warnings to prevent future military coups. Regarding the bank account, some years previously he had taught for three months at a private university, which had asked him to open an account at the bank in question for payment of his wages. He added that he had not been aware of having avoided a criminal investigation through the assistance of certain suspected members of an illegal organisation, and that this was a matter to be taken up with the police officers allegedly responsible. Furthermore, he had visited Fetullah G\u00fclen as a member of a group of journalists, for purely professional reasons linked to his role as a journalist, and had never kissed anyone\u2019s hand. Lastly, the one-dollar bill was of no special significance.", "26. On 22 September 2016 the applicant appeared before the Istanbul 10th Magistrate\u2019s Court and was questioned about his alleged acts and the accusations against him. At the end of the hearing, the magistrate ordered the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention, having taken the following factors into consideration: the strong suspicions against him; the nature of the alleged offences and the fact that they were among the offences listed in Article 100 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (\u201cthe CCP\u201d) \u2013 the so-called \u201ccatalogue offences\u201d, for which a suspect\u2019s pre-trial detention was deemed justified in the event of strong suspicion; the risk of absconding; and the risk that alternative measures to detention might be insufficient to ensure the applicant\u2019s participation in the criminal proceedings. In the reasons for his decision, the magistrate noted the following: during the attempted military coup, members of FET\u00d6/PDY had used heavy weapons; since February 2012 the organisation in question had been explicitly waging a campaign against the political authorities; the members of FET\u00d6/PDY had attempted to force the government\u2019s resignation by discrediting it in public opinion, especially through judicial operations carried out between 17 and 25 December 2013; and the organisation had taken control of several media outlets with a view to achieving its aim. The magistrate further noted that during the television broadcast on 14 July 2016, the applicant had said: \u201cWithin the State of the Republic of Turkey, there is probably another structure, whose components outside Turkey are closely observing and documenting all these events. It is not clear exactly when [it] will pull its hand out of the bag or how [it] will do so\u201d (\u201cT\u00fcrkiye Devleti i\u00e7inde de muhtemelen b\u00fct\u00fcn bu geli\u015fmeleri d\u0131\u015f d\u00fcnyada daha fazla belgeleyen, izleyen bir ba\u015fka da yap\u0131 var. Onun ne zaman torbadan elini \u00e7\u0131karaca\u011f\u0131, nas\u0131l elini \u00e7\u0131karaca\u011f\u0131 belli de\u011fil\u201d). The magistrate concluded that there were suspicions that the contents of the applicant\u2019s statements about the political authorities had been intended to prepare the ground for a military coup and were not covered by freedom of the press.", "27. On 28 September 2016 the applicant lodged an objection against the order for his pre-trial detention. In a decision of 10 October 2016 the Istanbul 2nd Magistrate\u2019s Court dismissed the objection.", "28. On 14 October 2016 the applicant lodged a fresh application for his release. In a decision of 26 October 2016 the Istanbul 3rd Magistrate\u2019s Court rejected the application.", "29. On various dates the applicant lodged further applications seeking his release pending trial. According to the documents produced by the parties, the applications were all rejected by the competent magistrates\u2019 courts, for example on 10 and 24 November 2016 and 8 December 2016.", "30. On 14 April 2017 the Istanbul public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Istanbul Assize Court in respect of several individuals, including the applicant, in particular accusing them, under Articles 309, 311 and 312 in conjunction with Article 220 \u00a7 6 of the CC, of attempting to overthrow the constitutional order, the Turkish Grand National Assembly and the government by force and violence, and of committing offences on behalf of a terrorist organisation without being members of it. The public prosecutor presented the following items of evidence against the applicant: two articles written by him; his comments during the television broadcast on 14 July 2016; the fact that he had an account with Bank Asya; and the seizure at his home of a United States one-dollar bill with an \u201cF\u201d serial number. He sought the imposition of three aggravated life sentences and a sentence of up to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment on the applicant.", "31. On an unspecified date, the public prosecutor filed his submissions on the merits (esas hakk\u0131nda m\u00fctalaa). He sought the applicant\u2019s conviction for the offences with which he was charged. Besides the evidence he had already submitted when the bill of indictment had been filed, the public prosecutor also produced messages sent by other suspected members of FET\u00d6/PDY via ByLock, an encrypted messaging service allegedly used by members of that organisation.", "32. During the criminal proceedings, the applicant denied having committed any criminal offence.", "33. In a summary judgment of 16 February 2018 the Istanbul 26th Assize Court sentenced the applicant to aggravated life imprisonment, in accordance with Article 309 of the CC, for attempting to overthrow the constitutional order. The criminal proceedings are still ongoing in the national courts.", "34. On 8 November 2016 the applicant lodged an individual application with the Constitutional Court. He complained that he had been placed in pre-trial detention on account of his articles and statements and alleged that this infringed his right to liberty and security and his right to freedom of expression and of the press. He also submitted that he had been arrested and detained for reasons other than those provided for by the Constitution. In addition, he complained that his detention in police custody had been unlawful and excessively lengthy, that he had had no access to the investigation file in order to challenge his pre-trial detention, that the magistrates ordering his detention had not been independent or impartial, that no hearings had been held following his applications challenging his continued pre-trial detention, and that the conditions of his detention were incompatible with the prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment.", "35. On 11 January 2018 the Constitutional Court gave a judgment (no. 2016/23672) in which it held, by eleven votes to six, that there had been a violation of the right to liberty and security and the right to freedom of expression and of the press.", "36. With regard to the applicant\u2019s complaint that his pre-trial detention was unlawful, the Constitutional Court noted firstly that the evidence forming the basis for his detention had included: (i) an article entitled \u201cThe meaning of Sledgehammer\u201d (\u201cBalyoz\u2019un Anlam\u0131\u201d), published in the Star newspaper in 2010; (ii) his statements during the television programme broadcast on Can Erzincan TV on 14 July 2016; and (iii) an article entitled \u201cTurbulence\u201d (\u201cT\u00fcrb\u00fclans\u201d), published on his own website on 20 July 2016. After examining the substance of these items of evidence, the Constitutional Court held that the investigating authorities had been unable to demonstrate any factual basis that might indicate that the applicant had been acting in accordance with the aims of FET\u00d6/PDY or with the purpose of preparing the ground for a possible military coup. The Constitutional Court observed that, as well as having published the above-mentioned articles and made the statements in question, the applicant was accused of holding an account with Bank Asya, having avoided a criminal investigation through the connivance of members of the national police suspected of belonging to FET\u00d6/PDY, and having in his possession a United States one-dollar bill with an \u201cF\u201d serial number. Addressing those allegations, the Constitutional Court held, having regard to the applicant\u2019s testimony and line of defence, that no specific facts had been established that could refute his explanations, which were \u201cconsistent with the normal course of life\u201d. Similarly, regarding the contents of the messages exchanged by other individuals via ByLock, the Constitutional Court held that the messages could not in themselves be regarded as significant indications that the applicant had committed an offence. Accordingly, it concluded that \u201cstrong evidence that an offence had been committed\u201d had not been sufficiently established in the applicant\u2019s case. Next, the Constitutional Court examined whether there had been a violation of the right to liberty and security in the light of Article 15 of the Constitution (providing for the suspension of the exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms in the event of war, general mobilisation, a state of siege or a state of emergency). On this point, it noted firstly that in a state of emergency, the Constitution provided for the possibility of taking measures derogating from the guarantees set forth in Article 19, to the extent required by the situation. It observed, however, that if it were accepted that people could be placed in pre-trial detention without any strong evidence that they had committed an offence, the guarantees of the right to liberty and security would be meaningless. Accordingly, it held that the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention was disproportionate to the strict exigencies of the situation and that his right to liberty and security, as safeguarded by Article 19 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution, had been breached.", "37. However, having regard to the length of the applicant\u2019s detention and the documents available to it, the Constitutional Court held that his complaint that he had been detained for political purposes, on grounds other than those provided for by the Constitution, lacked a sufficient basis.", "38. With regard to the complaint concerning freedom of expression and of the press, the Constitutional Court observed that the applicant\u2019s initial and continued pre-trial detention on account of his articles and statements amounted to interference with the exercise of that right. Taking into account his arguments regarding the lawfulness of his pre-trial detention, the Constitutional Court held that such a measure, which had serious consequences since it resulted in deprivation of liberty, could not be regarded as a necessary and proportionate interference in a democratic society. It further noted that it could not be clearly established from the reasons given for ordering and extending the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention whether the measure met a pressing social need or why it was necessary. Lastly, it found that it was clear that the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention could have a chilling effect on freedom of expression and of the press, in so far as it had not been based on any concrete evidence other than his articles and statements (see paragraph 235 of the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment). Regarding the application of Article 15 of the Constitution, it referred to its findings concerning the lawfulness of his pre-trial detention (as set out in paragraphs 155-57 of its judgment \u2013 see paragraph 36 above) and held that there had also been a violation of freedom of expression and freedom of the press as enshrined in Articles 26 and 28 of the Constitution.", "39. With regard to the complaints concerning the lawfulness and duration of the applicant\u2019s detention in police custody, the Constitutional Court held that he should have brought an action under Article 141 \u00a7 1 (a) of the CCP but had refrained from doing so. Furthermore, it noted that there was no information in the application or the appended material as to whether the applicant had lodged an objection under Article 91 \u00a7 5 of the CCP against his detention in police custody. Accordingly, it declared these complaints inadmissible for failure to exhaust the appropriate remedies.", "40. As to the complaint of a lack of independence and impartiality on the part of the magistrates who had ordered the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention, the Constitutional Court dismissed it as being manifestly ill-founded, on the grounds that the magistrates were appointed by the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors and were entitled to the same constitutional safeguards as other judges.", "41. Concerning the applicant\u2019s complaint that he had had no access to the investigation file, the Constitutional Court held that he had had sufficient means available to prepare his defence to the charges against him and challenge his pre-trial detention, in view of the contents of the detailed questions put to him during questioning by the public prosecutor and the magistrate, and the overall duration of the restriction on access to the case file. Accordingly, it declared this complaint inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded.", "42. With regard to the complaint that no hearing had been held during the examination of the applicant\u2019s applications challenging his pre-trial detention, the Constitutional Court found that there was no obligation to hold a hearing on each and every objection to pre-trial detention orders and their extension, and that where a person had been able to appear before the first-instance court considering the issue of detention, the fact that there was no hearing on a subsequent appeal did not in itself contravene the Constitution since it did not breach the principle of equality of arms. The Constitutional Court noted that the applicant and his lawyer had been present at the hearing on 22 September 2016, following which the applicant had been placed in pre-trial detention. It observed that he had lodged an objection against his detention on 28 September 2016, that the objection had been dismissed on 10 October 2016 and that eighteen days had thus elapsed between his previous appearance in court and the dismissal of his objection. Taking this period into account, the Constitutional Court considered that there had been no obligation to hold a hearing during the examination of his objection, and accordingly declared this complaint likewise inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded.", "43. Lastly, with regard to the applicant\u2019s complaint that the conditions of his detention were incompatible with the prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment, the Constitutional Court observed that he had not raised this issue with the enforcement judge. Accordingly, it declared the complaint inadmissible for failure to exhaust the appropriate remedies.", "44. Having regard to its findings of violations, the Constitutional Court held that the applicant was to be awarded 20,000 Turkish liras (TRY \u2013 approximately 4,500 euros (EUR)) in respect of non-pecuniary damage and TRY 2,219.50 (approximately EUR 500) in respect of costs and expenses.", "45. As the applicant was still in pre-trial detention on the date of delivery of its judgment, the Constitutional Court decided to transmit the judgment to the Istanbul 26th Assize Court so that it could take \u201cthe necessary action\u201d.", "46. On 11 January 2018 the applicant\u2019s lawyer applied to the Istanbul 26th Assize Court for his client\u2019s release.", "47. On the same day, the Istanbul 26th Assize Court rejected the application by two votes to one, on the grounds that it had not yet received official notification of the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment. It held in addition that the summary judgment submitted by the applicant\u2019s lawyer did not contain any indication by the Constitutional Court of a measure relating to the applicant\u2019s release.", "48. In his opinion the dissenting judge stated that, in accordance with Article 153 \u00a7 6 of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgments were binding on the legislative, executive and judicial organs, the administrative authorities and natural and legal persons. Accordingly, where a violation had been found on account of a judicial decision, the relevant court was required to take the necessary action to redress the effects of the violation, pursuant to section 50(2) of Law no. 6216 on the establishment and rules of procedure of the Constitutional Court (\u201cLaw no. 6216\u201d). In his view, the only way of satisfying this requirement in the applicant\u2019s case was to order his release.", "49. On 12 January 2018 the applicant lodged an objection with a view to securing his release, submitting a copy of the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment of 11 January 2018 as published on the court\u2019s website.", "50. In a decision delivered on 15 January 2018 the Istanbul 27th Assize Court, by two votes to one, dismissed the applicant\u2019s objection and ordered the continuation of his pre-trial detention. In reaching that finding, it observed that the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment had not been published in the Official Gazette as required by Article 153 \u00a7 6 of the Constitution.", "51. In his dissenting opinion, the judge in the minority expressed the view that, since the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgments were binding and not subject to appeal, the applicant should be released pending trial without waiting for the judgment in question to be published in the Official Gazette.", "52. On 19 January 2018 the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment on the individual application lodged by the applicant was published in Official Gazette no. 20306.", "53. On the same day, the Istanbul 26th Assize Court examined of its own motion the question of the applicant\u2019s continued detention. Noting firstly that the examination of the merits of an individual application to the Constitutional Court against a judicial decision entailed determining whether there had been a violation of fundamental rights and what measures would be appropriate to put an end to the violation, and secondly that grounds of appeal on points of law could not be examined by the Constitutional Court in the context of an individual application, it found that the Constitutional Court did not have jurisdiction to assess the evidence in the case file. On that account, the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment no. 2016/23672 was not in compliance with the law. The Assize Court added that ordering the applicant\u2019s release as an automatic consequence of the judgment in question would run counter to the general principles of law, the independence of the courts, the principle that no authority could give orders or instructions to the courts, and the \u201cnatural judge\u201d principle. Lastly, by two votes to one, it ordered the continuation of the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention. In so holding, it took the following into account: the evidence before it; the large scale of the attempted military coup; the risk of the applicant\u2019s absconding; the current state of the case file; and the severity of the potential sentence in the event of a conviction.", "54. The judge who had voted in favour of the applicant\u2019s release stated in a dissenting opinion that the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgments were binding and that the Assize Court was thus required to comply with judgment no. 2016/23672. He pointed out that the only possible way for it to do so was to order the applicant\u2019s release.", "55. On 30 January 2018 the applicant lodged a further individual application with the Constitutional Court. Relying on Articles 5, 6 and 18 of the Convention, he complained mainly that he had been kept in pre-trial detention despite the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment of 11 January 2018."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1", "5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
