On 8 July 2003 the applicant was transferred to the Odessa temporary detention facility (\u0456\u0437\u043e\u043b\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0442\u0438\u043c\u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f, \u201cthe ITT\u201d).

At the hospital a general surgeon and a neurosurgeon examined the applicant and issued a medical certificate stating that he had bruising on his shoulders and hips, and extensive bruising on his head and face, but that there was no indication of brain damage. Subsequently, the applicant was taken back to the ITT but the medical officer sent him back to the hospital for an additional examination, as not all the injuries on his body had been recorded. However, the hospital doctors refused to issue a new certificate.", "15. On an unspecified date the applicant was transferred from the ITT to the Odessa pre-trial detention centre (\u0441\u043b\u0456\u0434\u0447\u0438\u0439 \u0456\u0437\u043e\u043b\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0440, \u201cthe SIZO\u201d).", "16.

On 19 December 2003 investigator I.G. refused to institute criminal proceedings into the above complaint for want of proof against the police officers. According to the investigator\u2019s decision, it was impossible to establish the circumstances in which the applicant had sustained his injuries. The investigator relied on a certificate from the SIZO, according to which at the time of the applicant\u2019s admission to the SIZO he had had no injuries, and on the ITT records of 8 July 2003 describing the applicant\u2019s injuries. The investigator stated that despite this information from the ITT, the applicant had not raised any complaints during his questioning at the ITT.

On 1 August 2005 the Court of Appeal found the applicant and his co-defendant Y.G. guilty of murder and sentenced them to life imprisonment with confiscation of their property. The court based their conviction, among other things, on the testimony of Ms V., who had seen the applicant and Y.G. before and after the murder, on fingerprints from Y.G. found at the scene of crime, on the confessions made by the applicant and Y.G. in the presence of their lawyers, and on the applicant\u2019s written confession of 2 July 2003 made in the absence of his lawyer. Commenting on the applicant\u2019s complaint of ill-treatment, the court also took into account the investigator\u2019s decision of 19 December 2003. It thus found that there was no evidence that the applicant\u2019s confession had been obtained under duress and rejected his complaint as unsubstantiated.", "28.
