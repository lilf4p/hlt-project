TURKEY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Jon Fridrik Kj\u00f8lbro;Julia Laffranque;Ledi Bianku;Paul Lemmens;Robert Spano", "TEXT": ["1. The applicant, Mr Pavlos Loizou, is a Cypriot national, who was born in 1961 and lives in Nicosia. He was represented before the Court by M. Sa\u011firo\u011flu and F. Hansel, lawyers practising in Nicosia.", "2. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.", "3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "4. The complaints raised in this application arise out of the Turkish military intervention in northern Cyprus. The general context of the property issues arising in this context is set out in the cases of Cyprus v. Turkey ([GC], no. 25781/94, \u00a7\u00a7 13-16 and 28-33, ECHR 2001 IV), and Demopoulos and Others v. Turkey (dec.) ([GC], nos. 46113/99 and 7 others, \u00a7\u00a7 4-16, ECHR 2010).", "5. Before the military intervention in northern Cyprus in 1974 the applicant\u2019s family lived in Kyrenia and owned property there. This included the family\u2019s home (\u201cplot 146\u201d), which was registered in the name of the applicant\u2019s mother, and two commercial properties, which were registered in the name of a limited company, Neocles Loizou Successors (\u201cNLS\u201d). The applicant\u2019s parents were the sole shareholders in NLS. According to NLS\u2019s articles of association, the two commercial properties were to be distributed between the applicant and his two brothers if their parents, the shareholders, so wished.", "6. The first of the two commercial properties, plot 213, was a groundfloor dwelling which the applicant\u2019s father planned to turn into a supermarket. The second, plot 233, was a supermarket which was in operation until the military intervention began.", "7. When his mother died in 1990, the applicant\u2019s father decided to transfer all three properties (that is to say, the dwelling house and the two commercial properties) to the applicant and his brothers.", "8. On 6 August 1999 the NLS company, which had in the meantime ceased to be operational, was struck off the relevant register of companies.", "9. On 28 January 2003 the applicant, his father and his two brothers lodged an application with the Court, alleging violations of Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 arising from their inability to access their three properties (application no. 4758/03). On 14 December 2010 a Single Judge of the Court declared their application inadmissible because it had been lodged before the domestic remedy available via the IPC had been exhausted and therefore had to be rejected for nonexhaustion of domestic remedies.", "10. On 3 December 2010 the applicant\u2019s brothers transferred their shares in the properties to the applicant, making him the sole owner of all of them.", "11. The transfer of the ownership of the properties in question is substantiated by certificates showing the history of ownership issued by the Department of Lands and Surveys of the Republic of Cyprus.", "12. On 23 September 2011 the applicant filed an application, supported by an affidavit, with the IPC under Law no. 67/2005 (see paragraphs 32-33 below) claiming compensation for all three properties in the amount of 4,700,000 pounds sterling (GBP) and GBP 7,100,000 for the loss of their use. In support of his claim the applicant provided certificates issued by the Land Registry and Surveys Department of the Republic of Cyprus attesting that he was the owner of the properties in question. In the affidavit, the applicant stated that his father had owned the properties in 1974 and that there was no mortgage, restriction or other liability on the properties.", "13. The applicant\u2019s claim was communicated to the \u201cTRNC\u201d Attorney General as provided under Law no. 67/2005 and the relevant IPC Rules (see paragraphs 32-35 below).", "14. In a letter dated 22 December 2011 the applicant contended that the \u201cTRNC\u201d Attorney General had failed to provide an opinion concerning his claim within the thirty-day time-limit set out in the relevant provisions on the functioning of the IPC. He argued that the IPC should adopt a default decision on the basis of his claim.", "15. At a meeting before the IPC on 10 April 2012 the \u201cTRNC\u201d Attorney General\u2019s representative stated that he had still not received a report concerning the properties that were being claimed by the applicant and he was therefore not in a position to provide an opinion.", "16. Further meetings before the IPC scheduled for 12 June and 16 October 2012 were adjourned for the same reason.", "17. Meanwhile, the applicant instructed a law firm to represent him in the proceedings before the IPC.", "18. On 7 October 2013 the \u201cTRNC\u201d Attorney General submitted his opinion concerning the applicant\u2019s claim. The opinion relied on an affidavit by the \u201cTRNC\u201d Director of the Land Registry and Surveys Department which stated that \u2212 according to their information \u2212 plots 213 and 233 had been owned by the NLS company in 1974, and plot 146 by Elli Kika Loizou (the applicant\u2019s mother). In the opinion the view was also expressed that the applicant\u2019s claim was excessive.", "19. At a directions hearing on 6 November 2013 the applicant\u2019s representative undertook to provide photographs of the properties and asked the \u201cTRNC\u201d Attorney General to provide the relevant land registry search documents for the properties in question. The \u201cTRNC\u201d Attorney General\u2019s representative asked the applicant to provide birth certificates for him and his parents, certificates from the head of the local community (mukhtar) attesting that the persons who owned the properties in 1974 were the applicant\u2019s parents, and documents concerning the history of ownership of the properties after 1974 and attesting that there were no liabilities attaching to them.", "20. The applicant\u2019s representative produced the requested documents on 24 December 2013.", "21. At a preliminary hearing before the IPC on 20 November 2014, the \u201cTRNC\u201d Attorney General\u2019s representative and the Housing Undersecretary informed the applicant and the IPC that no offer would be made in respect of the family house (plot 146) unless the claims made in respect of the two commercial properties (plots 213 and 233) were withdrawn. The applicant\u2019s representatives stated that they were trying to find a solution with the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities concerning issues relating to companies and mortgages. They therefore asked for a month\u2019s adjournment in order to monitor developments on the matter and stated that if a solution was not reached they would withdraw the request relating to the two commercial properties.", "22. At a meeting before the IPC on 8 January 2015 the applicant\u2019s representative explained that they were working on the amendments of the relevant law with the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities and asked for a further adjournment of the examination of the case.", "23. A further meeting before the IPC was held on 19 February 2015 at which the applicant was also present. His representative asked for an adjournment, explaining that some additional documents needed to be provided and that there was no progress with the amendment of the relevant law. He also stated that the applicant would withdraw the claim with regard to the commercial properties.", "24. On 20 February 2015 the applicant\u2019s representatives forwarded further necessary documents to the IPC.", "25. On 23 February 2015 the applicant\u2019s representatives submitted a letter to the IPC stating that, without prejudice, they were withdrawing the applicant\u2019s claim in respect of the two commercial properties (plots nos. 213 and 233). They explained that before 1974 the two properties had been registered as the property of a company whose shareholders were the applicant\u2019s parents. Thereafter, the company had terminated its activities and its properties had been transferred to the shareholders\u2019 children (the applicant and his brothers). Later, the company had been liquidated and now no longer existed as a legal entity. The applicant\u2019s representatives also submitted that as the transfer of properties had occurred after 1974 and as the relationship between the applicant and the company was not defined as one of legal succession within the meaning of Law no. 67/2005, the legislation did not provide the applicant with the possibility of submitting a claim for compensation for that property before the IPC. They considered that this was the reason why the \u201cTRNC\u2019s\u201d representative had refused to make an offer for the compensation claim unless the two commercial properties were withdrawn. Lastly, they argued that their decision to withdraw the claim was in line with the \u201cTRNC\u201d High Administrative Court\u2019s practice in similar cases (see paragraphs 37-38 below), which showed that the IPC could not be considered as a remedy in relation to a claim concerning the two commercial properties.", "26. At a meeting before the IPC on 16 April 2015, at which the applicant was also present, his representatives asked for an adjournment of the proceedings in order to consider a settlement offer in the amount of GBP 190,000 made by the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities.", "27. On 17 April 2015 the applicant\u2019s representatives informed the IPC that he would accept the offer.", "28. On the same day a meeting was held before the IPC at which the \u201cTRNC\u201d representatives noted that the applicant had withdrawn the claim in respect of the two commercial properties (plots nos. 213 and 233) and reiterated their offer to pay GBP 190,000 in respect of the applicant\u2019s claim concerning the family house (plot 146), which the applicant\u2019s representatives accepted. On the basis of the parties\u2019 settlement, the IPC adopted a decision ordering the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities to pay the aforementioned amount to the applicant in respect of his claim concerning the family house.", "29. On 24 March 2016 compensation in the amount of GBP 190,000 was paid to the applicant.", "30. Article 159 \u00a7 1 (b) and (c), in so far as relevant, provide as follows:", "\u201c(b) All immovable properties, buildings and installations which were found abandoned on 13 February 1975 when the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus was proclaimed or which were considered by law as abandoned or ownerless after the above-mentioned date, or which should have been in the possession or control of the public even though their ownership had not yet been determined ... and (c) ... shall be the property of the TRNC notwithstanding the fact that they are not so registered in the books of the Land Registry Office; and the Land Registry Office shall be amended accordingly.\u201d", "31.

The plaintiff argued that, since she owned the immovable property as a company shareholder, the IPC should have ruled in her favour.", "38.

Viewing the undisputed facts and evidence before us, it can be seen that the owner of the immovable subject matter made up of 14 plots is AkinitaMeleagrous Ltd. The plaintiff has put forward that AkinitaMeleagrous is a family business, she is a shareholder of this company, the aforementioned properties were registered in her name due to this capacity, and these matters should have been taken into account by giving a ruling in favour of restitution.", "The registered owner of the aforementioned properties on 20/7/1974, AkinitaMeleagrous Ltd., is a company with a legal personality. The aforementioned company continues its legal entity despite having stopped its activities because it has not been struck off the register.", "The fact that the company transferred the properties it owned to other persons, even if these persons were its shareholders, does not affect the legal status in sections 2 and 6(2) of the law.
