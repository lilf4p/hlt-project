On 6 June 2001 the Taganskiy District Court of Moscow found Yar. guilty of fraud and sentenced him to five years\u2019 imprisonment and confiscation of property. In particular, the court established that Yar., acting in concert with other persons, whose identity was not known, had fraudulently acquired R.\u2019s flat and sold it to the applicant on the basis of a forged will. The judgment became final on 25 July 2001.", "14. On 5 March 2002 the prosecutor brought a civil claim on behalf of the Department for Housing of the City of Moscow (the \u201cHousing Department\u201d) seeking (1) the annulment of R.\u2019s will and of the applicant\u2019s title to the flat; (2) the applicant\u2019s eviction; (3) restitution of the flat to the City of Moscow; and (4) annulment of the purchase agreement between Yar. and the applicant, and the reimbursement by Yar. of the amount the applicant had paid for the flat.", "15.

As regards the applicant\u2019s counterclaim, the court recognised that she had bought the flat in good faith. However, it found that because Yar. had acquired R.\u2019s flat fraudulently, he had, in fact, stolen it from the City of Moscow and the latter had the right to reclaim the flat from the applicant, despite the fact that she was a bona fide purchaser.", "19.
