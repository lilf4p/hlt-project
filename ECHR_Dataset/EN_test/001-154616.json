The applicant, Mr Jude Kasangaki, is a Ugandan national, who was born in 1977 and lives in Dronten. He was represented before the Court by Mr G.J. Dijkman, a lawyer practising in Utrecht.", "2.", "3. On 19 February 2010 the applicant lodged a request for asylum.", "4. On 12 October 2011 the Minister for Immigration, Integration and Asylum Policy (Minister voor Immigratie, Integratie en Asiel) gave a decision rejecting the applicant\u2019s request as lacking an established basis in fact. This constituted a return decision (terugkeerbesluit).", "5. The applicant lodged an appeal (beroep).", "6. The Regional Court held a hearing on 24 January 2012. It sat in a formation consisting of a single judge, Judge L.", "7. On 30 October 2012 the Regional Court (rechtbank) of The Hague, sitting in Zwolle, gave a decision dismissing the appeal. The decision states that it was given by two judges, Judge L. and Judge S. It was signed by Judge S. and the registrar (griffier).", "8. The applicant lodged a further appeal (hoger beroep) with the Administrative Jurisdiction Division (Afdeling bestuursrechtspraak) of the Council of State (Raad van State) (hereafter \u201cthe Administrative Jurisdiction Division\u201d). In addition to challenging the decision of the Regional Court on substantive grounds, he submitted a ground of appeal to the effect that the Regional Court had given its decision in a different composition than that which had held the hearing, and an illegal two-judge composition at that.", "9. On 26 March 2013 the Regional Court informed the Administrative Jurisdiction Division at its request that the hearing had been presided over by Judge L. and that Judge L. and the registrar had discussed the case together. However, circumstances had led to the decision that the case should be further dealt with by Judge S. Judge S. and the registrar had discussed the case in private. The parties had not been informed of this development except through the decision in issue.", "10. The Administrative Jurisdiction Division gave its decision on 18 April 2013. Noting that neither party had assented to the replacement of Judge L. without a new hearing and the decision had been signed by a different judge than the one who had presided over the hearing, it allowed the appeal without going into any of the other grounds, quashed the decision of the Regional Court and remitted the case for rehearing.", "11. The Court has not been informed of the outcome of any subsequent proceedings.", "12. On 29 November 2012, the applicant\u2019s appeal having been dismissed by the Regional Court, the applicant was questioned by a police officer. The official record drawn up by the latter includes the following:", "\u201cI [the police officer] gave the alien the requisite information. He stated: I have had discussions with the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (Immigratie- en naturalisatiedienst; \u2018IND\u2019) and with my lawyer Mr Gerben Dijkman. I know that I am to leave the Netherlands. My lawyer has lodged an appeal. That was dismissed. I know that I should have left the Netherlands on 30 October 2012. My lawyer has told me that I had 28 days after 30 October 2012 to leave the Netherlands. I had an appointment yesterday to discuss this. I was collected today from the asylum seekers\u2019 centre in Almere. I have no work. I have lived at the asylum seekers\u2019 centre continuously. I had food and drink there and I could sleep there. I have no money. I have no residence permit for any other European country. I have no relatives in the Netherlands or any other European country. I receive medication against stress and nightmares. I have no business interests in the Netherlands or any other European country.", "I asked the alien whether he had understood me. He stated that he had understood me and understands what I have told him.", "I have told him that I am placing him in aliens\u2019 detention (vreemdelingenbewaring) because I do not trust him to leave the Netherlands, considering that he had 28 days to leave the Netherlands after 30 October 2012 and today is Thursday 29 November 2012. The alien had no satisfactory explanation for this. He did not wish to contact the Ugandan embassy or consulate.\u201d", "13. The police officer, acting in the name of the Deputy Minister for Security and Justice (Staatssecretaris van Veiligheid en Justitie, by this time the successor to the Minister for Immigration, Integration and Asylum Policy), ordered the applicant taken into aliens\u2019 detention pursuant to section 59(1), introductory sentence and sub a, of the Aliens Act 2000 ((Vreemdelingenwet 2000), see below). According to the decision (a tick-box form), the measure was required by:", "\u201cthe interests of public order because", "there is a danger that the person concerned will evade supervision", "the person concerned is evading or impeding the preparation of his departure or the expulsion procedure;", "which is borne out by the facts or circumstances that the alien", "has previously received a visa, decision, information note or order from which the duty to leave the Netherlands is apparent and he has not done so of his own accord within the time-limit implied therein or set for that purpose;", "has no fixed abode;", "has no adequate means of subsistence[.]\u201d", "14. On various occasions the applicant was invited to cooperate in obtaining the requisite Ugandan travel documents and leave the country voluntarily. Each time he refused.", "15. The applicant lodged an appeal against the detention order with the Regional Court (section 94(1) of the Aliens Act 2000; see below), which, having held a hearing on 10 December 2012, gave a decision on 17 December 2012 finding that the applicant\u2019s detention was lawful. The applicant lodged a further appeal against this decision with the Administrative Jurisdiction Division, which was dismissed on 25 January 2013.", "16. The applicant lodged two more appeals with the Regional Court of The Hague challenging his continued detention. The applicant sought his release on the ground that there was no realistic prospect of his actually being expelled. Decisions continuing the applicant\u2019s detention were given on 29 January 2013 and 12 March 2013.", "17. The applicant lodged a fourth appeal, invoking the same ground, on 10 April 2013.", "18. A hearing took place on 23 April 2013 before the Regional Court of The Hague, sitting in Utrecht. Neither the applicant nor the Deputy Minister attended. On the same day the Deputy Minister informed the Regional Court by fax that the detention measure had been lifted.", "19. Invited to comment, the applicant\u2019s representative replied by fax the following day that he wished to continue the proceedings in order to claim damages under section 106 of the Aliens Act 2000 (see below). He argued that the applicant\u2019s detention had become retrospectively unlawful as a result of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division\u2019s decision of 18 April 2013 (see above).", "20. On 4 June 2013 the Regional Court gave a decision dismissing the appeal. Its reasoning included the following:", "\u201cThe Regional Court considers that the fact that the decision of the Regional Court, sitting in Zwolle, of 30 October 2012 was overturned by the Administrative Jurisdiction Division and [the case] was remitted to the Regional Court does not mean that the continuation of the detention was unlawful at the time. The circumstance that in retrospect the asylum proceedings were in the appeal stage at the time of the period of detention in issue and the effect of the decision of the [Deputy Minister] was suspended constitutes, in the opinion of the Regional Court, only a temporary impediment. Moreover, there appear to be no reasons to believe that the appeal will not be decided in the foreseeable future (binnen afzienbare tijd). Already for this reason the Regional Court cannot follow the [applicant]\u2019s arguments on this point. [The Deputy Minister] has lifted the measure of detention because of the decision of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of 19 April 2013 and after having consulted this Regional Court, sitting in Zwolle. The Regional Court takes the view that the Deputy Minister] should be allowed a little time to consider the follow-up steps to be taken. [Since the detention was terminated] five days (including three working days) after the [Administrative Jurisdiction Division]\u2019s decision the Regional Court sees no reason to hold that the detention was unlawful before 23 April 2013.\u201d", "21. No further appeal lay against this decision.", "22. Administrative cases brought before the Regional Court shall normally be dealt with by a single-judge chamber (enkelvoudige kamer, section 8:10(1) of the General Administrative Law Act (Algemene wet bestuursrecht)), which may refer them to the multi-judge chamber (meervoudige kamer, section 8:10(2)).", "23. Save as otherwise provided, a multi-judge chamber of a jurisdictional body shall consist of three judges (section 6(2) of the Judiciary (Organisation) Act (Wet op de rechterlijke organisatie)).", "24. The relevant substantive provisions are the following:", "\u201c1.

An alien\u2019s detention shall not occur, or shall be terminated, as soon as he expresses the wish to leave the Netherlands and the opportunity to do so exists.", "5. ... detention pursuant to the first paragraph shall not be of longer duration than six months.", "6. In derogation from the fifth paragraph ... detention pursuant to the first paragraph may be extended by no more than twelve months if it is apparent that despite all reasonable efforts expulsion will take longer because of the alien\u2019s failure to cooperate in his expulsion or the documents from third countries necessary for that purpose are still missing. ...\u201d", "\u201c1. If the Regional Court orders the lifting of a measure entailing deprivation of liberty, or the deprivation of liberty is lifted before the request for its lifting is considered, it may award the alien compensation at the expense of the State.

Our [competent] Minister shall notify the Regional Court of a decision to impose deprivation of liberty as referred to in [section 59] no later than the twenty-eighth day after communication of the decision, unless the alien himself has lodged an appeal first. As soon as the Regional Court has received the notification, the alien shall be deemed to have lodged an appeal against the said decision imposing deprivation of liberty. The appeal shall also constitute a request for the award of damages.", "2. The Regional Court shall set the date for the examination of the appeal at the hearing immediately. The hearing shall take place no later than the fourteenth day after the notice of appeal or the notification, as the case may be, is received. The Regional Court shall summon the alien to appear either in person or represented by an authorised representative, and the competent Minister to appear represented by an authorised representative, in order to be heard.

If the Regional Court finds on appeal that the application or implementation of the decision [to impose deprivation of liberty] is contrary to this Act or is \u2013 on consideration of all the interests involved \u2013 not reasonably justified, it shall accept the appeal. In such a case the Regional Court shall order that the deprivation of liberty be terminated or the manner of its implementation altered.", "5.

The Regional Court shall give its decision orally or in writing. If in writing, the decision shall be given no later than seven days after the closure of the examination of the appeal. In derogation of section 8:66 of the General Administrative Law Act, [this time-limit] cannot be extended.", "3. If the Regional Court in considering the appeal finds that the imposition or execution of the measure is contrary to this Act or not reasonably justified on a balance of all the interests involved, it shall declare the appeal well-founded. In that case the Regional Court shall order the lifting of the measure or a change in the way in which it is executed. \u201d", "26. On 21 March 2011 the Administrative Jurisdiction Division gave a decision (no. 201100307/1/V3, ECLI:NL:RVS:2011:BP9280) in which it held inter alia that although there was a close interconnection between the return decision on the one hand and an order of aliens\u2019 detention on the other, joint consideration of the two in a single appeal was possible only if both were included in a single decision. If the return decision was given separately, then the system of legal remedies provided by the Aliens Act 2000 prevented the competent administrative tribunal from considering the lawfulness of the return decision together with the order of aliens\u2019 detention. In the latter event, it was only if the return decision was held to be unlawful in the dedicated proceedings that the tribunal called upon to consider the lawfulness of the aliens\u2019 detention could be faced with the question what consequences might result for the lawfulness of aliens\u2019 detention. This did not mean that the alien was denied a legal remedy in this respect, since the lawfulness of the return decision could be challenged in separate administrative proceedings and the possibility existed to seek an order for a provisional measure from the provisional measures judge (voorzieningenrechter) if need be.", "27. On 14 May 2012 the Administrative Jurisdiction Division gave a decision (no. 201200935/1/V3, ECLI:NL:RVS:2012:BW6197) in which it held obiter dictum that if a return decision was annulled on the ground that it was unlawful, then any aliens\u2019 detention ordered in pursuance of that decision became retrospectively unlawful and entitled the alien concerned to compensation under section 106 of the Alien\u2019s Act notwithstanding any previous judicial decision finding the detention to be lawful.
