He was also the chief editor of a monthly newspaper, Pravo-Zashchita (Protection of Rights), with a circulation of 5,000. The newspaper was published and distributed mainly in the Nizhniy Novgorod Region. At the end of each issue there was a standard disclaimer stating that the views of the editorial team might not concur with those expressed in the articles published.", "7. In early 2004 the applicant obtained two articles from the website Chechenpress. The first, which had the headline \u201cAddress by Akhmed Zakayev, Vice Prime Minister of the Government of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, to the People of Russia\u201d(\u00ab\u041e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u0446\u0435-\u043f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0427\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0418\u0447\u043a\u0435\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0410\u0445\u043c\u0435\u0434\u0430 \u0417\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u043a \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u00bb \u2013 \u201cthe first article\u201d), was published by him in issue no. 1 (58) of Pravo-Zashchita for March 2004. It read as follows:", "\u201cA year ago a peace process that had just begun was interrupted by the tragic events in the Dubrovka [theatre]. There may be long arguments as to who was responsible for that tragedy, but there is no dispute as to who benefited from it.", "Today, on behalf of Aslan Maskhadov, President of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, I am again addressing myself to the people of Russia. It is still not too late for us to resolve all the questions at issue. But for this, the people of Russia should get rid of those for whom peace represents the loss of power or perhaps even a trial. As long as they remain in the Kremlin, blood will continue to flow in Chechnya and in Russia.", "I am extending to the people of Russia the hand of peace over the head of their president. No one needs the war except for him: neither right nor left, neither poor nor rich. Vladimir Putin left the Chechens no choice, but you have a choice and you may still choose peace by voting against Putin in March 2004. Both for you and for us this is a real opportunity.\u201d", "8. The article was accompanied by the editorial team\u2019s comments (\u043e\u0442 \u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0438), which read as follows:", "\u201cFor reasons beyond the editorial team\u2019s control, we are publishing this document belatedly. This address was made on the eve of the presidential elections in Russia. Unfortunately, the people of Russia did not avail themselves of their historic opportunity, having again elected as their president a man who has made political capital out of a bloody war against his own people and who is leading the country towards the blind alley of a police state. Nevertheless, we are convinced that this document, which represents the legitimate Chechen authorities\u2019 statement to the outside world, has not lost its topicality in the meantime\u201d.", "9. The second article, which had the headline \u201cAddress by Maskhadov, President of the Chechen Republic Ichkeria, to the European Parliament\u201d (\u00ab\u041e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0427\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0418\u0447\u043a\u0435\u0440\u0438\u044f \u041c\u0430\u0441\u0445\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u043a \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0440\u043b\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0443\u00bb \u2013 \u201cthe second article\u201d), was published by the applicant in issue no. 2 (59) of Pravo-Zashchita for April and May 2004 and read as follows:", "\u201cOn 26 February 2004 the Parliament of the European Union adopted a declaration in which Stalin\u2019s deportation of the Chechen people on 23 February 1944 was officially recognised as an act of genocide. The European Parliament also recommended that the European Council study the plan of the Government of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria (the CRI) on peaceful resolution of the present military conflict [between Russia and Chechnya], which I had approved.", "The total deportation to Central Asia and Kazakhstan in 1944 is one of the most tragic pages in the entire centuries-old history of the Chechens, since during this act of violence the national republic was completely liquidated and its territory separated among the adjacent regions. During the 13 years which the Chechen people spent in exile, about 70% of the population died.", "It must be mentioned that the 1944 deportation was the ninth large-scale act of genocide by the military and political authorities of Imperial Russia during the period of the 400-year-long armed confrontation between the Chechens and Russians.", "The very first deportation of the Chechens was carried out by Russia as early as in 1792, after the destruction of the State headed by the first Imam of the Caucasus, Sheikh Mansur. And after the destruction of the State headed by Imam Shamil, when the Russian-Caucasian war was officially declared to be over in 1859, a considerable proportion of Chechens ended up on the territory of the Ottoman Empire.", "The last tsarist deportation was the expulsion of many Chechen families to cold and faraway Siberia in 1913. And the first mass deportations of the Chechens during the Soviet regime began in the years of collectivisation and cultural revolution, in other words during Stalin\u2019s regime.", "What is the aim of this historical overview? The Government of the CRI regards this political resolution by the European Parliament as an undoubtedly serious historic act on the way to achieving the long-awaited peace on blood-stained Chechen soil. More than a quarter of a million innocent civilians have already died in the CRI during the latest continuing Russian-Chechen war, the entire infrastructure of the republic has been completely devastated, many towns, villages, schools, hospitals and cultural facilities have been destroyed, and there is still no light at the end of the tunnel.", "Yet the international community is watching the deliberate and systematic murder of the entire nation with complete serenity and has not the slightest desire to react in any way to this criminal madness by the bloody Kremlin regime. This in turn engenders thousands and thousands of new fighters in the republic, who replenish the ranks of the Chechen Resistance with fresh forces each day, and who believe that they have a moral right to use the enemy\u2019s own methods against the enemy, [an approach] which we unequivocally condemn.", "Even on this mournful date \u2013 the 60th anniversary of the deportation \u2013 many Chechens marked the occasion in extremely harsh conditions of unmotivated mass murders, extrajudicial executions, groundless detentions, severe \u2018clear-up\u2019 operations, tortures, kidnappings, disappearances and \u2018residential\u2019 checks by Russia\u2019s invaders and their accomplices, who have been committing excesses in the territory of the CRI for the past five years.", "As the legitimately elected President of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, I express, on behalf of the recalcitrant Chechen people fighting for their freedom, sincere gratitude to all the members of the European Parliament who took this fundamental decision to recognise the deportation of 1944 as an act of genocide...", "Today, just as 60 years ago, the new global Russia\u2019s terror has become our national tragedy. Its inexorable millstones are grinding the gene pool of the unique and original Chechen people, one of the indigenous nations of the ancient Caucasus, and this in the end may lead to [the Chechens\u2019] total physical disappearance from the face of the earth.", "Your decision in defence of the Chechen people, living in a situation of ongoing genocide, is an additional moral incentive in the fight for survival. We are always open to constructive dialogue with the international community, and we invite independent experts from the United Nations and the European Union to monitor the situation with their own eyes, so that the groundless and defamatory attacks on the Chechens by Russia\u2019s propagandists, who insolently continue to pester the PACE, OSCE and other authoritative organisations, can no longer distort the real picture in the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria.", "There is no doubt that the Kremlin is today the centre of international terrorism, and [the Kremlin] selected Chechnya and the Chechens as targets for testing terrorist methods which are being developed by the [Federal Security Service]. It would be naive to believe that the present regime in Russia would be too shy to use its terrorist experience in the international arena to solve its political and other problems. An example of this is the treacherous and cowardly terrorist attack by Russia\u2019s special services in the State of Qatar, which prematurely took the life of my predecessor, Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, and was carried out with the use of diplomatic channels.", "Owing to the wide publicity given to the latest events concerning the Khanbiyev family, you have become witnesses to one of the numerous terrorist methods used by the State party of Russia, notably taking hostages from the civilian population. In the majority of cases, hostages disappear without trace, and their bodies, showing traces of torture, are later discovered in secret graves that can be found all across the territory of Chechnya.", "The genocide of the Chechen people, which continues in the 21st century, is a direct and impertinent challenge to all of progressive mankind, let alone civilised and democratic Europe, which considers human rights as its main value and priority, thus making the human factor of paramount importance and the most valuable achievement of civilisation.", "We would therefore like to believe that the Chechen people have a right to hope that you will soon recognise the war which the Putin regime imposed on Chechnya as genocide \u2013 a war which, in its scale, refinement, vandalism and inhumanity, overshadows the genocide of 1944.", "I sincerely believe in the triumph of reason and justice on earth, and in the final victory of the Chechen people. The bright day is near when the sacred Chechen soil will be completely cleansed of the countless hordes of Russia\u2019s invaders and their accomplices among local nation-traitors. The Chechen Resistance will inevitably accomplish it! Whatever the costs! No one in the world should have any doubt about this!\u201d", "10. On 28 November 2004 an officer from the prosecutor\u2019s office of the Nizhniy Novgorod Region (\u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430 \u041d\u0438\u0436\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u2013 \u201cthe regional prosecutor\u2019s office\u201d) reported that he had established that the articles written by unidentified authors contained public appeals to extremist activity \u2013 most notably to overthrow the State regime and forcibly change fundamental aspects of Russia\u2019s constitutional system.", "11. The applicant was interviewed in connection with his publication of the articles. He stated that he supported the assessment given by Akhmed Zakayev in his article of the role of Mr V. V. Putin, the President of Russia, in the history of Russia over the last several years. He also stated that he strongly supported his appeal to stop the war and to resolve the military conflict in the Chechen Republic in a peaceful political way, having made a commentary to that effect after the article. As regards the second article, the applicant explained that he had considered the material to be of great public importance for the people of Russia so had published it. He added that he had intended to convey to the readers the position of the leaders of one of the parties to the military conflict in the Chechen Republic as he had considered that, in the light of the continuing tragedy in the Northern Caucasus and terrorist threat, citizens should be entitled to have an idea of that position first hand rather than having the situation presented to them by Russia\u2019s mass media, which only reflected the point of view of the authorities of Russia.", "12. On 11 January 2005 the regional prosecutor\u2019s office instituted criminal proceedings under Article 280 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code (public appeals to extremist activity through the mass media). The applicant was questioned on several occasions as a witness.", "13. In reports dated 18 February 2005 Ms T., a linguistic expert, stated that the articles in question contained no appeals to extremist activity but rather were aimed at inciting racial, ethnic and social discord (\u0440\u043e\u0437\u043d\u044c), associated with violence (see paragraphs 20-27 below). Following that conclusion, the authorities decided to conduct a further investigation under Article 282 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code (incitement to hatred (\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044c) or enmity (\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430) and the humiliation of human dignity).", "14. In a witness interview on 25 April 2005 the applicant stated, inter alia, that he had published the two articles as he had considered the material to be of great public significance and had intended to apprise readers in the Nizhniy Novgorod Region of them. He had not pursued any other aim. He also stated that he had taken the decision to publish the articles, without being asked by anyone. In his opinion, the articles were decent and reflected their authors\u2019 point of view. He disagreed with the conclusions of the expert reports of 18 February 2005 that the articles contained statements aimed at inciting enmity between the Russians and the Chechens, or statements humiliating the human dignity of the Russians on the grounds of their ethnic origin. He also affirmed his principal position regarding that issue, namely that the actions of the Government of Russia and its armed forces during the conflict in the Chechen Republic should be regarded as a war crime and a crime against mankind. The applicant further stated that he had considered that the publication of the articles promoted friendship and peace between the people of Russia and the Chechen people. Lastly, he denied that he had obtained any payment for publishing the articles. During subsequent interviews the applicant consistently maintained his position.", "15. By a decision of 5 May 2005 the investigator in charge suspended the proceedings as those responsible remained unidentified. The decision referred to the statements the applicant had made during witness interviews to the effect that he had obtained the impugned documents from a website and published them with a view to apprising readers in the Nizhniy Novgorod Region of them. The decision further stated that no evidence capable of refuting the applicant\u2019s arguments had been obtained during the investigation. It went on to say that there was evidence of a crime under Article 282 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code in the actions of those who had published the documents online; however, since they remained unidentified the investigation had to be suspended.", "16. The decision of 5 May 2005 was quashed by a deputy prosecutor of the regional prosecutor\u2019s office and the proceedings were resumed on 9 July 2005.", "17. On 2 September 2005 the applicant was formally charged under Article 282 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code and banned from leaving his place of residence. On the same date the investigator in charge refused a request by him for another linguistic expert examination of the articles, stating that the conclusions in the reports of 18 February 2005 were well-reasoned and consistent.", "18. By a decision of 26 September 2005 the investigator in charge refused a request by the applicant for a comprehensive expert examination of the articles involving linguistic experts and historians including the history, culture and traditions of the Chechen people. The grounds for the refusal were similar to those stated in the decision of 2 September 2005.", "19. On 29 September 2005 an indictment was served on the applicant and the case file was sent for trial.", "20. In the context of the criminal proceedings against the applicant, the investigating authorities ordered a linguistic expert examination of the articles published by him. An expert was requested to answer whether they contained any appeals to extremist activity and, in particular, whether there were any appeals to activity aimed at advocating the exceptionality, supremacy or inferiority of citizens on the grounds of their racial, ethnic or social origin. The expert was also requested to reply whether the articles contained statements aimed at inciting hatred or enmity or humiliating the dignity of an individual or a group of individuals on the grounds of their race, ethnic origin, language, origin, attitude towards religion, or membership of a certain social group.", "21. On 18 February 2005 Ms T. drew up two expert reports. In a report on the linguistic expert examination of the first article, she pointed out that the text contained statements in the affirmative to the effect that \u201cthe tragedy in the Dubrovka [theatre] and the war in Chechnya [were] beneficial for Vladimir Putin\u201d, that \u201cthe cessation of war and a peace agreement with the leaders of the [Chechen Republic of Ichkeria meant] the loss of power for V. Putin\u201d, and that \u201cuntil V. Putin [guided] the State, blood [would] continue to flow in Chechnya and Russia\u201d. The report then referred to the following statement:", "\u201cIt is still not too late for us to resolve all the questions at issue. But for this, the people of Russia should get rid of those for whom peace represents the loss of power or perhaps even a trial. As long as they remain in the Kremlin, blood will continue to flow in Chechnya and in Russia.\u201d", "According to the report, that statement, analysed in the context of the whole article, contained a demand by the author to the people of Russia not to vote for Vladimir Putin in March 2004. It went on to note that the author was also promising that, otherwise, killings and terrorist acts would be carried out in Chechnya and in Russia (\u201cblood will continue to flow...\u201d), verbally threatening the people of Russia. On the basis of that analysis, Ms T. concluded that the above-mentioned statement was aimed at inciting racial, ethnic or social discord, associated with violence. The report provided no further details in respect of that conclusion. It also stated that the article contained no appeals to extremist activity or any statements aimed at advocating the exceptionality and supremacy of the Chechens on the grounds of their ethnic origin.", "22. The other report of 18 February 2005 concerned a linguistic expert examination of the second article and stated that the following statements were aimed at inciting racial, ethnic and social hostility, associated with violence:", "\u201c...the 1944 deportation was the ninth large-scale act of genocide by the military and political authorities of Imperial Russia...\u201d", "\u201cThe very first deportation of the Chechens was carried out by Russia as early as in 1792...\u201d", "\u201cMore than a quarter of a million innocent civilians have already died in the [Chechen Republic of Ichkeria] (the CRI) during the latest continuing Russian-Chechen war...\u201d", "\u201c...the international community ... has not the slightest desire to react in any way to this criminal madness by the bloody Kremlin regime...\u201d", "\u201c...the 60th anniversary of the deportation ... many Chechens marked ... in extremely harsh conditions of unmotivated mass murders, extrajudicial executions, groundless detentions, severe \u2018clear-up\u2019 operations, tortures, kidnappings, disappearances and \u2018residential\u2019 checks by Russia\u2019s invaders and their accomplices, who have been committing excesses in the territory of the CRI for the past five years...\u201d", "\u201cToday, just as 60 years ago, the new global Russia\u2019s terror has become our national tragedy. Its inexorable millstones are grinding the gene pool of the unique and original Chechen people...\u201d", "\u201c...we invite independent experts from the United Nations and the European Union to monitor the situation with their own eyes, so that the groundless and defamatory attacks on the Chechens by Russia\u2019s propagandists... can no longer distort the real picture in the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria...\u201d", "\u201cThere is no doubt that the Kremlin is today the centre of international terrorism, and [the Kremlin] selected Chechnya and the Chechens as targets for testing terrorist methods which are being developed by the [Federal Security Service]...\u201d", "\u201cIt would be naive to believe that the present regime in Russia would be too shy to use its terrorist experience in the international arena to solve its political and other problems...\u201d", "\u201cAn example of this is the treacherous and cowardly terrorist attack by Russia\u2019s special services in the State of Qatar, which prematurely took the life of ... Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev...\u201d", "\u201c...you have become witnesses to one of the numerous terrorist methods used by the State party of Russia, notably taking hostages from the civilian population...\u201d", "\u201cWe would therefore like to believe that the Chechen people have a right to hope that you will soon recognise the war which the Putin regime imposed on Chechnya as genocide...\u201d", "\u201cThe bright day is near when the sacred Chechen soil will be completely cleansed of the countless hordes of Russia\u2019s invaders and their accomplices...\u201d", "23. The report stated that in all those statements the author of the article was directly pointing out that it was Russia and its invaders, military and political authorities, special services and State party who were carrying out \u201cgenocide\u201d, \u201cunmotivated mass murders, extrajudicial executions, groundless detentions, severe \u2018clear-up\u2019 operations, tortures, kidnappings, disappearances and \u2018residential\u2019 checks\u201d, and that it was they who were \u201ccommitting excesses\u201d. It also indicated that \u201cthe expression \u2018State party [of Russia]\u2019 should be understood to mean a designation of a group of people, organisation or State set in contrast in some aspect to another group of people, organisation or State (in the present case, to Chechnya)\u201d.", "24. The report also pointed out that the last three sentences of the articles were exclamatory and expressed the author\u2019s contemptuous and angry attitude. According to the report, the three sentences were \u201can undisputable and unequivocal statement to the effect that the Chechen Resistance [would] inevitably liberate their soil of Russia\u2019s servicemen\u201d. The report went on to state that the expression \u201cWhatever the costs!\u201d referred to the means and methods (\u201cto use the enemy\u2019s own methods against the enemy\u201d, \u201cterrorist methods\u201d), and that it was of little importance whether those methods were condemned by the author or not, as the author\u2019s \u201cprotective reservation\u201d \u201cto use the enemy\u2019s own methods against the enemy, [an approach] which we unequivocally condemn\u201d did not change the true meaning of the aforementioned expression.", "25. T. also considered it necessary to note that the article contained a number of statements with contemptuous, angry stylistic connotations expressing a distinctly negative assessment of the actions of Russia\u2019s servicemen and governance of the military and political authorities of Russia, such as \u201cthis criminal madness by the [bloody] Kremlin regime\u201d, \u201cRussia\u2019s invaders and their accomplices, who have been committing excesses in the territory of the CRI for the past five years\u201d, \u201cthe Kremlin is today the centre of international terrorism\u201d and \u201cthe Putin regime\u201d.", "26. The report went on to note that the article in question also contained statements aimed at advocating the exceptionality and supremacy of the Chechens on the grounds of their ethnic origin, namely:", "\u201c...the new global Russia\u2019s terror has become our national tragedy. Its inexorable millstones are grinding the gene pool of the unique and original Chechen people, one of the indigenous nations of the ancient Caucasus...\u201d", "\u201cThe bright day is near when the sacred Chechen soil will be completely cleansed of the countless hordes of Russia\u2019s invaders...\u201d", "27. Lastly, the report concluded that the article contained no appeals to extremist activity.", "28. At a hearing, the applicant denied the charges. He confirmed that he had decided to publish the articles in question in the newspaper Pravo-Zashchita himself and supported the views expressed in them. He further argued that it had been his responsibility as a journalist to inform his readers of the position of the other party to the Chechen conflict and of possible means to its peaceful resolution. According to the applicant, he had acted in the name of peace and friendship between various nations in Russia. He confirmed that he supported the ideas expressed in the articles.", "29. The applicant\u2019s defence submitted a report by a linguistic expert, Ms V., which they had obtained at their own request at the investigation stage. It stated that the two articles in question could not be regarded as inciting racial or national hatred and discord. Before the trial court, the applicant argued that Ms T.\u2019s conclusions in the reports of 18 February 2005 were hypothetical and that she had not taken into account scientific recommendations for investigating the type of criminal offence with which he had been charged. The applicant also insisted that Ms T. had exceeded her competence as she had given a legal qualification to his actions. He also pointed to discrepancies between the reports by Ms T. submitted by the prosecution and the report by Ms V. submitted by the defence.", "30. A number of witnesses examined at the trial gave positive references about the applicant, stating that he was a man of good character and spoke out in favour of a peaceful resolution of the conflict in the Chechen Republic.", "31. Both experts were also cross-examined during the trial. The applicant submitted an audio recording of Ms T.\u2019s cross-examination, which he had made at the trial. It appears from the recording that, in reply to the applicant\u2019s questions, Ms T. refused to give definitions of the notions of \u201crace\u201d, \u201cethnic origin\u201d and \u201csocial group\u201d, stating that it fell outside of her field of expertise.", "32. In a judgment of 3 February 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Nizhniy Novgorod (\u201cthe District Court\u201d), sitting in a single-judge formation composed of Judge B., established that, in breach of sections 51 and 59 of the Mass Media Act, the applicant, \u201cacting intentionally and using his official position as chief editor, [had] decided to publish two articles which contained statements aimed at inciting enmity and humiliating the dignity of a group of persons on the grounds of race, ethnic origin and membership of a certain social group\u201d. The court then quoted the expressions referred to in the expert reports of 18 February 2005 (see paragraphs 21-22 above) and observed that 5,000 copies of each of the two issues in which the articles had been published had been distributed in Nizhniy Novgorod, Moscow, Voronezh, Kazan and the Republic of Ingushetia.", "33. The District Court found that the applicant\u2019s guilt had been proven \u201cby witness statements and the case material, [in particular] by the conclusions of the forensic expert examinations, according to which the texts [of the impugned articles contained] no appeals to extremist activity, but [contained] statements aimed at inciting racial, ethnic or social discord, associated with violence\u201d. On the basis of the evidence adduced to it, the District Court found it necessary to classify the applicant\u2019s actions as those punishable under Article 282 \u00a7 2 (b) of the Criminal Code, namely those aimed at inciting enmity and humiliating the dignity of a group of persons on the grounds of race, ethnic origin, membership of a social group, committed through the mass media by a person using his official position.", "34. The trial court then found that, \u201cacting with direct intent, being aware of the nature of his actions and wishing to carry them out, [the applicant], on his own, [had taken] a decision to publish two articles which had, as their basis, statements aimed at inciting enmity and humiliating the dignity of persons on the grounds of race, ethnic origin and membership of a social group\u201d. It observed that \u201cduring the trial [the applicant had] repeatedly expressed his support for the points of view reflected in the published articles\u201d and had \u201cpointed out that he [had been] carrying out his duty as a journalist by so doing\u201d. In the court\u2019s opinion, however, the arguments advanced by the applicant in his defence were \u201cuntenable from a legal point of view and should be regarded as [his] attempt to defend himself to avoid punishment for the committed offence of medium gravity\u201d. The witness statements in the applicant\u2019s favour were held \u201cto concern only the applicant\u2019s personality\u201d and to be \u201cirrelevant for the present criminal case\u201d.", "35. The District Court further pointed out that it had based its guilty verdict \u201con the lawful and well-founded expert reports [of 18 February 2005], in which [Ms T. had] thoroughly analysed the texts of both articles in their entirety and made a conclusion as to the presence in [them] of statements aimed at inciting racial, ethnic and social discord\u201d. The court considered that it had no reason to doubt or question the conclusions of the expert reports given, in particular, \u201cMs T.\u2019s competence, professional skills and [past] experience.\u201d", "36. The District Court further rejected the report by Ms V. as defective, saying that it was superficial and formalistic and that the expert examination in question had been carried out without due regard to an analysis of the texts. The court also noted in this connection that the applicant had paid for the report and that Ms V. had not been informed of the relevant provisions of procedural legislation which criminalised the drawing up of knowingly false expert reports.", "37. The trial court found it necessary to exclude from the charges against the applicant reference to \u201cthe statements aimed at advocating the exceptionality and supremacy of the Chechens on the grounds of their ethnicity\u201d \u201cin the absence of such wording in the provisions of Article 282 of the Russian Criminal Code\u201d.", "38. As regards the punishment to be imposed on the applicant, the court had regard to the nature and social dangerousness of the offence with which he had been charged and the fact that he had no criminal record, had positive references and had two dependent children. It also stated that there was no evidence at that time that \u201c[his] illegal actions had entailed any serious consequences\u201d. The court therefore considered it appropriate to give the applicant a two-year suspended sentence and four years\u2019 probation.", "39. On 9 February 2006 the applicant applied to the District Court to have the trial record amended. He complained that Ms T.\u2019s testimony, which was of crucial importance to his case, had been distorted in the record and that, in particular, it attributed certain statements to her which she had not made at the trial. He pointed out, more specifically, that during the trial Ms T. had refused, in reply to his questions, to give definitions to the notions of \u201crace\u201d, \u201cethnic origin\u201d and \u201csocial group\u201d, stating that it was outside of her competence as a linguist and rather fell within the competence of a sociologist or historian. However, according to the official trial record, Ms T. had defined the aforementioned notions. The applicant also asked the court to include in the case file a copy and transcript of the audio recording of the first-instance hearings, made by the defence, indicating the discrepancies between the actual statements made by Ms T. and those reflected in the trial record.", "40. By a decision of 13 February 2006 Judge B. of the District Court rejected the applicant\u2019s application. He noted that the trial record had been made in compliance with procedural law and fully reflected the actual testimony given by all witnesses. The judge further stated that neither the applicant nor his lawyer had notified the District Court of the audio recording of Ms T.\u2019s cross-examination at the trial or requested that the court include it in the case file, and that there were no legal grounds at that time for entertaining the applicant\u2019s application.", "41. On 9, 10 and 13 February 2006 respectively the applicant\u2019s two lawyers and the applicant lodged appeals against his conviction.", "42. On 17 February 2006 the applicant filed supplementary appeal pleadings, reiterating his complaints concerning the shortcomings in the trial record with respect to Ms T.\u2019s testimony and requesting that the appellate court examine the audio recording made during the trial of Ms T.\u2019s statements and establish the discrepancy between them and those reflected in the trial record.", "43. By a letter of 21 February 2006, Judge B. returned the applicant\u2019s supplementary pleadings, stating that, in substance, they reflected his remarks in respect of the trial record, which had already been examined and rejected on 13 February 2006.", "44. On 1 March 2006 the applicant resubmitted his supplementary pleadings of 17 February 2006 to the Nizhniy Novgorod Regional Court (\u201cthe Regional Court\u201d) and complained about Judge B.\u2019s refusal to accept them. In a letter of 13 April 2006 the Regional Court informed the applicant that it had accepted his pleadings of 17 February 2006 for examination and had examined them during an appeal hearing on 11 April 2006, and therefore the breach of his right of appeal against the judgment of 3 February 2006 had been remedied. The letter also stated that Judge B.\u2019s actions when he had unlawfully returned the applicant\u2019s supplementary pleadings of 17 February 2006 would be discussed by the Regional Court, but that at the same time there were insufficient grounds for instituting disciplinary proceedings against him.", "45. In its decision of 11 April 2006 the Regional Court found the judgment of 3 February 2006 reasoned and well-founded and upheld it on appeal. It reiterated the reasoning of the trial court, stating that the applicant\u2019s guilt for the offence with which he had been charged had been proven by the body of evidence examined during the trial \u2013 his own statements in which he had admitted having published the impugned articles and the expert reports of 18 February 2005. The Regional Court endorsed the trial court\u2019s argument that there was no reason to question the conclusions of those reports. It also stated that the trial court had addressed Ms V.\u2019s report, which had been favourable to the applicant, having assessed it critically.", "46. In February and March 2006 the applicant unsuccessfully attempted to have disciplinary and criminal proceedings instituted against Judge B. for alleged falsifying the trial record, exceeding his powers and obstructing justice."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
