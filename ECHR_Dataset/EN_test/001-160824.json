The relevant parts of the District Court\u2019s decision reads as follows:", "\u201cHaving examined ... the presented power of attorney, the court finds that the counter-claim ... must be returned, taking into account that the power of attorney has been issued in violation of Article 41 \u00a7 1, 2 and 4 of the [the Code of Civil Procedure].

On 15 November 2006 advocate G. lodged an appeal on points of law with the Court of Cassation against the District Court\u2019s decision not to admit the counter-claim.

He argued, in particular, that there was no evidence in the case file, such as an acknowledgement of receipt, which would substantiate that the defendant had received the copy of the judgment in a timely manner. In such circumstances, where it was the courts\u2019 duty to serve their decisions in due time, the Court of Appeal should not have placed the responsibility of producing proof of belated receipt of the judgment on the party to the proceedings.", "23. On 15 February 2007 the Court of Cassation declared the appeal on points of law inadmissible for lack of merit. In doing so, it stated, in particular, that:", "\u201cThe Civil Chamber of the Court of Cassation ... having examined the appeal on points of law lodged by [G.] against the decision of the Civil Court of Appeal of 19 January 2007 to return [the applicant\u2019s] appeal, found that it should be returned for the following reasons...", "The Court of Cassation finds that the admissibility criteria set out in Article 231.2 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure are absent in the appeal on points of law lodged in the present case.
