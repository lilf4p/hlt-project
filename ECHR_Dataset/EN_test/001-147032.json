The final decisions were taken by the Donetsk Administrative Court of Appeal on 10 September 2013 in the first applicant\u2019s case and by the Higher Administrative Court on 24 October 2013 in the second applicant\u2019s case.

On 28 March 2014 the Court received the first applicant\u2019s application form, in which he complained principally about the outcome and unfairness of the domestic proceedings in his case. By a letter of 11 April 2014, the Court informed the first applicant that he had not complied with the requirements set out in Rule 47 of the Rules of Court, as he had failed to provide copies of all relevant documents relating to exhaustion of domestic remedies, in particular copies of his appeals. The first applicant was further informed that his complaints could not be examined by the Court and that the six-month period referred to in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention was interrupted only when a complete application was sent to the Court.", "On 18 March 2014 the second applicant sent an application form to the Court, in which he complained about the outcome and alleged unfairness of the domestic proceedings in his case.

He provided no further details or documents concerning his health problems or the alleged complications he faced in the preparation of his application."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
