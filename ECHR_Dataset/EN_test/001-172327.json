The applicant was born in 1988 and lives in Zagreb.", "6. On 9 June 2013 Zagreb police (Policijska uprava Zagreba\u010dka, hereinafter \u201cthe police\u201d) received an emergency call informing them that two men were attacking a man and a woman of Roma origin.", "7. The police immediately went to the scene, where they found the applicant and her partner \u0160.\u0160., and another individual, I.M., with whom the applicant and her partner had had a verbal and physical conflict. They all had visible injuries. Soon afterwards, nearby, the police found and arrested another man, S.K., who had also been involved in the conflict.", "8. A preliminary report prepared by the police stated that the applicant and her partner had first had an argument with I.M. and S.K., during which S.K. had said \u201call Gypsies should be killed, we will exterminate you\u201d. S.K. and I.M. had then attacked the applicant\u2019s partner. The applicant and her partner had tried to escape but I.M. and S.K. had managed to catch them. S.K. had grabbed the applicant\u2019s T-shirt and thrown her to the ground and then kicked her in the head. I.M. and S.K. had then continued beating the applicant\u2019s partner, whose hands had been slashed with a knife by S.K..", "9. The police report stated that the applicant had a contusion that was visible below her left eye. The emergency medical services also attended the scene. A doctor recorded the applicant\u2019s injuries as minor bodily injuries. On the same day the applicant was examined at a hospital, where her injuries were confirmed. She was told to rest and take painkillers.", "10. In connection with the incident, the police carried out an on-site inspection and a further assessment of the available material. The police also interviewed the applicant and her partner as well as the two assailants.", "11. In his police interview of 9 June 2013 the applicant\u2019s partner \u0160.\u0160. stated that he was of Roma origin. On the day of the incident he had been at a flea market with the applicant when some passers-by had pushed her. He had realised that it had been two young men and he had told the applicant to ignore them because they were drunk (\u201cwasted\u201d). One of them had heard him and had turned to \u0160.\u0160., saying \u201cFuck your Gypsy mother, who is wasted? Who are you to tell me that? You should all be exterminated, I fuck your Gypsy mother\u201d (Jebem ti mater cigansku, tko je urokan, \u0161ta ti meni ima\u0161 govoriti, sve vas treba istrijebiti mamu vam cigansku jebem). The other man had also turned towards \u0160.\u0160., saying \u201cFuck your mother, you should all be exterminated, I will kill you\u201d (Jebem vam majku, treba vas istrijebiti, ubit \u0107u te). \u0160.\u0160. stated that he had then panicked and had drawn a knife in order to scare them. However, that had created a further outburst of anger from the two men; one of them had taken out a knife and they had started chasing \u0160.\u0160. As \u0160.\u0160. was running away, the applicant had joined him and they had started running away together, looking for help. However, the attackers had managed to get hold of \u0160.\u0160. and had started beating him. At that point the applicant had tried to help and had also been hit. The two men had then continued beating \u0160.\u0160., saying that he was a Rom and should be killed.", "12. In her police interview of 9 June 2013 the applicant stated that she lived with \u0160.\u0160., with whom she had had two children. She confirmed \u0160.\u0160.\u2019s version of events, saying that she had been pushed by the two men. After \u0160.\u0160. had reacted by saying that the men should be left alone because they were drunk, one of the two men had said, \u201cWho is drunk? Fuck your Gypsy mother, you should all be exterminated, this will be a white Croatia again, you are garbage\u201d (Tko je pijan, jebem ti mater cigansku, vas treba istrijebiti, ovo \u0107e ponovno biti bijela Hrvatska, sme\u0107e jedno). The applicant stated that after this the two men had started attacking \u0160.\u0160. She had tried to approach them to help \u0160.\u0160. but another woman had prevented her from doing so. However, at one point she had joined \u0160.\u0160. and they had started running away. The two men had then caught them and one of them had grabbed her by the T-shirt and said, \u201cWhat are you going to do now you bitch? I will beat you now\u201d (\u0160to \u0107e\u0161 sad kujo jedna, sad \u0107u te prebiti). He had then kicked her in the head. The two men had continued beating \u0160.\u0160., while she had run away and looked for help.", "13. In their interviews of 9 June 2013 the two assailants explained that the conflict had broken out because \u0160.\u0160. had offended them by saying that they were drunk. They denied the conflict had had any racial overtones.", "14. On 10 June 2013 the police lodged a criminal complaint against S.K. and I.M. with the Zagreb Municipal State Attorney\u2019s Office (Op\u0107insko dr\u017eavno odvjetni\u0161tvo u Zagrebu) for suspected commission of a hate crime, perpetrated by attempting to inflict grievous bodily harm on \u0160.\u0160., and motivated by the latter\u2019s Roma origin. The applicant was mentioned in the criminal complaint as a witness.", "15. In the course of the investigation the Zagreb Municipal State Attorney\u2019s Office questioned the two suspects and on 17 June and 31 July 2013 it instructed the police to conduct an identification procedure and formal questioning of the applicant and \u0160.\u0160. as witnesses.", "16. When questioned as a witness, \u0160.\u0160. repeated the statement he had given during the first police interview. He explained how, after the two men had pushed the applicant, one of them had turned towards him and uttered the insults related to his Roma origin (see paragraph 11 above). \u0160.\u0160. also stated that the applicant had been attacked after she had tried to help him when the two men were beating him up.", "17. During her questioning as a witness, the applicant repeated the statement she had given during the first police interview (see paragraph 12 above).", "18. Upon completion of the investigation, on 30 October 2013 the Zagreb Municipal State Attorney\u2019s Office indicted S.K. and I.M. in the Zagreb Municipal Criminal Court (Op\u0107inski kazneni sud u Zagrebu) on charges of making serious threats against \u0160.\u0160. and inflicting bodily injury on him, associated with a hate-crime element. The indictment also made reference to the attack on the applicant, suggesting that she had been kicked in the head while trying to save \u0160.\u0160. from the beating.", "19. The indictment was confirmed and the case was sent for trial on 21 March 2014.", "20. Meanwhile, on 31 October 2013 the Zagreb Municipal State Attorney\u2019s Office informed \u0160.\u0160., as a victim in the proceedings, that an indictment had been lodged against S.K. and I.M. in connection with the attack on him. On 23 January 2014 the Zagreb Municipal State Attorney\u2019s Office informed \u0160.\u0160.\u2019s lawyer, L.K., of the institution of the proceedings in the Zagreb Municipal Criminal Court.", "21. At a hearing on 9 October 2014 the Zagreb Municipal Criminal Court questioned \u0160.\u0160. He repeated the statements given to the police. When asked whether the two assailants had said anything to the applicant related to \u0160.\u0160.\u2019s racial origin, \u0160.\u0160. stated that she had told him something but he could no longer remember the details. He thought that she had said that the two assailants had told her that she was also Roma if she was with a Roma man. On the basis of an agreement between the parties, including \u0160.\u0160.\u2019s representative, the applicant\u2019s statement to the police was admitted in evidence and she was not questioned further at the trial.", "22. By a judgment of 13 October 2014 the Zagreb Municipal Criminal Court found S.K. and I.M. guilty as charged and sentenced them to one year and six months\u2019 imprisonment.", "23. In the meantime, on 29 July 2013 the applicant and her partner, represented by the lawyer L.K., had lodged a criminal complaint with the Zagreb Municipal State Attorney\u2019s Office against two unidentified suspects in connection with the incident of 9 June 2013 (see paragraphs 6-13 above). It was alleged in the criminal complaint that one of the suspects had first pushed the applicant and had then told her that she was a \u201cbitch\u201d (kuja) who had a relationship with a Roma man and that she would be beaten. She had been grabbed by the T-shirt and thrown to the ground, banging her head. The assailants had then continued beating \u0160.\u0160., threatening to kill him and the applicant. The criminal complaint also alleged that the assailants had stolen two mobile telephones from \u0160.\u0160. at the same time.", "24. The applicant\u2019s representative tried to obtain the relevant information about the attackers from the police on the grounds that she needed the information in order to institute court proceedings. On 12 November 2013 the police informed the applicant\u2019s representative that they had lodged a criminal complaint with the Zagreb Municipal State Attorney\u2019s Office against two individuals in connection with a suspicion that they had committed the offence of attempted grievous had been classified as a hate crime. The applicant\u2019s representative was also informed that she should contact the Zagreb Municipal State Attorney\u2019s Office for all further information.", "25. The applicant\u2019s representative then informed the Zagreb Municipal State Attorney\u2019s Office that the applicant and her partner would participate in the proceedings as victims and requested to be informed of all relevant procedural steps. On 17 February 2014 the applicant\u2019s representative, invoking the domestic authorities\u2019 obligations under the Convention, requested information from the police and the Zagreb Municipal State Attorney\u2019s Office about the criminal complaint lodged on behalf of the applicant.", "26. On 31 October 2014 the Zagreb Municipal State Attorney\u2019s Office rejected the applicant\u2019s criminal complaint. It examined the materials related to the investigation into the incident of 9 June 2013 and the criminal proceedings against S.K. and I.M. (see paragraphs 10-22 above). The relevant part of the decision reads:", "\u201cIn view of the above, it is established without any doubt that on the day in issue there was a physical conflict between S.K. and I.M. and \u0160.\u0160. whereby [S.K. and I.M.] caused bodily injury to and threatened \u0160.\u0160., and those offences were committed primarily because of hatred towards Roma.", "However, the statements of the witnesses \u0160.\u0160. and Maja \u0160korjanec show that [S.K. and I.M.] pushed her in the back, causing her to fall onto a [flea market] stall, not because she was the partner of \u0160.\u0160., who is of Roma origin, but because they were drunk and they accidentally pushed her towards the stalls.", "Furthermore, the medical documentation regarding Maja \u0160korjanec, as well as the records of the questioning of the witnesses \u0160.\u0160. and Maja \u0160korjanec and the statements of S.K. and I.M. given in their defence in the proceedings before the Zagreb Municipal Criminal Court, show that there is no doubt that S.K. kicked Maja \u0160korjanec in the left side of the face with the result that she sustained a minor bodily injury.", "Given that there is no indication that S.K. and I.M. inflicted injuries on Maja \u0160korjanec because of hatred towards Roma, as she is not of Roma origin, the criminal offence under Article 117 \u00a7 2 in conjunction with Article 87(21) of the Criminal Code has not been established.", "In particular, the injury which Maja \u0160korjanec sustained would, by its nature, suggest an injury within the meaning of Article 177 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code. ... As criminal proceedings for the offence under Article 177 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code are instituted on the basis of a private prosecution, the criminal complaint ... must be rejected ... on the grounds that the impugned criminal offence is not an offence that is prosecuted of the prosecutor\u2019s own motion.", "With regard to the criminal offence under Article 139 \u00a7 2 in conjunction with Article 87(21) of the Criminal Code, it should be pointed out that it is obvious that S.K. and I.M. threatened \u0160.\u0160. and not Maja \u0160korjanec ... Moreover, ... it does not follow from the record of Maja \u0160korjanec\u2019s witness statement, which has been examined, that S.K. and I.M. threatened her, but rather \u0160.\u0160., and thus the criminal complaint ... should be rejected on the grounds that the impugned criminal offence is not an offence that is prosecuted of the prosecutor\u2019s own motion.\u201d", "27. The applicant was informed that she could take over the prosecution of S.K. and I.M. as a subsidiary prosecutor, as provided for under the relevant domestic law (see paragraph 30 below)."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
