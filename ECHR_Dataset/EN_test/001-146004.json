The applicants, Ms Jelena Kova\u010devi\u0107 (\u201cthe first applicant\u201d), Mr Safet Salkovi\u0107 (\u201cthe second applicant\u201d) and Ms Ivanka Karlov\u010dan (\u201cthe third applicant\u201d) were born on 27 October 1936, 27 April 1936 and 25 February 1937. They live in Vara\u017edin, Tuzla (Bosnia and Herzegovina) and Zagreb respectively. The second applicant is a national of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the other two applicants are Croatian nationals. The first applicant was represented before the Court by Mr G. Vu\u010deti\u0107 and the second and the third applicant by Mr V. \u0110urovi\u0107, advocates practising in Vara\u017edin and Zagreb respectively.", "2. The Croatian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mrs \u0160. Sta\u017enik.", "3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "4. The applicants are pensioners. Until September 1993 their pensions were regularly adjusted in line with the increase in wages in accordance with section 30 of the Act on principal rights arising from pension and disability insurance (Zakon o osnovnim pravima iz mirovinskog i invalidskog osiguranja, Official Gazette of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 23/82, 77/82, 75/85, 8/87, 65/87, 76/88, 74/88, 74/89, 87/89, 44/90 and 87/90 and Official Gazette of the Republic of Croatia no. 53/91 \u2013 \u201cthe Basic Pension and Disability Insurance Act\u201d) and section 121 of the Pension and Disability Insurance Act (Zakon o mirovinskom i invalidskom osiguranju, Official Gazette nos. 26/83, 5/86, 42/87, 34/89, 57/89, 40/90, 9/91, 26/93, 96/93, 44/94 and 59/96).", "5. In the period between 1 October 1993 and January 1995 the Croatian Government adopted a series of successive decrees whereby it limited the funds available for payment of pensions. This measure was part of the Government\u2019s strategy to curb inflation and stabilise the economy. Since the funds available were insufficient to enable pensions to be adjusted in line with the increase in wages, the level of pensions paid in that period was lower than required by law.", "6. On 19 February 1997 the Act on adjustment of pensions and other benefits arising from pension and disability insurance and on administering pension and disability insurance funds (Zakon o uskla\u0111ivanju mirovina i drugih nov\u010danih primanja iz mirovinskog i invalidskog osiguranja, te upravljanju fondovima mirovinskog i invalidskog osiguranja, Official Gazette no. 20/97 \u2013 \u201cthe Pension Adjustment Act\u201d) entered into force. It provided that in the period between 1 February 1995 and 31 December 1996 pensions should have been adjusted in line with the increase in wages (section 1), and that pensioners were to be compensated for their resultant loss within eighteen months from the Act\u2019s entry into force by way of an increase in their pensions (section 2). The Act also abrogated section 30 of the Basic Pension and Disability Insurance Act and section 121 of the Pension and Disability Insurance Act (see paragraph 4 above) and provided that from 1 January 1997 pensions were to be adjusted in line with the increase in the cost of living (section 3).", "7. By a decision of 12 May 1998 the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) invalidated almost the entire Pension Adjustment Act, including sections 1-3, as unconstitutional. It also held that the State had an outstanding statutory obligation to pensioners to pay them pensions adjusted in line with the increase in wages as of September 1993. This obligation became known as \u201cthe debt to pensioners\u201d (dug umirovljenicima, hereafter \u201cthe pension debt\u201d).", "8. As a result of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision, 427,809 requests were lodged with the Croatian Pension Fund\u2019s regional offices by pensioners seeking (retrospective) adjustment of their pensions in accordance with the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision, that is, in line with the increase in wages. In addition, pensioners brought 1,775 civil actions for payment of compensation for the pension debt in civil courts.", "9. On 6 August 1998 the Act on the transfer of funds from the State budget to the pension and disability insurance funds and on the adjustment of pensions (Zakon o preno\u0161enju sredstava dr\u017eavnog prora\u010duna fondovima mirovinskog i invalidskog osiguranja te uskla\u0111ivanju mirovina, Official Gazette no. 102/98 \u2013 \u201cthe Transfer Act\u201d) entered into force. It provided that in the period between 1998 and 2002 the State would transfer HRK 7,524,856,731 to the Croatian Pension Fund with a view to increasing all pensions. The increase was paid in the form of a monthly pension supplement (dodatak uz mirovinu) of 100 Croatian kunas (HRK) plus 6% of the pension paid in June 1998. The supplement was paid from 6 August 1998 until 31 December 2002, after which it was permanently incorporated and became an integral part of a person\u2019s pension. The legal basis for the supplement was provided by subordinate legislation passed on the basis of the Transfer Act, namely, the Ordinance on the method and time-limits of the payment of the pension supplement (Pravilnik o na\u010dinu i rokovima isplate dodatka uz mirovinu, Official Gazette no. 136/98). The Transfer Act also provided that pensions were to be adjusted at the rate calculated by adding up the rate of the increase in the cost of living and the rate of the increase in wages and then dividing them by half (hereafter \u201cthe Swiss formula\u201d). Thereby it in fact derogated from section 30 of the Basic Pension and Disability Insurance Act and section 121 of the Pension and Disability Insurance Act, according to which pensions were to be adjusted in line with the increase in wages (see paragraph 4 above). On 23 December 1998 the Constitutional Court rejected four petitions for (abstract) constitutional review and thus refused to institute proceedings to review the constitutionality of the Transfer Act.", "10. On 1 January 1999 the Pension Insurance Act (Zakon o mirovinskom osiguranju, Official Gazette nos. 102/98, 127/00, 59/01, 109/01, 147/02, 117/03, 30/04, 177/04, 92/05, 43/07, 79/07, 35/08, 40/10, 121/10, 130/10, 139/10, 61/11, 114/11, 76/12, 112/13) entered into force. It expressly abrogated the Basic Pension and Disability Insurance Act and the Pension and Disability Insurance Act (see paragraph 4 above) and provided that pensions were to be adjusted according to the Swiss formula.", "11. On 1 January 2001 the Act on the increase of pensions to eliminate differences in levels of pensions earned in different periods (Zakon o pove\u0107anju mirovina radi otklanjanja razlika u razini mirovina ostvarenih u razli\u010ditim razdobljima, Official Gazette no. 127/00 \u2013 \u201cthe Pensions Increase Act\u201d) entered into force with a view to levelling out pensions, because pensions earned before 31 December 1994 were disproportionately lower than those earned after that date. As set out in its section 1, the Act regulated the method of increasing pensions with a view to eliminating differences in levels of pensions earned in different periods and implemented the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 12 May 1998 in accordance with the State\u2019s economic capacities. The Act increased pensions earned before 31 December 1998 by anything between 5% to 20% depending on the year of retirement. The increase was paid between 1 January 2001 and 31 July 2004. On 19 December 2001 the Constitutional Court rejected a number of petitions for (abstract) constitutional review and thus refused to institute proceedings to review the constitutionality of the Pensions Increase Act.", "12. On 5 August 2004 the Act on the implementation of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 12 May 1998 (see paragraphs 51-53 below, hereafter \u201cthe Implementation Act\u201d) entered into force. It provided that those pensioners (hereafter \u201celigible pensioners\u201d) whose pensions had, in the period between 1 September 1993 and 31 December 1998 (hereafter \u201cthe relevant period\u201d), not been adjusted in line with the increase in wages had a right to compensation (for the pension debt) which corresponded to the difference between the pension they had been entitled to receive and the pension actually paid to them in that period, reduced by the pension supplement paid under the Transfer Act and the pension increase received under the Pensions Increase Act. In addition, eligible pensioners were also entitled to interest on the total amount of compensation at a rate of 19.9752% calculated from the date of the Act\u2019s entry into force. While the amount of compensation was to be determined (calculated) by the Croatian Pension Fund, the compensation itself was to be obtained through a special fund (\u201cthe Pensioners\u2019 Fund\u201d) that was to be established on the basis of subsequent legislation.", "13. On 29 July 2005 the Pensioners\u2019 Fund Act (see paragraphs 54-62 below) entered into force. The Act provided that each eligible pensioner had a right to a share in the Fund depending on the amount of compensation to which they were entitled. The Act gave each of them a choice between payment of half of the compensation in four semi-annual instalments over a period of two years (2006-2007) (Model A), or payment of full compensation in six annual instalments over a period of eight years (2006-2013) with a two-year delay (Model B). In the end, around 74% of eligible pensioners opted for Model A whereas 26% chose Model B. The Pensioners\u2019 Fund is operated and managed by a private investment company, HPB-Invest, which is also charged with calculating the interest due on the amount of compensation determined in advance by the Croatian Pension Fund under the Implementation Act in respect of each eligible pensioner.", "14. According to a report by the Croatian Pension Fund of 31 December 2010, the total amount of compensation for the pension debt that was to be paid through the Pensioners\u2019 Fund was HRK 12,912,219,047.17 plus an additional HRK 2.579.243.782.89 in accrued interest. The report also suggests that 464,025 eligible pensioners were entitled to compensation whereas 257,865 were not, because the total amount of their pensions received in the relevant period together with the pension supplement paid under the Transfer Act and the pension increase paid under the Pensions Increase Act exceeded the total amount of pension they were entitled to receive in that period.", "15. On 15 February 2011 the Constitutional Court rejected thirty-nine petitions for (abstract) constitutional review and thus refused to institute proceedings to review the constitutionality of five provisions of the Implementation Act. Likewise, on 4 October 2011 it rejected eleven petitions for (abstract) constitutional review and thus refused to institute proceedings to review the constitutionality of eight provisions of the Pensioners\u2019 Fund Act (see paragraph 76 below).", "16. The first applicant has been receiving a survivor\u2019s pension (obiteljska mirovina) since 9 May 1996, following the death of her husband.", "17. By a notice of 27 November 2005 HPB-Invest informed the first applicant that the amount of compensation for the pension debt owed to her equalled zero Croatian kunas (HRK); in other words, she was not entitled to any compensation. In particular, the calculation contained in the information notice indicated that in the relevant period the first applicant had received, together with the disbursements paid under the Transfer Act and the Pensions Increase Act (see paragraphs 9 and 11-12 above), pension payments in the total amount of HRK 72,238.38, whereas she was entitled to receive HRK 45,538.44.", "18. On 14 December 2005 the first applicant requested the Vara\u017edin Regional Office of the Croatian Pension Fund (Hrvatski zavod za mirovinsko osiguranje \u2013 Podru\u010dna slu\u017eba u Vara\u017edinu) to verify whether the amount of compensation referred to in the HPB-Invest\u2019s information notice had been correctly calculated.", "19. By a letter of 16 January 2006 the Regional Office replied that it had verified the calculation and established that the amount had been calculated correctly.", "20. On 9 October 2007 the first applicant requested the Regional Office to re-calculate the amount of compensation in accordance with the criteria set forth in the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 12 May 1998 (see paragraph 7 above).", "21. By a letter of 12 October 2007 the Regional Office, after explaining the method of calculation to the first applicant, reiterated that the amount of compensation in her case had, in its view, been accurately calculated.", "22. On 25 October 2007 the first applicant brought an action for judicial review in the Administrative Court (Upravni sud Republike Hrvatske) contesting the Regional Office\u2019s letter of 12 October 2007. She argued that the Regional Office had refused to re-calculate the amount of compensation in her case in accordance with the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 12 May 1998.", "23. By a decision of 13 December 2007 the Administrative Court declared the first applicant\u2019s action inadmissible, finding that the contested letter of 12 October 2007 did not constitute an \u201cadministrative act\u201d, within the meaning of section 6(2) of the Administrative Disputes Act (see paragraph 66 below), against which administrative-dispute (judicial review) proceedings could be instituted. The relevant part of that decision reads as follows:", "\u201cSection 4 paragraph 1 of [the Implementation Act] provides that the difference between the pension to which a person was entitled and the pension actually received in the period between 1 September 1993 and 31 December 1998 shall be determined [that is, calculated] for each pensioner separately by the Croatian Pension Fund of its own motion and within a year (without issuing a special decision in administrative proceedings).", "...", "Section 6(1) of the Administrative Disputes Act provides that administrative-dispute proceedings may be initiated only against an administrative act.

On 7 April 2008 the first applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court. She relied on Article 14 paragraph 2 (equality before the law) of the Croatian Constitution (see paragraph 50 below).", "25. By a decision of 29 May 2008 the Constitutional Court declared the first applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint inadmissible as lodged outside the statutory time-limit of thirty days.

The second applicant has been receiving a disability pension (invalidska mirovina) since 10 June 1986.", "27. By a notice of 26 November 2005 HPB-Invest informed the second applicant that the amount of compensation for the pension debt owed to him equalled zero HRK, that is, that he was not entitled to any compensation. In particular, the calculation detailed in the information notice indicated that in the relevant period the second applicant had received, together with the disbursements paid under the Transfer Act and the Pensions Increase Act (see paragraphs 9 and 11-12 above), pension payments in the total amount of HRK 101,291.64, whereas he had been entitled to HRK 98,728.45. However, from the calculation it is evident that the sum of the amounts the second applicant was entitled to receive was not HRK 98,728.45, but HRK 222,378.70. The relevant part of HPB-Invest\u2019s information notice reads as follows:", "28. On 9 January 2006 the second applicant requested both the Zagreb Regional Office of the Croatian Pension Fund (Hrvatski zavod za mirovinsko osiguranje \u2013 Podru\u010dna slu\u017eba u Zagrebu) and HPB-Invest to correct the manifest error in calculation contained in the information notice of 26 November 2005 and pay him HRK 121,087.06, that is, the difference between the amount received and the amount he had actually been entitled to. On 19 January 2006 the applicant submitted the same request to the Central Office of the Croatian Pension Fund (Hrvatski zavod za mirovinsko osiguranje \u2013 Sredi\u0161nja slu\u017eba).", "29. By a letter of 20 January 2006 the Central Office replied that it had verified the calculation contained in HPB-Invest\u2019s information notice of 26 November 2005 and established that it was correct.", "30. In his motion of 6 February 2006 the second applicant asked the Zagreb Regional Office to issue a formal decision on the merits of his request of 9 January 2006, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act.

Besides, pursuant to the Implementation Act the calculation of the amount of compensation (or denial of compensation) is not an administrative matter within the meaning of section 6(2) of the Administrative Disputes Act in which an administrative or other public authority would decide on one\u2019s rights or obligations. [Rather,] it concerns direct execution, proprio motu, of the Implementation Act, which determines which categories of pensioners, depending on the type of pensions [they receive], are entitled to compensation, as well as how [that compensation] should be calculated. That Act does not lay down an obligation to conduct administrative proceedings and render an administrative act [i.e. a formal decision] which would confer on citizens the rights it sets out. Therefore, the document [in question] (the information notice) on the calculation of compensation (or the non-existence of the right to compensation) is of a declaratory nature only.", "Since the obligation to conduct administrative proceedings and issue an administrative act [i.e. a formal decision] is not prescribed (in any event, HPB-Invest would not be entitled to conduct such proceedings or issue an administrative act as it is evidently not an administrative or other public authority but a commercial company) there is no constitutive act [i.e. a formal decision] which would entail the right to appeal, within the meaning of Article 18 of the Constitution, whereas the right of access to court is limited only [to the extent that] the jurisdiction of the Administrative Court, which is prescribed by law, excludes ... non-administrative matters.

In particular, the Supreme Court held that after these two legislative acts had come into force on 5 August 2004 and 29 July 2005 respectively such compensation claims had to be adjudicated solely on the basis of that legislation. Since under those two legislative enactments compensation for the pension debt could be obtained either as payment of half of the compensation due over a period of two years or as delayed payment of the entire amount of compensation due over a period of eight years, awarding full and immediate compensation to those pensioners who had brought civil actions to that end would place them in a privileged position compared to other pensioners who had not brought such actions and thus had to obtain compensation through the Pensioners\u2019 Fund.

G\u017e-1266/08 of 1 June 2007 the Split County Court reversed a first-instance judgment dismissing an action brought by two pensioners as plaintiffs and ordered the Croatian Pension Fund as the defendant to pay them the pension debt. It held that because the plaintiffs had not withdrawn their action in accordance with section 42(1) of the Pensioners\u2019 Fund Act (see paragraph 62 above), they had chosen to obtain compensation for the pension debt not through the Pensioners\u2019 Fund but in civil proceedings.", "82. By judgment no. G\u017eo-276/10 of 9 August 2010 the Split County Court quashed a first-instance judgment and remitted the case where the first-instance court had dismissed an action for payment of compensation brought by a pensioner as the plaintiff against the Croatian Pension Fund for its failure to satisfy its statutory obligation under section 3 of the Implementation Act (see paragraph 53 above) and determine the amount of compensation owed to him. The plaintiff had brought his action because he had not received HPB-Invest\u2019s information notice within the statutory time-limit, and the Croatian Pension Fund, in reply to his request for calculation of the compensation owed to him, had informed him that he was not eligible for compensation because he had been receiving a pension on account of his status as a former political prisoner. The Fund did so even though it had previously granted him a disability pension.", "83. By judgment no. P-514/06 of 2 February 2009 the Kutina Municipal Court dismissed an action for payment of the pension debt brought by a pensioner as the plaintiff against the State as the defendant. The plaintiff brought her action after she had been informed via HPB-Invest\u2019s information notice that she was not entitled to any compensation through the Pensioners\u2019 Fund, and after the Croatian Pension Fund, in reply to her request for re-calculation of the compensation owed to her, had informed her that the compensation had been correctly calculated. The court did not accept the State\u2019s argument that it did not have jurisdiction in the matter. It held that it had jurisdiction precisely because the Croatian Pension Fund had not issued a formal decision (an administrative act) on the plaintiff\u2019s request for re-calculation, thus depriving her of the possibility to seek judicial review before the Administrative Court. The court eventually dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s claim because it held that she should have sued the Croatian Pension Fund instead of the State, and because she had refused to advance the fees of the financial expert the court had been prepared to call upon to verify the Fund\u2019s calculation of compensation.", "84.

G\u017e-772/10 of 10 February 2011 the Sisak County Court upheld a first-instance judgment dismissing an action brought by a pensioner as the plaintiff against the State as the defendant for payment of compensation for the pension debt. The court held that the State had standing to be sued because the Pensioners\u2019 Fund Act provided that Pensioners\u2019 Fund had been established by the Government of Croatia on behalf of the State (see paragraph 55 above). The court dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s claim because a financial expert confirmed that the Croatian Pension Fund\u2019s calculation, according to which the plaintiff was not entitled to compensation, was correct.", "85. By judgment no.

The plaintiff brought her action because she considered that the amount of compensation indicated in HPB-Invest\u2019s information notice was too low. She did so only after the Croatian Pension Fund, in reply to her request for re-calculation of the compensation, had informed her that the compensation had been correctly calculated. The plaintiff specifically asked the court to establish the correct amount of compensation owed to her under the Implementation Act and the Pensioners\u2019 Fund Act. The court dismissed her action because it held that it was not authorised to verify the accuracy of the Croatian Pension Fund\u2019s calculation of the compensation. The court held, in particular:", "\u201cThis court considers that it has no power to establish whether the amount of compensation for the pension debt ... has been determined correctly.
