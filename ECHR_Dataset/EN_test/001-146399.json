SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Administrative proceedings;Article 6-1 - Access to court)", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Andr\u00e9 Potocki;Ann Power-Forde;Ganna Yudkivska;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Mark Villiger;Vincent A. De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["5. The applicants own property close to Ume\u00e5, in the vicinity of a Natura 2000 area, the European network of nature protection areas established under the EU Habitats Directive of 1992 (see further below at paragraph 33). Most of them live there (permanently or on a part-time basis).", "6. On 15 October 1999, the National Rail Administration (Banverket; hereinafter \u201cthe NRA\u201d) applied to the Government for permission, under the Environmental Code (Milj\u00f6balken), to construct a 10 km long railway section in a river area in the north of Sweden (constituting the final section of a railway called \u201cBotniabanan\u201d, the total length of which is 190 km). The NRA presented some alternative railway stretches, all located in a specified \u201ccorridor\u201d, but recommended the one named \u201calternative east\u201d. The proposed railway construction concerned certain areas which were or were going to be part of Natura 2000.", "7. It appears that six of the present applicants own houses or land within the mentioned \u201ccorridor\u201d: Ms Carina Granberg, Ms Agneta Holmstr\u00f6m, Mr Gustaf H\u00e4rest\u00e5l, Mr Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6jer, Ms Inga-Britt H\u00f6jer, and Mr Christer Skoog. Ownership of Mr Skoog\u2019s property was transferred to Ms Granberg on 7 January 2011. The properties of the other twelve applicants \u2013 houses and land in their ownership or owned houses located on non-freehold sites \u2013 are situated outside the \u201ccorridor\u201d. The distance from their properties to the \u201ccorridor\u201d or the specific stretch of the railway fixed in later proceedings vary; the houses appear to be situated 300 \u2013 2500 metres away whereas the closest piece of land is located about 50 metres from the \u201ccorridor\u201d.", "8. On 12 June 2003 the Government, after having heard the European Commission, granted the application and allowed the construction of the railway in the proposed \u201ccorridor\u201d under the condition, inter alia, that the NRA adopt a railway plan before 1 July 2009 and also a specific plan for the realisation of the necessary environmental compensation measures in the Natura 2000 areas. The plan on compensation measures had to be presented to the Government before the railway plan was adopted. The Government stated, inter alia, that the activity could be permitted, despite its harmful effect on the environment in a Natura 2000 area, if there were no alternative solutions and the railway had to be constructed for reasons of public interest.", "9. A number of individual property owners, including three of the applicants in the present case \u2013 Ms Bring, Mr B\u00e4cklund and Mr Osterman \u2013 petitioned the Supreme Administrative Court (Regeringsr\u00e4tten) for a judicial review of the case and requested that the Government\u2019s decision be quashed. The property owners claimed that the decision contradicted Swedish law as well as applicable European Union law, including the Habitats Directive. It was argued, firstly, that the decision contravened the general rule in the Environmental Code on the site to be chosen for activities and installations that may affect human health or the environment. This aspect allegedly had a direct and clear bearing on their civil rights. Secondly, they asserted that the Government\u2019s decision violated Swedish regulations on nature conservation by failing to consider relevant alternative sites for the railway.", "10. On 1 December 2004 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the petitions for a judicial review because it was not possible to determine who should be considered an interested party at that stage of the railway planning. The exact route of the railway would not be established until the railway plan had been drawn up. Until then, it could not be assessed with any certainty who would be affected to the extent that they were entitled to bring an action or what account should be taken of their interests. Further stating that the parties affected to a sufficient extent by the future railway would be able to obtain a judicial review of the later decision to adopt the railway plan, the court refused the petitioners locus standi.", "11. One judge dissented, finding that the issue of locus standi in respect of each petitioner should be further investigated by the court in order to ensure that the individual interests were taken into account, having regard to the binding character of the Government\u2019s decision in the later railway planning proceedings.", "12. In 2003 and 2004 the NRA applied to the County Administrative Board (l\u00e4nsstyrelsen) in the County of V\u00e4sterbotten for a permit to construct the railway in the specific Natura 2000 area and to the Environmental Court (milj\u00f6domstolen) in Ume\u00e5 for permits to build two bridges.", "13. The County Administrative Board granted a construction permit for the railway by a decision of 14 October 2004, which was subsequently appealed against to the Environmental Court.", "14. The Environmental Court decided to examine the cases jointly. By judgments of 24 May 2005 and 13 June 2005, considering itself bound by the Government\u2019s decision of 12 June 2003 on the permissibility of the railway project, the court decided to grant all the permits requested by the NRA.", "15. On 15 June 2006 the Environmental Court of Appeal (Milj\u00f6\u00f6verdomstolen) in Stockholm quashed the Environmental Court\u2019s judgments and referred the cases back to the latter instance. The appellate court found that the Government\u2019s decision had not contained a detailed examination of measures necessary to compensate for environmental harm caused by the railway project, and that these issues had to be settled as part of the determination of the construction permit requests.", "16. On 26 April 2007 the Environmental Court decided anew to grant the permits requested by the NRA. The court considered itself bound by the Government\u2019s decision as to the permissibility of the railway project and thus limited its examination to the environmental compensation measures, as indicated by the decision of the Environmental Court of Appeal.", "17. Two applicants \u2013 Ms Granberg and Mr Skoog \u2013 appealed against the Environmental Court\u2019s judgment in so far as it concerned the permit for the railway construction. All applicants except Mr Osterman appealed against the part which concerned the permit to construct the bridges.", "18. By a judgment of 6 December 2007 the Environmental Court of Appeal affirmed the binding nature of the Government\u2019s permissibility decision and approved the construction of the railway and the bridges with certain added conditions.", "19. On 9 May 2008 the Supreme Court (H\u00f6gsta domstolen) refused leave to appeal and, thus, the Environmental Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment became final.", "20. On 21 June 2005 the NRA adopted a railway plan for the area in question.", "21. Twelve applicants \u2013 all but Ms Holmstr\u00f6m, Mr H\u00e4rest\u00e5l, Mr H\u00f6jer, Ms H\u00f6jer, Mr Sj\u00f6stedt and Mr Stenlund \u2013 appealed to the Government against the railway plan. They essentially complained of the specific stretch of the railway, invoking, inter alia, nuisance such as noise and vibrations affecting the enjoyment of their property.", "22. By a decision of 28 June 2007 the Government referred to its decision on permissibility of 12 June 2003. It found that the specific stretch chosen in the railway plan was situated within the permitted \u201ccorridor\u201d and thus rejected the appeals.", "23. All of the applicants and several other petitioners turned to the Supreme Administrative Court and requested that it, by way of a judicial review, order the quashing of the Government\u2019s decision. They claimed, inter alia, that, although their civil rights were affected by the planned railway, they had not had these rights considered and determined by a court, in violation of the Convention. As to the chosen location of the railway, they also asserted that the Government\u2019s decision was contrary to provisions of the Environmental Code and the EU Habitats Directive.", "24. On 10 December 2008 the Supreme Administrative Court, after having held a hearing in the case, rejected the petition, finding that the railway plan was in line with the Government\u2019s decision of 12 June 2003 on the permissibility of the railway project and that the proceedings for the adoption of the plan did not demonstrate any failings. The court considered that the question of permissibility of a railway project was within the power of the Government, which had to take into account public interests such as environmental, industrial, economic and regional policy. The Government\u2019s permissibility decision was binding for the subsequent proceedings in that courts and other decision-making bodies could not examine issues that had been determined by that decision. Thus, in the proceedings concerning the construction permits requested by the NRA, the various instances could decide on conditions and other details but not on the general permissibility as defined in the Government\u2019s decision. Similarly, in the third stage of the decision process \u2013 the adoption of the railway plan \u2013 it was for the authorities and courts to decide only on the precise location of the railway, within the area designated by the Government\u2019s decision. The Government had not been obliged to review its decision of 12 June 2003 on the permissibility of the railway project and the designation of the \u201ccorridor\u201d in which the railway could be located. These issues could not be examined in the third stage of the decision process. The Supreme Administrative Court further stated that, if private interests were affected by the location of a railway project, judicial review could be obtained by petitioning the court in proceedings against the Government\u2019s permissibility decision. The fact that the court, on 1 December 2004, had concluded that no individual petitioner could be considered to have locus standi in relation to the permissibility decision did not compel it to include in its current examination of the adoption of the railway plan the issues of permissibility of the project or its general location.", "25. One judge dissented, considering that the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s judgment contravened its decision of 1 December 2004. She noted, inter alia, that the adoption of a railway plan \u2013 as opposed to the construction permits \u2013 had direct consequences for the individual as it entailed a right for the railway company, under certain conditions, to expropriate land. Consequently, the court, in the instant case, should have examined all the objections presented by the appellants, including the claim that there were better alternative locations for the railway. According to the dissenting judge, a full judicial review had also been foreseen by the court in its earlier decision.", "26. It appears from the parties\u2019 observations in the case that at least ten of the applicants (including seven with houses or land situated outside the \u201ccorridor\u201d) have received some form of compensation as a consequence of the railway construction, either for land requisitioned or for reduced residential value or market value. In one case, the change to noise-reducing windows was partly paid by the NRA. It is not clear whether the other applicants requested compensation. In the vicinity of some properties, whose owners have not received compensation, noise barriers have been erected in order to keep the noise from the railway below the applicable target values."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
