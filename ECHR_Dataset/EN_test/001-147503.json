The relevant parts of the decision read as follows:", "\u201cMusayev Ibragim substantiated his request by claiming that his life had been threatened by the MNS of Azerbaijan.", "He confirmed his identity by [presenting his Azerbaijani passport] ...", "He refused to provide his military service identification card, stating that it was \u2018a state secret\u2019...", "Musayev I.G. reasoned the existence of a threat to his life ... by the fact that he had refused to comply with an order issued by the MNS to kill a person ...", "[He stated that] between 2010 and 2012 he had worked as a secret agent for the MNS. He refused to answer the question whether he had followed any secret service training in the MNS, since it was \u2018a state secret\u2019.", "Musayev Ibragim stated that ... as a result of his failure to comply with an order to \u2018kill a person\u2019 he had started to receive threats personally from the Minister of National Security ...

His employment by the MNS is not proven by any documents.", "During the check of his declared place of residence in Moscow ...

The applicant\u2019s representative, Mr S., complained against the decision to the Federal Migration Service (\u201cthe FMS\u201d). The complaint stated that the regional immigration authorities had failed to consider two facts: first, that the applicant had left Azerbaijan before the institution of criminal proceedings against him; and secondly, that given the reports of human-rights organisations about the practice of torture and other human-rights violations in Azerbaijan, the applicant would be exposed to those risks, especially in view of the political nature of his prosecution.", "17. On 4 July 2013 the FMS issued decision No. 1198 upholding the decision of the regional authorities. The relevant parts read as follows:", "\u201cIt must be observed that the applicant\u2019s statement that the reason for his presence in Russia is to seek asylum is not corroborated by the facts ... After arriving on 2 September 2013 he did not lodge his request until January 2013 after the period of his lawful stay [in Russia] had expired. Publications on the internet signed by him started to appear only in November 2012 (after leaving Azerbaijan and at the end of the period of lawful stay in Russia).", "The asylum seeker claims that he was an agent of the MNS, but does not provide any supporting documents and only refers to information on the internet as proof.", "The claim that since the spring of 2011 he has been persecuted by the leadership of the MNS as a result of his refusal to kill a woman ... has also not been proved.", "In the spring of 2011 he ... obtained a passport in his name for travelling abroad ... and until his arrival in Russia in September 2012 he repeatedly travelled outside Azerbaijan, including a trip to Iran in August 2012 with his wife.", "From Iran he returned with his wife to Azerbaijan, despite his allegation that his life was threatened there ... [and only one month] later left for Russia.", "The analysis of the decision by the MD FMS, the case file, the allegations of the asylum seeker, and information of the FMS and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the situation in Azerbaijan demonstrate that ... there are no reasonable grounds for [Mr Musayev\u2019s] alleged fear of persecution in Azerbaijan.\u201d", "18. On 8 August 2013 the applicant\u2019s representative, Mr S., appealed against the above decisions to the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow.

The applicant\u2019s representative, Mr S., challenged the authorisation in court. The complaint stated that the asylum proceedings were still pending and that the criminal prosecution of the applicant had a political nature, because he \u201cengages in human rights defence and reveals facts of human rights violations in Azerbaijan\u201d.", "22.

In the event of extradition the police of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic would subject Musayev to violence and torture ...", "The defence witness Mr M. stated that his son ... had started living with him in the village of Shopsha, Yaroslavl Region in August 2012, and that according to [an unidentified] colonel of the MNS his son was an agent of the security services ...", "The prosecution stated that the complaint should be dismissed, since all the arguments of the defence had been refuted during the extradition check ...", "[T]he court considers the extradition authorisation ... to be reasonable and lawful ...", "The arguments of the defence counsel that the asylum proceedings are not yet finished are erroneous.", "... The case materials demonstrate that the decision of the Federal Migration Service [to refuse asylum] of 21 April 2013 was considered lawful and upheld on appeal on 4 July 2013 ...", "The opinion of the complainant that Musayev I.G. must not be extradited to another State, since his criminal prosecution is of a political nature is arbitrary.", "The case file contains no evidence proving that Musayev I.G. was employed by the Ministry of National Security, any political party or human rights organisation. The statements of Musayev and his father that [the applicant] is being persecuted as a former agent of the MNS are unsubstantiated.", "The extradition request of the Prosecutor General of Azerbaijan guarantees that he will not be subjected to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and that the request does not pursue any political motives ...", "The court examined the materials submitted by the defence counsel about possible human rights violations in the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic.", "Having regard to the generally positive situation regarding respect for human rights in the State seeking extradition, the specific circumstances of the present case and the guarantees of the Azerbaijani authorities, the court does not consider that there are any reasonable grounds to believe that [the applicant would be subjected to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment]\u201d.", "24.
