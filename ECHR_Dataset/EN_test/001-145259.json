The applications were lodged by three Ukrainian nationals, Mrs Ganna Kostyantynivna Kolesnyk (\u201cthe first applicant\u201d), Mrs Larysa Oleksandrivna Navrotska (\u201cthe second applicant\u201d) and Mrs Svetlana Vyacheslavovna Fil (\u201cthe third applicant\u201d, collectively \u201cthe applicants\u201d). The applicants were born in 1978, 1977 and 1982, respectively, and live in Simeyiz, Vinnytsya and Donetsk, Ukraine.", "2. The applicants, who had been granted legal aid, were represented by Mr E. Leontyev, a lawyer practising in the town of Gorlivka, Ukraine. The Ukrainian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, most recently, Ms Nataly Sevostianova of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine.", "3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "4. On 5 April 2007 the first applicant gave birth to a child. She took three years of maternity leave, ending on 5 April 2010.", "5. On 10 July 2007 the first applicant applied to the relevant State authorities for a monthly allowance, to be paid to her in accordance with section 42 of the Law of Ukraine on Compulsory State Social Insurance in Case of Temporary Loss of Ability to Work and Childbirth and Funeral Expenses (\u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u201c\u041f\u0440\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u2019\u044f\u0437\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0446\u0456\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0445\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0443 \u0437\u0432\u2019\u044f\u0437\u043a\u0443 \u0437 \u0442\u0438\u043c\u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u043e\u044e \u0432\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u044e \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0456 \u0442\u0430 \u0432\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438, \u0437\u0443\u043c\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f\u043c \u0442\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f\u043c\u201d \u2013 hereafter \u201cthe Compulsory State Social Insurance Act\u201d - see paragraph 30 below). The allowance was awarded to her with effect from 21 June 2007 (the first day after the end of the initial period of maternity leave). Between June and November 2007 the first applicant received the following amounts: 43.01 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH) in June 2007; UAH 129.03 in July 2007; UAH 132.64 in August 2007; UAH 134.45 in September 2007; UAH 136.13 in October 2007; and UAH 140.05 in November 2007. Between December 2007 and April 2010 the first applicant was receiving UAH 144.10 (around 16-18 euros (EUR)) per month.", "6. In 2007-2009 the laws which set the amount of the allowance in question were modified by the State Budget Acts. On 9 July 2007 and 22 May 2008 the Constitutional Court of Ukraine found that the State Budget Acts for the years 2007 - 2008 could not validly amend the scope of rights and obligations set up in other legislation (see paragraph 46 below).", "7. In December 2008 the first applicant asked for her allowance to be recalculated in the light of the Constitutional Court decisions of 9 July 2007 and 22 May 2008. In reply the Yalta Town Council informed the first applicant that since \u201cthe Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine had not adopted a mechanism for recalculation of the child allowance, to make it compatible with the decision of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine\u201d, the recalculation could not be carried out. At the same time it noted that, according to the decision no. 1751 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine (see paragraph 34 below), the monthly child allowance was UAH 425 for the period between 1 May 2007 and 30 April 2008.", "8. On 12 February 2009 the Labour and Social Policy Ministry of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea informed the first applicant that she was entitled to a child allowance in accordance with the State Assistance (Families with Children) Act (\u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u00ab\u041f\u0440\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0443 \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0441\u0456\u043c\u2019\u044f\u043c \u0437 \u0434\u0456\u0442\u044c\u043c\u0438\u00bb) (see paragraph 32 below) to be paid between 21 June 2007 and 5 April 2010. The Ministry noted that as of 1 January 2009 the amount of allowance was UAH 144.10 whilst, \"pursuant to the decision of the Constitutional Court of 9 July 2007 the applicant would have received monthly payments of UAH 463 in July-September 2007 and UAH 470 in October-December 2007 which corresponds to the amount of the minimum subsistence level (\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0456\u043d\u0456\u043c\u0443\u043c) for a child aged six\". However, for the years 2007-09 the necessary financial provisions for these payments had not been not made, with the result that the applicant would continue to receive the sums provided by the State Assistance (Families with Children) act, as amended by the respective State Budget Acts.", "9. In April 2009 the first applicant instituted proceedings in the Yaltynsky Town Court against the Labour and Social Protection Department of the Yalta Town Council claiming, inter alia, UAH 10,878.99 in allegedly unpaid child allowance due to her for the period between 21 June 2007 and 30 April 2009 and requesting that an allowance in an amount not lower than the minimum subsistence level established by law for an able-bodied person (see paragraph 36 below) be paid to her until 5 April 2010. The first applicant indicated that she was insured under the obligatory social insurance scheme and was entitled to child allowance under sections 42 and 43 of the Compulsory State Social Insurance Act. However, decision no. 1751 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine which had been applied in her case, contradicted the above Act, even though the latter had higher legal force. The first applicant further noted that she had learned about the allegedly erroneous calculation of the amount of her child allowance from the media only in September 2008.", "10. On 9 June 2009 the court found that the first applicant was insured under the Compulsory State Social Insurance Act. Under section 43 of the Act the amount of child allowance paid could not be less than the amount of the minimum subsistence level established by law. The changes introduced by the State Budget Acts in 2007 and 2008, which provided for a reduction in the amount of the benefit, had been declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine on 9 July 2007 and 22 May 2008. Therefore, these changes were not applicable in the first applicant\u2019s case.", "11. The court further held that the first applicant had lodged before the court her claim for payment of the child allowance due to her in 2007 only in 2009, while the decision of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine of 9 July 2007 had been published on 27 July 2007. The first applicant should have learned about the breach of her rights on the latter date. As the first applicant requested recalculation of her child allowance in May 2009 only, she had missed the one-year time-limit provided for by the Code of Administrative Justice Procedure. The court allowed the first applicant\u2019s claims related to the period between May 2008 and May 2009 and awarded her UAH 5,278.70.", "12. On 24 March 2010 the Sevastopol Administrative Court of Appeal amended the decision of 9 June 2009. It found that the first applicant had had good reasons for missing the time-limit for lodging her claim. In particular, she had correctly tried to settle the dispute out of court by lodging her request for recalculation directly with the defendant first.", "13. The court held that the relevant provisions of the State Budget Acts for 2007 and 2008, which suspended (for 2007) and then revoked (with effect from 2008) section 43 of the Compulsory State Social Insurance Act, had been found to be unconstitutional on 9 July 2007 and 22 May 2008. The first applicant was insured and thus was entitled to a monthly child allowance in accordance with section 43 of the Compulsory State Social Insurance Act, which provided that the amount of the child allowance should not be lowers than the minimum subsistence level. The court found that the State Budget Act for 2007 set the minimum subsistence level for children aged up to six years as UAH 463 (between April 2007 and September 2007) and UAH 470 (between October and December 2007). In June-December 2007 the first applicant was paid UAH 859.41. Consequently, the first applicant was to be paid \u201cthe remaining UAH 2,714.59\u201d in child allowance for the period between 21 June 2007 and 31 December 2007.", "14. As for 2008 the court found that the first applicant\u2019s claims for the period between May and December 2008 (i.e. after the Constitutional Court decision of 22 May 2008) should be also granted. The State Budget Act for 2008 set for the minimum subsistence level for children aged up to six years as UAH 538 (between April and June 2008), UAH 540 (between July and September 2008) and UAH 557 (between October and December 2008). The first applicant received UAH 1,152 \u2013 UAH 144,10 x 8 months. The court awarded her the remaining UAH 3,215 for the period between 22 May and 31 December 2008 (538 x 2 + 540 x 3 + 557 x 3 \u2013 1,152).", "15. As for the first applicant\u2019s claims related to the 2009 payments, the court held that section 46 of the State Budget Act 2009 provided that the amount of child allowance provided for by the Compulsory State Social Insurance Act and by the State Assistance (Families with Children) Act had to be fixed by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. As the relevant provisions of the State Budget Act 2009 had not been declared unconstitutional and the allowance in question had paid to the first applicant in the amount determined by the Cabinet of Ministers\u2019 decision no. 57 (see paragraph 41 below), the court dismissed the first applicant\u2019s claim relating to the 2009 payments. The court held that the first applicant\u2019s claim for payment of an allowance up to 5 April 2010 could not be allowed, since it concerned future payments.", "16. The first applicant appealed in cassation, stating that she was insured and thus entitled to child allowance in an amount no lower than the minimum subsistence level for an able-bodied person as of 21 June 2007. She also noted that the Constitutional Court of Ukraine had already declared on numerous occasions that the State Budget Act could not introduce changes to other legal acts.", "17. On 19 July 2010 the Supreme Court of Ukraine found that there were no grounds to grant the first applicant leave to appeal on points of law.", "18. On 7 February 2008 the second applicant gave birth to a child. From 8 April 2008 she received UAH 130 a month in child allowance.", "19. On 3 March 2009 the second applicant lodged a claim before the Zamostyansky District Court. Relying on section 15 of the State Assistance (Families with Children) Act, the second applicant claimed that child allowance in an amount not less than the minimum subsistence level established by law was due to her for the period between 8 April 2008 and 7 February 2011. The second applicant also referred to Article 22 of the Constitution of Ukraine and the Constitutional Court decisions of 9 September 2007 and 22 May 2008, and argued that it was unconstitutional to amend an existing provision of the State Assistance (Families with Children) Act by virtue of the State Budget Act.", "20. On 13 April 2009 the Zamostyansky District Court found that the second applicant was insured, and therefore the Compulsory State Social Insurance Act was applicable to her. Despite this conclusion, the court relied on section 15 of the State Assistance (Families with Children) Act, which was modified by the State Budget Act 2008, and also, referring to the State Budget Act 2007, held that resources for financing child allowance payments had to be allocated by the State Budget. On these grounds, it dismissed the applicant\u2019s claims.", "21. On 17 June 2010 the Vinnyatsya Regional Court of Appeal upheld that decision. It held, however, that in the second applicant\u2019s case it was not the Compulsory State Social Insurance Act, which applied \u201cto temporarily disabled persons or in cases of birth or death\u201d, but the State Assistance (Families with Children) Act which was applicable, and that therefore the amount of child allowance had been calculated correctly.", "22. On 16 August 2010 the second applicant appealed in cassation.", "23. By letter of 19 November 2010 the Supreme Court informed the second applicant that since 9 September 2010 it had had no jurisdiction to examine administrative cases and that her appeal would be considered after the introduction of the necessary changes to the law.", "24. By letter of 6 March 2012 the Higher Administrative Court of Ukraine informed the second applicant that her case (no. K/9991/75865/11) was pending before that court.", "25. The second applicant\u2019s lawyer informed the Court that the Higher Administrative Court of Ukraine had rejected the second applicant\u2019s appeal in cassation on 31 May 2012. He submitted a copy of the decision, which was published in the General State Court Decisions Registry of Ukraine (\u0404\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0454\u0441\u0442\u0440 \u0441\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u0456\u0448\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438). The copy contains no mention of the second applicant\u2019s name (all personal information was replaced by the reference \u201cPerson 4\u201d) but makes reference to her case number (no. K/9991/75865/11).", "26. The Higher Administrative Court of Ukraine found, without any particular specification, that the second applicant was entitled to a child allowance under the State Assistance (Families with Children) Act and had been paid it in accordance with decision no. 1751 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.", "27. On 9 May 2009 the third applicant gave birth to a child. From 29 June 2009 she received UAH 130 a month in child allowance, payable until the child reached the age of three.", "28. On 11 June 2010 the Kirovsky District Court of Donetsk rejected the third applicant\u2019s claim against the Labour and Social Protection Department of the Kirovskiy District Council of Donetsk for payment of child allowance in an amount equal to the minimum subsistence level. It held that the amount of the allowance paid to her had been calculated correctly in accordance with the State Assistance (Families with Children) Act.", "29. On 13 August 2010 the Donetsk Regional Court of Appeal upheld that decision. It held that although section 43 of the Compulsory State Social Insurance Act was in force and applicable in the present case, the State Budget Acts of 2009 and 2010 provided that the amount of the allowance in question had to be agreed by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. The amount of the child allowance due to the third applicant had been calculated correctly, in accordance with the relevant decision of the Cabinet of Ministers. This court decision was not subject to appeal.", "30. The relevant provisions of the Act read as follows:", "Section 42. Right to a child allowance payable until the child attains the age of three", "\u201cAn insured person (a parent, an adoptive parent, a grandmother, a grandfather, another relative or a guardian) who has a child under his or her care has the right to child allowance payable until the child attains the age of three.", "Child allowance payable until the child attains the age of three is provided to an insured person in the form of an allowance during their three-year period of maternity leave and partially compensates the loss of salary (income) during this time.\u201d", "Section 43. Amount of allowance payable until the child attains the age of three", "\u201cChild allowance shall be paid to an insured person in the amount set by the board of the [Social Insurance] Fund but it shall be not lower than the amount of the minimum subsistence level established by law.\u201d", "31. The Transitional Provisions of this Act, adopted in 2001, stipulated that until the economic situation had stabilised the amount of the allowance would be determined every year by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine until it gradually reached the minimum subsistence level.", "32. The relevant provisions of the Act read as follows:", "Section 13. Right [to receive] child allowance until the child attains the age of three", "\u201cA person who is not insured under the obligatory State social insurance scheme, who has a child under his or her care has the right [to receive] child allowance until the child attains the age of three.\u201d", "Section 15. Amount of allowance payable until the child attains the age of three", "\u201cChild allowance shall be paid in an amount which shall be equal to the minimum subsistence level for a child aged up to six years.\u201d", "33. The Transitional Provisions of this Act, amended in 2005, provided that the allowance in question should amount to 50% (from 1 January 2008), 75% (from 1 January 2009) and 100% (from 1 January 2010) of the difference between the minimum subsistence level for an able-bodied person and the average monthly family income for one person for the previous six months.", "34. This decision established the amounts and methods of payments under the State Assistance (Families with Children) Act and, in particular, of child allowance payable to children under the age of three.", "35. The monthly subsistence level for children aged up to six years was gradually increased by the relevant laws from UAH 463 (around EUR 67) in June 2007 to UAH 911 (around EUR 89.51) in June 2012.", "36. The monthly minimum subsistence level for an able-bodied person changed from UAH 561 (around EUR 81.21) in June 2007 to UAH 1,094 (around EUR 107.49) in June 2012.", "37. By the State Budget Act 2007 section 43 of the Compulsory State Social Insurance Act and section 15 of the State Assistance (Families with Children) Act were suspended. Part 2 of section 56 of the State Budget Act 2007 provided that the allowance in question should not be less than UAH 90 for non-insured persons and not less than 23% of the minimum subsistence level for insured persons.", "38. On 9 July 2007 the Constitutional Court of Ukraine declared that part 2 of section 56 of the State Budget Act and the suspension of section 43 of the Compulsory State Social Insurance Act and of section 15 of the State Assistance (Families with Children) Act were unconstitutional.", "39. By the Law \u201cOn the State Budget 2008 and on the Introduction of Changes to Certain Laws\u201d (\u201cthe State Budget Act 2008\u201d) sections 42 and 43 of the Compulsory State Social Insurance Act were revoked. The Act also introduced changes to the State Assistance (Families with Children) Act. These changes provided that a person raising a child had the right to child allowance until the child attained the age of three. This allowance was paid in an amount equal to the difference between the minimum subsistence level and the average family income for the previous six months, but not less than UAH 130.", "40. At the same time the State Budget Act 2008 also provided that child allowance should amount to 50% (from 1 January 2008), 75% (from 1 January 2009) and 100% (from 1 January 2010) of the difference between the minimum subsistence level and the monthly average family income for one person for the previous six months, but should not be less than UAH 130.", "41. On 22 February 2008 decision no. 1751 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine was amended by decision no. 57. The latter decision provided that the allowance in question had to amount to the difference between 75% (from 1 January 2009) and 100% (from 1 January 2010) of the minimum subsistence level and the monthly average family income for one person for the previous six months, but should not be less than UAH 130.", "42. On 22 May 2008 the revocation of sections 42 and 43 of the Compulsory State Social Insurance Act was found unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine. The question of the constitutionality of amendments to the State Assistance (Families with Children) Act made by the State Budget Act 2008 was not raised before the Constitutional Court.", "43. The State Budget Acts 2009 and 2010 provided that the amount of the allowance in question should be established by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.", "44. The decision of 20 March 2002 concerned limitations on some social security payments introduced by the State Budget Act 2001. The Constitutional Court held that:", "\u201c... since for a considerable number of citizens of Ukraine privileges, compensation and safeguards, the right to which is provided by laws in force, are an addition to their main sources of support and a necessary component of the constitutional right to maintain a standard of living (Article 48 of the Constitution of Ukraine) no lower than the minimum subsistence level established by law (part 3 of Article 46 of the Constitution of Ukraine), any limitation of the content and ambit of this right by adoption of new laws or amendment of current laws is forbidden by Article 22 of the Constitution of Ukraine.\u201d", "45. The Constitutional Court of Ukraine reiterated this position in its decision of 1 December 2004 \u201cOn discontinuing or limiting privileges, compensation and guarantees\u201d.", "46. By its decisions of 9 July 2007 and 22 May 2008 the Constitutional Court stated as follows:", "Decision of 9 July 2007 (citizens\u2019 social protection case)", "\u201c...", "The analysis of the legislative activity of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine confirms that laws of Ukraine on granting privileges, compensation and guarantees, which form part of the constitutional right of citizens to social protection and to maintain a sufficient standard of living (Article 46 of the Constitution of Ukraine), are systematically suspended following the adoption of State Budget Acts.", "The suspension of laws [...] is to be done in accordance with the Constitution of Ukraine. [...] Therefore, the State Budget Act suspends, for a certain period of time, the functioning of the mechanism for implementing constitutional socio-economic rights, which leads to a limitation of the right to social protection. Systematic suspension by the State Budget Acts of the laws of Ukraine on granting privileges, compensations and guarantees in practice invalidates them.", "Suspension of laws which establish the rights and freedoms of citizens [...] is a limitation of those rights and freedoms and can take place only in cases provided for by the Constitution of Ukraine. [...]", "As a result of the temporary suspension of the valid laws of Ukraine on granting privileges, compensation and other forms of social guarantee, citizens\u2019 income, which should not be lower than the minimum subsistence level established by law (part 3 of Article 46 of the Constitution of Ukraine), falls and thus the right of everybody to a decent standard of living under Article 48 of the Constitution of Ukraine is breached.", "Therefore, in accordance with part 3 of Article 22 and Article 64 of the Constitution of Ukraine, the right of citizens to social protection and other socio-economic rights can be limited, including by way of suspension of laws or their parts, only in a military state or state of emergency for a limited period of time.", "This legal position has already been expressed by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine in its decision of 20 March 2002.", "3.2 [...]Failure of the State to comply with its social obligations with respect to certain persons puts those citizens in an unequal position and undermines the principle of an individual\u2019s trust in the State, which leads to a violation of the principles of the Welfare State and the rule of law ... .", "[...]", "The Constitutional Court of Ukraine has on numerous occasions [...] found that certain provisions of the State Budget Acts which suspend or limit privileges, compensation and guarantees contradicted the Constitution of Ukraine (decision of 20 March 2002 (case about privileges, compensation and guarantees); decision of 17 March 2004 (case about social protection of military personnel and employees of law enforcement bodies); decision of 1 December 2004 (case about suspension or limitation of privileges, compensation and guarantees); decision of 11 October 2005 (case about amount of pension and monthly living allowance).
