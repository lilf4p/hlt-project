The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Armavir. She is disabled and is confined to a wheelchair. She depends on her disability pension as a means of subsistence.", "7. On an unspecified date the applicant instituted proceedings against her neighbour, M., seeking to have dismantled a construction that the latter had built in 1987 inside the entrance of their multi-flat house for the purpose of insulating the building. In its place the applicant sought to install a wooden ramp for her wheelchair in order to facilitate her access to her flat, situated on the ground floor.", "8. It appears that during the court proceedings the applicant, who was not represented by a lawyer, modified her claim and asked for the construction in question not to be dismantled but to be allocated to her so that she could install a wooden ramp in its place.", "9. On 26 July 2007 the Armavir Regional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim, finding that the applicant had failed to substantiate with any proof, such as an expert opinion, that it was necessary and possible to dismantle the construction and that it was technically possible to install a wooden ramp in its place.", "10. On 1 August 2007 the applicant, still not represented, lodged an appeal.", "11. On 13 September 2007 the Civil Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim on appeal. The court found that the applicant\u2019s request to have the construction allocated to her was ill-founded since the construction had not been built by her and, moreover, belonged to the owner of the underlying plot of land. The court further referred to an opinion issued on 16 January 2007 by the Armavir Municipality, according to which it was technically preferable to build a wooden ramp from the balcony side of the applicant\u2019s flat rather than from the building\u2019s main entrance.", "12. On 7 November 2007 the applicant, still unrepresented, lodged an appeal on points of law with the Court of Cassation.", "13. By a letter of 12 November 2007 the Chief Registrar of the Court of Cassation returned the applicant\u2019s appeal, informing her that the appeal had not been admitted for examination as it had not been lodged by an advocate licensed to act before the Court of Cassation, pursuant to Article 223 of the Code of Civil Procedure (the CCP)."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
