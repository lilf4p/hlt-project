At the beginning of August 1995 the Croatian authorities announced their intention to take military action with the aim of regaining control over Krajina. The operation was codenamed \u201cStorm\u201d (Oluja) and took place from 4 to 7 August 1995. Before the military action, the vast majority of the population of Krajina fled Croatia.

Body no. 434 was also dug up and an identity card was found in the name of P.M. The remains were examined at the Institute for Forensic Medicine in Zagreb (Zavod za sudsku medicinu i kriminalistiku) and on 15 October 2002 an autopsy report was issued which concluded that the cause of death had been three wounds from shelling. On 24 November 2003 the third applicant identified the remains as those of her father, P.M.", "11.

On 25 August 2015 the police interviewed O.M. and S.M., residents of \u017degar.", "O.M. said that he had never heard of someone being killed in the \u201cMili\u0107a\u201d cave even though he had lived all his life in the area. He also said that during Operation Storm five people from the settlement called Mili\u0107i, part of the village of \u017degar, had been killed, including P.M. They had all been members of the paramilitary forces and had been armed. He had heard that they all had perished in rocky areas of the village but did not know the cause and manner of their deaths.", "S.M. had no information about the possible perpetrators of the alleged crime in question.", "15.

On 22 January 2016 the Zadar County State Attorney\u2019s Office informed its counterpart in Split County that it had not been able to confirm the allegations made in the anonymous letter of 11 August 2015 as there was no indication that twelve elderly people had been killed in the \u201cMili\u0107a\u201d cave. However, five members of the Serbian paramilitary forces had been killed during Operation Storm, including P.M. Enquiries had therefore been stopped since the information given in the anonymous letter had proved to be unreliable.", "20.

It had also not been established that he had been killed by members of the Croatian army or police in areas where there had been no operations related to the war. In addition, the claim had become statutebarred. During the proceedings information was obtained from the archives of the Ministry of Defence showing that the Croatian army had entered the area in question on 6 August 1995, whereas P.M. had been killed on 5 August 1995. The first-instance court also accepted the statement of the witness O.M., who said that the village of \u017degar had been shelled on 5 August 1995.", "The first-instance judgment was upheld by the Zagreb County Court on 21 September 2010.", "On 10 June 2014 the Supreme Court upheld the lower courts\u2019 judgments in respect of the ruling that the applicants\u2019 claim had become statute-barred.", "21.
