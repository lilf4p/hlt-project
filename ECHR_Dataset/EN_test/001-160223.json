The applicants were born in 1962 and 1994 respectively and live in Makhachkala, Republic of Dagestan, Russia. They are the mother and the wife of Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev, who was born in 1990.", "6. At the material time Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev and the applicants, along with other relatives, lived together at 115A Magomed Dalgata Street, Makhachkala, Dagestan. According to the applicants for about eighteen months prior to the events in question Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev had been suspected of illegal activities and had been followed by Dagestani law enforcement agencies, in particular by the Centre against Extremism of the Dagestan Ministry of the Interior (\u201cthe CPE\u201d) (\u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440 \u043f\u043e \u0411\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0431\u0435 \u0441 \u042d\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0437\u043c\u043e\u043c \u041c\u0412\u0414 \u043f\u043e \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0435 \u0414\u0430\u0433\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d (\u0426\u041f\u042d)).", "7. At about 6 p.m. on 20 May 2013 Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev drove in his white GAZ Volga-3110 car along Engelsa Street to visit his relatives, who lived about a ten-minute drive from his house in Makhachkala. At about 6.45 p.m. his car was stopped and he was abducted by a group of eight armed men who were driving two civilian vehicles: a silver-coloured VAZ-21014, which had a registration number which partially read \u201cA067\u201d, and a black VAZ-21099. The men were dressed in civilian clothing and were masked. The applicants\u2019 relative, Mr Ub.Ub., called Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev during the abduction and upon hearing him screaming immediately informed the applicants that there was a problem. Directly after that Mr Ub.Ub., together with the first applicant, went along Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev\u2019s route and found his car in the street with two police vehicles and officers from the Sovetskiy district police station in Makhachkala (\u201cthe Sovetskiy ROVD\u201d) (\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b \u0432\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u043b (\u0420\u041e\u0412\u0414)) next to it. The police told the first applicant and Mr Ub.Ub. that they had arrived a couple of minutes ago and that a few minutes prior to their arrival a man had been abducted. They told the applicant and Mr Ub.Ub. to wait at home for a telephone call from the police and took Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev\u2019s car to the premises of the Sovetskiy ROVD.", "8. Approximately twenty days after the abduction, that is to say between 9 and 12 June 2013, police officers from the CPE searched the applicants\u2019 house.", "9. About a month after the events, on or around 20 June 2013, the applicants obtained video footage of the abduction from a local resident (see paragraph 23 below). They recognised one of the abductors by his voice as the CPE officer named \u201cShakir\u201d and informed the authorities of this.", "10. On 1 July 2013 a burnt male corpse was found five kilometres from Gurbuki village in the Karabudakhkenstrkiy district in Dagestan.", "11. On 23 December 2013 the body was identified by the authorities as that of Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev (see paragraph 53 below). The applicants and their relatives disagreed with that conclusion (see paragraphs 54-55 below).", "12. According to the applicants, they have had no news of Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev since his abduction.", "13. The Government did not dispute the facts as presented by the applicants, but denied any involvement of State agents in the incident.", "14. In reply to the Court\u2019s first request for a copy of the contents of the investigation file, the Government provided ninety-eight copied pages of documents from it reflecting steps taken by the authorities between 14 June and 26 October 2013.", "15. In reply to the Court\u2019s further request for a copy of the contents of the investigation file, the Government submitted 372 copied pages of the relevant documents, some of which were illegible. The contents of the legible documents can be summarised as follows.", "16. Immediately after the incident the applicants went to the Sovetskiy ROVD, informed the police of the abduction and gave statements to the police investigator. They also conducted their own search for eye witnesses to the incident and found several of them in nearby shops and blocks of flats. The applicants informed the investigators of their findings (see, for example, paragraph 23 below).", "17. On 20 May and then on 24 May 2013 the applicants complained of the abduction to the Sovetskiy district investigations department (\u201cthe investigations department\u201d). In their second complaint they stated that, in their opinion, the police were wilfully postponing steps in the investigation of the incident.", "18. On 3 June 2013 the investigators examined the crime scene. No evidence was collected.", "19. On 6 June 2013 the investigators examined the car from which Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev had been abducted; two fingerprints were collected from the chassis of the vehicle. On the same date a forensic examination of the fingerprints was ordered.", "20. On 14 June 2013 the investigations department opened criminal case no. 302564 into the abduction. The applicants were informed thereof.", "21. On 18 June 2013 the investigators granted Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev\u2019s father, Mr A.A., victim status in the criminal case and questioned him. His statement was similar to the applicants\u2019 account submitted to the Court. The witness stated, amongst other things, that he had not witnessed the abduction and had learnt of it from his relatives. According to the witness, his son had no unpaid debts or personal enemies and had the mobile telephone number 8-903-481-61-47.", "22. On 18 June 2013 the investigators questioned Mr Ub.Ub. whose statement concerning the incident was similar to the applicants\u2019 account before the Court.", "23. According to the applicants, shortly after their initial complaint to the authorities they identified witnesses to the incident and informed the investigators accordingly. As a result, on 21 June 2013 the investigators questioned Mr Ma.Ma. who stated that at about 6.45 p.m. on 20 May 2013 he had been smoking on his balcony at 3 Engelsa Street when he had heard men arguing. He had looked out and seen a group of six or seven masked men with pistols in their hands. Four of those men had been trying to pull the driver out of a white GAZ Volga-3110 car but the latter had been resisting. Then the men had started beating him and had somehow managed to pull him from his seat into the back seat of the car. Three of them had got inside the vehicle. In about two or three minutes the masked men had carried the immobilised driver out of the car and put him in a silvercoloured VAZ-2114. Then all of the masked men had driven off in that car and a black VAZ-21099 car. Immediately afterwards the witness had gone outside and asked a passerby to call the police. In about five minutes the police had arrived at the scene. According to the witness, he had recorded the abduction on his mobile telephone camera and then copied it to a CD.", "24. On the same date, 21 June 2013, the investigators seized the abduction footage made by Mr Ma.Ma. On 25 June 2013 they examined the video, the contents of which were similar to the applicants\u2019 account of the abduction submitted to the Court.", "25. On 25 June 2013 the investigators questioned the second applicant\u2019s mother, Ms G.G., whose statement concerning the abduction was similar to the applicants\u2019 account before the Court. She had not witnessed the incident and had learnt of it from her relatives.", "26. On the same date, 25 June 2013, the investigators questioned the first applicant, whose statement was similar to the applicants\u2019 submission before the Court. In addition the investigators obtained samples of the first applicant\u2019s saliva for DNA testing and for its database.", "27. On 20 August 2013 the investigators ordered a comparison of the first applicant\u2019s DNA samples with those from the DNA database.", "28. On 30 August 2013 the investigators again questioned the first applicant who stated that in June and July 2013 she had received text messages on her telephone from two unknown numbers. The first message contained the following:", "\u201cCongratulations, your son became a shahid on the path of jihad in the Karabudakhkenstrkiy district ... May Allah accept his shahada and take him to the gardens of Firdous. Allahu Akbar!\u201d", "The second message contained the following:", "\u201c...Your son and son-in-law were set up by your neighbour Makhmud who worked for the 7th department [of the police]. If you don\u2019t believe it, have your men follow him. I could not do nothing about it as I have got nobody who could help me eliminate him. This beast spares no one. I hope you will believe me as I have got no other way out. My brother was the only tower of strength in my life. Friend.\u201d", "29. On the same date, 30 August 2013, the investigators seized the first applicant\u2019s mobile telephone to examine the above messages. It was established that the first message had been received on 15 June 2013 from a mobile telephone located that day in Popovicha Street in Makhachkala; the second message \u2013 received on 20 July 2013 \u2013 came from a different telephone number.", "30. On 5 September 2013 the investigators requested the Sovetskiy District Court in Makhachkala to grant them permission to obtain from the relevant mobile phone operator the call logs of Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev\u2019s telephone number (8-903-481-61-47) between 20 April and 1 September 2013.", "31. On 9 September 2013 the investigators received the court\u2019s permission and examined the call logs of Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev\u2019s telephone calls. According to the logs, at about 6.35 p.m. on 20 May 2013 he had received a telephone call from Mr Ub.Ub and after that the handset had been switched off. On 16 August 2013 a five-second call had been received on Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev\u2019s number; the caller had been located in the area of Dachi in Makhachkala.", "32. On 9 September 2013 the investigators again questioned the first applicant who stated that on the morning of 5 September 2013 she had received a call on her mobile telephone from a man who had not introduced himself but had stated that he was an officer of the Federal Security Service (\u201cthe FSB\u201d) (\u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0421\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0431\u0430 \u0411\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 (\u0424\u0421\u0411)) and that he was holding Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev. The man, who had called from 8988-059-41-98, had told her that he would release her son in one day in exchange for 250,000 Russian roubles (RUB). The applicant had passed the telephone to her husband who had told the man they had had only RUB 150,000 and that they would pay RUB 50,000 at once and then RUB 100,000 after their son\u2019s release. The man had told them that Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev was being held about a ten to twelve hour drive from Makhachkala and that he was in a bad state of health. Between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. on that date (5 September 2013) the first applicant\u2019s husband and the man had called each other several times. The applicant\u2019s husband had been ordered to deposit RUB 50,000 in the account of mobile telephone number 8-964-519-62-69, which he had done on the same day. The man had confirmed receipt of the money and told the applicant and her husband to wait for his call. But he had not called back and his telephone number had been disconnected since 5 September 2013.", "33. On 25 September 2013 the forensic experts informed the investigators that the fingerprints collected from Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev\u2019s car (see paragraph 19 above) were not fit for identification. The applicants were informed thereof on 21 December 2013.", "34. On 30 September 2013 the investigators requested that the Sovetskiy District Court in Makhachkala grant them permission to obtain the call logs of telephone number 8-988-059-41-98 (used by the alleged FSB officer on 5 September 2013) between 1 August and 30 September 2013. Permission was received on 4 October 2013.", "35. On 7 October 2013 the investigators searched Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev\u2019s house. No evidence was collected.", "36. On 7 October 2013 the investigators questioned the second applicant whose statement concerning the abduction was similar to that submitted by the applicants to the Court. She had not witnessed the incident but had learnt of it from her relatives.", "37. On 9 October 2013 the investigators received the call logs of the telephone number 8-988-059-41-98. According to these logs, the caller who had contacted the first applicant and her husband on 5 September 2013 (see paragraph 32 above) had been located in Volgograd.", "38. On 10 October 2013 the first applicant requested the investigators to order an expert analysis of the voice of one of the abductors from the video footage of the incident (see paragraph 23 above); according to her, Mr Ub.Ub. had identified that voice as belonging to a Dagestan CPE officer named Shakir whom he would be able to identify if necessary. The applicant requested that the investigators examine the video and compare the abductor\u2019s voice to that of Shakir.", "39. On 16 October 2013 the investigators granted the first applicant\u2019s request and ordered that steps be taken to identify the CPE officer Shakir and to analyse the voice on the video. The applicants were informed thereof.", "40. On 26 October 2013 the investigators questioned Mr T.G. who stated that he lived next to the scene of the abduction but had not witnessed it and learnt of it from his neighbours.", "41. On 28 October 2013 the investigators questioned police officer A.A. who stated that on 20 May 2013 he had been on duty at the Sovetskiy ROVD and had been called to the abduction scene. According to the witness, the investigators had examined the crime scene and had towed away the white GAZ Volga-3110 car left behind after the abduction to their police station. After about a month the car had been picked up by an unnamed individual.", "42. On 1 November 2013 the investigators questioned Shakir N., an officer with the Dagestan CPE, who stated that he did not have information pertaining to the abduction, but that he had participated in the search of the applicants\u2019 house in June 2013 (see paragraph 8 above). The witness also confirmed that in June 2013, about two days after the search, he had spoken with Mr Ub.Ub. who had visited the CPE with his son Mr A.Ub., who had been suspected of involvement in illegal armed groups. Mr Ub.Ub. had requested his assistance in the criminal case against his son Mr A.Ub. but the witness had refused to help him. Due to the passage of time the witness could not recall where he had been on the evening of 20 May 2013 but stated that he had not met Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev and had not participated in a special operation against him. The witness\u2019 mobile telephone number was 8-967-395-69-75 and he had been using that number since June 2012.", "43. On 3 November 2013 the investigators again questioned the first applicant who stated that, in her opinion, her son had been abducted by special forces servicemen or law-enforcement officers as they had suspected Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev of aiding members of illegal armed groups. Twenty-four days after the abduction the CPE officers had searched her house (see paragraph 8 above). According to the applicant, Mr Ub.Ub. had met officer Shakir in the middle of June when he had gone to the CPE with his son.", "44. On 5 November 2013 the investigators received the call logs of the telephone number used for the deposit of RUB 50,000 (see paragaph 32 above). According to the list, on 5 September 2013 the caller had been located in Volgograd, Russia.", "45. On 19 November 2013 the investigators ordered an expert analysis of the voices in the abduction video (see paragraph 23 above). It can be seen from the documents submitted that on an unspecified date between 19 and 28 November 2013 the experts concluded that the voice on the footage was not fit for identification (see paragraph 47 below).", "46. On 24 or 25 November 2013 the investigators requested the Sovetskiy District Court in Makhachkala to grant them permission to obtain the call logs for between 10 a.m. and 11 p.m. on 20 May 2013 from the telephone number belonging to officer Shakir N. (see paragraph 42 above). This was granted on 28 November 2013.", "47. On 28 November 2013 the Dagestan Ministry of the Interior conducted an internal inquiry into the applicants\u2019 allegations of the involvement of the CPE officers in the abduction and concluded, amongst other things, the following:", "\u201c... On 20 May 2013 A.A. complained of the abduction of his son Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev to the Investigations Department ...", "... According to the witness statements of the first applicant, Mr R.M., Mr Ub.Ub. and Mr A.Ub., enclosed with the complaint, officers of the CPE were involved in the abduction ... In their statements Mr Ub.Ub. and Mr A.A. directly indicate the CPE officers Ra.M. and Shakir; the latter they had been able to identify from the video posted on Youtube under the title \u201cAbduction of Mr S. Abakargadzhiyev\u201d.", "According to the statement of the CPE operational search officer Shakir N. given to the inquiry, ... in June 2013 he had participated with his colleagues from the CPE in the search of Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev\u2019s home ... After the search, prior to the departure, he and his colleagues had asked Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev\u2019s relatives to ensure that Mr A.Ub. would appear at the CPE. The latter, who had been related to Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev, had been listed in the CPE\u2019s database as a supporter of terrorist groups, had been told to report to the CPE to help with enquiries ... several days later Mr A.Ub. had been arrested and charged with the same crimes for which he had been investigated. After the arrest, the father of Mr A.Ub., Mr Ub.Ub., had asked the witness and Captain Ra.M. to assist him in persuading the authorities to be lenient towards his son, but his requests had been refused by the officers ... On the date of Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev\u2019s abduction the witness had taken a detainee, Mr M.D., to the court ... he had had nothing to do with the abduction. In addition, the witness explained that Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev had been an ardent supporter of Wahabiism and on several occasions had aided members of Dagestani terrorist groups, in particular, Mr S.Gu., and had participated in the attack on Dagestan traffic police officers near Agachul in February 2013 ...", "When questioned, the head of the operational search divison of the Dagestan CPE, Captain Ra.M., confirmed the above statement and explained that neither he nor his subordinate officers had had anything to do with the abduction. Mr Ub.Ub. had told lies about them as he and the servicemen of his department had arrested his son Mr A.Ub. in connection with the investigation of criminal case no. 30284.", "According to the evidence submitted by the CPE, they had obtained information concerning planned attempts on the lives of law-enforcement officers committed by Mr S.G., Mr A.Kh., Mr G.A. and Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev on 6 February 2013. The CPE officers did not arrest or detain Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev and no operational measures were taken against him...", "... It can be seen from the case file that according to the expert analysis of the video \u201cAbduction of S. Abakargadzhiyev\u201d it was imposssible to analyse and identify the voices therein ...", "Thus, the internal inquiry was not able to verify the first applicant\u2019s complaints concerning the unlawful actions of the CPE officers owing to significant discrepancies between the statements of those questioned during the inquiry; those discrepancies could be resolved only within the framework of a criminal case ...\u201d", "48. On 4 December 2013 the investigators received the call logs of officer Shakir N.\u2019s mobile telephone for 20 May 2013, according to which on that date his telephone had been located in Makhachkala.", "49. On 12 December 2013 the investigators questioned forensic expert Mr M.U., who had fingerprinted the white GAZ Volga-3110 car (see paragraphs 19 and 33 above). According to the witness, nobody else had touched the vehicle until after the examination.", "50. On 30 December 2013 the investigation was suspended. The applicants were informed thereof.", "51. On 28 January 2014 the investigation was resumed and the applicants were informed accordingly. The decision stated, amongst other things, the following:", "\u201c... the investigation established that Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev\u2019s corpse had been found five kilometres north-west of Gurbuki village ... In connection with this, on 1 July 2013 the Kaspiysk Investigations Department opened criminal case no. 329105 ...\u201d", "52. On 29 January 2014 the investigators examined the contents of criminal case file no. 329105. According to the contents, there was a 99.93% DNA match between the DNA of the burnt corpse and that of the first applicant taken from the DNA database, as shown by the results of a forensic examination of 23 December 2013.", "53. On 3 February 2014, having established that the burnt body found on 1 July 2013 had been that of Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev, the investigations in criminal cases nos. 302564 and 329105 were joined by the investigators under the number 302564. The decision stated that the body had been found in a VAZ-2107 vehicle in which a home-made explosive device had been detonated.", "54. On an unspecified date between February and March 2014 the investigators asked the first applicant to identify the body found on 1 July 2013. According to the applicant, she was not shown the actual corpse, but a photograph of it. She was able to tell from the photograph that it was not the body of her son Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev: according to the police, the corpse had at least five gold teeth; Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev did not have any.", "55. On 12 March 2014 the first applicant\u2019s husband asked the investigators to question him and the first applicant again about the circumstances of the abduction, to order another expert forensic examination of the corpse and to further examine and identify the voice of Shakir N. recorded by Mr Ub.Ub. The outcome of this request is unknown.", "56. It appears from the documents submitted that the proceedings are still pending.", "63. The applicant maintained that it was beyond reasonable doubt that the men who had abducted their relative Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev on 20 May 2013 had been State agents. In support of their allegation they referred to the following: the abduction had taken place in broad daylight, in an area surrounded by CCTV cameras, in the presence of witnesses; the perpetrators had acted openly, without fear of arrest by law-enforcement authorities; the authorities had wilfully delayed the investigation of the incident by conducting, for instance, the crime scene examination almost two weeks after the applicants\u2019 complaints about it (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above) and by taking further steps either belatedly or with major deficiences (see, for example, paragraphs 19 and 33 above); the CPE officer Shakir N. had been present in the vicinity of the abduction scene during the incident (see paragraphs 38 and 48 above) and the applicants had informed the investigators of his and his colleagues\u2019 alleged involvement in the crime; Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev had been suspected of involvement in illegal activities and, therefore, the authorities had had motives for his abduction (see paragraphs 38, 43 and 47 above). The applicants also referred to a number of abductions allegedly perpetrated by State authorities in Dagestan between 2011 and 2012 in similar circumstances, where some of the abducted men had subsequently been found in State custody.", "64. The Government denied any involvement of State agents in the events. In particular, they stated that only in October 2013 had the first applicant alleged that law-enforcement officers had been involved in the incident (see paragraph 38 above).", "65. The Court points out that a number of principles have been developed in its case-law as regards applications in which it is faced with the task of establishing facts on which the parties disagree. As to the facts that are in dispute, the Court reiterates its jurisprudence requiring the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d in its assessment of evidence (see Av\u015far v. Turkey, no. 25657/94, \u00a7 282, ECHR 2001-VII). Such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. In this context, the conduct of the parties when evidence is being obtained has to be taken into account (see Tani\u015f and Others v. Turkey, no. 65899/01, \u00a7 160, ECHR 2005VIII).", "66. The Court is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and recognises that it must be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (see, for example, McKerr v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 28883/95, 4 April 2000). Nonetheless, where allegations are made under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, the Court must apply a particularly thorough scrutiny (see, mutatis mutandis, Ribitsch v. Austria, 4 December 1995, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 336, and Av\u015far, cited above, \u00a7 283) even if certain domestic proceedings and investigations have already taken place.", "67. The Court reiterates that it has noted the difficulties for applicants to obtain the necessary evidence in support of allegations in cases where the respondent Government are in possession of the relevant documentation and fail to submit it. Where the applicant makes out a prima facie case and the Court is prevented from reaching factual conclusions owing to the lack of such documents, it is for the Government to argue conclusively why the documents in question cannot serve to corroborate the allegations made by the applicants, or to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation as to how the events in question occurred. The burden of proof is thus shifted to the Government and if they fail in their arguments, issues will arise under Article 2 and/or Article 3 of the Convention (see To\u011fcu v. Turkey, no. 27601/95, \u00a7 95, 31 May 2005, and Akkum and Others v. Turkey, no. 21894/93, \u00a7 211, ECHR 2005II).", "68. The Court notes that in reply to its request for a copy of the investigation file into the abduction of Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev the Government produced the relevant documents from the file (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above).", "69. The Court has found the Russian State authorities responsible for a number of extra-judicial executions or disappearances of civilians perpetrated in the Chechen Republic at the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s, even in the absence of final conclusions from the domestic investigation (see Khashiyev and Akayeva v. Russia, nos. 57942/00 and 57945/00, 24 February 2005; Luluyev and Others v. Russia, no. 69480/01, ECHR 2006-XIII; Estamirov and Others v. Russia, no. 60272/00, 12 October 2006; and Baysayeva v. Russia, no. 74237/01, 5 April 2007). It has done so taking into account the length of time during which the applicants had not had any news of their missing relatives and on the basis of witness statements and other documents attesting to the presence of military or security personnel in the area concerned at the relevant time. It has relied on references to military vehicles and equipment, on witness accounts, on other information on security operations and on the undisputed effective control of the areas in question by the Russian military. On that basis, it has concluded that the areas in question were \u201cwithin the exclusive control of the authorities of the State\u201d in view of the military or security operations being conducted there and the presence of servicemen (see, mutatis mutandis, Akkum, cited above, \u00a7 211, and Zubayrayev v. Russia, no. 67797/01, \u00a7 82, 10 January 2008).", "70. However, in the present case the circumstances in which the events occurred do not warrant an unequivocal conclusion that State agents were responsible for the abduction of the applicants\u2019 relative for the following reasons. As regards the general background, the events complained of took place not in Chechnya, but in Dagestan in May 2013, and there was neither a curfew in place nor any restrictions on driving civilian vehicles. Noting that the applicants\u2019 version of the events was based on the statements of those who had not witnessed the abduction themselves, except for the statement of Mr Ma.Ma., that the video of the abduction had not assisted in the identification of the culprits (see paragraphs 24 and 45 above) and taking into account that the abductors drove ordinary vehicles and were wearing balaclavas and civilian clothing, the Court has little evidence to rely upon. However, bearing in mind that after the events the applicants received information alleging knowledge of their relative\u2019s whereabouts which they submitted to the authorities with a delay varying from several days to several weeks (see, for example, paragraphs 28 and 32 above), along with the subsequent discovery of the burnt body and the experts\u2019 evaluation concerning its identity (see paragraphs 52 and 53 above), the Court is not persuaded that the abduction of the applicants\u2019 relative by State agents is the only possible explanation of the events in question.", "71. Accordingly, the information in the Court\u2019s possession does not suffice to establish that the perpetrators belonged to the security forces or that a \u201csecurity operation\u201d had been carried out in respect of Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev.", "72. To sum up, it has not been established to the required standard of proof that State agents were implicated in the disappearance of Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev; nor does the Court consider that the burden of proof can be entirely shifted to the Government."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
