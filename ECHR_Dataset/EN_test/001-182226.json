The second applicant was found guilty of the breach of the established procedure for the conduct of public events committed by a participant, an offence punishable under Article 20.2 \u00a7 5 of the CAO. His fine was reduced to RUB 10,000 (about EUR 233 at the time)."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["11", "5", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["11-1", "5-1", "6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
