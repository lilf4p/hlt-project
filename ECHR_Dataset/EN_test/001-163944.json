The applicant, Mr Miros\u0142aw Wy\u017cga, is a Polish national who was born in 1976 and lives in Krak\u00f3w. He was represented before the Court by Mr J. Krupa, a lawyer practising in Krak\u00f3w.", "2. The Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mrs J. Chrzanowska of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs", "3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "4. On an unknown date the applicant was charged with several offences and in particular uttering threats (committed mostly in 2008).", "5. On 10 July 2008 the Krak\u00f3w District Prosecutor asked the Krak\u00f3w District Court to remand the applicant in custody. The prosecutor indicated that the applicant had failed to report for a court-ordered psychiatric observation. The applicant was arrested and placed in the hospital on 18 June 2008. However, he escaped two days later.", "6. The applicant was remanded in custody on 31 August 2008 and placed in the psychiatric ward of the Krak\u00f3w Remand Centre Hospital. Between 22 September 2008 and 3 November 2008 he was under psychiatric observation. On 19 November 2008 two expert psychiatrists gave an opinion and determined that the applicant was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. They observed that the applicant should be placed in a psychiatric hospital as there was a very high probability that he would commit another, similar offence.", "7. On 9 March 2009 the Krak\u00f3w District Court gave a decision and discontinued the criminal proceedings against the applicant. The court, referring to the experts\u2019 opinion, established that the applicant could not be held criminally responsible as he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. It ordered that the applicant be placed in a psychiatric hospital. On 28 April 2009 the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court upheld that decision.", "8. The applicant\u2019s remand in custody was subsequently extended. On 6 May 2009 a doctor confirmed that the applicant could be treated in the hospital wing of the detention facility until he could be transferred to a psychiatric hospital.", "9. On 17 June 2009 the Psychiatric Commission on Preventive Measures (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) ruled that the applicant should be placed in the Jaros\u0142aw Psychiatric Hospital. On 22 July 2009 the Krak\u00f3w District Court asked the Commission to indicate the Krak\u00f3w Babinski Psychiatric Hospital (\u201cBabinski Hospital\u201d) as the hospital where the applicant should be placed, since sending him to the Jaros\u0142aw Hospital would make it difficult for him to maintain contact with his family. On the same day, the Commission recommended Babinski Hospital.", "10. On 24 September 2009 the applicant was transferred from the detention centre to Babinski Hospital.", "11. On 4 March 2010 the Krak\u00f3w District Court, citing an expert opinion of 18 January 2010, confirmed that the applicant\u2019s condition had not changed and that it was necessary to keep him in the hospital. The applicant appealed. On 28 May 2010 the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court upheld the district court\u2019s decision.", "12. Meanwhile, another set of criminal proceedings against the applicant (charges of computer hacking committed in 2003) was discontinued by the Krak\u00f3w District Court on 27 May 2010. The court held that the applicant could not be held criminally responsible. It further considered, citing a psychiatric opinion of 13 April 2010 given by expert psychiatrists D.W. and S.T. that the applicant needed constant pharmacological treatment but he could be treated outside a psychiatric hospital.", "13. At a session held on 22 October 2010 the Krak\u00f3w District Court confirmed that the applicant\u2019s condition had not changed. Its decision given on that day was identical to that of 4 March 2010. The court examined an expert opinion of 16 July 2010, signed by two psychiatrists (including D.W.) and two psychologists, who confirmed that the applicant should continue to be treated in a psychiatric hospital. The court also refused a request by the applicant\u2019s lawyer for experts to be appointed from outside the Krak\u00f3w region. It further noted that the two expert opinions (of April and July 2010) could not be compared, as different circumstances had been examined in these two sets of proceedings.", "14. The applicant\u2019s lawyer appealed against this decision, claiming that D.W.\u2019s opinions were contradictory and that it had not been reliably shown that the applicant\u2019s continued detention was necessary. On 10 December 2010 the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court upheld the district court\u2019s decision, concurring that the applicant\u2019s confinement should be extended.", "15. On 21 April and 11 October 2011 the Krak\u00f3w District Court again extended the applicant\u2019s detention in a psychiatric hospital. These decisions were identical to the two previous decisions. However, the court referred to fresh experts\u2019 opinions, of 14 January and 14 July 2011 respectively. These decisions were upheld on 11 July and 15 December 2011 by the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court.", "16. On 27 January 2012 the Krak\u00f3w District Court confirmed that the applicant\u2019s detention in a psychiatric hospital should be continued, basing this decision on an opinion of 12 January 2012. The court referred to the applicant\u2019s attempted escape of 11 January 2012. The applicant\u2019s appeal was dismissed by the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court on 29 February 2012.", "17. On 23 May 2012 expert psychiatrists confirmed that the applicant should continue to be treated in hospital, as he was still completely uncritical as regards the acts he had committed and his illness.", "18. On 11 June 2012 the Krak\u00f3w District Court confirmed that the applicant\u2019s detention in a psychiatric hospital should be continued. The court cited a fresh expert report and the applicant\u2019s attempted escape of 11 January 2012. On 30 July 2012 the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court upheld the district court\u2019s decision.", "19. On 3 December 2012 the Krak\u00f3w District Court, on the basis of an experts\u2019 opinion of 23 November 2012, held that the applicant\u2019s detention in a psychiatric hospital should be continued. An appeal against this by the applicant was dismissed by the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court on 25 January 2013.", "20. In their opinions of 16 May and 15 July 2013 experts found that the reasons for applying the preventive measure remained. However, owing to the applicant\u2019s inappropriate behaviour (harassment of other patients and uttering threats towards patients and the hospital staff) they recommended that he be transferred to a different hospital. Nevertheless, on 8 August 2013 the Krak\u00f3w District Court decided to keep the applicant in Babinski Hospital. That decision was upheld by the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court on 24 September 2013.", "21. On 19 September 2013, upon a recommendation by the Psychiatric Commission, the Krak\u00f3w District Court decided to place the applicant in the D\u0119bica Medical Centre (\u201cD\u0119bica Hospital\u201d). The applicant was transferred there on 25 September 2013.", "22. On 10 December 2013 two expert psychiatrists and a psychologist from the Tarn\u00f3w region confirmed that the applicant did not see a need to continue treatment, he was uncritical about his illness, and there was a risk that he might commit yet another offence. Therefore, he should continue treatment in a secured psychiatric facility. Referring to this opinion, the Krak\u00f3w District Court decided to extend the applicant\u2019s confinement on 27 January 2014. The decision was upheld by the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court on 23 May 2014.", "23. On 24 April 2014 two expert psychiatrists and a psychologist held that the applicant\u2019s condition had deteriorated and there was still a risk that he might commit yet another offence. For these reasons it was necessary to continue his treatment in a secure psychiatric facility. Subsequently, on 26 June 2014 the Krak\u00f3w District Court extended the applicant\u2019s detention.", "24. On 21 August 2014 the Krak\u00f3w District Court decided to transfer the applicant to the Branice Psychiatric Hospital \u2013 a high-security psychiatric facility. On 16 October 2014 the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal against that decision. The court stressed, referring to a recent expert opinion that the applicant\u2019s condition had deteriorated since March 2014. He was aggressive and threatened other patients and medical staff.", "25. The applicant was transferred to Branice Hospital on 4 September 2014.", "26. On 10 February 2015 expert psychiatrists from the Opole region observed some improvement in the applicant\u2019s mental state. He was no longer threatening other patients and had not attempted to escape. However, the improvement was not permanent, and there was still a high risk that the applicant would commit another similar offence.", "27. On 19 March 2015 the Krak\u00f3w District Court again extended the applicant\u2019s detention. In view of the experts\u2019 opinion it also ordered that the applicant be transferred to a less secure psychiatric facility - the Rybnik Psychiatric Hospital.", "28. According to the information available to the Court on the date of adoption of the present decision the applicant is still detained in a psychiatric hospital.", "29. Conditions for the detention of persons of unsound mind who are not criminally responsible on medical grounds are laid down in the Polish Criminal Code of 1997:", "Article 93", "\u201cThe court may impose a preventive measure as provided for in this chapter, which involves committal to a secure medical institution only if necessary in order to prevent the repeated commission of a prohibited act by an offender suffering from mental illness ... mental impairment or addiction to alcohol or other narcotic drugs. Before imposing such a measure, the court shall hear evidence from psychiatrists and a psychologist...\u201d", "Article 94", "\u201c1. If an offender has committed a prohibited act in a state of insanity as specified in Article 31 \u00a7 1, causing significant harm to the community, and there is a high probability that he will commit such an act again, the court shall commit him to a suitable psychiatric institution.", "2. The duration of the stay in the institution shall not be fixed in advance; the court shall release the offender from the institution if his stay there is no longer deemed necessary.", "3. The court may reorder the committal of an offender (as specified in paragraph 1) to a suitable psychiatric institution if it is advisable in the light of the circumstances specified in paragraph 1 or Article 93; such an order may not be issued more than five years after release from the institution.\u201d", "30. Pursuant to Article 22 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences of 1997, as applicable from 1 January 2012, an offender and his defence lawyer may take part in a court hearing only if this is expressly provided by law.", "Article 204, as applicable at the material time, provided:", "\u201c1. The court shall, no less frequently than every six months, and in the event of receiving an opinion that further detention of the offender in a secure medical institution in which a preventive measure is being executed is unnecessary, immediately make a decision as regards the further execution of that measure. If necessary, the court shall refer to the opinion of other medical experts.", "2. A decision on the further execution of a preventive measure may be appealed against.\u201d", "31. On 1 July 2015 Article 204 was amended to the effect that it now provides explicitly for the obligatory participation of a prosecutor (always) and a defence lawyer (if the offender is deaf, mute or blind, or a minor, if there are justified doubts as to whether he could be held criminally responsible or if the court finds that the defence may be particularly difficult)."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
