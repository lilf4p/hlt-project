The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Enfield (United Kingdom).", "7. The complaints raised in this application arise out of the Turkish military intervention in northern Cyprus in July and August 1974. The general context of the property issues arising in this connection is set out in the cases of Cyprus v. Turkey ([GC], no. 25781/94, \u00a7\u00a7 13-16 and 28-33, ECHR 2001IV), and Demopoulos and Others v. Turkey (dec.) ([GC], nos. 46113/99 and 7 others, \u00a7\u00a7 4-16, ECHR 2010).", "8. In 1997 the applicant was gifted five plots of land, or shares in them, by her aunt, who died in 1998. In 2008 she was also gifted an additional share of one of the plots of land by her mother. According to the certificates of ownership provided by the Department of Lands and Surveys of the Republic of Cyprus, the applicant is the sole owner of four plots of land and owns a 9/16 share of the fifth plot.", "9. The land lies in the village Koma Tou Yialou (Kumyali) in the \u201cTRNC\u201d. The total area of the land is some 18 d\u00f6n\u00fcm.", "10. In 2007 the applicant instructed a law firm in Nicosia, which duly obtained a valuation report on the land from a Turkish Cypriot chartered surveyor. The valuation report of 3 December 2007 assessed each of the five plots of land and provided valuations for them, which ranged from 500 pounds sterling (GBP) per d\u00f6n\u00fcm to GBP 10,000 per d\u00f6n\u00fcm.", "11. In October 2011 the applicant obtained a further valuation report by a chartered surveyor from the Republic of Cyprus. This report valued the five plots of land, including the economic loss and interest (all calculated for the period between 1974 and 2011), at 2,690,962 euros (EUR) in total.", "12. In February 2017 the applicant obtained a new valuation report from the Land Registration Office of the Republic of Cyprus which assessed the value of the property in question, including economic loss and interest accrued since 1997 (when the applicant became owner of the property) to December 2016, at EUR 2,088,366 in total.", "13. In May 2008 the applicant, through her Turkish Cypriot representatives, filed a claim with the IPC under Law no. 67/2005 (see paragraphs 41-43 below) \u2012 supported by an affidavit \u2012 claiming restitution of her property and/or compensation at the property\u2019s current market value and damages for loss of use of the land in question. The total compensation sought was GBP 100,000 per d\u00f6n\u00fcm (GBP 1,800,000 or approximately EUR 2,285,000).", "14. In her affidavit the applicant attested that the property in question had been transferred to her after 1974 by her aunt, who had owned it since before 1974. The affidavit also attested that there were no mortgages, liabilities or restrictions on the property in question, that the applicant lived in South Cyprus in a house owned by a Turkish Cypriot, and that she was paying rent to the Republic of Cyprus. The file also contained the applicant\u2019s identity documents (British passport and Cypriot identity card), certificates from the Republic of Cyprus Land Registry and Surveys Department concerning the ownership and legal status of the applicant\u2019s plots of land (indicating no mortgages, liabilities or other restrictions), and a document issued by the relevant Cypriot authority showing that the applicant lived in a house owned by a Turkish Cypriot and had been billed 270 Cypriot pounds (CYP) by way of rent for the period 1 April 2003 to 30 June 2004.", "15. The applicant\u2019s claim was communicated to the \u201cTRNC\u201d Attorney General as provided under Law no. 67/2005 and the relevant IPC Rules (see paragraph 43 below).", "16. On 5 May 2010, the Attorney General\u2019s Office submitted an opinion to the IPC in reply to the applicant\u2019s claim. It relied on an affidavit by the \u201cTRNC\u201d Director of the Land Registry and Surveys Department, who explained that their records showed that one of the registered owners of the property in question was Chrystollou Nicola Stavrinou (the applicant\u2019s aunt), that Maria Nicola Stavrinou (the applicant\u2019s mother) was the owner of part of one of the plots of land, and that the applicant had failed to demonstrate that she was the legal heir of the two registered owners. He also considered that the applicant\u2019s compensation claim was excessive and unfounded.", "17. A directions hearing before the IPC took place on 25 May 2010. The applicant\u2019s representative stated that they had received the Attorney General\u2019s opinion only on the day of the hearing and thus asked for an adjournment in order to prepare their case. The Attorney General\u2019s representative did not object and the hearing was adjourned until 1 June 2010.", "18. At a directions hearing on 1 June 2010 the applicant\u2019s representative undertook to obtain a valuation report and a document showing that the plots of land had been transferred to the applicant by way of donation. The Attorney General\u2019s representative requested that documents showing that the applicant was the legal heir of Chriystolleuo Nicola Stavrou [sic.] should be provided, as well as proof of the amount of rent she was paying for the Turkish Cypriot house where she lived in the South, or alternatively the lease agreement by which the house had been allocated to her. The Attorney General\u2019s representative also undertook to submit a search document from the \u201cTRNC\u201d Land Registry and Surveys Department, and indicated that he reserved his right to submit and request further documents. The hearing was adjourned so that the parties could obtain the relevant documents.", "19. On 3 June 2010 the Attorney General submitted the search document of the \u201cTRNC\u201d Land Registry and Surveys Department relating to the plots included in the applicant\u2019s claim.", "20. On 6 June 2012, through her representative, the applicant asked permission to amend her initial claim. She submitted that she had in the meantime become the sole owner of the plot of which she had previously owned a 5/6 share and that in October 2011 she had obtained a valuation report indicating that the value of her properties was EUR 2,690,962 (see paragraph 8 above).", "21. At a preliminary hearing on 18 June 2012, after the Attorney General\u2019s representative stated that he had no objections with regard to the amendment of the applicant\u2019s claim; the President of the IPC accepted the amendment and instructed the applicant to submit her amended claim and the Attorney General\u2019s Office to submit an opinion in that regard.", "22. On 6 July 2012 the applicant complied with the order and amended her claim, seeking compensation in accordance with the new findings and developments concerning her property title.", "23. On 20 November 2012 the applicant submitted the documents requested by the Attorney General\u2019s representative on 1 June 2010 (see paragraph 18 above). In particular, the applicant submitted certificates issued by the head of the local community (mukhtar) explaining that there were inconsistencies in the spelling of the applicant\u2019s aunt\u2019s name in different documents. The mukhtar explained that the latter had held Cypriot identity document no. 327090 and had been variously known as: Christallou Nikola Stavrinou, Chriystallou Nicola Stavrinon, Christallou Nicola Stavrinou, Christalla Nikola and Chrystallou Nicola, but these were one and the same person. The mukhtar further certified that she had never married and that before her death she had gifted her immovable property to her sister\u2019s daughter, the applicant (Andriani Ioannou, holder of a Cypriot identity card). In support of the mukhtar\u2019s certificates, the applicant submitted her aunt\u2019s identity documents (including a Cypriot identity document). The applicant also submitted documents showing the transfer of title from her aunt to her in respect of the plots of land in question. She also submitted documents showing that she had been allocated a Turkish Cypriot house in the South and had paid CYP 342 by way of rent for the period 1 June 2000 to 31 December 2001 and CYP 270 for the period 1 April 2003 to 30 June 2004.", "24. A preliminary hearing before the IPC scheduled for 10 January 2013 was adjourned due to the absence of the Attorney General\u2019s representative, who could not attend the hearing for family reasons.", "25. At a preliminary hearing on 25 January 2013 the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities were represented by the Attorney General\u2019s representative and the undersecretary of the Housing Affairs Department. They asked the applicant to submit the birth certificates of her aunt and her mother and a title deed for the property which she now owned in its entirety. The hearing was adjourned to enable the applicant to obtain the documents in question.", "26. On 19 February 2013 the applicant submitted the requested documents, which also included documents confirming that her aunt had never been married.", "27. At a preliminary hearing on 25 April 2013 the \u201cTRNC\u201d representatives asked the applicant to submit certificates from the mukhtar showing that the names Andriani Joannou, Andriani Ioannou and Andriani Georgiou Antoniou all referred to the applicant, and further certificates showing that her aunt had been variously known as Chrystollou Nicola Stavrinou, Chrystolleuo Nicola Stavriou, Chrystolleui Nicolou Stavriou, Nikola Hristallu (Nicola Hrystallou), Hristalla Nicola and Hrystallou Nicola (Nikola), and that her mother had been variously known as Maria Nicola Stavrinou, Maria Stavrinou, Maria Georgiou and Maria Georgios, and that their antecedent Nikolas Stavrinou (Nicolas Stavrinou), had also been known as Nicola Stavrinou and Nicola Stavrinu. The hearing was adjourned to permit the applicant to obtain the requested documents.", "28. On 9 May 2013 the applicant submitted certificates from the mukhtar showing that the aforementioned different names referred to the same individuals, namely the applicant, her mother, her aunt and their antecedent, respectively. The mukhtar\u2019s certificates also identified these individuals on the basis of their identity card numbers. A certificate dated 8 May 2013 indicated that the applicant\u2019s mother was variously known as Maria Nicola (Nicolas, Nikola, Nikolas) Stavrinou and her aunt as Chrystolleui Nicolou Stavriou.", "29. At a preliminary hearing on 24 October 2013, at which the applicant was also present, the \u201cTRNC\u201d representatives argued that the mukhtar\u2019s certificates were incomplete and that the names Maria Nicola (Nicolas, Nikola, Nikolas) Stavrinou, for the applicant\u2019s mother, and Chrystolleui Nicolou Stavriou, for the applicant\u2019s aunt, should be added. The representative further argued that an official document should be submitted showing that the applicant\u2019s aunt had not married and did not have any other heirs. He also requested a document showing that there were no liabilities attaching to the property in question. Upon production of these documents, the Attorney General\u2019s representative would be prepared to settle the case by paying GBP 60,000 to the applicant.", "30. In reply, the applicant\u2019s representative stated that they would obtain the requested documents. However, he pointed out that they had already produced documents showing that the applicant\u2019s aunt had never married and this was anyway apparent from the fact that she had never changed her last name. The applicant\u2019s representative also pointed out that the applicant\u2019s aunt had transferred the property in question to the applicant while she was still alive. He asked for an adjournment in order to consider the Attorney General\u2019s settlement offer.", "31. On 16 January 2014 the applicant\u2019s representative asked that a hearing be held before the IPC.", "32. A further examination of the case before the IPC took place on 1 March 2016. The President and members of the IPC questioned the applicant\u2019s representative with regard to the instructions he had received from the applicant concerning the case. As the applicant was not present and could not be reached at that time to give clear instructions concerning the case, the hearing was adjourned.", "33. On 9 March 2016 the applicant\u2019s Turkish Cypriot representatives informed her representative in the Republic of Cyprus that the fact that an application had been lodged with the Court had caused them upset. They also stated that they would not represent the applicant in further proceedings.", "34. A hearing before the IPC was held on 28 June 2016. The applicant\u2019s Turkish Cypriot representative explained that she had informed the applicant of her wish to withdraw from the case. However, she was unable to provide an official document to that effect and the hearing was therefore adjourned in order for the representative to complete the formalities for withdrawal.", "35. On 19 August 2016 the applicant took over the files from her Turkish Cypriot representatives.", "36. At a hearing on 28 September 2016 the IPC accepted the applicant\u2019s Turkish Cypriot representatives\u2019 withdrawal from the case and decided that the applicant should be contacted directly during the future course of the proceedings. Another hearing was scheduled for 12 October 2016.", "37. On 15 October 2016 the applicant informed the IPC that she had not received the summons to the hearing of 12 October 2016 until 13 October 2016.", "38. A further meeting for the examination of the case, at which the applicant was personally present, was held on 2 March 2017. The \u201cTRNC\u201d representatives argued that the applicant should provide further documents showing the exact dates of birth of her mother and her aunt as well as the respective death certificates. Furthermore, they argued that the applicant could not be considered to be a legal heir of her aunt for the purpose of Law no. 67/2005 as she had obtained the property at issue from her aunt while the latter was still alive. The applicant contended that these arguments were being raised for the first time now and she therefore asked for a formal hearing to be openedThe proceedings before the IPC are still pending."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
