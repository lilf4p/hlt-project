He allegedly had a cap put on his head so that he could not see anything and was taken by car out of town, where he was beaten up and given electric shocks with wires attached to his little fingers. His mouth was taped so that he would not scream. When he was ready to give a statement in order to stop the torture, he was taken to a river bank and shown a dead body. He was thrown on the ground and kicked. When taken back to the Sovetskiy police department, he made a confession statement to an investigator in the presence of the same police officers who had illtreated him.", "13.

At 12.50 a.m. on 20 June 2006 investigator S. arrested the applicant as a suspect and questioned him between 1 and 1.50 a.m., and then between 11 and 11.15 a.m., in the presence of P., a State-appointed lawyer invited by investigator S. The applicant reiterated his earlier selfincriminating statements, as well as the statements concerning his illtreatment at the Severnyy police department.

On 28 June 2006 investigator S. communicated the applicant\u2019s allegations concerning the unlawful actions of the police officers from the Severnyy police department to the Kominternovskiy district prosecutor\u2019s office of Voronezh. An investigator of that prosecutor\u2019s office carried out a pre-investigation inquiry and refused to institute criminal proceedings into the applicant\u2019s complaint. His two decisions of 1 July and 2 August 2006 were annulled by his superiors on the grounds that they had been based on an incomplete inquiry.", "19. In the most recent refusal of 29 September 2006 to institute criminal proceedings for lack of evidence that the officers of the Severnyy police department had committed a crime, the investigator established the facts as follows, relying on the police officers\u2019 statements. On 17 June 2006 certain operative officers of the criminal search unit of the Severnyy police department carried out operational-search activities in connection with I.\u2019s disappearance. In order to check the applicant\u2019s involvement in I.\u2019s disappearance they took him to the Severnyy police department with his consent and interviewed him. After receiving his \u201cexplanation\u201d M. released him. That evening M. took him to the police station again for swearing on the street near the police station. From 9.50 p.m. on 17 June until 10.40 a.m. on 19 June 2006 the applicant was detained in a cell for administrative offenders. He was then taken to the Sovetskiy police department. No physical force was used against him, and no complaints were made by him.", "20. The investigator noted that on the two occasions the applicant had been taken to the Severnyy police department \u2013 first, for giving statements in relation to I.\u2019s disappearance, and second, for having committed the administrative offence \u2013 he had had no injuries. In the same decision the investigator suggested that the applicant\u2019s injuries could have been inflicted by a third party outside the Severnyy police department, between 17 and 19 June 2006, between one and three days before his medical examination by the forensic expert on 20 June 2006.", "21. On an unspecified date the applicant also complained about the unlawful actions of officers of the Sovetskiy police department, explaining that he had blamed the officers of the Severnyy police department for all his injuries for fear of reprisals from the officers of the Sovetskiy department, in whose hands he had been at the time. An investigator of the Sovetskiy district prosecutor\u2019s office of Voronezh carried out a preinvestigation inquiry and refused to institute criminal proceedings into the applicant\u2019s complaint. His decision of 10 August 2006 was annulled by his superior as unlawful and unfounded.", "22. In the most recent refusal of 21 September 2006 to institute criminal proceedings for lack of evidence that a crime had been committed, the investigator found, relying on statements by the operative officers of the Sovetskiy police department, that the applicant had been taken to the station with his consent and had confessed to the murder of I. He had also shown where he had hidden her body voluntarily, without any coercion.", "23. An appeal by the applicant of 17 May 2007 against the investigators\u2019 decisions was not examined by the District Court because by that time he had been convicted by a final judgment, as was stated by the court in a letter of 4 June 2007.", "24. At his trial the applicant pleaded innocent and submitted that he had given the self-incriminating statements at the preliminary investigation stage as a result of physical coercion by officers of the Severnyy and Sovetskiy police departments. His counsel requested that the records of the investigative measures carried out on 19, 20 and 21 June 2006 be declared inadmissible, arguing, inter alia, that they had been obtained in the presence of lawyer P., who had been invited by investigator S. in breach of the relevant procedure and without the applicant\u2019s consent.", "25. The District Court dismissed the request, noting that all investigative measures since the applicant\u2019s arrest as a suspect on 20 June 2006 had been carried out in the presence of lawyer P. Moreover, there was no evidence that the applicant had rejected her services. Following his confession, recorded in his \u201cexplanation\u201d to the investigator of 19 June 2006, the applicant had shown where he had hidden I.\u2019s body, which had not required the presence of a lawyer. The court based its findings on the selfincriminating statements given by the applicant in the preliminary investigation, noting that his allegations of illtreatment in police custody had been examined and dismissed by the Sovetskiy and Kominternovskiy district prosecutor\u2019s offices in decisions of 21 and 29 September 2006 respectively.", "26. On 25 October 2006 the District Court convicted the applicant of aggravated murder and sentenced him to twelve years\u2019 imprisonment.", "27. On 30 November 2006 the Council of the Voronezh Regional Bar Association examined a disciplinary case against lawyer P. which originated in a complaint by the applicant. It found that P. had defended the applicant at investigator S.\u2019s direct invitation, surpassing the Council of the Voronezh Regional Bar Association in breach of the relevant procedure. P. was subjected to disciplinary liability in the form of a warning. On 5 December 2006 the Council informed the applicant of its decision, explaining that there was nothing to suggest that P. had failed to properly defend the applicant. However, it had established a breach of the procedure for providing legal assistance at the invitation of the investigating authorities.", "28. On 6 February 2007 the Voronezh Regional Court upheld the judgment on an appeal by the applicant, fully endorsing the trial court\u2019s findings.", "29. Applications by the applicant for supervisory review of his case were dismissed by the Regional Court."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "5", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
