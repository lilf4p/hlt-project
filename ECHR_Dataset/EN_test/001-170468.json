The FSB officers had beaten the applicant and kept him inside the house until the following day.", "113. On 10 June 2014 \u201cTimur\u201d and \u201cZakhar\u201d had taken the applicant to a runway at one of Moscow\u2019s airports without passing through any border or passport controls as the applicant\u2019s passport had remained with the Moscow FMS. The FSB officers had handed the applicant over to Uzbek officials near the steps of a Tashkent-bound airplane.", "114. Once in Uzbekistan, the applicant had been placed under arrest by the Main Investigation Department of the Ministry of the Interior of Uzbekistan and had been subjected to torture and other ill-treatment by lawenforcement officers for two months with a view to securing a selfincriminating statement. The applicant had been tied to a bar attached to the wall head downward and had been beaten repeatedly. The Uzbek officers had broken two of the applicant\u2019s ribs and knocked out seven of his teeth.", "115. The Government submitted that according to CCTV pictures the applicant had been kidnapped at about 7 p.m. on 9 June 2014 by unidentified people and had been taken away by car to an unidentified destination. There had been no proof of the direct or indirect involvement of the Russian authorities in the applicant\u2019s alleged abduction and forced transfer to Uzbekistan.", "116. From the limited material provided by the parties the Court can discern the following as the few facts which appear to be not in dispute. Both parties have agreed that the applicant was abducted in Moscow at about 7 p.m. on 9 June 2014 (see paragraphs 21 and 77 above). It follows by implication from the Government\u2019s assertion that the applicant was kidnapped by unidentified people (see paragraph 115 above) that they have acknowledged that the applicant was restricted in exercising his free will from that moment on. It is thus reasonable to assume that the Government have not contested the allegation that the applicant was involuntarily removed from the Russian territory. Furthermore, there is no dispute about the fact that the applicant was arrested and placed in custody in Tashkent by the Uzbek authorities, although there appears to be a certain amount of confusion as to the date of his arrest (see paragraphs 24, 62 and 92 above). The Government also raised no objection to the applicant\u2019s representative\u2019s submission that the applicant stood trial at Tashkent City Court and was convicted of crimes related to religious extremism (see paragraph 43).", "117. Nevertheless, the events from 7 p.m. on 9 June 2014 onwards, in particular the factual circumstances of how the applicant travelled from Russia to Uzbekistan, have not been elucidated.", "118. The Court notes in passing that the Government enclosed a record of the applicant\u2019s interview by the Uzbek authorities, without providing any accompanying comment or explanation. According to that document, the applicant had travelled from Moscow to Tashkent by bus without a passport (see paragraph 90 above). Were the Government to be understood to be tacitly relying on the explanation appearing in that document, the Court would be reluctant to accept is as satisfactory given that the interview in question was not attended by sufficient procedural safeguards against abuse and arbitrariness.", "119. The Court reiterates that it has established a number of general principles concerning situations in which, owing to a conflicting account of events by the parties, it has confronted difficulties when establishing the facts (for a summary of those principles see El Masri v. \u201cthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d [GC], no. 39630/09, \u00a7\u00a7 15153, 13 December 2012).", "120. In particular, the Court reaffirms its constant position that the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation where the events giving rise to a complaint under Articles 2 or 3 of the Convention lie within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons under their control in custody (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000VII), or where, although it has not been proved that a person has been taken into custody by the authorities, it is possible to establish in the context of a disappearance complaint under Article 5 of the Convention that he or she was officially summoned by the authorities, entered a place under their control and has not been seen since (see Tan\u0131\u015f and Others v. Turkey, no. 65899/01, \u00a7 160, ECHR 2005\u2013VIII).", "121. Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court observes that, owing to the scarcity of the information before it, it is not in a position to establish with certainty the exact circumstances of the applicant\u2019s travel from Moscow to Tashkent, including the date of arrival to destination and the means of transportation employed. Given that three documents issued by the Uzbek authorities that were submitted by the Government suggest that he reached Tashkent on 14 June 2014 (see paragraphs 85-86 above), the Court is ready to accept, in the absence of any other evidence, that date as the date of arrival. As to the means of transportation, the applicant\u2019s representative submitted that the applicant was put on an aeroplane in one of the Moscow airports. The Government remained silent on the matter. The Uzbek authorities implied that the applicant took a bus from Moscow to Tashkent.", "122. The Court considers that, owing to the scarcity of the information available, it cannot establish the precise circumstances surrounding the applicant\u2019s travel from Moscow to Tashkent. Nevertheless, it regards the following two elements as salient for the analysis of the present case: (a) that the applicant was without his passport on 9 June 2014 (see paragraph 18 above), and (b) that, in order to arrive to Tashkent, he must have crossed the Russian State borders in one manner or another.", "123. The Court notes in this connection that it has previously concluded that a forcible transfer of an individual to a State that was not a party to the Convention by aircraft from Moscow or the surrounding region could not happen without the knowledge and either passive or active involvement of the Russian authorities (see Iskandarov v. Russia, no. 17185/05, \u00a7\u00a7 113-15, 23 September 2010; Abdulkhakov v. Russia, 14743/11, \u00a7\u00a7 125-27, 2 October 2012; and Ermakov v. Russia, no. 43165/10, \u00a7 176, 7 November 2013). Any airport serving international flights is subject to heightened security measures, remaining under the permanent control of the respondent State\u2019s authorities and notably, the State border service (ibid., also, see Savriddin Dzhurayev v. Russia, no. 71386/10, \u00a7\u00a7 201-02, ECHR 2013 (extracts)). As to the possibility of transport by bus, it would appear implausible that an individual whose name appeared on the wanted lists (see paragraphs 11 and 83 above) could travel some 3,400 kilometres through Russia and Kazakhstan by bus and cross the Russia-Kazakhstan and Kazakhstan-Uzbekistan State borders unimpededly despite having no passport on him (see paragraph 18 above).", "124. The Court considers, accordingly, that a strong presumption of the Russian authorities\u2019 involvement in the applicant\u2019s relocation to Uzbekistan has arisen. The Government, however, have failed to rebut this presumption. In particular, they did not disclose the passenger logs for the Tashkentbound flights which had departed from the Moscow airports after 9 June 2014 (see paragraph 60 above). Nor did the Government submit any explanation as to how the applicant could cross the Russian border without a passport.", "125. In view of the above, the Court considers that, whereas the applicant made out a prima facie case that he had been abducted and transferred to Uzbekistan with the direct or indirect involvement of the Russian authorities, the Government failed persuasively to refute his allegations and to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation as to how the applicant arrived in Tashkent.", "126. The Court accordingly finds it established that the Russian authorities bear responsibility, as a result of direct or indirect involvement, for the applicant\u2019s forcible transfer from Moscow to Tashkent. On the basis of this finding, the Court will proceed to examine the applicant\u2019s complaints under Article 3 of the Convention."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "38"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["34"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
