A list of the applicants is set out in the appendix. They were all represented by Mr L. \u0160u\u0161ak, a lawyer practicing in Zagreb.", "2. The Croatian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms \u0160. Sta\u017enik.", "3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "4. The applicants\u2019 family lived in Vukovar, a Croatian town near the Serbian border which was heavily attacked by the Yugoslav People\u2019s Army and paramilitary Serbian armed forces in the period between August and November 1991, during the war in Croatia.", "5. According to the applicants, on 17 November 1991 their respective husband and father, K.L., was taken from his home in Borovo Naselje, a district of the town of Vukovar, by Croatian soldiers and killed on 18 November 1991.", "6. According to the Government, the town of Vukovar fell on 18 November 1991; after the surrender of the last Croatian forces on 20 November 1991 the Yugoslav Peoples\u2019 Army and Serbian paramilitary forces established their control over it.", "7. After the fall of Vukovar, the applicants went to live in Serbia.", "8. Between 1992 and 1996 Vukovar was a part of the United Nations Protected Area (UNPA). In 1996 the United Nations Security Council established the United Nations Transitional Administration in Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES), which included Vukovar. On 15 January 1998 the UNTAES mandate ceased and the transfer of power to the Croatian authorities began.", "9. An investigation was opened on 27 November 1991 by an investigating judge of the Belgrade Military Court. On 26 February 1992 the first applicant gave evidence in those proceedings.", "10. On 1 April 1992 an indictment was lodged before that court against M.F., Z.\u0160., M.D. and D.S., Croatian soldiers imprisoned by the Serbian forces, on charges of war crimes against the civilian population.", "11. On 26 June 1992 the Belgrade Military Court found the accused guilty as charged. The conviction of Z.\u0160. and M.D. covered, inter alia, responsibility for the killing of K.L. M.D. was sentenced to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment and Z.\u0160. to death. This judgment was upheld by the Serbian Supreme Military Court on 29 December 1992 and thus became final.", "12. On 14 February 2007 the applicants submitted a claim for damages with the State Attorney\u2019s Office in respect of the death of K.L. They requested that V.P. and M.S. be heard as witnesses.", "13. The Croatian authorities learned about the death of the applicants\u2019 relative for the first time when they made the above request. An investigation ensued. On 15 June 2007 the police interviewed V.P., who had no knowledge whatsoever about the killing of K.L. and said that she had never been to Vukovar. It was also established that M.S. had died.", "14. The applicant\u2019s request was refused.", "15. Between 24 November 2010 and 3 July 2013 the police interviewed the applicants, M.K., P.D., V.M., Z.\u0160. and M.V. None of them had any relevant knowledge about the circumstances of the killing of K.L.", "16. In the meantime, on 3 January 2011 the Vukovar County State Attorney\u2019s Office asked the Serbian Prosecution Office for War Crimes for all evidence in respect of the killing of K.L. On 4 May 2011 the latter Office sent to the Croatian authorities completed documentation which did not contain any of the judgments of the Serbian Military Courts.", "17. On 5 March 2008 the applicants brought a civil action against the State before the Vukovar Municipal Court, seeking compensation in connection with the death of their relative. They asked that witness M.K. be heard in respect of the circumstances surrounding the killing of K.L.", "18. That claim was dismissed on 13 April 2010. The Municipal Court found that the claim had been submitted after the expiry of the applicable time-limit specified in the statute of limitations. The applicants were also ordered to pay to the State the costs of the proceedings in the amount of 9,750 Croatian kuna (HRK). In an appeal against the first instance-judgment and an appeal on points of law before the Supreme Court the applicants complained about the manner in which the rules on the time-limit specified in the statute of limitations had been applied. The first-instance judgment was upheld by the Vukovar County Court and the Supreme Court on 1 July 2010 and 12 October 2011 respectively.", "19. On the latter day the applicants sent to the Supreme Court copies of judgments of the Belgrade Military Court and the Serbian Supreme Military Court (together \u201cthe Serbian Military Courts\u201d) (see paragraph 11 above).", "20. On 16 February 2012 the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint. They enclosed the judgments of the Serbian Military Courts and argued, inter alia, that there had been a conviction by a criminal court in respect of the killing of K.L. and that therefore their civil claim could not have become statute-barred. The applicants\u2019 constitutional complaint was dismissed on 16 May 2012 as ill-founded. The Constitutional Court did not make any reference to the judgments of the Serbian Military Courts.", "21. The State authorities instituted enforcement proceedings in the Vukovar Municipal Court against the first applicant, seeking the payment of the costs of the above-mentioned civil proceedings, together with applicable interest and the costs of the enforcement proceedings.", "22. An enforcement order was issued on 19 April 2011; under the order, one-third of the first applicant\u2019s pension was to be seized each month.", "23. The first applicant lodged an appeal, arguing that her monthly pension amounted to HRK 1,200 and the seizure of one-third of that amount put her in a precarious position since it did not leave her with sufficient resources for subsistence.", "24. The appeal was dismissed by the Vukovar County Court on 14 October 2011 and a subsequent constitutional complaint lodged by the first applicant was dismissed by the Constitutional Court on 4 April 2012.", "25.
