The applicant, Ms Selvi Be\u00e7aj, is an Albanian national, who was born in 1983 and lives in Tirana. She was initially represented by Ms E. Meli and, subsequently, by Ms E. Kokona, lawyers practising in Tirana.", "2. The Albanian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their then Agent, Ms L. Mandia and, subsequently, by Ms A. Hicka of the State Advocate\u2019s Office.", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "3. On 10 February 2010 the applicant was appointed, pursuant to a service contract (kontrat\u00eb sh\u00ebrbimi), as first secretary at the Permanent Mission of Albania to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Vienna, Austria (\u201cthe Permanent Mission\u201d).", "4. On 5 December 2011 the applicant went on maternity leave. She gave birth to a child on 9 January 2012.", "5. On 24 January 2012 the Minister of Foreign Affairs (\u201cthe Minister\u201d) decided to terminate the applicant\u2019s employment as from 24 February 2012.", "6. On 24 February 2012 the Minister appointed the applicant to work as a specialist at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (\u201cthe Ministry\u201d) in Tirana. The applicant declined the offer.", "7. On 22 March 2012 it was confirmed that the applicant had been divested of her diplomatic status and the benefits that derived from the exercise of her job as first secretary.", "8. On 23 February 2012 the applicant challenged the Minister\u2019s decision of 24 January 2012 before the Tirana District Court (\u201cthe District Court\u201d).", "9. On 4 May 2012 the District Court partially accepted the applicant\u2019s civil action. It found that the termination of her employment while she was on maternity leave was in breach of Articles 105/a and 107 \u00a7 1 of the Labour Code. It therefore annulled the Minister\u2019s decision of 24 January 2012 and ordered the applicant\u2019s reinstatement. The District Court further held that the reasons advanced by the applicant\u2019s employer for the termination of her employment, such as the commission of traffic offences in Austria, did not prevail over the legal guarantees afforded to women during the post-natal leave period. The District Court decided that its decision should be provisionally enforced in accordance with Article 317 of the Code of Civil Procedure (\u201cCCP\u201d). Having regard to the applicant\u2019s situation and the position she occupied, the District Court ordered that, in addition to her reinstatement, the applicant\u2019s accreditation should be renewed and her benefits restored, including the grant of a residence permit, provision of accommodation, payment of salary and provision of medical examinations which had started in the applicant\u2019s place of residence on account of her employment (padit\u00ebsja vler\u00ebsohet se duhet t\u00eb kthehet n\u00eb nj\u00eb detyr\u00eb, e cila p\u00ebr nga r\u00ebnd\u00ebsia dhe specifikat e saj, implikon procedura t\u00eb caktuara q\u00eb lidhen me akreditimin dhe rip\u00ebrfitimin e benefiteve (leja e qendrimit, p\u00ebrfitimi i pag\u00ebs, ekzaminimet mjek\u00ebsore t\u00eb nisura n\u00eb vendin e qendrimit p\u00ebr shkak t\u00eb pun\u00ebs)). The Ministry appealed.", "10. On 22 November 2012 the Tirana Court of Appeal upheld the lower court\u2019s decision.", "11. On 17 December 2012 the Ministry appealed to the Supreme Court. The proceedings are currently pending before that court.", "12. On 22 June 2012 the District Court issued a writ of execution in respect of its decision of 4 May 2012 in accordance with Articles 510 and 511 of the CCP.", "13. On 9 July 2012 the bailiff unsuccessfully requested the Ministry to comply voluntarily with the District Court\u2019s decision, as upheld by the Court of Appeal.", "14. On 27 July 2012, having regard to the Ministry\u2019s failure to comply with the District Court\u2019s decision voluntarily, the bailiff decided to proceed with the mandatory enforcement thereof.", "15. On 12 December 2012, having regard to the Ministry\u2019s failure to enforce the decision, the bailiff warned the Ministry that it would be fined in accordance with Article 606 of the CCP.", "16. The Government submitted that on 19 December 2012, at the applicant\u2019s request, the bailiff decided to terminate the enforcement proceedings (pushimin e ekzekutimit me k\u00ebrkes\u00eb t\u00eb kreditorit). It transpired from the bailiff\u2019s decision that the applicant had decided to transfer the file to another bailiff\u2019s office for supervision and enforcement (p\u00ebr ta transferuar te nj\u00eb p\u00ebrmbarues tjet\u00ebr).", "17. The Government further submitted that pursuant to the Minister\u2019s order no. 222 of 13 May 2013 the applicant had been appointed as first secretary, a position equivalent to the one she used to hold, at the Consulate General of Albania in Istanbul, Turkey (\u201cthe Consulate General\u201d). The Ministry\u2019s letter to the Consulate General of 14 May 2013, as submitted by the applicant, stated that \u201cthe Ministry undertakes to pay Ms Be\u00e7aj only her monthly salary (Ministria...merr p\u00ebrsip\u00ebr vet\u00ebm shpenzimet e pag\u00ebs mujore)\u201d.", "18.

Article 104 \u00a7 1 provides that the duration of maternity leave is thirtyfive days in respect of pre-natal leave and forty-two days in respect of post-natal leave. Article 105 \u00a7 2 states that when the period of post-natal leave is over, a woman may decide whether she wishes to return to work or benefit from social insurance entitlements. Under Article 105/a, in the event that a woman\u2019s employer terminates her employment during her pregnancy or following her return to work after the birth of a child, the employer must prove that the reason for the termination was not the woman\u2019s pregnancy or the birth of the child. Under Article 107 \u00a7 1 the termination of employment is void if it takes place during the period in which the woman is entitled to social insurance payments subsequent to the birth of a child.", "23. Under Article 317 a court decision may be provisionally enforced if it concerns payment of damages owing to unjust dismissal from work. Its provisional enforcement may also be ordered, if, owing to the delay in enforcement, the plaintiff may suffer significant damage which cannot be remedied or if the enforcement would become impossible or would be made exceedingly difficult.", "24.
