The applicant, Mr C.M.M., is a national of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (\u201cDRC\u201d) who was born in 1962. He is currently living in the Netherlands. He was initially represented before the Court by Ms M. de Boer, a lawyer practising in Utrecht. She was succeeded by Mr W. Boelens, who is also a lawyer practising in Utrecht.", "2. The Netherlands Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr R.A.A. B\u00f6cker, and Deputy Agent, Ms L. Egmond, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.", "3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.", "4. On 3 August 2001 the applicant entered the Netherlands and applied for asylum, fearing persecution within the meaning of the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (\u201cthe 1951 Refugee Convention\u201d). On 14 August 2001, the immigration authorities held a first interview (eerste gehoor) with the applicant concerning his identity, nationality and travel itinerary. A written record of this interview was prepared and the applicant, assisted by a lawyer, was given the opportunity to submit corrections and additions, which he did on 15 August 2001. On 16 August 2001 a second interview (nader gehoor) was held with the applicant about his reasons for seeking asylum. A written report was drawn up and the applicant, assisted by a lawyer, submitted corrections and additions on 17 August 2001.", "5. On 16 August 2001 the Deputy Minister of Justice (Staatssecretaris van Justitie) issued a notice of her intention (voornemen) to reject the applicant\u2019s asylum application. On 17 August 2001, assisted by a lawyer, the applicant submitted written comments (zienswijze) on the notice of intent.", "6. On 20 September 2001, on the basis of his written comments of 17 August 2001, the immigration authorities held a supplementary interview (aanvullend gehoor) with the applicant. A written report of this interview was drawn up and the applicant, assisted by a lawyer, submitted corrections and additions on 22 October 2001.", "7. During these three interviews, the applicant gave the following statement. He was a national of the DRC. His parents had died. He was married but his wife had remained in the DRC together with their six children, who were born between 1988 and 1999. He also had two brothers and one sister, all of whom were living in the DRC. He gave the address of his home (N. street no. ... in the N\u2019djili borough of Kinshasa) and described the surroundings of the house where he had lived for the previous two years. He stated that it was near to a nameless football field located at M. or K. street, and that there was a protestant school on the opposite side of the street. Behind this school there was a street without a name and he had lived in a side street of this nameless street. For identification purposes, he provided the Netherlands authorities with a formal declaration of loss of identity documents (attestation de perte des pi\u00e8ces d\u2019identit\u00e9) bearing the number 6436/POP/2000, which had been issued on 31 August 2000 by the mayor of one of the Kinshasa boroughs and contained the applicant\u2019s particulars \u2212 including his personal address \u2212 but no specification of the nature of the identity documents lost. For the same purpose, he submitted a work pass issued by the \u201cService de l\u2019A\u00e9ronautique Civile du Zaire\u201d on 19 February 1998 and valid until 15 February 2001 and attesting that the applicant was working as a loadmaster in the employment of Nigeria Airways. Although the street name of the applicant\u2019s personal address in this work pass was the same as that on the declaration of loss of documents, the house number was not the same.", "8. The applicant also stated that, since 2000, he had been a sympathiser of the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (Mouvement de Lib\u00e9ration du Congo; hereafter \u201cMLC\u201d). He often read MLC information material but never participated in public events such as demonstrations or party meetings. Between 1988 and 1996 he had worked as a ticket agent for Air Zaire. From 1996 until leaving the Congo, he had worked as a ground handling manager/loadmaster for Nigeria Airways, which entailed checking in and boarding passengers, carrying out ground-crew tasks and drawing up flight manifests.", "9. In October or November 1998 the applicant and his Nigerian superior had been arrested by three officers of the DRC national police on a charge of allowing passengers with false papers onto a departing aircraft. After being held for three days in the civilian prison in the Gombe borough of Kinshasa, near to the Mamayeno Hospital, and following intervention by his employer, he had been released unconditionally. He had been beaten whilst in detention.", "10. On 18 February 2001 the applicant had been arrested for a second time by two men who showed him passes identifying them as officers of the DRC military intelligence service (D\u00e9tection militaire des activit\u00e9s anti-patrie; hereafter \u201cDEMIAP\u201d). He was accused of helping two passengers \u2012 who were believed to have been involved in an attack on President Laurent Kabila \u2012 to flee the country rather than reporting them to the immigration service. The applicant had denied the accusation; it had not been his task to guide passengers to or through immigration checks. He had been detained in a military subterranean prison which, he believed, was located in the Gombe borough of Kinshasa. On the third day of his detention, the applicant\u2019s home had been searched, during which two MLC pamphlets had been found. His passport had also been found and seized during this search. As a result of the severe maltreatment he had suffered during his detention, in mid-March 2001 the applicant had been admitted to the Gombe military hospital for treatment. His wife had been allowed to visit him in hospital once at the end of March 2001. On that occasion she had given him a Bible in which some money and his identity papers had been concealed. With the help of a friend of his brother-in-law\u2019s, the applicant had managed to escape at the end of June 2001. Three soldiers had taken him from the hospital to a house in a place near Kinshasa. On 2 August 2001 he had been taken to Kinshasa airport and on the same day had managed to flee the DRC by plane.", "11. On 15 November 2001 the Deputy Minister of Justice issued a fresh notice of her intention to reject the applicant\u2019s asylum application. On 11 December 2001, assisted by a lawyer, the applicant submitted written comments on the new notice of intent.", "12. In a decision of 17 January 2002, the Deputy Minister rejected the applicant\u2019s asylum application. On 11 February 2002, the applicant filed an appeal against this decision with the Regional Court of The Hague.", "13. On 3 October 2003 the applicant submitted, as additional grounds of appeal, a copy of a summons which he had received only on that date, although it had been issued on 2 November 2001 by the DRC judicial police (police judiciaire des parquets) of the Prosecution Service of the DRC State Security Court (Parquet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pr\u00e8s la Cour de s\u00fbret\u00e9 de l\u2019Etat). It ordered the applicant to present himself on 3 November 2001 before a named inspector of the judicial police in order to be questioned about \u201cfacts of which he would be informed\u201d.", "14. The applicant also submitted on 3 October 2003 a report commissioned by \u201cDocu Congo\u201d, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in the Netherlands, which had been compiled by another NGO, namely the International Society for Human Rights (hereafter the \u201cISHR\u201d). The author of the ISHR report was the president of the Congo Section of the ISHR, Reverend Placide Tshisumpa Tshiakatumba. For the purposes of this report the researcher(s) had visited the applicant\u2019s address in Kinshasa \u2212 as given in the record of his first interview and on the declaration of loss of identity documents (see paragraphs 4 and 7 above) \u2212 and N\u2019djili (Kinshasa) International Airport. They had interviewed a former secretary at Nigeria Airways, amongst others, and had sought information from two people working for the Prosecution Service of the State Security Court. The report confirmed, in its relevant part, that the applicant had worked for Nigeria Airways at Kinshasa airport, that he had been arrested by the DEMIAP on the grounds stated, and that he had lived at the address he had provided. The report also stated that Nigeria Airways had had to cease its activities at Kinshasa airport for various reasons including the failure to respect airport rules and procedures, fraudulently embarking passengers, and \u201cabove all for that manifesto matter\u201d (\u201csurtout pour cette affaire de manifeste\u201d). It also states that the applicant\u2019s wife had left for an unknown destination. Through their sources at the State Security Court, the researcher(s) confirmed that the applicant was wanted for endangering state security (\u201cMonsieur [C.M.M.] est recherch\u00e9 par les services de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pour des motifs gr\u00e2ves d\u2019attente [sic] \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9tat\u201d), that the person who signed the summons was indeed an inspector for the State Security Court and that the applicant would be immediately arrested and detained if found.", "15. On 14 October 2003, the applicant was informed that the impugned decision of 17 January 2002 had been withdrawn and a fresh decision would be taken.", "16. On 14 January 2004 the applicant was informed that the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs was initiating an investigation in the DRC in response to the material the applicant had submitted in support of his asylum request.", "17. On 22 December 2004 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a person-specific official report (individueel ambtsbericht) based on an investigation carried out in the DRC. It had been found, inter alia, that \u2013 contrary to the ISHR report \u2013 the street name given by the applicant as his home address during his first interview as also on his declaration of loss of identity documents did not exist in the Kinshasa borough where he had allegedly been living during his last two years in the DRC and that, for this reason, it had not been possible to verify whether the applicant\u2019s spouse and/or other relatives were still living there. It had also become apparent that the declaration of loss of identity documents no. 6436/POP/2000 and the summons submitted by the applicant (see paragraphs 7 and 13 above) were forgeries, and it had not been possible to verify the authenticity of the work pass submitted by the applicant (see paragraph 7 above). Moreover, in so far as known, there was no subterranean prison attached to the DEMIAP office in the Gombe borough in Kinshasa and no military hospital existed in Gombe.", "18. On 25 February 2005 the Minister for Immigration and Integration (Minister voor Vreemdelingenzaken en Integratie; hereafter \u201cthe Minister\u201d) issued a fresh notice of intent rejecting the applicant\u2019s asylum request. Observing that the applicant had not submitted any evidential material (such as a boarding pass, a luggage label, an in-flight magazine or other in-flight item bearing the name of the airline) attesting to his journey, that he had not submitted any documents in support of his asylum application and that he had provided only very cursory information about his periods of detention and hospitalisation, and having noted the content of the personspecific official report of 22 December 2004, the Minister concluded that there were sufficiently persuasive arguments for attaching no credence to the applicant\u2019s asylum statement.", "19. On 2 March 2005, under the provisions of the Government Information (Public Access) Act (Wet Openbaarheid van Bestuur), the applicant requested that the documents underlying the person-specific official report of 22 December 2004 be disclosed. This request was transmitted to the Minister of Foreign Affairs on 14 March 2005.", "20. On 25 March 2005, assisted by a lawyer, the applicant submitted written comments on the fresh notice of intent of 25 February 2005. He contested the findings set out in the person-specific official report, whilst pointing out that the non-disclosure of the documents underlying that report and of the working methods employed by the person(s) involved in the inquiry meant that he could do so to only a limited extent. The applicant also requested a reasonable extension to the four-week period allowed for the submission of additional written comments, as he had requested Docu Congo to commission a new expert report to counter the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\u2019 person-specific official report. He therefore asked the Minister to stay her decision pending submission of this counter-report.", "21. On 31 March 2005 the Minister of Foreign Affairs provided the applicant with the documents on which the person-specific official report had been based, at the same time restricting his access to certain parts of the documents containing information about the identity of agents or informants who had assisted in the investigation, information about investigation methods and techniques used, and information about their level of knowledge (so as to avoid facilitating an improvement in the quality of forgeries).", "22. In her decision of 16 December 2005 the Minister rejected the applicant\u2019s asylum application. She noted that on 25 March 2005 the applicant had requested an extension in order to allow Docu Congo to produce a report to counter the person-specific official report and that this request had been granted on 1 April 2005. She also noted that, by letters dated 20 June, 18 July, 16 August, 28 October and 25 November 2005, the applicant had been asked to indicate when submission of the counter-report could be expected and that neither the applicant nor his lawyer had been able to answer this question. Finding that the applicant had had ample time to submit his comments on the person-specific official report, the Minister decided to proceed with her decision. The Minister took into account the fact that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\u2019 inquiry had been based on the applicant\u2019s submissions, including the ISHR report (see paragraph 14 above), and that \u2013 following the so-called \u201cREK check\u201d (see D.T. v. the Netherlands and Georgia (dec.), no. 28199/12, \u00a7\u00a7 25-26, 15 September 2015) \u2013 it had been found that the person-specific official report had been drawn up with due care, both substantively and procedurally, and was comprehensible. The Minister also found that the applicant had submitted no evidence capable of casting doubt on the finding that the declaration of loss of identity documents no. 6436/POP/2000 and the summons submitted by the applicant (see paragraphs 7 and 13 above) were forgeries and once again concluded that no credence could be attached to the applicant\u2019s asylum statement.", "23. On 11 January 2006, the applicant filed an appeal against this decision with the Regional Court of The Hague and, on 10 March 2006, submitted a report commissioned by Docu Congo which had been published on 27 January 2006 by the NGO Comit\u00e9 pour la Democratie et les Droits de l\u2019Homme (hereafter the \u201cCDDH\u201d). The author of the CDDH report was its Secretary-General, Mr Ren\u00e9 Kabala Mushiya. For the purposes of compiling the report, he had managed to contact the applicant\u2019s spouse as well as some people working at N\u2019djili Airport who had known the applicant when he was an employee of Nigeria Airways.", "24. The applicant\u2019s spouse had explained that the street address given by the applicant was in fact a path across a cemetery. According to information provided by the N\u2019djili Borough Population Service (Service de la Population de la Commune de N\u2019djili), illegal dwellings had been built around the cemetery and that was where the applicant and his spouse had lived. When visiting the cemetery in November 2005, the applicant\u2019s spouse had been unable to orientate herself as a result of major rebuilding work carried out in the neighbourhood after 2003, when the local authorities had decided to transform the cemetery into a residential area. This transformation was confirmed in an appended written statement by the local neighbourhood leader (chef de quartier). The applicant\u2019s spouse had also stated that, together with some Nigeria Airways employees, she had visited the applicant in the Gombe medical centre at about 8 p.m. one evening in mid-March 2001. For his part, the applicant submitted written statements by three individuals working in the airline industry, who all declared that they had personally known the applicant, confirmed that he had worked for Nigeria Airways and described the nature of his work for the airline. The report drawn up by the CDDH does not contain any information about the declaration of loss of identity documents or the summons of 2 November 2001 (see paragraphs 7 and 13 above).", "25. The Regional Court of The Hague sitting in \u2018s-Hertogenbosch found on 11 April 2006 that the restrictions applied to the applicant\u2019s access to the underlying documents (see paragraph 21 above) were justified under section 8:29 of the General Administrative Law Act (Algemene Wet Bestuursrecht). This decision was communicated to the applicant on the same day, with a request to indicate whether or not he had given his consent for the Regional Court to take into account these underlying documents in determining his appeal on 11 January 2006 without their being disclosed to the parties.", "26. In its judgment of 7 December 2006, the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in \u2018s-Hertogenbosch rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal of 11 January 2006. It noted that the parties had given their consent under the terms of section 8:29 \u00a7 5 of the General Administrative Law Act to take into account the documents underlying the person-specific official report of 22 December 2004. It held, inter alia, that the Minister could reasonably find that the applicant had failed to demonstrate that the absence of documents supporting his asylum statement was not a shortcoming for which he was to blame, and that the Minister could reasonably held against the applicant the fact that he had not provided a detailed and verifiable statement about his purported travel itinerary and that this detracted from the reliability and credibility of the applicant\u2019s asylum statement. As regards the two reports commissioned by Docu Congo, and relied upon by the applicant, and the person-specific official report of 22 December 2004, the Regional Court held:", "\u201c18. It appears from the investigation carried out by the CDDH that the neighbourhood where the appellant claims to have lived changed in 2003 into a residential area after improvised (illegal) buildings were erected around an old cemetery. The appellant has argued that, since it has been demonstrated that the investigation of the address [by the Minister of Foreign Affairs] was incomplete, the reason for believing that the \u2018attestation de perte des pi\u00e8ces d\u2019identit\u00e9\u2019 he submitted is forged has become groundless.", "19. The court does not agree with this conclusion by the appellant. The findings of the CDDH do not alter the conclusion that the \u2018attestation de perte des pi\u00e8ces d\u2019identit\u00e9\u2019 is a forgery. The court reaches this conclusion after having studying the documents underlying the person-specific official report, in particular the additional statement of 28 October 2004 [containing a detailed explanation as to why it was clear that this document was a forgery]. It appears therefrom that the document concerned \u2013 irrespective of the correctness of the street name indicated \u2013 contains deletions as a result of which it can no longer be regarded as authentic. It follows that the appellant, by relying on the findings in the CDDH report, has not adduced concrete evidence calling into doubt the correctness of the conclusions in the person-specific official report.", "20. Unlike the appellant, the court does not find that the investigation lacked due care. ...", "21. In so far as the appellant has expressed doubts as regards the objectivity and reliability of the confidential contact person [who carried out the investigation in the DRC], the court points out that the appellant has not submitted any concrete evidence to suggest that this confidential contact person might have been untrustworthy and acted carelessly. The claim that the confidential contact person acted out of resentment has likewise not been substantiated by the appellant. Moreover, contrary to the appellant\u2019s submissions, it is not apparent from the underlying documents that the ISHR report was found to be inaccurate. ...", "22. In assessing whether the Minister acted in a reasonable manner, the court finds that, in referring to the person-specific official report, [the Minister] adduced sufficient arguments to support the finding that the appellant\u2019s asylum statement is not credible.", "23. In the appeal proceedings the appellant also submitted that, if returned to the DRC, he would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention. ...", "26. Since the court has held, in the light of the above, that [the Minister] had good reasons for finding that the asylum statement was not credible, it cannot be concluded therefrom that the applicant would be exposed to a real and foreseeable risk of being subjected to treatment prohibited by Article 3 if he were removed to the DRC. ...\u201d", "27. The applicant\u2019s further appeal was rejected on the basis of a summary reasoning issued on 30 May 2007 by the Administrative Jurisdiction Division (Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak) of the Council of State (Raad van State). It found that the further appeal did not provide grounds for quashing the impugned rulings. Pursuant to section 91 \u00a7 2 of the Aliens Act 2000 (Vreemdelingenwet 2000), no further reasoning was required as the arguments submitted did not raise any questions requiring a determination in the interests of legal unity, legal development or legal protection in the general sense. No further appeal lay against that ruling.", "28. To date, the applicant has not been removed from the Netherlands nor has he filed a fresh asylum application in the Netherlands.", "29. The relevant domestic law and practice as regards asylum proceedings and the enforcement of removals are set out in K. v. the Netherlands ((dec.), no. 33403/11, \u00a7\u00a7 16-19 and \u00a7\u00a7 25-32, 25 September 2012).", "30. Details concerning the preparation of person-specific official reports (individuele ambtsberichten) and their use in asylum-related proceedings have been set out in D.T. v. the Netherlands and Georgia (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 24-27).", "31. On 27 September 2007 the Netherlands National Ombudsman (Nationale Ombudsman) \u2013 an independent institute charged with protecting individuals against improper government conduct by conducting investigations of its own motion or on the basis of an individual\u2019s complaint, and making non-binding recommendations to government agencies \u2013 released report no. 2007/200 on the manner in which personspecific official reports are compiled and used in asylum proceedings. The report was entitled \u201cThe credibility of official reports. How asylum statements are confirmed or confuted.\u201d (\u201cDe geloofwaardigheid van ambtsberichten. Hoe asielverhalen worden bevestigd of ontkracht.\u201d). In this report, the Ombudsman formulated a number of recommendations addressed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Justice seeking to reinforce the position of asylum seekers in asylum proceedings and thus the compliance of such proceedings with the common standards of propriety.", "32. In a letter of 19 September 2008 to the President of the Lower House of Parliament (Tweede Kamer) about the follow-up generated as a result of this report, the Ombudsman stated that, although it had led to a number of laudable improvements, the Ministers had not accepted two important recommendations concerning the degree of disclosure of documents underlying person-specific official reports to the decisionmaking civil servant and the asylum seeker concerned.", "33. In March 2009, the Ombudsman filed comments on the consolidated seventeenth to eighteenth periodic reports on compliance with the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which had been submitted by the Netherlands Government to the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. The Ombudsman\u2019s comments contain the following observations in respect of general country assessment and person-specific official reports as used by the Netherlands immigration authorities in their decision-making process:", "\u201cFeedback from interest groups indicated a great deal of dissatisfaction with the quality of these official country reports. They allegedly contained information that was insufficiently relevant, insufficiently current, and incomplete, or sometimes even incorrect. One of the key problems was the fact that official country reports do not provide an overview of the available facts but rather a conclusion concerning certain facts. The underlying facts are often not available to the asylum seekers and their representatives, which makes it essentially impossible to enter into a discussion concerning the substance of the conclusions drawn. The IND [Immigration and Naturalisation Department] employee who makes the decision is thus not able, in preparing the decision, to consult this file to assess whether the contents of the individual official country report are supported by the underlying documents. Only a more highly-qualified IND employee is allowed to do so. This more highly-qualified IND employee will subsequently pass on his findings to the employee who makes the decision. Neither the asylum seeker nor his representative is able to inspect this file [Footnote 41: Subject to application of Article 8:29 General Administrative Law Act]. The Ombudsman found that this working method fails to recognise the responsibility of the state to present sufficient valid facts during the asylum procedure and to facilitate a fair hearing on the basis thereof [Footnote 42: National Ombudsman, The credibility of person-specific official reports, report 2007/200]. The Ombudsman made several recommendations to improve the position of foreign national/asylum seekers during the asylum procedure, but not all of these were implemented.\u201d", "34. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination considered the consolidated seventeenth to eighteenth reports of the Netherlands at its 1986th and 1987th meetings, held on 23 and 24 February 2010. At its 2003rd meeting, held on 5 March 2010, it adopted its concluding observations on these reports, which did not address the quality of general country assessment reports and/or person-specific official reports.", "35. Section 8:29 of the General Administrative Law Act reads as follows:", "\u201c1. Parties who are obliged to provide information or submit documents may, if there are substantial reasons (gewichtige redenen) to do so, refuse to provide such information or submit such documents, or may inform the administrative tribunal that it alone shall be allowed to inspect the information or the documents.", "2. In the case of an administrative body, there can exist no such substantial reasons since there is an obligation, pursuant to the Government Information (Public Access) Act, to accede to any request for information contained in the documents to be submitted.", "3. The administrative tribunal shall decide whether the refusal or restriction of inspection referred to in the first paragraph is justified.", "4. If the administrative tribunal has decided that the refusal is justified, the obligation shall no longer exist.", "5. If the administrative tribunal has decided that the restriction of inspection is justified, it may give judgment based on that information or those documents only with the permission of the other parties. If such permission is refused, the case shall be remitted to another chamber.\u201d", "36. According to the most recent official country assessment report on the DRC, published in December 2014 by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the general situation in the eastern provinces of North-Kivu, South-Kivu, Haut-Uele and Bas-Uele has continued to be unsettled and unpredictable and the general security situation in the province of Katanga has deteriorated due to actions by armed factions. In the other provinces of the DRC the general security situation has remained stable, apart from some isolated incidents. As to the general situation in Kinshasa, the report states:", "\u201cOn 30 December 2013 in Kinshasa, three separate groups simultaneously attacked the headquarters of the Congolese army, the National Radio and N\u2019Djili international airport. Since then no major security incidents have taken place. In instances where the police and the Agence Nationale de Renseignements (ANR) used violence, this was not directed against specific (population) groups. The rate of street crime in Kinshasa remains high. Armed gangs, kuluna, commit burglaries, extortion, threats and kidnappings. On 7 December 2013 the police in Kinshasa arrested ten such gangs as part of an operation called \u201cLikofi\u201d (the word for \u201cpunch\u201d in Lingala). On 14 December 2013 operation Likofi II started, focussing on kuluna in uniform. The latter allegedly killed ten people within one month in shootings in the neighbourhoods of Ma Campagne and Binza Ozone in Ngaliema borough. On 25 February 2014 the Minister of the Interior announced that operation Likofi would be expanded to tackle armed bandits at national level. In the operations Likofi I \u2212 against the Kuluna in Kinshasa \u2212 and Likofi II \u2212 against undisciplined soldiers and police in Kinshasa \u2212 a total of 925 individuals have been apprehended and 593 brought before an investigating judge. Two police officers have been sentenced to death, three military and two civilian accused have been sentenced to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment, one policeman to 20 years\u2019 and one civilian to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment for illegal possession of weapons.", "New police force", "On 6 April 2014, during a parade in the Kintambo cycle stadium in Kinshasa, General C\u00e9lestin Kanyama \u2013 the chief police commissioner of Kinshasa in charge of the Likofi operation \u2013 presented the \u201cnew\u201d police force, comprising law-abiding, disciplined officers who are immune to corruption. The police asked for a salary increase and better working conditions. On 1 October 2014 Prime Minister Matata Ponyo opened the national criminal investigation centre of the police, which has been built with funding from the British development aid and the EU. As from that date, the general population could use the toll-free emergency number 112.\u201d", "37. The official report of December 2014 does not deal specifically with people who have been involved with the MLC, mentioning only that an Amnesty Law approved by the DRC legislature on 3 February 2014 and signed by President Kabila on 11 February 2014 granted amnesty for acts of insurgency, acts of war and political offences committed between 18 February 2006 and 20 December 2013 by, amongst others, military personnel who had participated in the armed MLC uprising.", "38.
