On 7 June 2002 this decision was overturned by the Central Commission, the national authority in charge of the implementation of Law no. 9/1998, which held that the calculation of the total amount needed to be done again, given that the disputed plot of land was actually located on the outskirts and not in the central area, while the disputed house had been built with adobe and not with bricks. The decision stipulated that:", "\u201cIn view of the advanced age of the person entitled [to compensation] the decision must urgently be redrafted and the three children of the deceased father, G.D., should be included therein.\u201d", "7.
