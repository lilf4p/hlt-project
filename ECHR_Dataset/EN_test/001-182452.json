The decision, addressed to the Primorskiy district prosecutor, in so far as relevant, read as follows:", "\u201cMoreover, the [finding] that the investigator, Ms L., did not take sufficient steps to find relatives of the deceased and that measures undertaken [by her] were formalistic in character is not only confirmed by the fact that the decision assigning victim status to [a representative of the municipal authority], had been taken before the information was received from the police officials, but also by the fact that criminal-case-file material contained sufficient information about [the applicants\u2019 son], on the basis of which it was possible to establish the place of residence of his relatives ([there was] an explanation from Mr O. made on 1 December 2005, in which he had given the information about the place of residence of [the applicants\u2019 son]; a statement made by Mr O. on 8 December 2005 in which he said that a criminal case against [the applicants\u2019 son] was pending before a court; statements by a witness, Ms A., who asserted that [the deceased\u2019s] mother had occasionally made telephone calls to [the deceased\u2019s] flat; a certificate on [the deceased\u2019s] criminal record from which it is apparent that the Primorskiy district prosecutor\u2019s office of St. Petersburg applied a measure of restraint in the form of a written undertaking in respect of [the applicants\u2019 son] in criminal case no. 137755; the material in the abovementioned criminal case file contain a copy of [the applicants\u2019 son\u2019s] passport; and so forth).", "It follows that the victims\u2019 rights envisaged by the law in force were substantially violated in the course of the preliminary investigation.", "Relying on Article 29 \u00a7 4 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, [the court] rules:", "that the violations of criminal-procedural law committed during the preliminary investigation in the criminal case should be brought to the attention of the Primorskiy district prosecutor in St Petersburg;", "that the Primorskiy District Court of St Petersburg should be informed of the measures taken no later than a month after the receipt of the present decision.\u201d", "16. In 2007 the applicants lodged an action against the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office and the Ministry of Finance, seeking compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. Relying on the Primorskiy District Court\u2019s interim decision of 6 June 2006, the applicants argued that as a result of the investigator\u2019s failure to promptly notify them of their son\u2019s death, they had sustained pecuniary damage, having been forced to pay for the exhumation and transport of their son\u2019s remains from St. Petersburg to Belomorsk. In addition, they had suffered non-pecuniary damage as they had been unaware of their son\u2019s whereabouts for a long time and had been forced to initiate a search for him; they had been unable to properly say \u201cgoodbye\u201d to their son and to provide him with a decent burial; they had been forced to go through a two-week bureaucratic procedure to obtain permission to exhume their son\u2019s remains; and subsequently, after the exhumation, they had been forced to identify his disfigured remains.", "17.
